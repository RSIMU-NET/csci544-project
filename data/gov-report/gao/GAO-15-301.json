The dissemination of CER refers to developing and  distributing information derived from CER for target audiences, such as  clinicians, consumers, or policymakers, in order to inform health care  delivery or practice. This process involves translating research findings  into terminology and materials that are appropriate for the target  audience. Specifically, AHRQ has supported CER activities by awarding  grants and contracts to research centers and academic organizations to  carry out this work, which includes reviewing and synthesizing scientific  evidence through research reviews; generating new scientific evidence  and analytical tools in original research reports; compiling research  findings; and communicating those findings to a variety of audiences.  Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery  Act), AHRQ received funding of $474 million to support and disseminate  the results of CER\u2014$300 million that was appropriated to AHRQ and  $174 million that was appropriated to the HHS Office of the Secretary and  allocated to AHRQ.

Specifically, PPACA directed PCORI to establish  priorities for research that take into account factors that include disease  incidence, prevalence, and burden; gaps in evidence with regard to  clinical outcomes; patient needs, outcomes, and preferences; and  practice variations and health disparities in terms of delivery and  outcomes of care, among other things. The act also directed PCORI to  develop a research agenda for addressing these priorities. The act did not  specify the content or form of the priorities or agenda. According to  documentation on the process PCORI used to develop its research  priorities and agenda, the workgroups reviewed and considered these  requirements. In the process of developing the research agenda, the  workgroups identified where, for example, certain agenda items  addressed criteria such as gaps in knowledge, variation in care, and  inclusiveness of different populations.", "According to PCORI officials, PCORI intended its research priorities to be  broad in scope so that they could encompass a broad range of topics in  need of study, including different disease areas, conditions, or health care  system issues, thus making PCORI\u2019s research agenda more flexible than  if it identified specific topics. PCORI noted in its research priorities and  agenda document that PCORI did not want to exclude any disease from  being studied. Some stakeholders we interviewed expressed concern that  PCORI\u2019s research priorities are too broad and lack specificity. While  PCORI officials acknowledged that many of the institute\u2019s initial funding  announcements were broad in that they did not identify specific topics,  they noted that they are in the process of increasing the proportion of  funding that goes to specific research topics. For example, PCORI will  soon begin funding awards for large pragmatic clinical studies to evaluate  patient-centered outcomes. The funding announcement for this effort  indicates a number of specific research topics of interest to PCORI.  PCORI officials noted that applications which are responsive to these  specific research topics will be given priority for funding. The specific  research topics identified in this funding announcement were developed  using, among other things, stakeholder recommendations, IOM\u2019s CER  Priorities, and input from PCORI\u2019s advisory panels.", "To identify more specific research questions and topics for use in funding  announcements, PCORI utilizes advisory panels, as authorized by  PPACA. PPACA directed PCORI to establish advisory panels for rare  diseases and clinical trials, which PCORI established in November 2013,  and also authorized PCORI to establish other advisory panels as   needed. In addition to establishing the two advisory panels required by  PPACA, PCORI has also established five additional advisory panels:   (1) Assessment of Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options;   (2) Improving Healthcare Systems; (3) Addressing Disparities; (4) Patient  Engagement; and (5) Communication and Dissemination Research. Four  of these advisory panels align with PCORI\u2019s research priorities. To  appoint members to its advisory panels, PCORI solicits applications via  its website. Advisory panel applicants are reviewed based on common  criteria established by PCORI and against the needs of the specific panel  for which a position is being filled. The PCORI Board of Governors makes  the final selection of advisory panel members.", "PCORI\u2019s advisory panels assist in the prioritization of research topics.  PCORI receives suggested research topics through a number of sources,  including stakeholders, social media, and workshops, as well as from  AHRQ, NIH, and professional and advocacy groups. As part of the  prioritization process, PCORI\u2019s advisory panels evaluate and rank  suggested research topics using the following criteria: patient- centeredness, potential condition impact, assessment of current options,  likelihood of implementation in practice, and durability of information.  Topics identified by advisory panels as being of higher priority proceed for  further evaluation while the lower-priority topics enter a pool of topics that  may be reconsidered at a later date. Recommendations from PCORI\u2019s  advisory panels are taken into consideration by PCORI\u2019s staff and Board  of Governors and are used to refine and prioritize specific research topics  and inform the development of PCORI funding announcements. PCORI  may also use recommendations from advisory panels to commission  reviews of previous and current research on recommended high-priority  topics.", "According to PCORI, its processes for identifying research include  mechanisms for avoiding unnecessary duplication and coordinating  research efforts with NIH and AHRQ. For example, when establishing its  broad research priorities, officials from both NIH and AHRQ participated  in PCORI\u2019s workgroups to develop these priorities and the related  research agenda. As PCORI has developed more specific research  priorities for funding announcements, PCORI staff has consulted with  relevant NIH staff on specific topics in an effort to obtain expertise and an  understanding of what research is being funded on a particular topic. For  example, PCORI officials reported and NIH confirmed that when  developing a specific research topic related to cardiovascular disease,  PCORI coordinated with staff at NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood  Institute to ensure that PCORI\u2019s planned research in this area had not  already been sufficiently addressed by prior research. NIH submitted to  PCORI a list of potential topics it considered important but was not  actively funding, according to PCORI officials. PCORI officials also stated  that when a new topic is suggested to PCORI for inclusion in a funding  announcement, technical briefs are prepared to document the existing  work that has been completed on that topic. In addition, PCORI staff  stated that they conduct searches in ClinicalTrials.gov, NIH\u2019s Research  Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditure and Results (RePORTER),  and other research databases to determine if any similar research is in  progress or has already been funded.proposed research topic that is unnecessarily duplicative is eliminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PCORI Has Established Processes for Funding Research and Monitoring Contractors", "paragraphs": ["PPACA directs PCORI to enter into contracts to carry out its research  priorities.

PCORI officials stated that their merit review  process is modeled on the peer review processes established by AHRQ  and NIH, which are described in law. Unlike AHRQ and NIH, however,  PCORI\u2019s merit review process utilizes patients and stakeholders in the  review and scoring of applications. Key steps in PCORI\u2019s research  funding process include the development and posting of funding  announcements, review and scoring of applications, and final approval by  the Board of Governors.

Reviewers have  one month to electronically submit both their initial scores and detailed  written critiques to PCORI.", "Following the online review, applications advance to in-person merit  review meetings where they are reviewed again in panels specific to the  funding announcement. To determine which applications will advance,  PCORI staff considers reviewers\u2019 average overall scores for each  application, whether applications have scores that differ significantly  among reviewers (and could thus benefit from further discussion), and  whether applications received a good score for technical merit criteria and  are therefore a strong candidate for funding. Reviewers discuss the  applications\u2019 merits and weaknesses and, as a panel, provide a final  overall application score. After applications are scored at the in-person  meeting, PCORI staff determine the applications that will be submitted for  review to a PCORI selection committee, composed of PCORI Board of  Governors members and up to one member from PCORI\u2019s methodology  committee. The selection committee proposes a list of applications to  fund. According to PCORI staff, while the proposed applications generally  consist of the top-scoring applications, some lower-scoring applications  may be included to achieve program balance or fund research in critical  areas. The full Board of Governors votes to approve the recommended  applications. While the Board has the authority to make changes, PCORI  staff stated that it has not made such changes to date. Once the  recommended applications are approved, awards are announced to the  public via PCORI\u2019s website, PCORI develops final contract requirements,  and research contracts are executed. PCORI officials stated that each  cycle of the research funding process takes 9 to 12 months to complete,  from the time a funding announcement is posted to the time  recommended applications are approved by the Board, of which the merit  review process takes about 4 to 6 months. There are currently up to four  funding cycles each year and PCORI staff noted that these cycles  overlap.", "PCORI officials reported taking steps during the merit review and  application selection process to ensure PCORI\u2019s funded research is not  duplicative of other research within the federal government or private  sector. For example, PCORI officials reported seeking input from NIH and  AHRQ during the final selection of awards through each agency\u2019s  involvement in the selection committee and membership on PCORI\u2019s  Board of Governors. PCORI officials also noted that in some instances  NIH and AHRQ staff assist PCORI in reviewing letters of intent submitted  in response to PCORI funding announcements. Finally, before funding an  application, PCORI program staff check databases that include  ClinicalTrials.gov and NIH\u2019s RePORTER to identify any ongoing studies  on a particular topic that may be duplicative.", "Once funded, PCORI contractors are monitored by PCORI staff.  According to PCORI staff, following an initial kickoff call with the  contractor, PCORI receives a progress report from each contractor every  6 months, and there are additional interactions via phone and through  regularly scheduled meetings. Progress reports include updates on key  project milestones, a progress statement for public use, a financial status  update, and additional documents the contractor deems relevant to the  project\u2019s progress during the reporting period.

According to PCORI\u2019s financial projections,  it expects that total administrative expenses will constitute 14 percent and  8.2 percent of its total expenses in fiscal years 2014 and 2015,  respectively. (See figure 3.)", "Each of the projects PCORI has committed to funding has been awarded  within one of twelve funding areas. (See figure 4.) Five of these funding  areas closely correspond to PCORI\u2019s priority areas. Some of the other  areas\u2014such as reducing disparities in asthma\u2014cover specific topics  within a priority area.", "According to PCORI officials, approximately $106 million in commitments  to date are for the PCORnet data research network, the aim of which is to  improve the capacity for and speed of conducting CER. PCORI officials  stated that they expect to spend a total of $271 million on PCORnet  through 2019. PCORnet is a distributed data research network, which  means that no central repository of data exists. Instead, multiple  organizations, each with their own data, agree to allow users to query  their data and combine it with data from the other organizations on a  project-by-project basis. PCORnet consists of 29 separate health data  networks called clinical data research networks (CDRN) and patient- powered research networks (PPRN), some of which existed prior to  PCORnet and some of which were created with PCORnet funding.", "PCORnet is still undergoing development and testing. CDRNs and  PPRNs are currently working to map their data to the PCORnet common  data model. The common data model standardizes the definition, content,  and format of data aggregated by CDRNs and PPRNs, which is  necessary to allow researchers to use data from multiple CDRNs and  PPRNs. An initial test query was conducted using PCORnet in  September 2014. PCORnet is expected to be used to conduct an initial  clinical research trial starting in 2015. Officials stated that limited amounts  of data will be available through PCORnet for queries by researchers  after September 2015, with the amount of available data increasing over  time.", "While PCORI officials, stakeholders, and PCORnet contractors noted that  PCORnet has the potential to significantly improve the ability to conduct  CER, they also noted challenges that PCORI will face with regard to the  establishment and future operation of PCORnet. For example, they  expect that the process of mapping data to the common data model will  be slow and resource intensive because of the lack of standardization  among existing data maintained by CDRNs and PPRNs, such as data  from electronic health records (EHR). PCORI officials recognize the  challenges caused by the lack of standardization. They expect that both  the common data model and a future requirement by PCORI for CDRNs  to hire additional staff with expertise related to this work will help to  address this challenge. PCORnet contractors also noted uncertainty  regarding future costs and the sustainability of the network, particularly if  the PCORTF is not reauthorized beyond fiscal year 2019. One  stakeholder we interviewed noted that some core funding would always  be required to maintain the central operation of the network. PCORI  officials acknowledge that some future core funding could be needed, but  they expect it to be lower than current funding levels. They also expect  that future research projects funded by PCORI, NIH, or others such as  the pharmaceutical and device industry will pay for the use of PCORnet\u2019s  data. PCORI officials also noted that each CDRN and PPRN will be  required to provide a sustainability plan for continuing operation once  PCORI funds are no longer available. Another concern noted by CDRN  officials is that their data does not cover all care received by patients due  to the fragmented nature of the U.S. health care system, although such  \u201ccomplete\u201d data would be preferred by PCORI. An official from one  PPRN noted that the completeness of CDRN and PPRN data could be  improved by having PPRNs and CDRNs share data with one another,  which is not current practice. PCORI officials said that they are  collaborating with other relevant organizations, including state Medicaid  offices and private health insurers, to identify how CDRNs could link their  EHR data to claims data, which would improve data completeness. In  addition, PCORI officials stated they are requiring CDRNs to identify and  implement links with other institutions that have additional patient data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PCORI Has Established an Evaluation Plan and Anticipates Developing Efforts to Measure Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["PCORI\u2019s evaluation group\u2014a body composed of members from its Board  of Governors, methodology committee, advisory panel on patient  engagement, external experts, and PCORI staff \u2014has developed initial  plans for evaluating PCORI\u2019s efforts against its three strategic goals,  which are to increase information, speed implementation, and influence  research. To do so, PCORI identified primary outcome measures for each  of its strategic goals. In its strategic plan, PCORI notes that these are  meant to be long-term measures because research typically requires  several years to complete and additional years for the results to be  disseminated and implemented. Therefore, since 2013, PCORI has been  using early and intermediate process and output measures as a way to  monitor its progress toward its strategic goals. PCORI anticipates having  some early results related to its primary outcome measures starting in  2017 after the first CER studies are completed and their findings  released, although full evaluation of the results of these outcome  measures will not be possible until around 2020, after a large number of  CER studies have been completed and a few years have elapsed,  allowing time for study results to be taken up. (See table 5.)", "Officials stated that to collect information for monitoring PCORI\u2019s progress  and for evaluating PCORI\u2019s impact on the dissemination and uptake of  CER study results, PCORI will employ a variety of data collection  methods, including surveys, focus groups, interviews, case studies, and  document reviews, to collect data on how potential consumers of CER  perceive PCORI\u2019s work and CER in general. For example, PCORI is  conducting a number of surveys to collect both baseline and ongoing data  to gauge changes in perceptions of CER over time. (See table 6.)", "PCORI officials stated that these baseline data will be compared against  future similar data collection efforts in an attempt to see whether PCORI\u2019s  work is contributing to improved understanding and increased use of  CER. PCORI anticipates having preliminary baseline data by the end of  2014.", "PCORI has identified some limitations and challenges related to their  evaluation methods. Specifically, PCORI\u2019s evaluation plans rely on survey  development, focus groups and interviews, data extraction from PCORI  databases, and expert panels. In its plans, PCORI identifies potential  response bias and self-report bias as limitations to some of those data  collection methods. Further, PCORI officials stated that measuring  outcomes such as reducing practice variation and changing health care  delivery can be challenging, particularly within a 5- or 10-year timeframe.  PCORI staff stated that disseminating research results in an effort to  improve health care is a long-term challenge, as past research suggests  that it takes more than 17 years for research evidence to affect clinical  practice settings. PCORI staff stated that they hope the inclusion of end  users in their research process\u2014such as patients and clinicians\u2014will  expedite the uptake of PCORI\u2019s research findings, but it is too soon to tell  if this will be the case.", "Finally, officials stated that it will be difficult to know for certain whether  any measured changes in health care delivery and practice are  attributable to PCORI-funded research or due to other efforts. Therefore,  officials stated that they will have to rely on the measures identified in  PCORI\u2019s strategic plan for a small subset of PCORI\u2019s studies, to  determine the extent to which these studies may influence reductions in  practice variation or other changes in health care delivery.", "PCORI is also undertaking efforts to assess the extent to which its funded  research addresses CER priority topics identified by the IOM in its 2009   PCORI issued a request  report and AHRQ\u2019s Future Research Needs.for proposal to evaluate whether the research topics they funded address  the CER priority topics identified by IOM and AHRQ. Contractors were  selected and began conducting this work in June 2014, and it is  anticipated that the work will continue through 2015, with the possibility of  it extending into 2016. PCORI plans to use the results from this  evaluation to inform additional funding announcements in the future.", "PCORI officials stated that preliminary analysis has shown that about half  of the research studies PCORI has funded to date directly related to a  CER priority topic identified in IOM\u2019s 2009 report.", "PCORI has conducted a preliminary effort to compare the extent to which  mental health research PCORI has funded aligns with mental health  topics in the IOM report, as well as some additional analyses to show the  extent to which PCORI-funded research aligns with IOM\u2019s 100 CER  priorities, according to officials. For example, an analysis in September  2013 showed that of PCORI\u2019s 55 projects at that time, 6 were closely  related, 23 were somewhat related, and 26 were unrelated to the IOM\u2019s  100 CER priorities. PCORI officials noted that the IOM\u2019s CER priorities  were developed in 2009 and that, given the amount of time that has  passed, it is likely that some of the topics listed in the IOM report are no  longer critical, while other CER topics have increased in importance.  PCORI officials stated that, as a result, the IOM\u2019s CER priorities alone are  not a good indicator of PCORI\u2019s progress related to CER."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to PCORI for review and comment.
