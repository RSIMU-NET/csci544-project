Beginning in 1975, the FBF replaced appropriations to GSA as the primary means of financing the operating and capital costs associated with federal space owned or managed by GSA. GSA charges federal agencies rent, and the receipts from the rent are deposited in the FBF. Congress exercises control over the FBF through the appropriations process that sets annual limits on how much of the fund can be expended for various activities. In addition, Congress may appropriate additional amounts for the FBF.", "The FBF operates as follows. Initially, as part of the President\u2019s budget preparation process, GSA estimates the rental revenue the FBF is expected to receive. The rent estimate is prepared about 18 months in advance of the fiscal year. Through the appropriation process, Congress establishes annual limits on how much of the fund can be expended for various activities. As revenues are received, they are deposited into the FBF, and, subsequently, GSA is to fund various projects and programs within the limits set by Congress. Descriptions for some of these budget activities are shown in table 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our first objective was to verify, to the extent practical, the amounts GSA attributed to the individual reasons for overestimation of the FBF rental revenue projections for fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998. To do this, we developed an understanding of the rental revenue estimation process that PBS used. We (l) discussed with PBS program officials and staff the basic steps involved in the process used for fiscal years 1996 through 1999; and (2) reviewed studies of the process done by an internal PBS review team, two consulting firms, and GSA\u2019s Inspector General. Further, we examined documents that supplied supporting details, such as a PBS listing of buildings associated with a particular reason, and we discussed each reason for the overestimation and the amount attributed to it with PBS program officials and staff.", "Our second objective was to determine whether PBS\u2019 corrective actions appeared to address GSA\u2019s identified reasons for the overestimation. We also determined if the corrective actions addressed the weaknesses in the estimation process that we and others identified. To do this, we interviewed PBS officials and staff, reviewed documentation associated with the actions, and observed the operation of a new management information system PBS is developing to help it estimate rental revenues, among other things. On the basis of our knowledge of the estimation system and the proposed or actual corrective actions to the system, we determined whether the corrective actions appeared to address GSA\u2019s identified reasons for the overestimation and other identified weaknesses.", "Our third objective was to determine the budgetary impact of the overestimation on projects and programs in the FBF. To accomplish this, we developed an understanding of the process by which PBS identified sources of obligational authority that had the potential for inclusion in the fiscal year 1997 obligational reserve. Specifically, through interviews with PBS officials and review of documentation they maintained about the process, we developed an understanding of how PBS became aware of the magnitude of the overestimation problem\u2014$680.5 million\u2014and the action those officials took to identify specific sources of obligational authority.", "We reviewed the process that PBS used to identify unobligated balances that could be included in the reserve. Both new construction and modernization projects potentially could be included because such projects were experiencing delays that made it unlikely that they would need the obligational authority available in fiscal year 1997. We further developed information on how PBS officials narrowed the pool of potential new construction and repair and alteration projects to the final 11 new construction projects included in the reserve.", "Concerning the sources of the unobligated fiscal year 1996 balances included in the reserve, we obtained both the regional and headquarters final fiscal year 1996 allowances and the end-of-year obligated balances. However, we did not verify the data on allowances and the end-of-year obligated balances with regional officials or regional records. Finally, PBS headquarters officials provided us with the reasons they believed the unobligated balances existed.", "In reviewing the budgetary impact of the overestimation on projects and programs, we determined if PBS\u2019 claim that none of the new construction projects included in the reserve were delayed from awarding a construction contract because they were included in the reserve. We did so by discussing the projects with PBS headquarters and regional officials as well as staff of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) to obtain general background information on the projects and the dates and reasons given for schedule delays. We did not do a detailed review of the project files or the history of the projects before they were included in the reserve.", "Also, we reviewed the GSA and OMB statements that the impact of the funding problem on the FBF would be eliminated by the end of fiscal year 1998. We verified that GSA had proposed a fiscal year 1998 program of new construction and modernization projects and that GSA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 appropriation did not provide obligational authority for that program. We discussed the impact of the deletion of funding for new construction projects with AOUSC officials to identify the impact on the courts\u2019 immediate and long-range construction programs because the courts\u2019 projects constituted the bulk of PBS\u2019 proposed $594.5 million in fiscal year 1998 funding for new construction. We did not attempt to estimate the dollar impact on specific projects as a result of lack of fiscal year 1998 funding because GSA\u2019s proposed program of projects may have been altered by OMB and congressional reviews prior to obligational authority being provided in GSA\u2019s appropriation law.", "We did our work primarily at GSA headquarters in Washington, D.C., between July 1997 and June 1998, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

PBS, in fiscal year 1997 and 1998, took two actions to deal with the overestimation. First, PBS refrained from using about $680.5 million in obligational authority that Congress had previously provided. Second, PBS reduced operating expenses by deferring planned expenditures until later years. It also took steps to address the weaknesses that were identified in the process used to estimate rental revenues for the budget. Figure 1 shows FBF\u2019s estimated and actual income for fiscal years 1990 through 1997.", "The FBF\u2019s actual rent revenue has grown from about $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1987 to about $4.8 billion in fiscal year 1997. GSA\u2019s historical trends of estimated rental revenue versus actual rental revenue show that actual rental revenues were less than estimated rental revenues for each of fiscal years 1994 through 1997, by amounts ranging from about $110.7 million, or 2.4 percent of the estimate in fiscal year 1995, to about $422.1 million, or 8.2 percent of the estimate in fiscal year 1996. For fiscal years 1994 and 1995, PBS\u2019 overestimation of rental revenue was a combined total of $308.1 million. According to its Chief Financial Officer in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, PBS absorbed the overestimation by reducing planned expenditures and using unobligated carryover balances without the need for congressional action.", "In January 1997, PBS informed Congress that it expected its total overestimation of rental revenue for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 to be $847 million. As shown in table 2, PBS identified seven reasons for the overestimation and linked specific dollar amounts to each reason.", "In July 1997, PBS increased the overestimation figure for fiscal year 1997 by $86.8 million and reported a potential overestimation in fiscal year 1998 of about $109.2 million. As a result, the total anticipated overestimation for fiscal years 1996 through 1998 was about $1.04 billion. However, after it closed its fiscal year 1997 books, PBS reported the actual budget impact of its overestimation to be $634.4 million for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and reduced its fiscal year 1998 overestimation to $28.3 million.", "In our March 1998 testimony on PBS\u2019 overestimation of the FBF rental revenue projections, we reported that PBS provided documentation supporting the amount of the overestimation for six of the seven reasons shown in table 2. Although we examined the documentation PBS provided to explain its overestimation, we did not trace all the data compiled by PBS back to the original source documents. PBS could not provide documentation showing how it developed the $86 million attributed to the reason that the original fiscal year 1995 rent revenue estimate was higher than actual fiscal year 1995 revenues.", "We also reported in our testimony that during the course of our work, we determined that weaknesses in PBS\u2019 estimation process contributed to the rental income overestimation. Through discussions with PBS staff and review of studies done by (l) the firms of Ernst and Young and Arthur Andersen\u2014consultants hired by PBS, (2) the GSA Inspector General, and (3) the Rent Revenue Forecasting GO Team\u2014an internal GSA review team established to look at PBS\u2019 rental revenue estimation process\u2014we identified several weaknesses in the process for estimating rental revenues. These weaknesses included the following: lack of documented policy and procedures for the estimating process; unclear lines of responsibility and accountability for revenue estimates below the level of the PBS Commissioner; lack of supporting documentation necessary to verify forecast information and assumptions; and use of national averages, rather than project-specific data, to forecast occupancy schedules and rental rates.", "Finally, we reported that GSA was aware of the identified weaknesses in its revenue estimation process and had corrective actions to improve this process either already under way or planned. These corrective actions included the following:", "Documentation is to be required for all decisions, assumptions, and steps involved in the rental revenue estimation process.", "The Office of Financial and Information Systems, with overall responsibility for the rental revenue forecasting process, was established.", "Project-specific data is to be used in occupancy schedules and rental rates instead of national averages.", "A new information system is being implemented to manage, track, and access data, with plans for a revenue forecasting module to be added to the system.", "We concluded that it appeared that the actions PBS had under way and planned to improve the process it uses to estimate rental revenue address the weaknesses that we and others had identified. If effectively implemented, these actions should help improve future revenue estimates. However, as PBS points out, because its rental revenue estimate is a forecast, it is unlikely to produce a figure that is identical to actual rental revenue. Although some variance is to be expected in any estimating process, variances that go beyond a certain level can be indicative of estimating problems that need to be addressed.", "In this regard we stated in our testimony that PBS had not established an acceptable margin of error against which it could measure the success of its estimation process. We said that having such a benchmark would put PBS in a better position to identify variances that need to be investigated so that it can explore and fix the causes of excessive variances, improve its estimation process, and determine its effectiveness over time. We recommended that the PBS Commissioner establish an acceptable margin of error for its rental revenue estimates, as well as a process for exploring and resolving causes of variances outside the margin adopted. In a letter dated June 11, 1998, the GSA Administrator notified us that PBS had established 2 percent as a reasonable margin of error and is developing a reconciliation process. Considering the need to prepare estimates 18 months in advance and the steps involved in the estimating process, such as identifying revenue changes for each building, 2 percent does not seem to be an unreasonable margin of error."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Taken by PBS in Fiscal Year 1997 to Ensure Obligational Integrity of FBF", "paragraphs": ["In late spring 1996, PBS identified a potential revenue gap for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. During fiscal year 1997, PBS officials acted to address the FBF overestimation problem by preventing the use of the FBF obligational authority that could not be met from the FBF resources. PBS determined the size of the obligational authority that was in excess of the FBF resources using both actual fiscal year 1996 operating data and estimates for fiscal year 1997 (see table 3).", "To address the $680.5 million in obligational authority in excess of available resources, PBS officials created an obligational reserve at the beginning of fiscal year 1997.

To identify the additional $504.5 million needed for the reserve, in October and November 1996, PBS officials analyzed the FBF new construction and acquisition, and repair and alteration budget activities.

We discussed the reasons for this unobligated balance with PBS officials who told us that it was partially a result of lower interest rates for short-term construction loans on projects and for the long-term 30-year notes on the facilities. In addition, they told us that total interest needs were lower than they had budgeted for because the projects had been slower to use borrowed funds. They said that their estimates of both interest rates and the rate at which funds would be needed by projects had projected higher interest costs than actually were incurred.

They said $68 million of the $71 million would be used as part of the reserve.", "PBS officials told us that having an unobligated balance in a budget activity is not unusual because regional offices do not have to obligate the entire allowance they receive. Regarding the specific reasons why the rental of space budget activity had an unobligated balance at the close of fiscal year 1996, PBS officials cited incorrect estimates of when leases would start to incur obligations so that lease payments were lower than anticipated. Another reason provided by PBS officials involved the number of lease cancellations.", "They said there were more cancellations than PBS had budgeted, which resulted in lower obligations. However, they were not able to provide specific dollar amounts by lease. Rather, PBS officials provided us with a breakdown of the fiscal year 1996 regional allowances and unobligated balances (see table 5).", "PBS staff advised us that although the actual figure, about $71 million, was a little higher than the $68 million included in the reserve, their plan at the time the reserve was established was to include only $68 million in the reserve. However, events during fiscal year 1997 precluded using most of the $68 million for funding of the reserve. In particular, in August 1997, PBS sought congressional approval to transfer about $110 million in funds within the FBF budget activities to meet needs it considered crucial for rental of space. In September 1997, congressional committees approved the transfer request but directed that PBS use $54 million in fiscal year 1996 unobligated balances, which was part of the reserve, to fund part of the transfer. PBS officials told us that the $54 million was used in fiscal year 1997, and additional unobligated construction and acquisition of facilities budget activity funds were used to replace the $54 million in the reserve to maintain full funding of the $680.5 million reserve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Building Operations Reserve Amount", "paragraphs": ["PBS funds the operations of government-owned and -leased facilities and pays other government agencies for building operations performed by them in GSA-controlled facilities through the building operations budget activity.

This was combined with $45 million in unapportioned fiscal year 1997 funds for a total unobligated balance in the building operations budget activity of $96 million. The officials explained that on a fiscal year basis, a portion of the overall appropriation available for regional building operations is divided into initial allowances against which regions plan and operate their programs. During a fiscal year, according to PBS officials, the initial allowance may be revised to reflect unforeseen needs. These adjustments are funded from money held back by PBS headquarters when the initial allowances are given to the regions.", "PBS officials told us that the existence of an unobligated balance in a budget activity at the close of a fiscal year is not unusual because regional offices do not have to obligate the entire allowance they receive. At the end of fiscal year 1996, building operations\u2019 unobligated balance was about $51 million.

Initially, PBS officials considered both the construction and the modernization programs in developing a list of potential projects for funding the reserve.

In addition, delays in basic repair and alteration work could also result in additional future cost to the extent prices for these services increase in the future and to the extent delays cause further deterioration. The maintenance of government-owned assets has been a long-standing concern.
