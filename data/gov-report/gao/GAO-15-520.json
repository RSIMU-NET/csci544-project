However, the agency has issued a proposed rule that would establish consistent requirements for the bonding of the two types of projects in several areas, including minimum bond amounts.", "BLM has about $100 million in bonds for the reclamation of wind and solar projects on federal land. These bonds are primarily letters of credit and surety bonds. BLM has two data systems for tracking bonds, but GAO found that neither system is reliable for this purpose. Specifically, GAO found instances in both systems where information was missing or inaccurate, or had not been updated. The agency does not have a timeliness standard for wind and solar data entry, contrary to having such a standard for its mining program. Without accurate or complete information, BLM has limited assurance that its data systems are reliable for tracking wind and solar bonds to ensure that bonding policies are being followed and that projects have the required bonds.", "BLM has limited assurance that bonds for wind and solar rights-of-way will cover reclamation costs, leaving the federal government potentially at financial risk if developers do not complete reclamation. GAO found about one-third of the wind and solar rights-of-way were underbonded by as much as $15 million in total. Also, BLM did not clearly document how it made its bond decisions, contrary to government standards that call for documentation of significant events. Specifically, GAO found that for about two-thirds of the wind rights-of-way, there was little or no documentation to support the bond amount. In addition, BLM does not adequately ensure that wind and solar bond instruments are properly secured, handled, and stored and does not have policies related to this. In one BLM field office, a staff member told GAO that someone mistakenly shredded several bonds. BLM also does not consistently adhere to its policies calling for periodic review of wind and solar bond amounts to verify their adequacy. GAO found about half of the bonds were at least 4 months overdue for review. BLM officials acknowledged that automatic notifications could be established in their data system as to when reviews are due.

BLM plays a key role in  managing energy produced on these lands, including energy from  renewable resources. Through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress  encouraged the Secretary of the Interior to approve non-hydropower  renewable energy projects, including wind and solar projects, with a total  combined capacity to generate at least 10,000 megawatts of electricity on  federal lands by 2015. In 2012, BLM met this goal by approving projects  with a total combined capacity to generate more than 12,000 megawatts  of renewable energy. In June 2013, the President proposed an  expansion in renewable energy construction projects and set a new goal  for Interior to approve a renewable energy capacity of at least 20,000  megawatts of electricity from projects on federal land. That would be  enough capacity to power more than 6 million homes by 2020.", "Projects to produce energy from renewable resources can affect  thousands of acres of federal land and involve significant infrastructure.  For example, one solar project on federal land in California covers  approximately 3,500 acres and requires buildings, access roads,  wastewater treatment facilities, perimeter fencing, and power lines. The  projects may require developers to alter the land\u2019s topography or remove  vegetation, physically or through the use of herbicides, and these actions  may affect the site itself or have potential downstream or off-site effects.  As a condition of BLM\u2019s authorization for renewable energy projects, the  developer must agree to remove infrastructure elements and return the  land to its pre-developed condition when the project terminates, a process  called reclamation. Reclamation can cost millions and take years to  complete. For example, the current estimate for the reclamation of federal  land involved in the California solar project mentioned earlier is  approximately $30 million. According to BLM officials, as of April 2014,  BLM has not had to reclaim any wind or solar energy development  projects.", "To ensure compliance with applicable requirements, including  requirements to reclaim project sites, BLM requires operators of wind and  solar energy projects on federal lands to obtain bonds. For the purposes  of this report, all financial instruments used to cover reclamation costs will  be referred to as bonds.

If the bonds are inadequate to cover  reclamation costs and the federal government is unable to recover  additional costs from the developer, the federal government may have to  pay the reclamation costs. Concerns have been raised about whether  bonds held by the federal government are sufficient to cover estimated  reclamation costs.

Multiple technologies exist for utility-scale solar power,  such as photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies.  Solar photovoltaic technologies convert energy from sunlight directly  into electricity, using arrays of solar panels. (See fig. 3.)", "Concentrating solar technologies use two types of mirrors with  tracking systems, either curved (parabolic) or flat, to focus the sun\u2019s  energy onto a small area. The concentrated light is then used to heat  water or other fluids that create the steam to power a conventional  turbine generator and produce electricity. Examples of concentrating  solar power technologies include parabolic trough and power tower.  Parabolic trough technology collects energy from the sun using  parabolic mirrors that concentrate heat onto solar thermal equipment,  often a tube filled with fluid that runs the length of the trough at its  focal point; the heated transfer fluid then powers solar steam turbine  generators. (See fig. 4.)", "A power tower system consists of an array of dual-axis tracking  mirrors that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower.  The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500-800 \u00baC and then  used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage  system. (See fig. 5.)", "An average solar plant, whether photovoltaic or concentrating,  requires about 3 to 8 acres for every megawatt of generating capacity.  For example, a small utility-scale solar plant occupying about 600  acres may generate 50 megawatts, and a large facility occupying  about 4,000 acres may generate 550 megawatts.", "However it is generated, electricity from utility-scale wind and solar  energy development is sold to utilities and conveyed to consumers  through transmission lines, the same as electricity generated by more  conventional sources such as coal- or gas-fired power plants.", "Developing wind and solar energy projects on a scale large enough to  generate substantial electric power can affect the environment in both the  immediate vicinity and across hundreds, or even thousands, of acres of  land depending on the energy source.

Requirements would differ based on  whether projects were located in certain preferred areas\u2014called  designated leasing areas.", "Specifically, for projects outside designated leasing areas, the proposed  rule would establish a minimum bond amount per turbine of $20,000 for  wind energy development projects\u2014a doubling of the minimum amount  currently set in BLM policy\u2014and establish a minimum bond amount of  $10,000 per acre for solar energy development projects. The minimum  bond amount for wind energy site-specific or project area testing projects  would remain at the amount currently set in BLM policy, that is, $2,000  per meteorological tower. The proposed rule would require both wind and  solar right-of-way applicants to submit a reclamation cost estimate to help  BLM to determine the bond amount, and would outline specific bond  components that must be addressed when determining the estimated  costs. These components are those outlined in BLM\u2019s 2010 solar energy  development policy, including (1) environmental liabilities; (2)  decommissioning, removal, and disposal of improvements and facilities;  and (3) interim and final reclamation, revegetation, recontouring, and soil  stabilization.

BLM proposed a standard bond  amount for solar or wind energy development inside designated leasing  areas because these areas would be identified by BLM as areas with  lesser and fewer environmental and cultural resource conflicts. According  to BLM officials, when a project terminates inside a designated leasing  area, the agency would potentially reoffer the site for new wind or solar  energy development. As a result, these sites would require less  reclamation than if they needed to be fully reclaimed to their pre- developed condition. For this reason, the bond amount required would be  lower than it would outside designated leasing areas, according to BLM  officials. Under the proposed rule, right-of-way holders would not be  required to submit a reclamation cost estimate, and the bond amounts  would not be adjusted unless there is a change in use. For example, the  removal of a wind turbine and subsequent reclamation could result in a  decreased bond amount. The standard bond amounts would be subject to  an adjustment every 10 years based on inflation. However, the proposed  rule would not require BLM to conduct periodic reviews to assess whether  the standard bond amounts remain adequate or whether they need to be  adjusted based on factors other than inflation.", "A BLM official told us that the agency expects the proposed rule to be  finalized by the end of 2015.

However, BLM had not updated the Bond and Surety  System to show that the $160,000 bond had been accepted, and  the system contained no information on the $40,000 bond.", "In another case, the Bond and Surety System showed a bond in  the amount of approximately $150,000. However, LR2000 showed  four additional payments totaling more than $500,000, bringing the  total bond amount posted for this project to more than $650,000.", "In a third case, both the Bond and Surety System and LR2000  showed that a bond in the amount of $110,000 had been filed with  BLM in 2011, but BLM had not updated the bond status in either  system to reflect that BLM had accepted the bond.

Specifically, officials in several BLM state and field offices told us that  because of a shortage of land law examiners\u2014staff trained on data  systems and requirements and responsible for entering data\u2014the data  entry is being done by realty specialists, who manage the rights-of-way  and may not be as well trained in data entry.  Further, officials at some  BLM state and field offices also said not all staff have access to the Bond  and Surety System, which affects their ability to ensure that the bond  information for their projects is complete, accurate, and matches what is  in LR2000. An official in BLM headquarters told us that because access  to the Bond and Surety System is limited, the information in that system is  not as frequently updated or modified as the information in LR2000.
