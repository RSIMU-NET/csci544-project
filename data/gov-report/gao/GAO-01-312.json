While Russia and the United States have worked cooperatively to reduce the risk of theft in Russia, Russian officials' concerns about divulging national security information continue to impede DOE's efforts to install systems for several hundred metric tons of nuclear material at sensitive Russian sites. Continued progress in reducing the risk of nuclear material theft in Russia hinges on DOE's ability to gain access to Russia's sensitive sites and reach agreement with the Ministry of Atomic Energy to reduce the number of sites and buildings where nuclear material is located. DOE currently does not have a means to periodically monitor the systems to ensure that they are operating properly on a continued basis. Such as mechanism would provide DOE officials with increased confidence that the security systems are reducing the risk of nuclear material theft. The strategic plan developed by DOE should provide an estimate of how much sustainability assistance is required on the basis of an analysis of the costs to operate and maintain the systems and the sites' ability to cover these costs.

Terrorists and countries seeking nuclear weapons could use as little as 25 kilograms of highly enriched uranium or 8 kilograms of plutonium to build a nuclear weapon. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it is estimated that Russia inherited 603 metric tons of highly enriched uranium and plutonium in forms highly attractive to theft. This amount of material is enough to produce almost 40,000 nuclear bombs. The breakdown of Soviet-era control systems, coupled with social and economic deterioration within Russia, has increased the threat of this material\u2019s theft or diversion.", "Since the early 1990s, the United States has been working cooperatively with Russia to install nuclear security systems at its nuclear sites. In 1995, the Department of Energy (DOE) established the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting program to install improved security systems for nuclear material at civilian nuclear sites, naval fuel sites, and nuclear weapons laboratory sites in Russia. As of February 2001, DOE officials had identified 252 buildings at 40 sites in Russia that require nuclear security systems. Through direct contracts between its national laboratories and the Russian sites, DOE provides funding for the security improvements. Project teams consisting of nuclear security experts from the national laboratories work with their Russian counterparts to design and install the improved security systems. In 1998, DOE issued guidelines that provide criteria for effectively reducing the risk of nuclear material theft in Russia. The criteria specify the types of security improvements needed on the basis of threat assessments developed for each of the sites in Russia. By following the criteria, DOE plans to install security systems that reduce the risk of theft as quickly as possible at these sites. While the systems being installed are not as stringent as those in the United States, they are designed to prevent individual employees or a small group of criminals from stealing nuclear material. The Department has established a panel of experts, known as the Technical Survey Team, to determine if the installed systems meet the Department\u2019s criteria for effectively reducing the risk of nuclear material theft at a site. The Team conducts its reviews by examining project documentation and meeting with the project team that designed and installed the systems but does not generally visit the Russian sites.", "This is the second of two reports we have issued addressing your request to assess DOE\u2019s Material Protection, Control, and Accounting program.This report addresses (1) if the nuclear security systems are reducing the risk of theft and how DOE is measuring their effectiveness; (2) what DOE is doing to ensure that Russia operates and maintains the improved security systems over the long run; and (3) DOE\u2019s plan for completing the program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to DOE, 603 metric tons of highly enriched uranium and plutonium are at risk of nuclear material theft in Russia. This material, located at civilian research centers, naval fuel storage sites, and Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories, can be used directly in a nuclear weapon without further enrichment or reprocessing. The material is considered to be highly attractive to theft because it (1) is not very radioactive and therefore relatively safe to handle and (2) can easily be carried by one or two people in portable containers or as components from dismantled weapons. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent social, political, and economic changes in Russia weakened the existing Soviet-era nuclear security systems. These systems placed a heavy emphasis on internal surveillance of nuclear workers and citizens and severe penalties for violations of nuclear security. The decline in economic conditions, late payment of wages to nuclear workers, and the rise of a strong criminal element increased the risk that employees or criminal elements in Russia would attempt to steal nuclear material for economic gain. Furthermore, Russian nuclear facilities lacked modern equipment that could quickly detect, delay, and respond to attempted thefts of nuclear material.", "Over the last 7 years, DOE has worked cooperatively with Russia to install modern nuclear security systems consisting of three components:   Physical protection systems, such as fences around the buildings that contain nuclear material; metal doors protecting the rooms where material is stored; and video surveillance systems that monitor the storage rooms.", "Material control systems, such as seals attached to nuclear material containers that indicate whether material may have been stolen from the containers and badge systems that only allow authorized personnel into areas containing nuclear material.", "Material accounting systems, such as inventories of nuclear material and computerized databases that enable sites to track the amount and type of nuclear material contained in specific buildings.", "DOE\u2019s Guidelines for Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Upgrades at Russian Facilities provide U.S. project teams with criteria for designing and installing security systems. The criteria were designed to achieve the greatest reduction to the risk of nuclear material theft within the program\u2019s projected budget. While the guidelines are based on DOE\u2019s physical security and material control and accounting requirements, and the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s recommendations for physical protection, they are not as stringent as U.S. and international standards used to protect material at similar kinds of sites. According to the guidelines, installing security systems that use multiple components reduces the risk of theft by minimizing the reliance on any one component to detect and delay attempted thefts. Locating the components close to the material, such as around storage vaults and work areas, rather than at a site\u2019s perimeter also reduces risk by minimizing the chance that a thief can bypass security systems and steal material. The guidelines also establish priorities for installing security systems on the basis of how easily the nuclear material being protected could be converted to nuclear weapons. Material that is more readily converted to nuclear weapons receives more extensive security systems than material that poses less of a proliferation risk. DOE is also placing a priority on countering lower-level threats of theft from nonviolent individual employees or a small group of criminals rather than from higher-level threats such as those from violent employees or terrorists equipped with explosives to maximize the amount of material that can be protected within the program\u2019s budget.", "DOE\u2019s Technical Survey Team reviews project documentation and meets with project team members to ensure that the installed systems meet DOE\u2019s guidelines for reducing the risk of nuclear material theft in Russia. The Team comprises eight national laboratory personnel with expertise in physical protection systems and material control and accounting for nuclear materials. The Technical Survey Team\u2019s reviews include (1) an estimate of the original risk of theft at the site and how the installed security systems will reduce it; (2) the extent to which project activities have reduced the risk of theft at the site, on the basis of completed systems or other risk-reduction activities; and (3) the extent to which the security systems are balanced with appropriate physical security and material control and accounting equipment and procedures.

DOE installed completed systems in 81 buildings protecting about 86 metric tons, or about 14 percent, of the nuclear material.  DOE has also installed partially completed security systems known as rapid upgrades in 34 additional buildings protecting about 106 metric tons, or about 18 percent of the nuclear material. According to DOE, rapid upgrades consist of such things as bricking up windows in storage buildings; installing strengthened doors, locks, and nuclear container seals; establishing controlled access areas around nuclear material; and implementing procedures requiring two people be present when nuclear material is handled. By installing rapid upgrades, DOE helps Russian sites establish basic control over nuclear material while U.S. project teams finish installing the security system. DOE officials consider a system to be completed when it includes such components as electronic sensors, motion detectors, and closed circuit television systems to detect intruders; central alarm stations, where guards can monitor cameras and alarms; and computerized material accounting systems.  According to DOE, the program also has work under way on an additional 130 metric tons of nuclear material.", "Table 1 shows the number of buildings and types of sites where completed nuclear security systems have been installed, where rapid upgrades have been installed, where work has started but rapid upgrades have not been completed, and where work has not yet started.", "Our assessment that the installed systems are reducing the risk of nuclear material theft is based on the Technical Survey Team\u2019s reviews of the security improvements at Russian sites, our visits to nine sites, and our discussions with DOE and Russian officials responsible for installing the systems.", "From January 1999 through September 2000, the Technical Survey Team reviewed projects at 30 of the 40 sites with nuclear material in Russia. Of the 30 sites reviewed, the Team found that the security systems installed or being installed for 22 sites are reducing the risk of theft. Specifically, the systems increased the site\u2019s ability to detect, delay, and respond to an attempted theft or otherwise strengthened control over their nuclear materials at all times. To evaluate the projects, the Team used DOE\u2019s criteria and determined (1) whether the project teams installed security systems on the basis of how easily the nuclear material being protected could be converted to nuclear weapons, (2) whether the systems were installed close to the nuclear material rather than at the sites\u2019 perimeter, and (3) whether multiple components were installed to minimize reliance on any one component to prevent theft. The following are examples where the Technical Survey Team found that the systems as installed are reducing the risk of nuclear material theft:   At the Mayak Production Association, a major producer of plutonium for Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons program, DOE installed 1-ton interlocking concrete blocks over trenches containing over 5,000 containers of plutonium. (See fig. 1.) As of February 2001, the blocks were protecting over 15 metric tons of plutonium. Each container has a computerized bar code and tamper-resistant seal to help the site track its location and to show if any attempts have been made to open the container. Each block provides a barrier to delay a thief from gaining access to the material before being detected. In addition, the site\u2019s ability to detect and respond to an attempted theft is reinforced with additional sensors, surveillance cameras, alarms, and communications systems. According to the Technical Survey Team, the blocks are effective against an adversary using sophisticated methods.", "At Navy Fuel Storage Sites 49 and 34 (located in Murmansk and Vladivostok, respectively), DOE helped the Russian Navy construct storage complexes to consolidate tens of tons of nuclear reactor fuel that were located in poorly protected sites in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. (Navy Site 49 is shown in fig. 2.) DOE, working with the Russian Navy, strengthened the walls and ceilings of the nuclear storage buildings and installed portal monitors for nuclear material, which scan people and vehicles entering and leaving facilities to ensure that they have not taken nuclear material from storage locations, video surveillance systems, alarms, and fences to increase the ability to detect a theft. In addition, DOE improved the guard forces\u2019 ability to respond to an attempted theft by providing them with helmets, bulletproof vests, strengthened barriers that protect against gunfire, and a radio communication system. According to the Technical Survey Team, the systems have significantly reduced the risk of nuclear material theft at these sites.", "At the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering at Obninsk, DOE bricked up windows at several buildings that contain several tons of nuclear material and installed high-security vault doors and locks and access control systems. According to the Technical Survey Team, these measures reduce the risk of theft. The project team also developed an inventory strategy that reduced the time it takes to inventory items and encouraged the facility to place nuclear material that it seldom uses in sealed containers. According to the Team, these security improvements are consistent with the guidelines issued by the program.", "At six of the eight remaining sites, the Technical Survey Team\u2019s reports indicated that activities undertaken to install security systems had achieved little or no risk reduction so far, while at the two remaining sites, it was too soon to tell if the systems were reducing risk. At two of the six sites (the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute and the Bochvar Institute), the systems that were installed did not meet the criteria for reducing risk because they were installed at the perimeter of the sites rather than close to the material. DOE\u2019s project teams are currently taking actions to correct the problems. At two other sites\u2014Sarov (also known as Arzamas-16, the primary nuclear weapons design laboratory in Russia) and Elektrostal (a MINATOM facility that fabricates reactor fuel rods of highly enriched uranium for the Russian Navy)\u2014project teams did not have sufficient access to buildings to install systems in accordance with the guidelines. At Sarov, the project team gave Sarov personnel security system components to install in some of the buildings where the project team did not have physical access. However, according to the Technical Survey Team, while incremental improvements to security have occurred at Sarov, the risk of nuclear material theft remains high. At Elektrostal, DOE project teams were limited to providing security improvements only for low enriched uranium, which poses a low risk of proliferation if stolen. Because of the project team\u2019s lack of access to buildings with highly enriched uranium, the program has decided not to enter into any new contracts at the site until access issues are resolved. At Tomsk-7, the team did not verify the type of material it was protecting and installed systems around material that, according to the Technical Survey Team, presented little proliferation risk. At the Lytkarino Research Institute of Scientific Instruments, the strengthened doors installed as part of the site\u2019s rapid upgrades were ineffective, and according to the Team, needed to be replaced.", "In order to observe how the nuclear security systems are reducing the risk of theft in Russia, we visited nine nuclear sites in Russia where DOE installed systems. During our visits, we toured buildings where the installation of nuclear security systems was complete as well as buildings where work was ongoing or had not been started. We also discussed how the nuclear security systems were working with the Russian site officials and U.S. project team members who accompanied us on the tours. We saw site personnel demonstrate how they use the security systems, and we observed the multiple systems designed to detect or delay an outsider or employee attempting to steal material. The officials at the sites that we visited also showed us nuclear material storage rooms as well as rooms where employees work with the material. We observed the following systems and concluded that they were reducing risk:   Storage vaults equipped with strengthened doors, locks, video surveillance systems, and alarms that can detect and delay thieves as they attempt to steal nuclear material.", "Central alarm stations where guards monitored the video surveillance systems. The guards were equipped with communications equipment to respond to alarms.", "Nuclear material containers equipped with computerized bar codes and tamper-resistant seals that allow site personnel to perform quick inventories of the material and determine whether containers were tampered with.", "Access and exit procedures that ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed into areas with nuclear materials.", "Nuclear material portal monitors that scan people and vehicles entering and leaving facilities to ensure that they have not taken nuclear material from storage locations.", "However, at three sites, we also observed some problems that appeared to decrease the effectiveness of the new systems. For example, one site left a gate to its central storage facility open and unattended during the day. (See fig. 3.) According to a site official, the gate is left open to allow employees to enter and leave the facility without having to use the combination locks on the gate. When the gate is open, the only other controlled access point is at the perimeter of the site. At another site that we toured, the guards did not respond to metal detectors that were set off when we entered the site, nuclear material portal monitors were not working, and alarm systems had exposed cabling that could allow an adversary to cut the cable and disable the alarm easily. At the third site, DOE had provided heavy metal containers that could be bolted to the floor to make it more difficult for an individual to gain access to the material. But some of the containers were empty, and instead, the site stored material in old containers that did not offer as much protection. In addition, this site did not have access controls, such as metal detectors or nuclear material portal monitors at locations where nuclear material is stored, and the guards did not check the identification of people entering the storage areas. More information on the sites that we visited can be found in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Is Not Installing Systems in Many Buildings Because of Access Problems", "paragraphs": ["As of February 2001, DOE was not installing systems in 104 buildings because the U.S. project teams did not have physical access to the buildings. These buildings, mostly located at Russian nuclear weapons laboratories, contain hundreds of metric tons of nuclear material. According to DOE officials, physical access is needed to (1) confirm the type of material to be protected, (2) design systems that provide adequate security for the material to be protected, (3) ensure that equipment is installed properly, and (4) ensure that the sites operate the systems properly and use equipment for the intended purpose. MINATOM is reluctant to grant DOE project teams physical access to the buildings because of Russian national security concerns and Russian laws on the protection of state secrets. For example, rather than allow project teams into buildings where they can determine what security systems are needed, some sites have allowed the project teams only to view the site perimeters. Consequently, the project teams do not obtain enough information on the buildings\u2014for example, information on the type of material and how easy it would be to convert the material into a nuclear weapon\u2014which determines the type of security systems that DOE would install. Because it lacked physical access, in September 1999, DOE suspended new work at six of the nuclear weapons laboratories\u2014Sarov, Snezhinsk (also known as Chelyabinsk-70), and the four nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly sites.  Table 2 shows the status of DOE\u2019s physical access to buildings by program sector.", "In January 2000, DOE issued new guidance to project teams on access to sites. Under the new guidance, physical access is still the preferred means to identify nuclear material that needs protection and to design and install security systems. However, if the Russian site officials do not grant physical access to the project team, DOE officials may pursue alternative means of providing assurances if the alternatives are acceptable to site officials and DOE approves of the alternative. According to the guidance, alternative means of providing assurances may include a combination of photographs and videotapes of areas before and after the installation of security systems, a visual inspection by a single member of the project team, and written certifications by site directors. Once DOE approves the alternate means for providing assurances, it is incorporated into the access provisions that become part of the contract with the site for installing security systems. According to a DOE official, DOE pays only for work performed under the contract once it receives the assurances obtained as stipulated in the access provisions of the contract. DOE officials are currently testing this approach in pilot programs with Sarov and Snezhinsk for work at sensitive buildings at the sites but it has not yet reached any such agreements under the new access guidance.", "DOE has also reached a draft agreement with MINATOM to provide program personnel with greater access to sensitive MINATOM sites.  This agreement is undergoing interagency review in the executive branch.

Lawrence Livermore ultimately developed a measurement system that looked at 30 elements that make up an effective security system, such as access controls, intrusion detection, the testing of electronic security and alarm systems, and the functioning of the guard forces. The measurement system was designed to provide a baseline to measure progress; identify weaknesses in installed systems; and monitor, on a continuing basis, the functioning of the systems.

At certain sites, DOE has contracts with the Russian sites to collect information on the functioning of equipment such as nuclear material portal monitors, which can indicate how often the system has been operating and whether any problems have caused it to malfunction or be turned off. In addition, before installing security systems, DOE and Russian site officials conduct vulnerability assessments, which assess the probability of the existing nuclear security systems at the sites to prevent nuclear material theft.

For example, many of the sites cannot afford the warranties, parts, or technical support necessary to ensure that the new systems are fully operational. At six of the nine sites we visited, Russian officials stated that without assistance, operating the systems would be difficult.

For example, project teams are designing systems that use equipment produced in Russia rather than foreign-made equipment because Russian equipment may be easier for the sites to service and replacement parts may be more readily available.

In addition, DOE officials\u2019 initial assumption that Russia would reach a level of economic stability by 2000 to support the long-term operation and maintenance of the security systems did not materialize. DOE officials found that the economic decline culminating in the August 1998 collapse of the Russian economy adversely affected the ability of Russian sites to commit the necessary resources to fully sustain the security systems. Similarly, DOE officials found that Russia needs assistance beyond installing security systems, such as assistance with developing nuclear security regulations and enforcement capabilities. Consequently, DOE officials now assume that Russia will achieve the economic and political stability to operate and maintain the nuclear material security systems by 2015 and that DOE will gradually phase out assistance from 2015 through 2020. Finally, the limited access to sensitive buildings that MINATOM has given to DOE\u2019s project teams has caused delays in the plan to complete the installation of security systems by fiscal year 2002.", "In developing the time frames for completing the program by 2020, DOE officials took into account several factors that limit how quickly it would be able to install security systems. In particular, DOE\u2019s time frame estimates take into account Russia\u2019s short construction season due to weather conditions, the sites\u2019 ability to provide the personnel to install the systems, and the time needed to negotiate access to sensitive sites. DOE officials also assumed that the portion of the Department\u2019s budget devoted to improving security at the 40 nuclear sites would increase from about $118 million in the fiscal year 2001 budget to $155 million in the fiscal 2005 budget. According to a DOE official, if the program\u2019s funding were to remain at current levels, it will take at least 4 additional years to install security systems at Russian sites (from 2011 to 2015). Figure 4 shows DOE\u2019s yearly spending estimates for fiscal years 2001 through 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Cost Estimate and Time Frame Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["DOE officials expressed uncertainty about the cost estimate and time frame for completing the program because of a number of issues, including the lack of access to sensitive sites and DOE\u2019s limited experience in some types of assistance that it is providing.", "DOE officials said that the greatest uncertainty in the cost estimate and time frame for completing the installation of security systems stems from the lack of access to sensitive sites, in particular, the nuclear weapons laboratories. In contrast, DOE officials have the most confidence in the cost estimates for sites where its project teams have good access for designing and installing the systems, such as most civilian and Russian Navy sites. The lack of access creates uncertainty because project teams do not know how many buildings at the nuclear weapons laboratories require security systems or when they will be able to start and complete the installation of security systems. The number of buildings is a major factor in the cost of improving security at a site because each building requires that the project team design and install a unique security system. Some of the nuclear weapons laboratories may have more buildings than DOE officials have assumed, and others may have fewer.", "DOE officials are also uncertain of the cost estimate for installing security systems because project teams have less experience in installing and developing cost estimates for security systems at the large and complex buildings in the nuclear weapons laboratories that enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium for use in weapons. Although DOE has installed security systems for buildings where Russian civilian sites work with nuclear material, the buildings where the weapons laboratories work with nuclear material are much larger. Therefore, DOE cannot assume that the cost of installing security systems at buildings in the weapons laboratories is about the same as it is at civilian sites.", "Another source of uncertainty in the program\u2019s cost estimate for completing the program stems from DOE\u2019s limited experience in providing operational assistance to sites and assistance to Russia\u2019s regulatory and enforcement agencies. On the basis of its limited experience in providing a handful of small completed civilian sites with operational assistance, DOE officials used generic assumptions about how much assistance it would provide at each site after installing nuclear security systems rather than developing individual estimates for each of the sites. At most sites, DOE officials anticipate that the Department will provide operational assistance, at gradually declining levels, through 2020. Similarly, DOE officials regard their assistance to Russia\u2019s nuclear regulatory and enforcement agencies as a long-term effort to continue through 2020, but DOE has not yet completely determined what the assistance will consist of beyond its plans for the next few years.", "DOE plans to update its cost estimate and time frame for completing the program annually. DOE officials said that they would develop more confidence in their estimates as they gain more experience in the areas where there is currently more uncertainty. For example, DOE officials expect to complete the installation of security systems at two sensitive uranium-processing sites where project teams have physical access in fiscal year 2001. After completing these two sites, DOE will have a better basis to estimate the costs of installing systems at large processing buildings in the nuclear weapons laboratories. Similarly, DOE is just beginning to implement a pilot project to negotiate alternatives to physical access at sensitive buildings at two nuclear weapons laboratories. The outcome of the pilot project will help DOE officials make better assumptions about the process of gaining access to buildings in the rest of the nuclear weapons laboratories.", "DOE is in the process of developing for the program a strategic plan that ties together the program\u2019s goals, priorities, and strategies for reducing the risk of theft in Russia with the program\u2019s costs and time frames for completing the program. Such a plan could provide DOE managers with guidance as they adjust the implementation of the program to take into account changes in time frames for installing systems and the amount of access DOE project teams may have to buildings. According to a DOE official, the plan, when completed in April 2001, will tie together the cost estimate and time frame for completing the program with a revised version of the Guidelines for Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Upgrades at Russian Facilities which, among other things, sets out the program\u2019s goals, priorities, and strategies for installing security systems that reduce the risk of theft at Russian sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Material Consolidation and Conversion, if Successful, Could Reduce Program Costs and the Number of Buildings That Contain Nuclear Material", "paragraphs": ["Under the Material Consolidation and Conversion initiative, one of DOE\u2019s strategies for completing the program is to reduce the number of buildings and sites that contain nuclear material and need security systems. DOE\u2019s cost estimate and time frame for completing the program sets a goal of closing 50 buildings and five sites by 2010. Under the initiative, the reduction would take place by consolidating nuclear material into fewer buildings and sites and converting 24 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, or about 3 percent of the estimated 603 metric tons of weapons- usable nuclear material in Russia, into low enriched uranium that cannot be used for weapons. DOE estimates that the Material Consolidation and Conversion initiative will cost $387.2 million through fiscal year 2010.", "According to DOE, about three-quarters of the material to be converted will be uranium enriched to 85 percent in the isotope U-235. DOE officials told us that by converting this material, risk will be reduced for material that is some of the most attractive to theft in Russia. security systems or, if the systems are already installed, providing assistance for their operation and maintenance. In addition, the initiative would completely eliminate the risk of theft at the buildings and sites that no longer contain nuclear material. However, the initiative has had limited success since its inception in 1999. In particular, the Material Consolidation and Conversion initiative has not resulted in the complete removal of weapons-usable nuclear material from any buildings or sites.", "The program has had more success at removing materials from buildings at sites that are not in the initiative. DOE has helped Russian facilities consolidate materials into fewer buildings at the State Research Institute, Scientific Industrial Association; the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering; Dmitrovgrad; Novosibirsk; and several of the Russian Navy\u2019s nuclear fuel storage sites. uranium. However, both of the buildings still contained nuclear material when we visited the site in October 2000, and site officials told us that they do not plan to provide material for conversion under the initiative for the next 2 to 3 years. We also met with officials at the State Research Institute, Scientific Industrial Association (also known as Luch)\u2014one of the two sites that is converting highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium. These officials told us that they are encountering difficulties in obtaining highly enriched uranium for conversion because Russian sites believe they will receive more money and support from DOE by retaining their weapons-usable nuclear material.", "As of December 2000, the initiative resulted in the conversion of about 1.6 metric tons of highly enriched uranium. DOE officials have also successfully negotiated verification measures with both of the sites that are converting the material to provide assurances that the sites actually convert highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium that cannot be used for weapons. However, DOE\u2019s initiative has not yet resulted in the closure of any buildings or sites; therefore, DOE officials are not sure of the extent to which the initiative will result in an overall cost savings to the program. Furthermore, while material conversion is reducing the proliferation risk for the material converted to low enriched uranium, it is not reducing the risk of theft at the buildings and sites that are contributing the highly enriched uranium because those buildings and sites still contain weapons-usable nuclear material and still require nuclear security systems. Given the lack of progress in closing buildings and sites, DOE officials said that they are reevaluating whether to continue with material conversion. DOE officials said that the initiative\u2019s primary goal is to reduce the risk of nuclear material theft and that they favor continuing the material conversion even if it does not result in the closure of any buildings or sites because the risk of theft for the material that is converted would still be eliminated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["DOE is improving the security of 192 metric tons of weapons-usable nuclear material in Russia by installing modern security systems that detect, delay, and respond to attempts to steal nuclear material. These systems, while not as stringent as those installed in the United States, are designed to reduce the risk of nuclear material theft at Russian sites. While Russia and the United States have worked cooperatively to reduce the risk of theft in Russia, Russian officials\u2019 concerns about divulging national security information continue to impede DOE\u2019s efforts to install systems for several hundred metric tons of nuclear material at sensitive Russian sites. Continued progress in reducing the risk of nuclear material theft in Russia hinges on DOE\u2019s ability to gain access to Russia\u2019s sensitive sites and reach agreement with MINATOM to reduce the number of sites and buildings where nuclear material is located. Achieving these two goals would improve security for large amounts of nuclear material and reduce program costs. Regarding the systems that are already installed, DOE currently does not have a means to periodically monitor the systems to ensure that they are operating properly on a continuing basis. Such a mechanism would provide DOE officials with increased confidence that the security systems are reducing the risk of nuclear material theft.", "The fact that DOE is developing a strategic plan that ties together the program\u2019s goals, priorities, and strategies for reducing the risk of theft in Russia with the cost and time frames estimate is a positive step forward. Such a plan will provide DOE managers with guidance as they adjust the implementation of the program to take into account the changes in the time frames for installing systems and the amount of access that DOE project teams may have to buildings.
