Mergers among the largest firms in the 1980s and 1990s and the dissolution of Arthur Andersen in 2002 significantly increased concentration among the largest firms, known as the \"Big 4.\" These four firms currently audit over 78 percent of all U.S. public companies and 99 percent of all public company sales. This consolidation and the resulting concentration have raised a number of concerns. To address them, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandated that GAO study (1) the factors contributing to the mergers; (2) the implications of consolidation on competition and client choice, audit fees, audit quality, and auditor independence; (3) the impact of consolidation on capital formation and securities markets; and (4) barriers to entry faced by smaller accounting firms in competing with the largest firms for large public company audits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Domestically and globally, there are only a few large firms capable of auditing large public companies, which raises potential choice, price, quality, and concentration risk concerns. A common concentration measure used in antitrust analysis, the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) indicates that the largest firms have the potential for significant market power following mergers among the largest firms and the dissolution of Arthur Andersen. Although GAO found no evidence of impaired competition to date, the significant changes that have occurred in the profession may have implications for competition and public company choice, especially in certain industries, in the future. Existing research on audit fees did not conclusively identify a direct correlation with consolidation. GAO found that fees have started to increase, and most experts expect the trend to continue as the audit environment responds to recent and ongoing changes in the audit market. Research on quality and independence did not link audit quality and auditor independence to consolidation and generally was inconclusive. Likewise, GAO was unable to draw clear linkages between consolidation and capital formation but did observe potential impacts for some smaller companies seeking to raise capital. However, given the unprecedented changes occurring in the audit market, GAO observes that past behavior may not be indicative of future behavior, and these potential implications may warrant additional study in the future, including preventing further consolidation and maintaining competition. Finally, GAO found that smaller accounting firms faced significant barriers to entry--including lack of staff, industry and technical expertise, capital formation, global reach, and reputation--into the large public company audit market. As a result, market forces are not likely to result in the expansion of the current Big 4. Furthermore, certain factors and conditions could cause a further reduction in the number of major accounting firms."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["There are hundreds of public accounting firms that audit public companies  in the United States. However, a small number of very large firms have  traditionally provided audit and attest services for the majority of public  companies, particularly large national and multinational companies. The  number of firms widely considered capable of providing audit services to  large national and multinational companies decreased from eight (\u201cthe Big  8\u201d) in the 1980s to four (\u201cthe Big 4\u201d) today. The reduction was the result of  mergers involving six of the top eight firms since the late 1980s and the  abrupt dissolution of Arthur Andersen LLP (Andersen) in 2002. The Big 4  firms are substantially larger than the other U.S. or international  accounting firms, each with thousands of partners, tens of thousands of  employees, offices located around the world, and annual revenues in the  billions of dollars. These four firms currently audit over 78 percent of all  U.S. public companies and 99 percent of public company annual sales.  Internationally, the Big 4 dominate the market for audit services.", "Big 8 mergers and Andersen\u2019s sudden dissolution have prompted  heightened concerns about concentration among the largest accounting  firms and the potential effect on competition and various other factors. As  a result, Congress mandated in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that we  study these issues. Specifically, we were asked to study (1) the factors  leading to the mergers among the largest public accounting firms in the  1980s and 1990s; (2) the impact of consolidation on competition, including  the availability of auditor choices for large national and multinational  public companies; (3) the impact of consolidation on the cost, quality, and  independence of audit services; (4) the impact of consolidation on capital  formation and securities markets; and (5) the barriers to entry faced by  smaller firms in competing with the largest firms for large national and  multinational public company clients.", "To evaluate the factors contributing to consolidation among the largest  firms, we interviewed current and former partners of large public  accounting firms involved in past mergers and Department of Justice (DOJ)  and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) officials. However, we did not review  any antitrust analyses conducted by DOJ specific to the proposed mergers  of the 1980s and 1990s. According to DOJ officials, most of the firm  documents had been returned to the relevant parties, and other documents  were viewed as \u201cpredecisional\u201d by DOJ. While GAO\u2019s statute provides us  with access to predecisional information absent a certification by the  President or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, we were  more interested in the reasons for the mergers than DOJ\u2019s analysis in  approving the mergers. Therefore, we used other sources to obtain the  necessary information for this report. We also collected information from  and coordinated with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and  its counterparts from the other six members (Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) of the Group of Seven nations as  required in the mandate. To evaluate the impact of consolidation on  competition and auditor choice, audit fees, and audit quality and auditor  independence, we consulted with academics, researchers, U.S. and foreign  regulators, and trade associations and collected data and descriptive  statistics for analysis. We also employed a simple model of pure price  competition, in which clients choose auditors based on price, ignoring  factors such as quality or reputation, to assess whether the current high  degree of concentration in the market for audit services is necessarily  inconsistent with a purely price competitive setting. Additionally, as of July  11, 2003, we had received 47 responses to a survey of the 97 largest  accounting firms\u2014those with at least 10 corporate clients registered with  SEC\u2014on their views of accounting firm consolidation and its potential  implications. This report also includes responses from 148 of 250 randomly  sampled, Fortune 1000 public companies on their experiences with their  auditor of record and their views on the potential implications of  consolidation. We plan to issue a subsequent report in September 2003 on  client responses received through July 30, 2003. Lastly, we interviewed a  judgmental sample of 20 chairs of audit committees for Fortune 1000  companies to obtain their views on consolidation and competition. To  address the issue of the impact of consolidation and concentration on  capital formation and securities markets, we interviewed representatives  from institutional investors, investment banks, self-regulatory  organizations, and credit rating agencies, among others, and we consulted  with academics and reviewed relevant literature. To identify any barriers to  competition faced by accounting firms, we reviewed existing state and  federal requirements and interviewed knowledgeable officials. We also  employed the previously cited economic model by simulating mergers  among smaller firms in order to assess whether, in a purely price  competitive environment, such mergers could lead to viable competitors to  the Big 4 for large national and multinational clients. We also obtained  information from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  (AICPA).

While officers and directors of a public company are responsible for the  preparation and content of financial statements that fully and accurately  reflect the company\u2019s financial condition and the results of its operations,  public accounting firms, which function as independent external auditors,  provide an additional safeguard.

Beginning in the 1970s, FTC, DOJ, and  individual professionals began to challenge the legality of these restrictions  through various court actions. As a result of these challenges, AICPA and  state boards adopted new rules that targeted only false, misleading, or  deceptive advertising; liberalized restrictions on solicitation; and changed  bans on competitive bidding.

In addition to traditional services such as audit and attest services  and tax services, firms also offered consulting services in areas such as  information technology. As figure 1 illustrates, over the past several  decades, the provision of management consulting services increased  substantially. For example, in 1975, on average, management consulting  services comprised 11 percent of the Big 8\u2019s total revenues, ranging from 5  percent to 16 percent by firm. By 1998, revenues from management  consulting services increased to an average of 45 percent, ranging from 34  to 70 percent of the Big 5\u2019s revenues for that year. However, by 2000, firms  had begun to sell or divest portions of their consulting business and  average revenue from management consulting services had decreased to  about 30 percent of the Big 5\u2019s total revenues.", "Although all of the Big 4 firms continue to offer certain consulting services,  three of the Big 4 have sold or divested portions of their consulting  businesses. PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 consulting practice was sold to  International Business Machines Corp.; KPMG\u2019s consulting practice  became BearingPoint; and Ernst & Young sold its practice to Cap Gemini  Group S.A. While it has contemplated doing so, Deloitte & Touche has not  divested its management consulting practice.", "The increase in the provision of management consulting and other  nonaudit services contributed to growing regulatory and public concern  about auditor independence. Although auditor independence standards  have always required that the accounting firm be independent both in fact  and in appearance, concern over auditor independence is a long-standing  and continuing issue for accounting firms. During the late 1970s, when  consulting services represented only a small portion of the Big 8\u2019s revenue,  a congressional study noted that an auditor\u2019s ability to remain independent  was diminished when the firm provided both consulting and audit services  to the same client. A number of subsequent studies resulted in various  actions taken by both the accounting firms and SEC to enhance the real  and perceived independence of auditors. By 2000, SEC proposed to amend  its rules on auditor independence because of the growing concern that the  increase in nonaudit services had impaired auditor independence. The  rules that were promulgated in 2001 amended SEC\u2019s existing rules  regarding auditor independence and identified certain nonaudit services  that in some instances may impair the auditor\u2019s independence, among other  things. The amendments also required most public companies to disclose  in their annual financial statements certain information about nonaudit  services provided by their auditor. Following the implementation of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, SEC issued new independence rules in March    2003.

Because of the extensive  network Klynveld Main Goerdeler had in Europe, which none of the other  Big 8 had, the merged firm became the largest accounting firm worldwide  and the second largest U.S. firm until 1989. In 1989, six of the Big 8 firms  explored merging. In June 1989, the first merger among the Big 8 involved  fourth-ranked Ernst & Whinney and sixth-ranked Arthur Young to form  Ernst & Young. The resulting firm became the largest firm nationally (and  internationally). In August 1989, seventh-ranked Deloitte Haskins & Sells  and eighth-ranked Touche Ross merged to form Deloitte & Touche.

First, the trend toward  corporate globalization led to an increased demand for accounting firms  with greater global reach. Second, some firms wanted to achieve greater  economies of scale as they modernized their operations and built staff  capacity and to spread risk over a broader capital base.

As their clients expanded  their operations around the world, the top-tier firms felt pressure to expand  as well as to provide service to their clients. The trend toward corporate  globalization, which continues today, was spurred in part by the lowering  of trade barriers. Moreover, by the mid-1990s, the overall economic  environment was changing dramatically as technological and  telecommunications advances changed the way businesses operated. As a  result, large U.S. companies operated worldwide and more foreign-based  companies entered U.S. markets. Although all of the Big 8 had offices in  certain countries, they did not have extensive networks that enabled them  to provide comprehensive services to large multinational clients. Some of  the smaller Big 8 firms had difficulty attracting and retaining strong foreign  affiliates. Mergers with compatible firms were the quickest way to fill gaps  in geographic coverage. For instance, in the 1980s, Ernst & Whinney had an  established network in the Pacific Rim countries while Arthur Young did  not. Likewise, Price Waterhouse had a network in South America while  Coopers & Lybrand\u2019s network was in Europe.", "In addition to expanding their reach and staff capacity, firms believed that  they needed to establish global networks to stay abreast of country-specific  generally accepted accounting principles and regulations. Globalization  also had raised a number of tax issues that required firms to have networks  able to accommodate clients with operations in a growing number of  countries.

For example, the Ernst &  Whinney and Arthur Young merger brought together two firms that  specialized in healthcare and technology, respectively. Similarly, the Price  Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand merger brought together two firms  that dominated the market for audit services in the energy and gas and  telecommunications industries, respectively.", "In addition, firm officials said that some of the mergers of the 1980s and  1990s were spurred by the need and desire to build or expand management  consulting services, which, as discussed previously, were becoming a larger  percentage of revenue. Officials also said that the mergers allowed them to  achieve economies of scope by offering a broader range of services to  clients. As firms merged, they were able to create synergies and offer their  clients extensive services beyond traditional audit and attest services such  as tax consulting, internal audit, and information systems support. In order  to remain competitive, some firms merged to build upon different  operating strengths such as consulting services versus auditing. For  example, the Deloitte Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross merger brought  together a firm with substantial audit and tax consulting operations and a  firm with a strong management consulting business.", "In the same era, some firm officials said that they had to build their  technical expertise in areas such as derivatives and other complex financial  arrangements used by their clients. Firms also needed to build their  expertise to address a series of changes to the U.S. tax code and the  regulatory requirements faced by their clients in other countries.

By expanding their capital base through  mergers, firms planned to create economies of scale by spreading  infrastructure costs from modernizing across a broader capital base. Some  firm officials said that mergers were critical to the firms\u2019 modernization  because, unlike their clients, accounting firms could not raise new capital  by issuing securities. Because of their prevailing partnership structures, the  firms\u2019 capital bases were largely dependent upon partner-generated capital.", "In addition to economies of scale, firm officials said that they also expected  that mergers would increase overall staff capacity and result in more  efficient delivery of services and more effective allocation of resources in  order to better respond to market demands. The broader capital bases also  allowed firms to invest substantial resources in staff training and  development.

The model\u2019s simulation results suggest that a market  driven solely by price competition could also result in a high degree of  market concentration.

According to our preliminary  survey results, a large majority (94 percent or 137 of 145) of public  companies that responded to our survey to date said that they had three or  fewer alternatives were they to switch accounting firms. All 20 of the audit  chairpersons with whom we spoke believed that they had three or fewer  alternatives. Of the companies responding to our survey, 42 percent (61 of  147) said that they did not have enough options for audit and attest  services. However, when asked whether steps should be taken to increase  the number of available choices, results revealed that 76 percent (54 of 71)  of public companies responding to our survey to date said they would  strongly favor or somewhat favor letting market forces operate without  government intervention.", "We also found that client choices could be even further limited due to  potential conflicts of interest, the new independence rules, and industry  specialization by the firms\u2014all of which may further reduce the number of  available alternatives to fewer than three. First, the Big 4 tend to specialize  in particular industries and, as our preliminary survey results indicated,  public companies that responded often preferred firms with established  records of industry-specific expertise, which could further reduce a  company\u2019s number of viable choices. For example, 80 percent (118 of 148)  of the public companies responding to our survey to date said industry  specialization or expertise would be of great or very great importance to  them if they had to choose a new auditor. When asked why they would not  consider an alternative to the Big 4, 91 percent (117 of 129) of public  companies responding to date cited technical skills or knowledge of their  industry as a reason of great or very great importance.", "As figure 7 shows, in selected industries, specialization can often limit the  number of firm choices to two\u2014in each case, two firms accounted for well  over 70 percent of the total assets audited in each industry in 2002. As a  result, it might be difficult for a large company to find a firm with the  requisite industry-specific expertise and staff capacity. Figure 7 also shows  the impact of the Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand merger and  dissolution of Andersen on industry specialization and associated client  choice. While two firms also dominated the four selected industries in 1997,  this concentration became much more pronounced by 2002, as illustrated  in figure 7. See appendix IV for a detailed discussion of industry  specialization and further industry-specific examples and limitations of this  type of analysis.", "Industry specialization, as captured by a relatively high market share of  client assets or client sales in a given industry, may also be indicative of a  firm\u2019s dominance in that industry on a different level. As a hypothetical  example, consider a highly concentrated industry, with several very large  companies and numerous smaller companies, in which a single accounting  firm audits a significant portion of the industry assets. This firm\u2019s  interpretation of accounting standards specific to the industry could  become the prevailing standard practice in that industry due to the firm\u2019s  dominant role. If, subsequently, these interpretations were found to be  inappropriate (by some influential external third party, for example), the  firm as well as the companies audited by that firm could be exposed to  heightened liability risk, which could potentially have a severe negative  impact on that industry as a whole as well as the firm.", "Finally, the new independence rules established under the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002, which limit the nonaudit services firms can provide to their  audit clients, may also serve to reduce the number of auditor choices for  some large public companies. As a hypothetical example, suppose that a  large multinational petroleum company that used one Big 4 firm for its  audit and attest services and another Big 4 firm for its outsourced internal  audit function wanted to hire a new accounting firm because its board of  directors decided that the company should change auditors every 7 years.  In this case, this company would appear to have two remaining alternatives  if it believed that only the Big 4 had the global reach and staff resources  necessary to audit its operations. However, one of the remaining two Big 4  firms did not enter a bid because its market niche in this industry was small  companies. Consequently, this company would be left with one realistic  alternative. Although hypothetical, this scenario spotlights another concern  that focuses on the potential exercise of market power, as it is highly  probable the remaining firm would be aware of its competitive position.

For  the period following the mergers of the late 1980s, both studies found that  audit fees declined through the mid 1990s.

However, other research hypothesized that  increased competition could reduce the probability that some accounting  firms could exercise disproportionate influence over the establishment of  accounting principles and policies. Likewise, auditor tenure might also  have a positive or negative impact. Some research hypothesized that an  auditor that served a given client for a longer period of time may be more  valuable to that client due to its deeper familiarity with and deeper insight  into the client\u2019s operations, which would allow the auditor to become less  dependent on the client for information about the client\u2019s operations.

By this measure, there is  some evidence suggesting that audit quality may have declined over the  1990s, as several recent studies have found that financial statement  restatements due to accounting irregularities have been increasing, and  those by larger companies have been increasing as well. As larger  companies typically employ larger accounting firms, which have been  perceived historically by some as providing higher quality audits, this trend  toward larger company financial statement restatements may heighten  concerns about potentially pervasive declining audit quality. In addition, in  some recent high-profile restatement cases it appeared that the auditors  identified problems but failed to ensure that management appropriately  addressed their concerns, raising questions about auditor independence.", "Another measure that has been employed by researchers to gauge audit  quality is whether an auditor issues a going-concern opinion warning  investors prior to a company\u2019s bankruptcy filing. One study found that  during the 1990s accounting firms issued fewer going-concern audit  opinions to financially stressed companies prior to bankruptcy. This study  found that auditors were less likely to issue going-concern opinions in  1996-1997 than in 1992-1993, and again less likely to issue such opinions in  1999-2000 than in 1996-1997.

However, numerous prior studies also  found that approximately half of all companies filing for bankruptcy in  selected periods prior to the 1990s did not have prior going-concern  opinions in their immediately preceding financial statements either.  Another study focusing on going-concern opinions over a relatively short,  recent time period examined whether there was an association between  nonaudit fees and auditor independence, but it found no significant  association between the two using auditors\u2019 propensity to issue going- concern opinions.

According to 83 percent of firms (38 of the 46) that  responded to our survey, litigation and insurance factors have had a great  or moderate upward influence on their costs, which they indicated have  increased significantly.

They said that the partnership structure of most public  accounting firms was one factor that limited the ability of all firms to raise  capital but posed a particular challenge for smaller firms. Under a  partnership structure, accounting firms are unable to raise capital through  the public markets. To expand their operations, accounting firms must look  to other options, such as borrowing from financial institutions, merging  with other accounting firms, growing the business without merging, or  tapping the personal resources of their partners and employees.

It  has become more highly concentrated, and the Big 4, as well as all  accounting firms, face tremendous challenges as they adapt to new risks  and responsibilities, new independence standards, a new business model,  and a new oversight structure, among other things. In many cases it is  unclear what the ultimate outcome will be and our findings about past  behavior may not reflect what the situation will be in the future. Therefore,  we have identified several important issues that we believe warrant  additional attention and study by the appropriate regulatory or  enforcement agencies at some point. First, agencies could evaluate and  monitor the effect of the existing level of concentration on price and quality  to see if there are any changes in the firms\u2019 ability to exercise market  power. This is especially important as the firms move to a new business  model with management consulting becoming a less significant source of  revenue. Second, the issue of what, if anything, can or should be done to  prevent further consolidation of the Big 4 warrants consideration. Such an  analysis could determine the possible impact of increased concentration  through the voluntary or involuntary exit of one of the current Big 4 firms.  If the effects were seen as detrimental, regulatory and enforcement  agencies could evaluate the types of actions that could be taken to mitigate  the impact or develop contingency plans to deal with the impact of further  consolidation. Part of this analysis would be to evaluate the pros and cons  of various forms of government intervention to maintain competition or  mitigate the effects of market power. Third, it is important that regulators  and enforcement agencies continue to balance the firms\u2019 and the  individuals\u2019 responsibilities when problems are uncovered and to target  sanctions accordingly. For example, when appropriate, hold partners and  employees rather than the entire firm accountable and consider the  implications of possible sanctions on the audit market. However, it is  equally important that concerns about the firms\u2019 viability be balanced  against the firms\u2019 believing they are \u201ctoo few to fail\u201d and the ensuing moral  hazard such a belief creates. Fourth, Big 4 market share concentration,  particularly in key industries, may warrant ongoing and additional analysis,  including evaluating ways to increase accounting firm competition in  certain industries by limiting market shares. Finally, it is unclear what can  be done to address existing barriers to entry into the large public company  market. However, it may be useful to evaluate whether addressing these  barriers could prevent further concentration in the top tier.

In the model, firms  with lower leverage ratios are more efficient and can therefore bid lower  prices for audit engagements than less efficient firms, and thus clients will  gravitate to more efficient accounting firms. Because data on partners and  staff published by PAR are reported at the consolidated level for the entire  accounting firm, not just the audit division, some error may be introduced  into the measure of leverage. In this model and simulation framework, a  client\u2019s size is captured by the natural logarithm (log) of its total assets,  which has been shown to be a good predictor of audit hours and thus audit  effort.

The results are then generated based on various assumed levels  of switching costs (the cost of changing auditors).

Of the  5,448 industrial companies, the Big 4 audited 68 percent of the log of assets in 2002, and the model of price competition consistently predicted that this  tier of firms would audit 68 percent or more of the total.

Figure 13 also shows that while a few firms  dominated certain industries in 1997 before the merger of Price  Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand and dissolution of Arthur Andersen,  there were fewer industries where two firms accounted for more than 70  percent of the total sales audited; and in most cases, at least one of the  remaining Big 6 firms audited a significant share (greater than 10 percent)  of the industry.", "The dissolution of Andersen in 2002 and the merger of Price Waterhouse  and Coopers & Lybrand in 1998 appear to have impacted many industries,  including those in the primary metals, general building contractors,  furniture and fixtures, petroleum and coal products, transportation by air,  and electric, gas, and sanitary services groups included in figure 13.  Moreover, figure 14 shows the remaining major economic groups with 20 or  more companies for which Andersen audited roughly 25 percent or more of  the total assets in the industry or Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand  both had significant presence in 1997. As the figure indicates, in many of  these sectors Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche acquired significant  market share by 2002. Because the Big 4 firms have increased their  presence in these industries formerly dominated by Andersen or Price  Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, the number of firms with industry  expertise appears to have remained unchanged in most cases. The mergers  between Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand did not impact choice  in most industries because the firms generally dominated different  industries as figure 13 and figure 14 show. This highlights that one of the  factors contributing to the mergers was the desire to increase industry  expertise. However, there are some industries (petroleum and coal  products, communications, primary metals, and fabricated metals among  others) that may have experienced a reduction in the number of viable  alternatives for companies that consider industry expertise important  when choosing an auditor.", "Table 13 provides a list of industries defined by 2-digit SIC codes with 25 or  more companies and also indicates where each of the Big 4 firms audit at  least 10 percent of the total industry assets.
