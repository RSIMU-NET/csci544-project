Rather, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (the Property Act) requires a screening process in which the appropriate government officials explore transferring the property with or without payment to another government or nonprofit agency. For example, DOD first screens excess property for possible use by other DOD organizations and then by other federal agencies. If no federal agency has a need for the excess property, it is declared surplus to the federal government and generally is made available to private nonprofit and state and local agencies. First, as stipulated by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the surplus property is made available to providers of services to the homeless. If none of these providers opt to take the property, it is offered to public benefit agencies such as state or local jurisdictions or qualifying nonprofit organizations for other authorized purposes. Any property that remains is available for negotiated sale to a state or local government. Finally, if no state or local government wishes to acquire the property, it is offered for sale to the general public.", "Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 contained a number of amendments to the Property Act and the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) acts of 1988 and 1990.

Thus, property disposition decisions at these bases have been delayed. In some cases, Indian groups were not represented on local reuse committees, and Indian requests and local reuse plans were in conflict. Furthermore, the Indian groups maintain that they should have sovereignty over property they receive, while the local jurisdictions want to maintain zoning and land use control. In Seattle, the Muckleshoot Tribe has requested a major portion of Puget Sound Naval Station, which the city plans to use to house the homeless and hold recreation, cultural, and other activities.", "In several cases, federal agency requests conflicted with local reuse plans. While these conflicts can delay local reuse planning, they are usually resolved through negotiation between DOD and the community. For example, at Williams Air Force Base, the Army Reserve requested property that local officials said was essential for their planned educational consortium. At the time of our review, this case remained unresolved but subsequently the Reserve and local officials came to mutual agreement.", "Disputes between communities and homeless providers over the extent of base property to be conveyed for the homeless have led to delays at some bases. The Department of Health and Human Services could deny homeless provider requests if it determined the provider lacked experience or financial viability for such a program. However, in deciding whether to approve homeless requests, the Department of Health and Human Services officials believed the McKinney Act gave them no discretion to consider whether the request would disrupt the local reuse plan. In October 1994, Congress passed and sent to the President for signature legislation that would give communities more flexibility in developing plans to meet homeless needs and federal agencies more discretion in approving such plans. The new legislation allows communities to develop reuse plans that incorporate the needs of the homeless either at the base or elsewhere in the community.

DOD officials told those communities deciding to request economic development transfers under the new rules they would have to also go through an additional McKinney Act homeless screening under the new rules, which could add an additional 8 months to the process.
