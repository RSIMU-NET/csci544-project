GAO also used internal control and corporate governance standards to articulate the key principles of accountability, transparency, and effective external communication; identified six leading practices that facilitate these principles; and analyzed the Board's Manual against each.

For example, the Board has authority for security decisions, as well as certain human capital and personnel matters, including the approval of officer terminations.", "In 2013, the Board adopted a Manual of Procedures (Manual) that references its operations and establishes protocols for outreach with the Congressional committees and leadership offices (stakeholders) with whom the Board interacts. This Manual fully incorporated one and partially incorporated five of the six leading practices that facilitate the principles of accountability, transparency, and effective external communication; however, the Board has not always implemented these practices, such as notifying stakeholders that certain information on the Board's decisions and operations is available to them.", "Some stakeholders raised concerns, such as the Board not adequately soliciting their input, and suggested adjustments to enhance the Board's approaches. Board officials told us that the Manual has not incorporated some leading practices, in part because they address activities beyond statutory requirements. Leading practices note that effective governing bodies make commitments to stakeholders that exceed basic requirements, and GAO found the Manual includes activities that go beyond what is statutorily prescribed. Working to fully incorporate leading practices into its Manual and operations would help the Board enhance its accountability, transparency, and effective external communication with stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Board revise its Manual to fully incorporate leading practices, including evaluating its performance, and engage with stakeholders and incorporate their views, as appropriate, on any changes.

The U.S. Capitol  Police is responsible for protecting the Congress, as well as its members,  staff, visitors, and facilities so that it can fulfill its constitutional and  legislative responsibilities in a safe, secure, and open environment. By  statute, the Capitol Police Board (Board) is charged with overseeing and  supporting the Capitol Police, which in turn is to police the Capitol  buildings and grounds under the direction of the Board. The Board is  comprised of the Senate and House Sergeants-at-Arms, the Architect of  the Capitol, and the Chief of the Capitol Police, who is a non-voting  member. The Board and the Capitol Police interact with multiple  committees and congressional offices in their respective capacities,  including the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the  Committee on House Administration, and the Senate and House  Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittees.", "The House Committee on Appropriations\u2019 July 2001 report that  accompanied the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2002 stated that  correspondence and answers related to routine budget matters that the  Committee was seeking from the police had to be routed through the  Capitol Police Board where they were held up pending review. In  particular, the report noted that \u201cthe unnecessary bureaucracy of the  review process added by the Board impedes appropriations review and  oversight.\u201d The committee\u2019s 2001 report also included a provision for us  to review the Board\u2019s structure. Thus, in 2002 we provided insights into  the Board\u2019s operations, internal controls, and standardized governance  practices, as well as alternatives to the existing Board\u2019s design. Although  the Board has undergone some changes since that time\u2014 such as  designating the Chief of the Capitol Police (Chief) as a non-voting  member in 2003 and adopting a Manual of Procedures (Manual) in 2013  to document, among other things, its mission, purpose, and  composition\u2014according to some Congressional stakeholders,  accountability and communication challenges persist. In light of this, you  asked us to review similar topics as those we explored in 2002.", "In this report, we examine the following:  1.  What are the roles and responsibilities of the Board and the Chief of  the Capitol Police, as set out in statute and in the Board\u2019s Manual of  Procedures, and how does the Board\u2019s scope compare to other law  enforcement oversight entities?  2.  To what extent does the Board\u2019s Manual incorporate leading practices  from internal control and other standardized governance principles to  facilitate accountability, transparency, and effective external  communication and in what ways is the Board implementing these  practices?  3.  What are Congressional stakeholder perspectives on the degree to  which the Board is accountable, transparent, and effective in its  communication approaches and what options exist to enhance the  Board\u2019s approaches?", "To examine the roles and responsibilities of the Board and the Chief of  Police as set out in statute and in the Board\u2019s Manual, and to determine  how the Board\u2019s scope compares to other law enforcement oversight  entities, we reviewed and analyzed the relevant provisions of statute  pertaining to the Board as well as the Board\u2019s Manual.  We also  conducted interviews with officials from four organizations with expertise  in law enforcement oversight and governance issues, which we selected  in order to understand how entities overseeing law enforcement agencies  are structured and how they function. We selected these particular  organizations because they have a breadth of knowledge about law  enforcement oversight structure and functions in other settings. We also  spoke with the National Council on State Legislatures (NCSL) to  understand how law enforcement oversight efforts are structured and  function at state capitols and identify the similarities and differences to the  operations of the Capitol Police Board. In addition, we solicited input  through interviews, phone calls, and emails with current Board members,  Board staff, and stakeholders.", "To examine the extent to which the Board\u2019s Manual  incorporates leading  practices from internal control and other standardized governance  practices that facilitate accountability, transparency and effective external  communication and describe the ways the Board is implementing these  practices, we first identified the applicable leading practices. To do so, we  relied on (1) federal internal control standards and (2) principles  originating from the Business Roundtable and the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Each standard and  principle reflected the specific activities in which effective governing  bodies should engage to facilitate accountability, transparency, and  effective external communication. For our purposes, and using these  practices as a guide, we used the following definitions for each term:", "Accountability  occurs when an entity acknowledges and assumes  responsibility for its actions and is answerable for any resulting  consequences.", "Transparency occurs when an entity records and communicates  information on activities to stakeholders who need it in a form and  timeframe that allows these stakeholders to carry out their  responsibilities.", "Effective external communication occurs when an entity utilizes  various modes of communication, proactively when possible, to  convey information to stakeholders.", "We then analyzed the Board\u2019s Manual for provisions related to these  terms and assessed the extent to which the Manual  incorporated the  leading practices. A determination of \u201cfully incorporated\u201d means that  procedures in the Manual  align with all activities associated with the  leading practice. A determination of \u201cpartially incorporated\u201d means that  procedures in the Manual  align with some activities associated with the  leading practice. A determination of \u201cnot incorporated\u201d means that no  provisions in the Manual align with any activities associated with the  leading practice. We also obtained and analyzed Board documentation  illustrative of its practices, such as the minutes of Board meetings held in  fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and year-end reports for calendar years 2013  through 2015. We focused on documentation developed in 2014 and  2015 because the Board adopted the Manual in June 2013. In addition,  we interviewed Board officials to understand their practices.  To identify the Congressional stakeholder perspectives on the degree to  which the Board is accountable, transparent, and effective in its  communication approaches and options that exist to enhance the Board\u2019s  approaches, we sought stakeholder views from the majority and minority  staff of the committees who engage with the Board\u2014Senate Committee  on Rules and Administration, Committee on House Administration, and  the Senate and House Legislative Branch Appropriations  Subcommittees\u2014as well as the majority and minority staff representing  the leadership from the Senate and the House. We also solicited Board  and stakeholder input and asked the organizations we had earlier  identified as having expertise in law enforcement oversight and  governance issues for their perspectives.

In addition, various Congressional acts have sought to  strengthen the qualifications for officers\u2019 appointment. For example, in the  early days of the Capitol Police, the Sergeants-at-Arms appointed force  members. In 2003 however, an appropriations act delegated appointment  and hiring authority to the Chief, who currently has the authority to set the  terms, conditions, and privileges of employment with the Capitol Police.  Further, beginning in the early 1900s, federal law began requiring more  stringent hiring standards, resulting in a police force with an increasing  amount of law enforcement expertise. Specifically, in 1919, an  appropriations act provided that any appointments to the Capitol Police  be based \u201csolely on account of efficiency and special qualifications.\u201d  Later, in 1935, an appropriations act specified that all appointees to the  Capitol Police were required to meet hiring standards that the Board  prescribed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capitol Police Board Structure, Composition, and Relationships to Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["The Board is comprised of the Senate and House Sergeants-at-Arms, the  Architect of the Capitol, and the Chief of the Capitol Police.

Two of the four  groups we spoke with indicated that typically, law enforcement oversight  bodies focus exclusively on a narrow range of issues.

These six practices are: (1) defining roles, responsibilities, and areas of  authority; (2) overseeing functions of the corporation\u2014or in the Board\u2019s  case, the Capitol Police; (3) conducting performance evaluations and  reviews; (4) developing processes for internal functions of the board; (5)  disclosing information to stakeholders; and (6) developing processes for  communication with stakeholders.

Further, according  to the Board, in developing its mission-related processes, the Board was  guided by corporate governance standards and best practices, federal  standards for internal controls, and other related sources. Fully  incorporating these leading practices into its Manual would better position  the Board to have reasonable assurance that its approaches facilitate  accountability, transparency, and effective external communication.

In practice, the Chief reports routinely to the Board on Capitol  Police initiatives such as security projects and the Inspector General  reports quarterly on audit findings. In addition, the Manual,  based on  statutory provisions, identifies areas where the Board is to obtain  approval from, consult with, or provide documentation to its stakeholders.  As appendix II, table 9 illustrates, federal law establishes these lines of  reporting, and each provision makes varying distinctions between  congressional stakeholders, including leadership offices and committees,  when determining to whom the Board is accountable in specific instances.

In practice, Board  members and staff explained that they do work with the Capitol Police to  ensure recommendations from the Inspector General\u2019s reports are  implemented, but these efforts are not codified in the Manual to help  ensure accountability.

In practice,  Board members and staff explained that the Board reviews and approves  the Capitol Police\u2019s budget justification in its entirety before it is submitted  to the appropriations committees. In our discussions with the Board,  officials explained that the Board and the Chief may discuss the  manpower needed to support an initiative or project included in the  justification and as needed, they may also discuss projects that  leadership offices would like to include in the department\u2019s justification.  After the Board approves the justification, Capitol Police management  works with the appropriations committees, and the Board members may  reach out to the committees if additional communication is necessary. In  addition, the Manual states that the Chief\u2019s semi-annual report is to  include a status report on the Capitol Police\u2019s spend plan. However, it  does not address any Board responsibilities in monitoring budget  execution by the Capitol Police, which may include activities such as  assessing whether the budget is appropriately responsive to changing  security conditions, as governance principles suggest. In our discussions  with the Board, officials explained that the Board proactively monitors the  police department\u2019s execution of the budget but these efforts are not  codified in the Manual. Codifying them as such could help the Board  ensure the police department\u2019s accountability for sound fiscal  stewardship.", "Oversee the corporation\u2019s risk assessment and management processes.  The Manual  partially incorporated this activity. As discussed above, the  Manual states that the Chief reports to the Board on the Capitol Police\u2019s  strategic planning and the Inspector General reports to the Chief and the  Board on findings or operational deficiencies from audits. Internal control  standards consider strategic planning and consideration of audit findings,  among others, to be methods for identifying internal or external risks to an  organization for achieving its objectives. However, beyond addressing  these actions that can help identify risk, the Manual does not address any  Board mechanism for overseeing the Capitol Police\u2019s analysis and  management of such risks, as governance principles suggest. Such  responsibilities could include estimating the significance of the risk,  assessing the likelihood of its occurrence, and deciding how to manage  the risk and what actions should be taken.

According to statute and the Manual, the Board is to make the meeting  minutes available for distribution to the House Speaker and Minority  Leader and the Senate President pro tempore and Minority  Leader. In  practice and in accordance with the Manual, the executive assistant  records the minutes for Board meetings as the Manual dictates. However,  although the executive assistant told us that the Board sends a letter to  these leadership offices notifying them that the minutes are available,  the  Board sent these letters for the first time in May 2016. Nevertheless,  Board members and staff told us that, in their opinion, stakeholders face  no barriers to information. They also asserted that Board members  routinely make themselves available for discussion with stakeholders as  needed. Further, they told us that if they were to receive requests for  written materials they would consider the facts and circumstances of each  request and work to ensure that any stakeholder with a need to know  would receive a satisfactory response.

As we  describe later in this report, several stakeholders relayed concerns about  the Board\u2019s transparency with respect to disclosure practices.

The Manual  partially incorporated this activity. For example, the Manual  presents the  Board\u2019s governance structure including the division of authorities between  the Board, Capitol Police, and congressional leadership offices and  committees.

In addition,  the Board did not notify all of the designated recipients, such as the  Comptroller General, that the Manual  was available. The Board also did  not submit a biannual report to the joint leadership on the status of the  legislative branch\u2019s emergency preparedness programs, as the Manual  directs. Board officials explained that the Senate and House Sergeants- at-Arms individually  report out on such programs. Nevertheless, such a  separate reporting structure does not promote transparency and  coordination across the two chambers in regards to emergency  preparedness. Given that it has limited the availability  of the Manual to  leadership offices, based largely on statute, the Board could identify other  mechanisms to communicate its corporate governance structure and  policies to committee stakeholders who do not receive the Manual in  order to fully incorporate this practice.

In practice, Board members and staff explained that they  routinely communicate with the committees multiple times a day to ensure  effective communication, but these efforts are not codified in the Manual.  As we will later describe, some stakeholders also expressed a concern  about the timing and nature of their engagement on key decisions.

In practice, Board officials  and congressional stakeholders told us that the full Board has met with  stakeholders on an ad hoc basis, but these efforts are not codified in the Manual to help ensure effective communication.

One stakeholder from a leadership office noted that the bicameral  structure of the Board precludes it from being accountable to any one  person or entity in Congress, but this individual did not see this as a  challenge. Rather, the individual observed that the Board\u2019s structure  serves as an appropriate buffer between political influences and security  decisions. In contrast, four of the seven committee stakeholders told us  they saw the bicameral structure as a factor limiting accountability and  that this, at times, challenges their oversight. For example, a single  committee cannot call all of the Board members to a committee hearing  because one of the two Sergeants-at-Arms is not under that chamber\u2019s  jurisdiction. In addition, one stakeholder told us that that there may be a  perception that the Architect of the Capitol as a Board member is not fully  accountable to the House committees because the Architect is confirmed  by the Senate. Aside from the bicameral structure, another factor that  some committee stakeholders noted precluded them from ensuring  accountability from the Board was a lack of insight into the Board\u2019s  decision-making. For example, one stakeholder pointed to the difficulty in  discerning whether the Board or the Chief made a decision regarding the  Capitol Police. As a result, the Chief is, at times, held accountable for  decisions made by the other Board members. According to several  committee staff, this factor hinders their ability to determine who is  responsible for Board decisions that have implications for their  committees\u2019 work. In its written comments on a draft of this report, the  Board indicated that no one outside of the U.S. Capitol Police and the  Board should know how the Board reached a decision, as once a  decision is reached, it is unanimous (see appendix III).", "Three of the four leadership stakeholders found the roles, responsibilities,  and lines of reporting between the Board and the Chief to be clear  enough to promote accountability, unlike six of the seven committee  stakeholders who did not. Five of these six committee stakeholders  noted that in their view, the Board intervenes in the Chief\u2019s management  of the police department. For example, in the view of some committee  stakeholders, the Board decides on and directs \u201ca lot\u201d of the Capitol  Police department\u2019s spending, which they feel should be left to the  discretion of the Chief. Some committee stakeholders also noted that the  Sergeants-at-Arms told Capitol Police officers that they may come to the  sergeants with any issues they may face within the police department. In  the views of these stakeholders, officers should go to the Chief, not the  Board, as this is a part of the day-to-day management of the department.  Two committee stakeholders added that the Chief does not appear to  have a sufficient voice in Board decisions regarding the Capitol Police  and added that it appears the Chief does not provide his opinion if it is  different from the Board\u2019s. These stakeholders perceived that this was the  case because the Board hires the Chief. As committee stakeholders  explained, as a result of unclear roles and responsibilities, it is difficult for  them to determine what the Capitol Police\u2014the department over which  they have oversight authority\u2014needs rather than what the Board needs.  Further, across both leadership offices and committees, some  stakeholders pointed out that the level of clarity in the roles and  responsibilities of the Board and the Chief depends on the personalities  or individual expectations of the Board members and the Chief.", "Stakeholders also provided their perspectives of the Board\u2019s role overall.  Some committee stakeholders said the Board did not involve the  respective committee in decisions in areas where, in their view, the  committee has authority, such as controlling access to the Capitol  buildings and grounds, which further limited the Board\u2019s accountability. In  addition, one leadership stakeholder noted that the issues encountered  with the Board stem from their view that the Board is not proactively  identifying issues and taking steps to address them, such as when this  stakeholder had to take the initiative to get the Board to address a  security issue that had existed for nearly 15 years. This stakeholder said  that such issues may be a result of how Board members perceive the  Board\u2019s role in security matters. In its written comments on a draft of this  report, the Board had indicated that it had brought this security issue to  stakeholders\u2019 attention in 2003, but no action had been taken until the  leadership stakeholder became aware of the issue and pushed the issue  to conclusion (see appendix III)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency", "paragraphs": ["We also found differences of opinion between leadership and committee  stakeholders with respect to their views on the Board\u2019s transparency.

Further, one committee stakeholder underscored a leadership  stakeholder\u2019s perspective, noting that the Board is not upfront with  congressional staff about the Board\u2019s security projects, so congressional  staff have to ask very specific questions to obtain the information they  need. Another committee stakeholder told us that the Board decided to  close an area of the Capitol for recent events that had typically been open  to members of Congress and their guests. In so doing, the Board  informed leadership in a letter after rendering the decision, but did not  consult with congressional staff from the cognizant committee prior to  finalizing this decision. This stakeholder pointed out that the committee,  not leadership, has jurisdiction over the chamber\u2019s grounds so the Board  should be more transparent with its decisions. According to this  stakeholder, the Board also does not trust congressional staff with  security related information and the individual  attributed this to the fact  that congressional staff, for the most part, are not former law enforcement  or security officials like the Board members.", "The one committee stakeholder who was satisfied with the level of the  Board\u2019s transparency acknowledged that based on personal opinion,  additional transparency is not necessary because the Board deals with  sensitive security-related matters better left discussed discreetly.

For example, some  stakeholders on the appropriations committees reported that the Board  did not communicate its plans when initiating security projects in the  middle of the fiscal year that had not been included in the annual budget  request. These stakeholders shared the view that initiating significant  security projects without their input limits transparency. One stakeholder  found out about changes to security initiatives that have implications for  future year appropriations in a widely-distributed notice of the changes,  but not directly from the Board. Further, some stakeholders also  expressed frustration with \u201cgoing through\u201d the Board when they have  questions or concerns about the Capitol Police\u2019s budget justification.

The other  stakeholder from that committee found that communication between  committee staff and the Board depended on the personalities of individual  Board members and that was not problematic. For example, the  Sergeant-at-Arms from their committee\u2019s chamber discusses items and  issues the Board is considering with the congressional staff. Further,  when this Sergeant-at-Arms took chairmanship of the Board, he met with  committee and leadership stakeholders to discuss and solicit feedback on  security issues he envisioned the Board tackling during his chairmanship."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options Exist for Adjustments to the Board\u2019s Operations and Structure", "paragraphs": ["Our analyses and discussions with law enforcement expert groups,  congressional stakeholders, and others who are familiar with the workings  of the Capitol Police Board identified options to enhance the Board\u2019s  approaches that fall into two categories: (1) adjustments the Board might  consider without any statutory change required, and (2) adjustments that  would require statutory change."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Adjustments That Would Not Require Statutory Change", "paragraphs": ["1. The provision of regular opportunities for the committees of  jurisdiction and the leadership offices to meet with the full Board.", "Some stakeholders suggested that more routine contact could enhance  accountability, transparency, and communication. For example,  congressional staff suggested periodic meetings between stakeholders  and all four Board members in one setting or the Board could invite staff  to scheduled Board meetings. These opportunities could address some  stakeholders\u2019 concerns that they do not have insight into the Board\u2019s  decision-making on security matters. One stakeholder told us that the  existing monthly meetings on the House side between congressional staff  from the leadership offices and the appropriations committees, as well as  the House Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chief, and the Architect of the Capitol,  are helpful tools. These meetings provide a platform for the relevant  parties to discuss security issues that need to be addressed and projects  that need to be funded. This individual wondered why the Board does not  similarly coordinate meetings with all of the appropriate stakeholders from  leadership offices or committees when it identifies security issues that  require input from these stakeholders. Leadership and committee  stakeholders who made these suggestions said that since congressional  staff do not meet regularly with the full Board, additional opportunities to  meet with all of the Board members at once would enhance transparency  by providing insight into the Board\u2019s decision-making and allow  stakeholders to be more informed of the Board\u2019s plans for the security of  the Capitol complex. In addition, some of the stakeholders asserted that  involving congressional staff in these meetings could also address their  concerns related to ensuring accountability of the full Board.  2.

From this individual\u2019s  perspective, issues between congressional stakeholders and the Board  arise from the Board not communicating effectively with stakeholders.  Further, a strategy to discuss decisions that the Board is considering  could also address other stakeholders\u2019 concerns about the lack of insight  into the Board\u2019s decisions in areas where stakeholders have specific  responsibilities. For example, one stakeholder noted that the Board could  better inform stakeholders on the reasons why the Board wants to pursue  one option or initiative over another.   3. The clarification for stakeholders of when a decision is within the  authority of the Board or the Chief.", "Some stakeholders conveyed frustration that they did not always know  the impetus for a decision and this affected who they could hold  accountable. For example, some stakeholders commented that in their  view, the Chief is at times held accountable for decisions made by the  other Board members. Other stakeholders commented that the Board is  too heavily invested in operational matters such as budget justification  review and personnel matters, although the statutory framework supports  this role. Thus, if the Board were more transparent about distinguishing  between areas within the Board\u2019s domain versus the Chief\u2019s, which some  stakeholders noted was unclear to them, it could reduce some degree of  confusion. Likewise, if the Board better explained its roles as directed by  statute, and how it operationalized those requirements, it could address  some stakeholders\u2019 concerns that the Board inappropriately  intervenes in  the Chief\u2019s management of the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structural Adjustments that Would Require Statutory Change", "paragraphs": ["1.  A change to the scope of the Board\u2019s duties.", "As mentioned earlier, the scope of the current Board\u2019s duties ranges  widely from managing certain human capital and personnel issues to  making security decisions. This contrasts from the scope of other law  enforcement oversight entities that we noted earlier when recapping the  views of the law enforcement expert groups with whom we spoke. In  addition, some stakeholders expressed frustration concerning the wide  scope of the Board\u2019s duties despite the professionalization of the Capitol  Police department over time. For example, they noted that the Board\u2019s  involvement in the budget process encroaches on their committees\u2019 ability  to interact directly with the Chief on the Capitol Police\u2019s budget  justification. Statutory change to reduce the Board\u2019s scope, expand its  scope, or eliminate the Board altogether could also have practical  implications on the Capitol Police. For example, if the Board\u2019s scope were  to be reduced, the Chief may have to assume new responsibilities or  adapt to a different level of oversight in the midst of ongoing Capitol  Police operations. If the Board\u2019s scope were to expand, it would require  the Board to quickly adapt to fulfill its new responsibilities and add  competing pressures on their time. If the Board were to be eliminated  entirely, some of its responsibilities may be reassigned to various entities,  including the Chief, all the while having to maintain some type of  congressional oversight structure for the Capitol Police.  2.  A change to the composition and size of the Board.", "As we previously described, the Board is currently comprised of the  House and Senate Sergeants-at-Arms, the Architect of the Capitol, and  the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police who serves in a non-voting, ex-officio  capacity. In speaking with law enforcement expert groups about the  Board, one group specifically mentioned that the current Board is smaller  than the size of traditional oversight bodies, which generally include at  least seven members. Another law enforcement expert group mentioned  that the Board could benefit from expanding its size, and therefore its  composition, to include representatives from other law enforcement  agencies who could add a broader perspective. For example, one  stakeholder suggested adding another Board member with specific  expertise on counterterrorism. Further, corporate governance standards  encourage the use of independent directors on a Board who do not have  a material or financial connection to the corporation they oversee.  Including representatives from outside law enforcement agencies could  be one way to incorporate the use of independent directors into the  Board\u2019s structure.", "Congressional stakeholders also commented that the Capitol Police  Board is smaller in size and composition compared to another body that  has some similarities in role. For example, the Joint Congressional  Continuity Board shares similar security related responsibilities but is  larger than the Capitol Police Board. The Joint Congressional Continuity  Board, while not a statutorily created organization like the Capitol Police  Board, is comprised of the current Capitol Police Board members with the  exception of the Architect of the Capitol, but also includes the Secretary  of the Senate, the Clerk of the House, and the Chief Administrative  Officer of the House.", "Changes to the Board\u2019s composition and size could impact how the Board  operates. For example, increasing the size of the Board may complicate  its decision-making process and the Board\u2019s current practice to operate  under consensus. In addition, according to the Board, the small size of  the current Board makes it more nimble and adding additional members  could negatively impact the accountability of individual  members to  Congressional stakeholders. Board members added that there may be  challenges associated with adding more people to the Board because any  new members may become involved in lawsuits that the Board may be  involved with at any given time and face liability,  which could impact their  desire to serve on the Board. In addition, according to the Board, the  structure and composition of the Board is its strength because it  combines the law enforcement credentials of the Board members with the  campus and infrastructure knowledge of the Architect of the Capitol.  However, as some stakeholders and law enforcement expert groups have  suggested, the Board may benefit from including other perspectives.  3.  A change to Board members\u2019 selection processes, voting rights,  and leadership assignments.", "As we previously described, Board members come into their positions in  different ways. The Speaker of the House and the Majority  Leader in the  Senate select the House and Senate Sergeants-at-Arms, respectively,  the Architect of the Capitol is selected by the President and confirmed by  the Senate, and the Chief of Police is selected by the Board. The  mechanisms by which members are placed into their positions may have  an impact on the Board\u2019s accountability to Congressional stakeholders.", "For example, some committee stakeholders noted that in their view, the  Board members are accountable to congressional leadership and not the  committees. Additionally, one law enforcement expert group we spoke  with indicated that police chiefs are often selected by elected officials,  rather than the oversight organization, which differs from the Board\u2019s  current practice of selecting the Chief. With respect to voting, currently, all  Board members vote except for the Chief of Police since one of the voting  decisions that is made by the Board involves the hiring and firing of the  Chief. The Board also has three voting members so that there is a tie- breaker, which serves a useful function in the event of disagreement and  this principle may be valuable to retain if changes to voting are made.  Changes to roles of the members, such as the voting status of members,  may impact the amount of weight individual  perspectives have in the  Board\u2019s decision-making process. With respect to how the chairmanship  of the Board is determined, the position rotates between the House and  Senate Sergeants-at-Arms on a yearly basis but that could change to  allow the Architect of the Capitol to serve in that role or to change the  timing of the rotation. Changes to the current practice of alternating  chairmanship of the Board could impact the continuity of Board initiatives,  as individual members of the Board may have different priorities.  4.  A change to the oversight of the Board\u2019s activities.", "As we mentioned earlier, a number of the Board\u2019s activities are subject to  the oversight of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, the  Committee on House Administration, and the Senate and House  Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittees, but four of the seven  Congressional stakeholders we spoke with from the committees stated  that they believed that the Board does not sufficiently take into account  the role of these committees in making decisions involving the U.S.  Capitol Police.", "Changes to the oversight into the Board\u2019s activities could take many  forms. For example, our prior work on the Board found that oversight of  the Board and the U.S. Capitol Police could be consolidated into a single  joint congressional committee, which could address concerns about  holding the entire Board accountable as the joint committee would be  bicameral and therefore would have jurisdiction over all the Board  members. However, according to the Congressional Research Service,  joint committees generally lack legislative authority, so their ability to  streamline legislative action would be limited, and as one Congressional  stakeholder we spoke with commented, joint committees can be difficult  to form. During outreach for our current study, we learned from a National  Council on State Legislatures (NCSL) representative that security and law  enforcement at many state capitols is managed this way. Oversight of  security and law enforcement at other state capitols is conducted by  members of the legislature, such as in California\u2014according to the  representative from NCSL. Also, as this individual from NSCL described  it, in New Mexico, a legislative council comprised of the leaders from the  state House and Senate chambers oversees security. Changes to the  oversight of the Board\u2019s activities may have practical implications. For  example, if oversight were to be consolidated into a joint committee, this  would establish a single focal point within the Congress for oversight.", "Changes to the oversight into the Board\u2019s activities could also include  restructuring the way in which the Board\u2019s initiatives are funded.  Representatives from another law enforcement expert group we spoke  with indicated that law enforcement oversight bodies typically have  funding that is separate from the law enforcement entity that they are  overseeing, which enhances their independence and adds a layer of  accountability to their appropriators. Further, Congressional stakeholders  we spoke with indicated that, if the Board had separate funding, it would  be required to follow the established budget justification process that  requires engagement with the appropriators, which would also enhance  the transparency of the Board\u2019s activities.", "Regardless of what change is made to the oversight of the Board\u2019s  activities, it is important that the Board\u2019s relationship to the oversight  committees is clear to both sides, given the perception among some  Congressional stakeholders that the Board does not always appropriately  acknowledge committees\u2019 roles in oversight."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Board has taken action to document its practices into a Manual of  Procedures. While the Manual  has incorporated some leading practices  to facilitate accountability, transparency, and effective external  communication, and the Board has taken action to implement many of  these provisions, Congressional stakeholders still have reservations  about the Board\u2019s effectiveness. As a key governing document, the  Manual could thus be strengthened to more fully incorporate the leading  practices we identified, such as turning inward to assess its own  performance, and thus address the stakeholder concerns we reported. In  some instances, the Manual is silent on the effective governance  practices that the Board is implementing and it could be strengthened by  codifying these activities. In other instances, the Board is not  implementing particular practices that the Manual directs. Adherence is  thus warranted, and also could positively impact stakeholder relations.  Finally, in some cases, the Manual is silent on a practice and the Board  has not been addressing it either. In this last case, adjusting the Manual  accordingly could help establish and routinize the desired leading practice  on a prospective basis and also could alleviate some stakeholder  concerns.", "Revising the Manual to fully incorporate leading practices for internal  control and governance standards would provide a sound and robust  governing document, inclusive of all the Board currently does while also  establishing new processes for the Board to do in the future. Additionally,  revising the Manual would help the Board better ensure that its practices  are designed to facilitate constructive and productive relationships with  stakeholders while maintaining the Board\u2019s critical security focus. As the  Board contemplates these revisions to the Manual,  it would benefit from  working to engage stakeholders in the process. The Board could do this  by soliciting stakeholder input as it considers the non-statutory changes  that stakeholders suggested to address their concerns, such as  developing strategies for obtaining stakeholder feedback when making  security decisions. Further, if the Board determines that statutory changes  are needed, it should coordinate with stakeholders on such changes.  Identifying  and communicating potential changes to its congressional  stakeholders, and incorporating their views into the revision process, as  appropriate, would help the Board ensure that steps to revise its Manual  best address both the leading practices and chief stakeholder concerns.", "Our work indicates that stakeholders hold widely divergent views about  the appropriate role of the Board, the level of transparency concerning its  operations, and the extent to which it engages stakeholders when making  decisions. These divergent views reflect a variety of competing interests  and priorities. Our report also outlines a number of options requiring  statutory change, which could further address concerns about the Board\u2019s  operations, but could also pose new challenges. These options center on  changes to the Boards\u2019 scope and duties, its composition and size, and  alternatives to congressional oversight of the Board, among other things.  Ultimately, the decision of whether to implement these options, and if so,  how to implement them, involves fundamental policy choices that only  Congress can make taking into account the results of our analyses and  discussions with law enforcement groups and stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the Capitol Police Board\u2019s current and any new  approaches help enhance accountability, transparency, and effective  external communication with its stakeholders, we recommend that the  Board revise its Manual of Procedures to fully incorporate each of the  leading practices for internal control and governance standards discussed  in this report. In so doing, the Board should engage stakeholders in the  revision process, such as by soliciting their input on any non-statutory  changes that could particularly address the concerns stakeholders have  raised, and incorporating their views as appropriate. If, in making  revisions to its Manual, the Board determines that statutory changes may  be helpful to enhance Board operations, then the Board should also  engage with stakeholders on such proposed changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Board for their review and  comment.

However, the Board did present several areas that it wanted emphasized,  such as its reporting structures and member credentials, both of which it  asserts as strengths.  Further, the Board noted that its Manual is an  internal reference tool to guide current and prospective Board members  and not a governance document.  With respect to reporting lines, we  revised our figure accordingly. With respect to the Manual,  we are not  making revisions to our report because the Manual  serves as the sole  document to guide Board operations.", "Additionally,  the Board expressed concern with the applicability of the  corporate governance leading practices we identified. In particular, the  Board stated that such practices are geared towards corporations and not  Congressional entities, such as the Capitol Police or the Board. We  disagree. As we noted in our report, these standards have broad  relevance to governing bodies seeking to facilitate accountability,  transparency, and effective external communication in a range of  contexts. Further, in identifying the leading practices, we were mindful of  choosing practices that would be pertinent to the Board, given that it does  not operate in a corporate setting. Additionally,  the Board utilized an  earlier version of these same practices in its 2003 report to Congress, as  we cited. Relatedly, in the Board\u2019s 2003 report, it noted that the Board  serves as the Board of Directors for the Capitol Police and indicated that  following corporate governance standards would provide an effective  model for the Board in setting out its roles, functions, and processes for  the future.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Board.

(2) To what extent does the Board\u2019s Manual of Procedures  incorporate leading practices from internal control and other  standardized governance principles to facilitate accountability,  transparency, and effective external communication and in what  ways is the Board implementing these practices?  (3) What are Congressional stakeholder perspectives on the degree  to which the Board is accountable, transparent, and effective in its  communication approaches and what options exist to enhance the  Board\u2019s approaches?", "To examine the roles and responsibilities of the Board and the Chief of  the Capitol Police as set out in statute and in the Board\u2019s Manual of  Procedures (Manual) and to determine how the Board\u2019s scope compares  to other law enforcement oversight entities, we reviewed the relevant  statutes that set out the Board and the Chief\u2019s roles and responsibilities.  We also reviewed the Board\u2019s Manual to identify areas where it identifies  the Board\u2019s roles and responsibilities, as well as those of the Chief in  relation to the Board. We then analyzed the relevant statutory and Manual  provisions to inventory the various roles and responsibilities of the Board  and the Chief.", "In addition, we conducted interviews with officials from organizations with  expertise in law enforcement oversight and governance issues, such as  the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies  (CALEA), Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), International  Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), and National Association for  Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (NACOLE), to understand how  organizations overseeing law enforcement agencies are structured and  how they function. We also spoke with the National Council on State  Legislatures (NCSL) to understand how law enforcement oversight efforts  are structured and function at state capitols and whether any parallels  exist to the Capitol Police Board. We selected these organizations  because we spoke to many of the same organizations for our prior work  on the Board and they have a breadth of knowledge about law  enforcement oversight structure and functions in other settings.", "Further, we interviewed current Board officials\u2014members, such as the  House Sergeant-at-Arms, general counsel, and the executive assistant\u2014 as well as a former Board member, a former Chief of the Capitol Police,  and current Capitol Police union officials. We also conducted semi- structured interviews with congressional staff from the majority and  minority sides of the committees that interact with the Board\u2014Senate and  House Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittees, Senate  Committee on Rules and Administration, and Committee on House  Administration\u2014as well as leadership offices\u2014Speaker of the House and  Senate Majority and Minority Leaders. We spoke with these  congressional staff to solicit their views on the roles and responsibilities of  the Board and Chief. The information collected from interviews with these  staff cannot be projected to all staff from the committees of jurisdiction  and leadership offices. However, these interviews provided us with the  perspectives of staff who work with the Board in their capacity as  committee and leadership staff.", "To examine the extent to which the Board\u2019s Manual  incorporates leading  practices from internal control and other standardized governance  practices to facilitate accountability, transparency and effective external  communication and describe the ways the Board has implemented these  practices, we first assessed the Manual using internal control and  corporate governance principles. For our purposes, and using these  practices as a guide, we used the following definitions for each term:", "Accountability  occurs when an entity acknowledges and assumes  responsibility for its actions and is answerable for any resulting  consequences.", "Transparency occurs when an entity records and communicates  information on activities to stakeholders who need it in a form and  timeframe that allows these stakeholders to carry out their  responsibilities.", "Effective external communication occurs when an entity utilizes  various modes of communication, proactively when possible, to  convey information to stakeholders.", "To identify the leading practices that reflect the specific activities that  effective governing bodies should engage to facilitate accountability,  transparency, and effective external communication, we consulted  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, the Business  Roundtable\u2019s Principles of Corporate Governance and the  G20/Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s  Principles of Corporate Governance. We reviewed these sources to  identify the standards that pertain to accountability, transparency, and  effective external communication and would also be relevant to the  Board, given that it does not operate in a corporate setting. Through this  process, we identified six leading practices and 24 specific activities, or  criteria, they encompass. The six leading practices reflect the specific  activities in which effective governing bodies should engage to facilitate  accountability, transparency, and effective external communication.  These leading practices are: (1) defining roles, responsibilities, and areas  of authority; (2) overseeing functions of the corporation; (3) conducting  performance evaluations and reviews; (4) developing processes for  internal functions of the board; (5) disclosing information to stakeholders;  and (6) developing processes for communication with stakeholders.  We then assessed procedures in the Manual against the activities  associated with each leading practice we identified and determined the  extent to which the practices were incorporated. To do this, we used a  scale of \u201cfully incorporated,\u201d \u201cpartially incorporated,\u201d and \u201cnot  incorporated.\u201d A determination of \u201cfully incorporated\u201d means that  procedures in the Manual  align with all activities associated with the  leading practice. A determination of \u201cpartially incorporated\u201d means that  procedures in the Manual  align with some activities associated with the  leading practice. A determination of \u201cnot incorporated\u201d means that no  provisions in the Manual align with any activities associated with the  leading practice. One analyst independently  reviewed the Manual and  made the initial determination. A second analyst then verified the  decision.", "We also obtained and analyzed Board documentation illustrative of its  practices, including the 2003 Board report to Congress, minutes of Board  meetings held in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, orders issued by the Board  in calendar years 2014 and 2015, year-end reports for calendar years  2013 through 2015, and a briefing that provides an overview of the Board.  We focused on documentation developed in 2014 and 2015 because the  Board adopted the Manual in June 2013. In addition, we interviewed  Board officials to understand their practices.", "To identify the Congressional stakeholder perspectives on the degree to  which the Board is accountable, transparent, and effective in its  communication approaches and options that exist to enhance the Board\u2019s  approaches, we sought stakeholder views from the majority and minority  staff of the committees who engage with the Board \u2013 Senate Committee  on Rules and Administration, Committee on House Administration, and  the Senate and House Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittees  \u2013 as well as the majority and minority staff representing the leadership  from the Senate and the House, to provide insight into how the Board\u2019s  practices were meeting their needs for accountability, transparency, and  effective communication when interacting with the Board and to solicit  feedback on the options to alternative Board structures that we found in  our prior work on the Board, options proposed by the Congressional  Research Service in 2009, and to identify any other options that may  address any concerns they have in interacting with the Board. We also  solicited Board and stakeholder input and asked the organizations we had  earlier identified as having expertise in law enforcement oversight and  governance issues for their perspectives. We then incorporated the  information collected from interviews with congressional staff and experts  into the alternative structures for the Board we found in our prior work on  the Board.
