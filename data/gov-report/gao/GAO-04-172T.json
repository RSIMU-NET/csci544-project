First, the agreement is very broad: It encompasses more than 800 pages, spans eight broad areas, and sets forth hundreds of individual commitments on how China's trade regime will adhere to the WTO's agreements, principles, and rules and allow greater market access. Second, the agreement is complicated: Interrelated parts will be phased in at different times, and some commitments are so general in nature that it may not be immediately clear whether China has fully complied with its obligations. Each of the key players involved in ensuring China's compliance--the executive branch, Congress, the private sector, and the WTO and its members--has made efforts to ensure China's compliance. However, the first-year experience in this regard has demonstrated that these efforts will need to be sustained over a long period. The executive branch has applied additional resources and new intra-agency teams to these efforts, but it takes time to organize these activities. Congress has enacted legislation and established new entities to increase oversight of China's compliance. The private sector also has provided information to the executive branch and to Congress on the status of China's compliance efforts. And, within the WTO, a China-specific mechanism was established as a means for WTO members to annually review China's implementation of its commitments.

Although China\u2019s implementation of its WTO commitments  cannot fully eliminate those concerns, compliance with its WTO  obligations is a central feature of China\u2019s economic relationship with the  United States and other WTO members. However, as we have found in our  analysis of the first year\u2019s efforts to monitor and enforce China\u2019s  compliance with its WTO commitments, the scope and complexity of the  agreement indicate that ensuring compliance will be difficult and will  require sustained efforts from all the key players to be successful.", "To provide you with an update on these issues, today I will discuss (1) the  compliance challenges associated with the scope and complexity of  China\u2019s WTO commitments and (2) the efforts to date of each of the key  players involved in ensuring China\u2019s compliance with its WTO obligations:  the executive branch, Congress, the private sector, and the WTO and its  members. My observations are based on a series of studies that we  initiated at the request of this Committee and of the Senate Committee on  Finance. That work has included a comprehensive analysis of China\u2019s  commitments, our survey and interviews with the private sector  representatives, and our examination of first-year U.S. compliance  efforts.

These negotiations resulted in China\u2019s  commitments to open and liberalize its economy and offer a more  predictable environment for trade and foreign investment in accordance  with WTO rules. The United States and other WTO members have stated  that China\u2019s membership in the WTO provides increased opportunities for  foreign companies seeking access to China\u2019s market. The United States is  one of the largest sources of foreign investment in China, and total  merchandise trade between China and the United States exceeded $145  billion in 2002, according to U.S. trade data. However, the United States  still maintains a trade deficit with China: Imports from China totaled  $124.8 billion, while exports totaled $20.6 billion in 2002. Through the first  half of 2003, exports to and imports from China grew about 25 percent  compared to same period in the previous year.", "The U.S. government\u2019s efforts to ensure China\u2019s compliance with its WTO  commitments are part of an overall U.S. structure to monitor and enforce  foreign governments\u2019 compliance with existing trade agreements. At least  17 federal agencies, led by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR), are involved in these overall monitoring and enforcement  activities. USTR and the departments of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce,  and State have relatively broad roles and primary responsibilities with  respect to trade agreement monitoring and enforcement. Other agencies,  such as the departments of the Treasury and Labor, play more specialized  roles. Federal monitoring and enforcement efforts are coordinated  through an interagency mechanism comprising several management- and  staff-level committees and subcommittees. The congressional structure for  funding and overseeing federal monitoring and enforcement activities is  similarly complex, because it involves multiple committees of jurisdiction.  Congressional agencies, including GAO, and commissions also support  Congress\u2019s oversight on China-WTO trade issues. In addition to the  executive branch and congressional structures, multiple private sector  advisory committees exist to provide federal agencies with policy and  technical advice on trade matters, including trade agreement monitoring  and enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Complexity of China\u2019s WTO Commitments Present Challenges for Ensuring Compliance", "paragraphs": ["China\u2019s accession agreement is the most comprehensive of any WTO  member\u2019s to date, and, as such, verifying China\u2019s WTO compliance is a  challenging undertaking for two main reasons.

Within these eight broad areas, we identified nearly 700 individual  commitments that China must implement to comply with its WTO  obligations. China has also committed to lower a variety of market access  barriers to foreign goods. These obligations include commitments to  reduce or eliminate tariffs on more than 7,000 products and eliminate  nontariff barriers on about 600 of these products.

In particular, the executive branch  emphasized problems in agriculture, services, and intellectual property  rights, as well as a crosscutting concern about transparency.

As a result, foreign businesses will be unable to fully  integrate import, export, and distribution systems until that time.  Additionally, although market access for most goods and services will be  phased in by 2007, some tariffs will not be fully liberalized until 2010.

On the one hand, some of China\u2019s WTO  obligations require specific actions from China, such as reporting  particular information to the WTO, or lowering a tariff on a product.  Assessing compliance with these specific types of commitments is  relatively easy. On the other hand, a significant number of commitments  are more general in nature and relate to systemic changes in China\u2019s trade  regime. For example, some commitments of this type require China to  adhere to general WTO principles of nondiscrimination and transparency.  Determining compliance with these more general types of commitments is  more difficult and can complicate the dialogue over achieving compliance.", "It is useful to note that many private sector representatives told us that  implementing these general types of commitments, such as those that  relate to the rule of law, was relatively more important than carrying out  specific commitments to increase market access and liberalize foreign  investment in China. Specifically, China\u2019s commitments in the areas of  transparency of laws, regulations, and practices; intellectual property  rights; and consistent application of laws, regulations, and practices  emerged as the most important areas of China\u2019s accession agreement in  our September 2002 survey of and interviews with U.S. companies  operating in China.
