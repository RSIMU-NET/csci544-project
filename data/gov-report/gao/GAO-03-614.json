IRS is now carrying out the National Research Program (NRP), through which IRS auditors are reviewing about 47,000 randomly selected tax year 2001 individual tax returns. In June 2002, GAO reported that NRP was necessary, that its design was sound, and that it appeared to meet IRS's goals of acquiring useful compliance data while minimizing burden on taxpayers with returns in the sample. GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of NRP.

Additionally, as the graphic illustrates, IRS is currently nearing the completion of casebuilding and has made progress in classifying NRP returns. Audits, when required, began in November 2002. As of the end of March 2003, IRS had closed 3,651 NRP cases. In accordance with IRS's plans to minimize burden on taxpayers with returns in the NRP sample, some cases have been closed without any taxpayer contact or with only limited audits. The NRP plan recognized that the initial estimates for the overall NRP sample size and the number of returns to be audited were uncertain because they were based on aging data. The overall NRP sample size will be smaller and IRS officials expect to conduct more face-to face audits than initially estimated. As IRS completes NRP casebuilding, classification, and audits, it is implementing quality assurance steps, including efforts to ensure that key audit steps are completed on all NRP audits before they are formally closed with taxpayers. This is important since the data collected from each NRP audit represent information from thousands of similar taxpayers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Understanding taxpayers\u2019 compliance with the nation\u2019s tax laws is critical  to the ability of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to improve the  effectiveness of its programs to enforce and promote voluntary  compliance.

This means that a large and  growing number of IRS enforcement audits are directed at compliant  taxpayers. IRS needs more current data on compliance to be able to  appropriately target audits to problem returns. IRS last studied voluntary  compliance with random audits of tax year 1988 tax returns.

Specially  trained IRS agents then review the approximately 47,000 returns in the  NRP sample and their supporting casebuilding files and identify lines on  the returns that cannot be verified without auditing the taxpayers\u2014a  process called classification. With this approach, some taxpayers will not  be contacted at all and most others will be asked to verify only some of the  line items on their returns.", "In June 2002, we reported to you our assessment of IRS\u2019s NRP plans. At  that time we determined that NRP was necessary and that its design  addressed both the need for up-to-date information on taxpayer  compliance and IRS\u2019s goal of minimizing the burden NRP imposed on  taxpayers. We also reported that IRS had important casebuilding and  classification procedures testing to complete, as well as selection and  training of IRS personnel to carry out the program.

We reported  in June 2002 that NRP\u2019s design, if implemented as planned, is likely to  yield the sort of detailed information that IRS needs to measure overall  compliance, develop formulas to select likely noncompliant returns for  audit, and identify compliance problems for the agency to address.

Classifiers place NRP returns into one of four categories:  (1) accepted as filed, (2) accepted with adjustments, (3) correspondence  audit, and (4) face-to-face audit. If the casebuilding material allows IRS to  verify all of the information that a taxpayer reported on his or her tax  return, then the taxpayer will not be contacted and the return will be  classified as accepted as filed. On returns where minor adjustments are  necessary, the adjustments will be recorded for research purposes, but the  taxpayers will not be contacted. These returns will be classified as  accepted with adjustments. NRP returns that have one or two items from a  specified list requiring examination will be classified for correspondence  audits. All other NRP returns for which the casebuilding material does not  enable IRS to independently verify the information reported on the returns  will be classified for face-to-face audits.", "NRP audits will take place either through correspondence with the  taxpayers or through face-to-face audits. When classifiers determine that  an NRP return will be sent for a correspondence audit, IRS will request  that the taxpayer send documentation verifying the line items in question.  To ensure accurate and consistent data collection, NRP audits will address  all issues identified by classifiers and will not be focused only on  substantial issues or cases for which there is a reasonable likelihood of  collecting unpaid taxes, according to IRS officials.

IRS  used the preliminary results of both of these tests to estimate NRP  classification outcomes and to evaluate the effectiveness of NRP training.

NRP staff members reviewed the  classifiers\u2019 results and found that, overall, the results of this NRP  simulation were positive. They found that the classifiers understood the  NRP approach to classification but that there were instances where the  classifiers overlooked some of the issues indicated by the casebuilding  materials or made other errors.", "In September 2002, IRS conducted another test of the NRP classification  process immediately following the initial training session using final  classification training materials. As we recommended in our June 2002  report, IRS had NRP classifiers classify previously audited tax returns in  order to compare classifiers\u2019 results with the results of actual audits.  Twenty-two newly trained classifiers classified 44 previously audited  returns, with each return classified by 5 different classifiers. All of the  earlier audits resulted in some changes. NRP staff members then  compared the classifiers\u2019 results with those of the other classifiers and  with the results of the earlier audits. NRP officials reported that the test  showed that about three-fourths of the time the trained NRP classifiers  were able to identify issues where noncompliance was found through an  audit.", "IRS used preliminary results of these tests to identify and implement  improvements to NRP. For example, NRP staff members noticed early in  the course of the second test that NRP classifiers were failing to classify  some line items in accordance with NRP guidelines. Trainers reiterated the  importance of following the classification guidelines for these items. NRP  staff members also saw that the format of the form that classifiers were to  use to record their classification decisions made it easy to make mistakes.  They revised the form to make decision recording less error-prone. IRS  also used these tests to identify the need for more stringent classification  review guidelines than initially planned in order to ensure that classifiers  understand and follow the classification guidelines.", "IRS did not finish analysis and documentation of the NRP simulation and  assessment and the classification process test until after the beginning of  classification in IRS area offices.

For example, NRP guidelines call for classifiers to  identify large, unusual, or questionable items on returns (the largest EQMS  error category) and NRP auditors must address all classified items.   However, IRS did not implement its earlier plan of having a selected cadre  of auditors work only on NRP cases. While NRP-specific training will serve  to prevent many audit errors, NRP audits are now being conducted by a  cross section of auditors from IRS field offices across the country and  more typical of the auditors who generated the 2002 EQMS error rates.  Because every return in the NRP sample represents many returns in the  whole population of 1040 filers, even a small number of cases closed with  incomplete information could affect the accuracy of NRP data.", "IRS officials also noted that their plan to conduct early reviews of NRP  cases will identify problems with auditors\u2019 understanding of NRP and help  to keep them from recurring on subsequent NRP audits. At least two of  each NRP auditor\u2019s early cases will have extensive manager involvement  while the cases are still in progress, and other managers will be looking at  a sample of both completed and open cases to identify problems.

IRS officials reported that, as of early April 2003, the NRP database and  related programs were running and that completed NRP cases were being  entered into the database.

IRS officials also intend  to compare classification decisions with the results of NRP audits to  identify ways of improving the classification process for future rounds of  NRP. Moreover, IRS\u2019s intent in carrying out NRP is to reduce the burden  on taxpayers in general by developing better audit selection formulas and  reducing the number of audits of fully compliant taxpayers.", "The NRP casebuilding and classification processes described on page 4  are having their intended effect of reducing the burden NRP creates for  taxpayers with returns in the NRP sample. IRS has assembled IRS and  third-party data on most of the returns in the NRP sample and classifiers  have used these data to verify information on the returns, where possible,  without contacting taxpayers. The remaining casebuilding and  classification work was under way as of the end of March 2003. The  material in the casebuilding files has allowed IRS to fully verify about 10  percent of NRP returns without any audit. Classifiers were able to use the  casebuilding material to verify all but one or two items on another 5  percent of NRP returns, and these were sent for correspondence audits.", "Classifiers identified line items needing verification through a face-to-face  audit on about 85 percent of NRP returns classified as of the end of March  2003. Because of the casebuilding and classification processes IRS  developed for NRP, these audits will generally be limited to line items that  cannot be verified using the information in the casebuilding files. This is a  substantial change from earlier compliance research efforts, in which all  returns were subject to audits of every line on the return. Only the 1,683  taxpayers with returns selected for NRP calibration audits will be subject  to complete audits of their returns.", "IRS plans to use NRP results to improve future iterations of NRP. For  example, NRP officials plan to compare classification outcomes with NRP  audit results to help them to identify possible changes needed in  casebuilding materials and the NRP classification process. They have told  us that it may be possible to further reduce the number of accurately  reported line items that are subject to compliance research audits. On the  other hand, IRS may also find through NRP calibration audits that  classification missed many items that should have been audited, so more  line items should receive some form of audit in future rounds of NRP in  order for the research results to be useful.  IRS also intends to apply  lessons learned in NRP classification to classification in the enforcement  audit environment.", "As we noted in our prior report, NRP should also lead to reductions in  taxpayer burden in general. IRS plans to use NRP results to help identify  and reduce causes of noncompliance and to better target enforcement  audits to noncompliant taxpayers, reducing the number of audits of fully  compliant taxpayers. IRS projects that, without improved audit selection  formulas based on NRP results, the percentage of enforcement audits that  result in no tax change will be about 35 percent higher in 2005 than it was  in 1993, the first year that selection formulas from the 1988 compliance  study were available.

According to IRS  officials, when they applied the NRP sampling plan to the 2001 filing  population, the number of returns necessary to satisfy the requirements  for some of the NRP strata declined because filing rates for those strata  were smaller than IRS officials had projected.

Our 2002 report on NRP also noted  the preliminary nature of these estimates. Initial classification breakdown  estimates were made using 14-year-old data from the 1988 Taxpayer  Compliance Measurement Program study. NRP staff members said that  changes in the tax code and in the economic makeup of the filing  population since the 1988 study make the returns from that study an  unreliable tool for predicting NRP classification results, though that was  all they had to work with.", "They also said that some of the change can be attributed to changes they  made in the final form of NRP classification guidelines. NRP staff  members said that they modified the NRP classification guidelines as a  result of discussions that took place between NRP staff members and  representatives from IRS\u2019s business operating divisions. They instituted  the changes to the classification guidelines in order to better match the  training and skills of the examiners selected to conduct NRP  correspondence and face-to-face audits with the types of issues to be  covered by those audits. One change is that discrepancies between the  casebuilding files and the tax returns for issues such as Individual  Retirement Account contributions and Social Security income were  removed from the list of issues that could be verified through a  correspondence audit.
