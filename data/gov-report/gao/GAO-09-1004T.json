To identify whether there are continuing indications of fraud and abuse related to controlled substances paid for by Medicaid, we obtained and analyzed Medicaid claims paid in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 from five states: California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, and Texas. To identify indications of fraud and abuse related to controlled substances paid for by Medicaid, we obtained and analyzed Medicaid prescription claims data for these five states from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). To identify other potential fraud and improper payments, we compared the beneficiary and prescriber shown on the Medicaid claims to the Death Master Files (DMF) from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify deceased beneficiaries and prescribers. To identify claims that were improperly processed and paid by the Medicaid program because the federal government banned these prescribers and pharmacies from prescribing or dispensing to Medicaid beneficiaries, we compared the Medicaid prescription claims to the exclusion and debarment files from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS OIG) and the General Services Administration (GSA). To develop specific case study examples in selected states, we identified 25 cases that illustrate the types of fraudulent, improper, or abusive controlled substance activity we found in the Medicaid program. To develop these cases, we interviewed pharmacies, prescribers, law enforcement officials, and beneficiaries, as appropriate, and also obtained and reviewed registration and enforcement action reports from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and HHS. To identify the effectiveness of internal controls that the federal government and selected states have in place to prevent and detect fraud and abuse related to controlled substances, we interviewed Medicaid officials from the selected state offices and CMS. More details on our scope and methodology can be found in our report that we issued today. We conducted this forensic audit from July 2008 to September 2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Nevertheless, Medicaid approved the claims at a cost of approximately $2.3 million. The offenses that led to their exclusion from federal health programs included Medicaid fraud and illegal diversion of controlled substances. Our analysis of matching Medicaid claims in the selected states with SSA's DMF found that controlled substance prescription claims to over 1,800 beneficiaries were filled after they died. Even though the selected state programs stated that beneficiaries were promptly removed from Medicaid following their deaths based on either SSA DMF matches or third party information, these same state programs paid over $200,000 for controlled substances during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for postdeath controlled substance prescription claims. In addition, our analysis also found that Medicaid paid about $500,000 in Medicaid claims based on controlled substance prescriptions \"written\" by over 1,200 doctors after they died. In addition to performing the aggregate-level analysis discussed above, we also performed in-depth investigations for 25 cases of fraudulent or abusive actions related to the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances through the Medicaid program in the selected states. We have referred certain cases to DEA and the selected states for further investigation. The selected states did not have a comprehensive fraud prevention framework to prevent fraud and abuse of controlled substances paid for by Medicaid. The establishment of effective fraud prevention controls by the selected states is critical because the very nature of a beneficiary's medical need--to quickly obtain controlled substances to alleviate pain or treat a serious medical condition--makes the Medicaid program vulnerable to those attempting to obtain money or drugs they are not entitled to receive. Fraud prevention is the most efficient and effective means to minimize fraud, waste, and abuse. Thus, controls that prevent fraudulent health care providers and individuals from entering the Medicaid program or submitting claims are the most important element in an effective fraud prevention program. Effective fraud prevention controls require that where appropriate, organizations enter into data-sharing arrangements with organizations to perform validation. System edit checks (i.e., built-in electronic controls) are also crucial in identifying and rejecting fraudulent enrollment applications or claims before payments are disbursed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drug abuse is a serious and growing public health problem.

There are reports and allegations that  criminals and drug abusers are able to illegitimately acquire controlled  substances by filing fraudulent Medicaid claims, seeking treatment from  medical practitioners for feigned injuries and illnesses, and perpetrating  other fraudulent activities. The cost associated with controlled substance  fraud and abuse is more than the cost of prescription drug purchases since  there are related medical services, such as doctor and emergency room  visits, which precede the dispensing of these medications. Several closed  criminal cases highlight Medicaid fraud and abuse related to controlled  substances.", "An Ohio physician was convicted in 2006 for filing $60 million in  fraudulent Medicaid, Medicare, and other insurance claims. The  physician, a pain management specialist, prescribed multiple injections  of controlled substances for his patients. He then billed Medicaid and  other insurance plans for those treatments. The physician was found to  have fostered an addiction to controlled substances in his patients so  that he could profit from their habit and increase the income he  received from their medical claims. Two patients who regularly saw  him died under his care; one from a multiple-drug overdose in the  physician\u2019s office and one from an overdose of OxyContin taken on the  same day that the prescription was written. The physician was  sentenced to life imprisonment.", "In 2006, a Florida physician was sentenced to life in prison following  his conviction on multiple charges, including wire fraud, illegal  distribution of controlled substances, and Medicaid fraud. The  physician, a general practitioner, wrote excessive prescriptions to  patients for controlled substances without giving them physical  examinations or additional follow-up treatments. The physician  directed patients to have their prescriptions filled at specific  pharmacies and warned them against filling their prescriptions at  pharmacies that would ask too many questions about the quantity and  combination of controlled substances prescribed. In fact, the physician  was found to have known some of his patients were addicts feeding  their drug habits. Five of his patients died from taking drugs he  prescribed.", "During 2004 to 2005, a pharmacist created false telephone  prescriptions for Vicodin, an addictive narcotic pain reliever that  combines hydrocodone and acetaminophen, and provided thousands  of the pills to at least two purported customers. The pharmacist also  submitted false claims for the drugs to Medicaid and other insurance  companies stating that they were prescribed for legitimate patients.  The customers were actually friends of the pharmacist who sold the  drugs and split the profits with him. In 2009, the pharmacist was  convicted of health care fraud, Medicaid fraud, and distribution of  dangerous controlled substances.", "My statement summarizes our report issued today to your subcommittee.

In some cases, beneficiaries may have a justifiable reason for receiving  prescriptions from multiple medical practitioners, such as visiting  specialists or several doctors in the same medical group. However, our  analysis of Medicaid claims found at least 400 of them visited 21 to 112  medical practitioners and up to 46 different pharmacies for the same  controlled substance.

We have  referred certain cases to DEA and the selected states for further  investigation. The following provides illustrative detailed information on  four cases we investigated:    Case 1: The beneficiary used the identity of an individual who was  killed in 1980 to receive Medicaid benefits. According to a state  Medicaid official, he originally applied for Medicaid assistance in a  California county in January 2004. During the application process, the  man provided a Social Security card to a county official. When the  county verified the Social Security Number (SSN) with SSA, SSA  responded that the SSN was not valid. The county enrolled the  beneficiary into Medicaid provisionally for 90 days under the condition  that the beneficiary resolve the SSN discrepancy with SSA within that  time frame. Although the beneficiary never resolved the issue, he  remained in the Medicaid program until April 2007. Between 2004 and  2007, the Medicaid program paid over $200,000 in medical services for  this beneficiary, including at least $2,870 for controlled substances that  he received from the pharmacies. We attempted to locate the  beneficiary but could not find him.", "Case 2: The physician prescribed controlled substances to the  beneficiary after she died in February 2006. The physician stated that  the beneficiary had been dying of a terminal disease and became  unable to come into the office to be examined. The physician stated  that in instances where a patient is compliant and needs pain  medication, physicians will sometimes prescribe it without requiring  an examination. A pharmacy eventually informed the physician that  the patient had died and the patient\u2019s spouse had continued to pick up  her prescriptions for Methadone, Klonopin, and Xanax after her death.  According to the pharmacy staff, the only reason they became aware  of the situation was because an acquaintance of the spouse noticed  him picking up prescriptions for a wife who had died months ago. The  acquaintance informed the pharmacy staff of the situation. They  subsequently contacted the prescribing physician. Since this incident,  the pharmacy informed us that it has not filled another prescription for  the deceased beneficiary.", "Case 3: A mother with a criminal history and Ritalin addiction used  her child as a means to doctor shop for Ritalin and other similar  controlled stimulants used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD). Although the child received overlapping  prescriptions of methylphenidate and amphetamine medications  during a 2-year period and was banned (along with his mother) from at  least three medical practices, the Illinois Medicaid program never  placed the beneficiary on a restricted recipient program. Such a move  would have restricted the child to a single primary care physician or  pharmacy, thus preventing him (and his mother) from doctor  shopping. Over the course of 21 months, the Illinois Medicaid program  paid for 83 prescriptions of ADHD controlled stimulants for the  beneficiary, which totaled approximately 90,000 mg and cost $6,600.", "Case 4: Claims indicated that a deceased physician \u201cwrote\u201d controlled  substance prescriptions for several patients in the Houston area. Upon  further analysis, we discovered that the actual prescriptions were  signed by a physician assistant who once worked under the  supervision of the deceased physician. The pharmacy neglected to  update its records and continued filling prescriptions under the name  of the deceased prescriber. The physician assistant has never been a  DEA registrant. The physician assistant told us that the supervising  physicians always signed prescriptions for controlled substances.

CMS has provided limited guidance to the states on how  to improve the state\u2019s control measures to prevent fraud and abuse of  controlled substances in the Medicaid program. Thus, for the five state  programs we reviewed, we found different levels of fraud prevention  controls. For example, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of  1990 encourages states to establish a drug utilization review (DUR)  program. The main emphasis of the program is to promote patient safety  through an increased review and awareness of prescribed drugs. States  receive increased federal funding if they design and install a point-of-sale  electronic prescription claims management system to interact with their  Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS), each state\u2019s Medicaid  computer system. Each state was given considerable flexibility on how to  identify prescription problems, such as therapeutic duplication and  overprescribing by providers, and how to use the MMIS system to prevent  such problems. The level of screening, if any, states perform varies  because CMS does not set minimum requirements for the types of reviews  or edits that are to be conducted on controlled substances. Thus, one state  required prior approval when ADHD treatments like Ritalin and Adderall  are prescribed outside age limitations, while another state had no such  controlled substance requirement at the time of our review.", "Under the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, CMS is required to  initiate a Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) to combat Medicaid fraud,  waste, and abuse. DRA requires CMS to enter into contracts with  Medicaid Integrity Contractors (MIC) to review provider actions, audit  provider claims and identify overpayments, and conduct provider  education. To date, CMS has awarded umbrella contracts to several  contractors to perform the functions outlined above. According to CMS,  these contractors cover 40 states, 5 territories, and the District of  Columbia. CMS officials stated that CMS will award task orders to cover  the rest of the country by the end of fiscal year 2009. CMS officials stated  that MIC audits are currently under way in 19 states. CMS officials stated  that most of the MIP reviews will focus on Medicaid providers and that the  state Medicaid programs handle beneficiary fraud. Because the Medicaid  program covers a full range of health care services and the prescription  costs associated with controlled substances are relatively small, the extent  to which MICs will focus on controlled substances is likely to be relatively  minimal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Lack Comprehensive Fraud Prevention Framework for Controlled Substances", "paragraphs": ["The selected states did not have a comprehensive fraud prevention  framework to prevent fraud and abuse of controlled substances paid for  by Medicaid.

Instead of these drugs being used for legitimate  purposes, these drugs may be used to support controlled substance  addictions and sale of the drugs on the street. As shown in figure 1 below,  a well-designed fraud prevention system (which can also be used to  prevent waste and abuse) should consist of three crucial elements: (1)  preventive controls, (2) detection and monitoring, and (3) investigations  and prosecutions.

Officials from all five selected states said that they  do not screen prescribing providers or pharmacies against the federal  debarment list, also known as the Excluded Parties List System  (EPLS). Further, officials from four states said when a pharmacy claim  is received, they do not check to see if the prescribing provider was  excluded by HHS OIG from participating in the Medicaid program.", "Drug Utilization Review: As mentioned earlier, states perform drug  utilization reviews (DUR) and other controls during the prescription  claims process to promote patient safety, reduce costs, and prevent  fraud and abuse. The drug utilization reviews include prospective  screening and edits for potentially inappropriate drug therapies, such  as over-utilization, drug-drug interaction, or therapeutic duplication.  In addition, selected states also require health care providers to submit  prior authorization forms for certain drug prescriptions because those  medications have public health concerns or are considered high risk  for fraud and abuse. Each state has developed its DUR differently and  some of the differences that we saw from the selected states include  the following.", "Officials from certain states stated that they use the  prospective screening (e.g., over-utilization or overlapping  controlled substance prescriptions) as an automatic denial  of the prescription, while other states generally use the  prospective screening as more of an advisory tool for  pharmacies.", "The types of drugs that require prior authorization vary  greatly between the selected states. In states where it is  used, health care providers may be required to obtain prior  authorization if a specific brand name is prescribed (e.g.,  OxyContin) or if a dosage exceeds a predetermined amount  for a therapeutic class of controlled substances (e.g.,  hypnotics, narcotics).", "Detection and Monitoring: Even with effective preventive controls,  there is risk that fraud and abuse will occur in Medicaid regarding  controlled substances. States must continue their efforts to monitor the  execution of the prescription program, including periodically matching  their beneficiary files to third-party databases to determine continued  eligibility, monitor controlled substance prescriptions to identify abuse,  and make necessary corrective actions, including the following:    Checking Death Files: After enrolling beneficiaries, Medicaid offices  in the selected states generally did not periodically compare their  information against death records.", "Increasing the Use of the Restricted Recipient Program: In the  course of drug utilization reviews or audits, the State Medicaid offices  may identify beneficiaries who have abused or defrauded the Medicaid  prescription drug program and restrict them to one health care  provider or one pharmacy to receive the prescriptions.

According to a selected state official, people  would sometimes cross state borders to obtain prescription  drugs in a state without a program.", "Investigations and prosecutions: Another element of a fraud  prevention program is the aggressive investigation and prosecution of  individuals who defraud the federal government. Prosecuting perpetrators  sends the message that the government will not tolerate individuals  stealing money and serves as a preventive measure. Schemes identified  through investigations and prosecution also can be used to improve the  fraud prevention program.
