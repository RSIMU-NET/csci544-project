Payments to communities at the Hanford and Savannah River sites accounted for approximately 70 percent of that total, while payments to six sites combined accounted for less than 5 percent. Total PILT payments have more than doubled since 1994, primarily because of growth in payments to communities at the Hanford and Savannah River sites and because communities at other sites began receiving payments since 1994.", "DOE intentionally allows for variations of payments across sites so that payments may reflect the revenues communities would have received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the condition in which it was acquired, which DOE officials stated is a goal of PILT. However, DOE's PILT order's lack of requirements has limited DOE's ability to provide adequate assurance that payments consistently meet this and other PILT goals. The PILT order does not require documentation of the key determinants that went into the calculation of payments, or an independent review process to determine whether payment calculations are consistent with PILT goals. The PILT order also lacks specificity about payment determinations in certain scenarios.

Once acquired by the federal government, such  property was not subject to state or local property taxes. The Atomic  Energy Act, as amended, authorizes DOE to make payments in lieu of  taxes (PILT) that would have been payable to communities if these  properties had remained subject to state or local taxes. The goal of PILT,  as stated in the act and reflected in DOE\u2019s order implementing the act, is  to render financial assistance to these communities, while generally not  making payments in excess of the taxes that would have been payable  for the property in the condition in which it was acquired. An additional  goal of PILT, according to DOE officials we met with, is to compensate  communities for the revenue they would have received if the property had  remained on the tax rolls.

At that time,  we found that, as DOE revised PILT policies over time, DOE had applied  different criteria to determine payments for different communities,  depending on when communities applied for PILT. To address concerns  about inequities resulting from the application of different criteria to  different communities, DOE had revised its PILT policy in 1993 to apply  more consistent criteria across PILT. We noted that this revision  addressed some communities\u2019 concerns about inequities because newer  PILT applicants were no longer subject to stricter criteria, and that PILT  payments would likely increase. We also concluded that because communities hosting about 78 percent of DOE property were not eligible  for PILT and the changes could increase payments to some PILT  recipients, some might view the changes as contributing to further  disparities.

The  communities calculate their estimated payments and then communicate  their requested payment amounts in annual invoices to DOE. DOE does  not prescribe the use of a particular formula by communities seeking  payments. However, DOE officials noted that communities usually base  the calculations they use to develop their annual PILT invoices on  property taxes and that they generally calculate these using a relatively  standard formula. Key information in this calculation includes the amount  of land, its estimated value, assessment ratio, and the property tax rate  (see figure 6).", "Differences in PILT payments to different sites are generally not a  function of variations in the payment formula, but rather of variations  among the inputs into the formula, although DOE has sometimes altered  payments in other ways. Based on our analysis of PILT payments in fiscal  year 2017, we found that values of property, assessment ratios, and  property tax rates vary across DOE sites and communities. The assessed  value of the property is partially determined by characteristics, or history,  of the property and market conditions. State and local tax policies may  determine both the assessment ratio and the property tax rate.", "Characteristics of the property. The amount of PILT eligible  property and its classification are factors that partially determine  payment amounts. DOE provides the highest payments to  communities at sites with the greatest amount of eligible acreage\u2014the  Hanford, Savannah River, and Oak Ridge sites. Similarly, lower  acreage at some sites usually results in lower payments. For  example, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Fernald Plant are  among the smallest sites and payments to these communities are  among the smallest. In addition, the land use classification of the  property, such as whether it was used for agricultural or commercial  purposes when it was acquired, influences its value. Some  classifications of land tend to have higher market values than others;  for example, commercial land generally has a higher value than  agricultural land. The land at the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory site,  located in western Pennsylvania, is classified as commercial property  and was valued in 2017 for PILT purposes at an average of $64,476  per acre. As a result, although Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory has  among the smallest acreage of any site\u2014at approximately 200  acres\u2014its payments are the fifth highest. In contrast, the land at the  Pantex site, located in the Texas Panhandle, is classified as  agricultural and homestead property and was valued in 2017 for PILT  purposes at an average of $976 per acre.", "Market conditions. The market value of property varies across PILT  sites as a result of local market conditions. Greater demand for land  contributes to higher per-acre values than when there is less demand  for land. This contributes to variations among land values, even within  a given classification, for the communities\u2019 annual PILT invoices to  DOE. For example, irrigable agricultural land at Benton County\u2014one  of the communities that hosts the Hanford site\u2014was valued at about  $6,500 per acre in 2017, which DOE and county officials attributed  primarily to high demand for agricultural property in Washington  State\u2019s Columbia Valley River Basin. In contrast, Carson County\u2014 which hosts the Pantex Plant and is in a region with lower farm real  estate values and is not near a major city\u2014valued its land at $976 per  acre in 2017, as previously noted.", "State and local tax policies. Some states and counties reduce  assessment ratios for certain types of property, such as agricultural  property. For example, the assessed value of the property is reduced  to a fraction of its market value. Some communities have reflected  these assessment ratios in their calculations for their annual PILT  invoices to DOE. Because assessment ratios can vary widely across  locations\u2014from 6 percent to 100 percent among communities that  received PILT payments in fiscal year 2017\u2014they can create large  variations in PILT payments. For example, the communities at the  Oak Ridge site assess agricultural property at 25 percent of the full  market value, which they reflect in their annual PILT invoices to DOE.  On the other hand, the Town of Brookhaven, which hosts Brookhaven  National Laboratory, applied a 90 percent assessment ratio to its  PILT-eligible property, which is categorized as residential. In addition,  tax rates vary across communities. For example, in fiscal year 2017,  the City of Oak Ridge applied a 2.5 percent tax rate to determine its  payments; whereas, Carson County applied a 0.6 percent tax rate.", "DOE\u2019s PILT order requires DOE to deduct from PILT payments an  amount equal to any payments by the federal government that will be  used by the community for the same, identifiable, discrete purpose.

This limited assurance that payments meet PILT goals may be in  part a result of deficiencies in DOE\u2019s internal controls for PILT. Based on  our reviews of PILT documentation and interviews with DOE officials, we  identified cases in which payments did not appear to meet the stated  PILT goal of compensating communities for the revenue they would have  received if the property had remained on the tax rolls. Specifically, we  identified five examples of payments potentially not meeting goals as a  result of issues with: property classification, determination of land value,  application of state tax adjustments, payment deductions, and payment  adjustments.", "Property classification. We identified a case in which payments  appear to be higher than the amount communities would have  received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the condition in  which it was acquired. In the case of Benton County, the property  classification that forms the basis of its requested PILT payments  does not appear to be based on the classification of the property  when it was acquired. Benton County\u2019s original PILT agreement from  1996 shows that, when acquired, Hanford property in the county was  classified as 11 percent farmland and 88 percent rangeland.  However, the agreement also states that, considering uses of the land  at the time of the agreement, 72 percent of the land would be treated  for the purpose of PILT as farmland in the category of \u201cirrigable land\u201d  and only 27 percent as rangeland. In 2017, irrigable land in Benton  County was valued at $6,495 per acre whereas rangeland was valued  at $410 per acre\u2014higher percentages of irrigable land compared to  rangeland therefore result in higher payments. Using these land  classifications is inconsistent with the PILT goal that payments will not  exceed the taxes that would have been payable for the property in the  condition in which it was acquired. DOE headquarters officials we  spoke with were not aware of this discrepancy in Benton County\u2019s  property classification. In addition, DOE did not have documentation  to explain DOE\u2019s decision, but an Office of the General Counsel  official noted that DOE agreed to these terms as part of a settlement  agreement at a time when a number of issues, beyond just PILT  issues, were in dispute between Benton County and DOE. Because of  this inconsistency in land classifications, it appears that Benton  County\u2019s payments may not have reflected the revenues the county  would have received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the  condition in which it was acquired. Had DOE maintained more  thorough documentation and had there been independent review of  PILT invoices, these higher payments might have been avoided.", "Determination of land value. We identified one case in which  payments were not clearly linked to the revenue communities would  have received if the property had remained on the tax rolls.  Specifically, DOE negotiated with Savannah River Site counties to  apply a dollar amount per acre that is not directly tied to assessed  property values. DOE and the counties originally negotiated values in  1988 of $1,000 per acre for Aiken and Barnwell and $426 for  Allendale counties. Those amounts remained flat until 2007, when  DOE agreed to adjust them with a \u201ctime value of money\u201d factor to  $1,641 and $712 respectively. According to county officials, the  counties and DOE agreed to use a negotiated rate rather than a rate  based on current assessment values partly because of the difficulty of  conducting appraisals because of the large amount of land, lack of  comparable properties, and the high expense of an appraisal.  Because of this reliance on a negotiated, rather than assessed value,  it is unclear whether these payments reflect the revenues the counties  would have received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the  condition in which it was acquired. Had DOE required independent  review of key determinants of PILT payments, this deviation from  using assessed values might have been avoided.", "Application of tax relief programs. We identified a third case in  which payments may have been higher than the revenue communities  would have received if the property had remained on the tax rolls.  With regard to the Hanford Site, the Open Space Taxation Act of  Washington State is a tax relief program that community officials said  allows assessment ratios of about 40 percent to be applied for land  that is being used for agriculture or as rangeland. In the past, none  of the three counties that receive PILT at the Hanford site applied  special assessment ratios under this tax relief program in calculating  PILT payments. Hanford site officials informed us that they were  aware of this tax law and requested that the three counties at the  Hanford site apply it. The DOE officials explained that the counties  refused because DOE was not using those lands for agriculture or  rangeland. The officials stated that the counties at Hanford decided  that DOE did not meet the purpose and the terms of the program.  However, if the land had remained on the tax rolls in the condition in  which it was acquired, it could also be assumed that it might have  been farmed or used as rangeland, in which case the counties may  have applied the special assessment ratios. Although DOE\u2019s order  does not state whether PILT payments should take into account such  tax relief programs, failure to take such programs into account may  have resulted in DOE paying the counties at Hanford more than they  would have received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the  condition in which it was acquired, contrary to the order. If DOE\u2019s PILT  order had included more specificity about how tax relief programs  should be addressed, DOE might have had greater assurance that  these payments were not higher than the revenue the communities  would have received had the property remained on the tax rolls in the  condition in which it was acquired.", "Payment deductions. We identified a case in which it was unclear  whether payments aligned with PILT goals. DOE has provided non- PILT funding to Los Alamos public schools and the Los Alamos fire  department. According to DOE officials, DOE has annually provided  $8 million to the county\u2019s schools; DOE provided over $20 million for  the county\u2019s fiscal year 2020 firefighting services. DOE also  provides PILT funding to Los Alamos County, which was $244,183 in  fiscal year 2017. About a decade ago, DOE considered whether it  should stop making PILT payments to Los Alamos County because of  its other support for the community and the provision in the PILT order  requiring deductions from PILT for other payments by the federal  government that will be used for the same identifiable, discrete  purpose. However, DOE has decided to continue paying Los  Alamos County PILT. The county\u2019s position is that the schools are a  separate entity from the county government and that its payments  should not be reduced to account for amounts received directly by the  schools, but in 2017 the county nonetheless reduced its PILT request  by the amount it would have provided to Los Alamos schools. It is  unclear how the PILT order should be applied in situations like this  where payments, including PILT payments, are made to multiple  entities. Making continued payments in such a situation, however,  may exacerbate perceptions of inequities across sites. If DOE\u2019s PILT  order had included more specificity about the reduction of payments  to account for other federal payments for the same identifiable,  discrete purpose, DOE might have had greater assurance that these  payments meet PILT goals.", "Payment adjustments. We identified a case in which the PILT  order\u2019s lack of specificity led to uncertainty for PILT payment  recipients when DOE\u2019s payments did not align with the communities\u2019  calculations of what the communities determined they would have  received if the property had remained on the tax rolls. When the PILT  invoices from the three counties at the Hanford Site increased by  about 73 percent in real terms from a total of about $6 million in 2010  to about $10.7 million in 2017, DOE began providing payments that  were lower than what the counties requested in their PILT invoices.  Specifically, in 2017, DOE provided 91 percent of what the counties  requested, and in 2018 DOE provided 65 percent of what they  requested, which DOE officials said was because payment requests  exceeded the amounts set aside for PILT purposes. DOE did not  cite problems in the counties\u2019 PILT invoices or document problems  with the counties\u2019 PILT invoices. Payment adjustments are allowable  under the PILT order\u2014both the Atomic Energy Act and DOE\u2019s PILT  order give DOE discretion as to payment amounts. However, because  the order also lists key determinants for PILT payments that are  based on the taxes communities would have received had they  remained on the tax rolls and because DOE has typically provided  what communities have requested, communities we spoke with said  they began to rely on PILT in their budget formulations. The  communities had developed their budgets based on the assumption  that payments would align with the amounts they determined they  would have received had their property remained on the tax rolls, but  it is now difficult for them to plan ahead with the new uncertainty. In  response to this uncertainty in the payment amount, in 2019, one of  the counties at Hanford\u2014Benton County\u2014provided DOE with a PILT  invoice that was about $5 million lower than the previous year.  According to the county officials we spoke with, the goal of providing a  lower PILT payment invoice was to increase the likelihood that they  would receive the full amount. DOE\u2019s order does not include any  information about under what conditions DOE will adjust payments\u2014 such as if payments calculations are not consistent with PILT payment  determinants\u2014to guide DOE\u2019s oversight. The order also does not  require DOE to document or communicate such information ahead of  time. Had DOE\u2019s PILT order included more specificity on these topics,  communities might have had more clarity regarding whether their  payment calculations were consistent with PILT goals and whether  they were likely to receive the amounts they requested."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["PILT payments help replace tax revenue that communities are no longer  receiving because of DOE\u2019s acquisition of property in their communities.  Our past work reported that DOE allowed different standards for PILT  invoices at different sites, depending on when the community applied for  PILT payments, raising concerns about inequitable treatment of  communities. In 1993, DOE updated its PILT order to address one of  these concerns by eliminating the gross benefits test that had been  applied to new communities. However, some concerns remained. DOE  intentionally allows payments to communities to vary across locations  because property characteristics, market conditions, and tax policies  differ; this variance enables payments to reflect the taxes the  communities would have received if the property had remained on local  tax rolls. However, DOE\u2019s PILT order lacks: (1) requirements for  documenting key determinants of PILT payments in intergovernmental  agreements and invoices, (2) requirements for independent review of  PILT invoices for consistency with agreed-upon bases of payments, and  (3) specificity about payment determinations in certain scenarios. This  has resulted in a relatively hands-off approach to management and  oversight of communities\u2019 annual PILT invoices as well as some  uncertainty about how to determine PILT payments. This is inconsistent  with federal internal-control standards and has limited DOE\u2019s ability to  provide adequate assurance that DOE is meeting PILT goals.

We also interviewed DOE site office officials about  how they expect communities to determine their requested payment  amounts.

During the early 1950s, the site began to produce materials  used in nuclear weapons, primarily tritium and plutonium-239. Five  reactors were built to produce nuclear materials and resulted in unusable  by-products, such as radioactive waste. About 35 million gallons of  radioactive liquid waste are stored in 43 underground tanks. The Defense  Waste Processing Facility is processing the high-activity waste,  encapsulating radioactive elements in borosilicate glass, a stable storage  form.
