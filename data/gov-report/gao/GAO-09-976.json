The notice phase is the first of IRS's three-phase process to collect unpaid debt. IRS annually sends notices to millions of individual taxpayers about billions of dollars of unpaid tax debt. Congress and others have questioned IRS's collection process's effectiveness. As requested, GAO is reporting on (1) how well IRS has established objectives, performance measures, and responsibility for reviewing notice-phase performance, and (2) how well IRS's business rules for sending notices to individuals help assure that the collection notice phase is achieving desired results at the lowest costs. To address these objectives, GAO compared the evidence obtained from IRS documents and responsible IRS collection officials to applicable guidance for internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the notice phase is a key part of IRS's approach and strategy for resolving billions of dollars of individuals' unpaid tax debt, IRS lacks certain internal controls to assure that notices to individuals are achieving the most benefits--such as debt collected or unpaid debt cases otherwise resolved-- with the resources being used. Management controls like clearly defined objectives, performance measures, and clear responsibility for reviewing program performance help provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of an agency are being achieved effectively and efficiently. However, IRS has no documented objectives for the notice phase and no performance measures to indicate how well the phase is performing in resolving debt cases or achieving other potential desired results. Further, IRS has not established responsibility for reviewing the performance of the complete notice phase. IRS lacks documentation for and evaluations of its business rules for notices to individuals to assure that the collection notice phase is achieving desired results. According to IRS officials, to make the best use of collection resources, IRS uses its business rules to--based on certain dollar thresholds and individual tax debt case characteristics--vary the number and types of notices sent to taxpayers and determine whether unresolved cases will be sent for further collection action or further action will be deferred. However, as shown in the table, in almost all cases, for the five business rules that IRS identified as affecting the most taxpayers, IRS did not have information on the date the rules were established, the rationale for the rule, or data supporting the rationale. IRS collection officials also lacked documentation describing the business rules and how they operate. Further, even though IRS officials estimated that the business rules had been established for years, IRS had documentation for an evaluation of only one of the five business rules. Without relevant evaluations IRS lacks assurance that the notice phase achieves desired collection results at the least cost."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must pursue collection of unpaid tax  debt to help ensure compliance and confidence in the tax system and  address the tax gap, which is the estimated difference between tax  amounts that taxpayers voluntarily and timely pay and those they owe. IRS  most recently estimated that $23 billion of the gross tax gap ($345 billion)  for tax year 2001 was for nonpayment of known individual income tax  assessments.", "As we previously reported to you, the first phase of IRS\u2019s complex, three- phase collection process is the notice phase in which taxpayers are mailed  a series of notices informing them of their tax debts and asking for  payment. The notices provide opportunities for taxpayers to pay or  otherwise resolve their debts before their cases are potentially forwarded  to one of the following two phases\u2014the phone and in-person contact  phases\u2014where IRS may take enforcement action such as to levy financial  assets or seize physical property.", "The notice phase provides IRS with an opportunity to maximize  collections while minimizing costs in pursuing individual tax debts.  Notices are computer-generated and mailed to taxpayers with little direct  involvement by IRS employees, a process that minimizes costs. To the  extent that taxpayers then take action to pay or otherwise resolve their  debts, collections can occur with relatively little additional IRS  investment. When individuals with tax debt do not respond to notices, IRS  either takes no action or takes enforcement action through the other two  phases to collect the tax debts. Such enforcement action is more labor- intensive and expensive.", "Even though the notice phase is relatively low cost, opportunities may  exist to improve tax collections though notices sent to individuals. In  fiscal year 2008, IRS issued about 22 million notices to individual  taxpayers, including about 12 million notices involving almost $57 billion  in newly identified unpaid tax debts from multiple tax years. Putting aside  debt amounts that IRS abated or offset with refunds during fiscal year  2008, IRS sent about $40.6 billion in tax debt to the more expensive  collection phases for potential enforcement action compared to around  $5.6 billion that IRS collected.", "Because of your continued concerns about unpaid tax debt and IRS\u2019s  collection processes for individual taxpayers, you asked us to review IRS\u2019s  procedures for sending notices of unpaid tax debt to individual taxpayers.

To assess IRS\u2019s business rules, we asked responsible IRS collection  officials to provide basic information on the key rules that affect the most  individual taxpayers in terms of which notices IRS sends to them. We  assessed the information for both objectives in light of applicable  guidance for federal internal control standards. More detailed information  on our objectives, scope, and methodology are below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS identifies unpaid tax liabilities through its program activities. The  most common include IRS (1) identifying a taxpayer who files a tax return  without fully paying the tax claimed to be owed, (2) adjusting tax liabilities  when filed returns are being processed by IRS by checking for obvious  errors such as those involving adding or subtracting numbers incorrectly  or using the wrong social security number for a claimed dependent,   (3) finding additional tax liabilities by auditing a filed tax return or  computer matching it to third party information on income paid to a  taxpayer, (4) assessing a penalty for some taxpayer action or inaction, and  (5) sending a tax bill to a taxpayer who did not file a required tax return  after IRS estimates, based on available information, how much tax the  person should have paid.", "IRS\u2019s process for collecting identified unpaid debt has three phases. Debt  goes through these phases until it is determined to be uncollectible, is  collected, or is otherwise resolved:    Notice: IRS sends the taxpayer a series of notices of balances due, in part,  to prompt a reply and payment by the taxpayer and handles responses to  those notices.", "Telephone: IRS uses telephone contacts with the taxpayer to prompt  payment or takes enforcement action that may include levying financial  assets or filing a lien against property.  In-person: IRS staff contact the taxpayer to prompt payment or to take  enforcement action, including levies, liens, and seizures of property.", "According to IRS officials, the phases and routing of tax debt-collection  cases result from IRS\u2019s designing the collection process to effectively and  efficiently use resources to resolve taxpayer debt at the earliest possible  time and using the least costly resources. Although data is not readily  available to determine the relative costs and benefits of the notice phase  versus the other phases, given the relatively high automation of the notice  process and relatively low costs of postage compared to the more staff- intensive nature of enforcement actions in later collection phases, the  notice phase is likely the most cost effective way for IRS to resolve unpaid  debt cases.", "During the notice phase for individual taxpayers IRS\u2019s general practice is  to send up to four notices at 5-week intervals to collect the balances due.   Generally, 6 weeks after the fourth notice, IRS either determines that any  additional collection actions should be deferred or sends cases to be  worked potentially in the telephone or in-person contact phases. IRS has  made an administrative decision to separately send two notifications in the  notice phase that are required by law\u2014notifications (1) of the debt due  and request for payment and (2) with regard to a levy of a state tax  refund\u2014in the first and fourth notices, respectively. According to IRS  officials, IRS sends the discretionary second and third notices because  they are successful in resolving some cases at relatively low cost.", "However, IRS has developed variations on the practice of sending four  notices before deciding whether to send any uncollected tax debt to the  next collection phase. Depending on specific debt-related characteristics,  IRS may take such actions as: (1) skip the discretionary reminder notices  to \u201caccelerate\u201d a debt to the next collection phase or (2) defer further  collection action on debts not resolved with notices. Based on these  characteristics, IRS has established \u201cbusiness rules\u201d that are embedded in  IRS\u2019s computer system. These rules are to determine the number and types  of notices as well as whether IRS defers collection action or sends the  debt to other phases for further collection action. IRS officials said  business rules were created in an attempt to make the most effective use  of collection resources.", "As shown in figure 1, IRS annually has sent millions of notices (across the  four types) to collect billions of dollars in unpaid debt from individual  taxpayers. The total number of the notices generally increased from fiscal  years 2004 through 2008, reaching around 22 million in 2008, largely  because of the number of \u201cfirst\u201d notices sent.", "Figure 2 shows that the total dollar values of these sent notices increased  overall in comparing fiscal years 2004 and 2008, with a decline in 2008,  when it reached around $129 billion.", "Every year, IRS\u2019s notice phase also disposes of debt for millions of notices  that had been sent. IRS dispositions arise in various ways, such as by  resolving the debt (including collecting payment from the taxpayer,  abating all or some of the debt, or offsetting the taxpayer\u2019s refund with the  debt owed), deferring further collection action, or sending the case to the  next collection phase for potential enforcement action. (See app. I on the  trends in volumes and dollar values of dispositions from the notice phase  for fiscal years 1999 to 2008.)", "Internal control is a major part of managing an organization. It comprises  the plans, methods, and procedures used to meet missions, goals, and  objectives and, in doing so, supports performance-based management.  Internal control also serves as the first line of defense in safeguarding  assets and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud. In short, internal  control, which is synonymous with management control, helps  government program managers achieve desired results through effective  stewardship of public resources. Internal control should provide  reasonable assurance that the objectives of the agency are being achieved  through, among other things, effective and efficient use of the agency\u2019s  resources.", "Federal Law requires that we issue standards for internal control in  government. The standards provide the overall framework for  establishing and maintaining internal control and for identifying and  addressing major performance and management challenges and areas at  greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In 2001, we  issued Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool  (GAO-01-1008G, August 2001) based upon Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government (GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1, November 1999), to  assist agencies in maintaining or implementing effective internal control.  This tool is not an authoritative part of the standards for internal control,  nor is it required to be used. Instead, it is intended as a supplemental guide  that federal managers and others may use in assessing the effectiveness of  internal control and identifying important aspects of control in need of  improvement. When used with GAO\u2019s standards for internal control and  the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management\u2019s  Responsibility for Internal Control, the tool is to provide a systematic,  organized, and structured approach to assessing an agency\u2019s internal  control structure.", "During the course of our review, in November 2008, IRS separately  initiated a review of notices sent to taxpayers, including notices sent to  taxpayers during the collection notice phase. The review was led by an IRS  team called the Taxpayer Communication Taskforce (TACT.) TACT\u2019s  objectives included simplifying and clarifying notice language; instituting  effective measures; streamlining and improving business processes; and  eliminating unnecessary or duplicative notices, letters, reminders and  inserts. According to its director, TACT is to brief the Commissioner on a  proposed \u201croad map\u201d for addressing issues identified by the team.

We  reviewed collection program documents including the Internal Revenue  Manual (IRM), IRS\u2019s collectionwide performance measures, and any  related performance measures in the Wage and Investment Division\u2019s  (W&I) and Small Business/Self-Employed Division\u2019s (SB/SE)  periodic  business performance review documents. We were to analyze whether  these measures provided information adequate to assess whether the  notice phase achieved the desired results laid out in any stated objectives.  We also interviewed responsible IRS collection officials on any stated  objectives for the notice phase and whether and how the officials use  available data to assess the performance of the notice phase and develop  performance measures. We reviewed available organization charts and the  IRM sections on the managerial and reviewing responsibilities for the  collection operations. We also obtained and reviewed the charter of the  Collection Governance Council, which includes representatives of  collection operations in W&I and SB/SE. We reviewed these documents to  identify IRS officials responsible for managing aspects of the notice  process and reviewing notice-phase performance and interviewed these  officials.", "To determine how well IRS\u2019s business rules help assure that the collection  notice phase achieves desired results at the lowest costs, we asked IRS  collection officials who were the most knowledgeable about the business  rules to identify the key business rules that affect most individual  taxpayers in the notice phase. The five rules IRS identified were based on  (see app. II for further descriptions of the five rules):    certain dollar thresholds (minimum-, low- and medium-dollar amounts) or  \u201crepeater\u201d characteristics (taxpayers who recently had tax debt resolved  or currently have other tax debt in collection status).", "For each of the five business rules, we interviewed these knowledgeable  officials on how the rule operates\u2014i.e., how the rule determines the  number and types of notices sent\u2014and asked IRS for documentation on  how the rules operated. We asked for information and documentation on  when the rule was established, the rationale or purpose for the rule to  include supporting data that IRS considered in establishing the rule, and  any evaluations of the rule since its establishment.", "To answer both objectives, we used applicable internal control standards  in our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  (GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1, November 1999), Internal Control Management  and Evaluation Tool (GAO-01-1008G, August 2001), and the Office of  Management and Budget Circular A-123, Management\u2019s Responsibility for  Internal Control.

Guidance for the  internal control standards is clear that such objectives should be written  and be the product of a process in which all levels of management have  been involved and have committed to the objectives. By not meeting these  standards, IRS cannot be assured that relevant staff and management  commonly understand and pursue the same outcomes that are linked to  IRS-wide objectives and strategic plans.", "IRS officials said that written objectives are unnecessary because IRS  officials have widespread agreement on the objectives. However, our  discussions with IRS W&I and SB/SE executives and managers responsible  for all parts of the collection process show that they have different views  about the notice phase in terms of what it is intended to do. For example,  one official said that the purposes of the notice phase are to prompt a  response from the taxpayer and get the taxpayer actively engaged in  resolving the unpaid debt. Among other possible objectives, officials said  that the notice phase is to resolve unpaid debt cases at the lowest possible  cost or achieve the most economical resolution of the greatest number of  debts. Furthermore, IRS officials referred to abating certain debts,  achieving full payments for debts, or collecting as much unpaid debt as  possible as other desired outcomes.", "These desirable outcomes strive for different things such as getting the  taxpayer involved, resolving as many debts as possible, minimizing costs,  and collecting the unpaid amounts. For example, one could focus on  minimizing costs or resolving more debt cases\u2014such as through  abatements or deferring any collection action\u2014but not collect any debt in  doing so. Without documenting how these different outcomes interact, IRS  does not have assurance that its staff clearly understand what the notice  phase should be producing or that they may maximize one type of  performance while adversely affecting other desired levels of  performance.", "Without written objectives, IRS cannot move forward to the next step of  establishing program performance measures that are tied to the desired  results envisioned in the objectives. Without performance measures  related to established objectives agencies cannot be assured that a  program is achieving desired results and, if possible, improving results. As  shown below, guidance for the federal internal control standards states  that performance measures should be established for government  programs and, among other things, be linked to objectives.", "Activity-level objectives include measurement criteria.", "Performance measures and indicators have been established throughout the  organization at the entitywide, activity, and individual levels.", "Performance measurement assessment factors are to be evaluated to ensure  they are linked to mission, goals, and objectives and are balanced and set  appropriate incentives for achieving goals while complying with law,  regulations, and ethical standards.", "As with objectives, IRS has not established performance measures for the  notice phase. IRS established the Collection Governance Council (CGC) in  part to establish consistent performance measures that could be compared  across the divisions and operating units that administer parts of the  collection process and be rolled up to reflect IRS-wide collection  performance. However, the three IRS-wide collection process measures  do not provide information necessary to assess the notice phase in part  because two of the measures reflect telephone and in-person contact  phase work in addition to notice phase work and the other measure is  specific to the telephone contact phase.", "Nor do the W&I and SB/SE unit-level performance measures that IRS uses  to hold managers accountable for performance in these units provide  information necessary to assess the notice phase in part because they  reflect work done in addition to notice phase work. For example, the  measures for the Compliance Services Collection Operations (CSCO) units  reflect performance not only on handling taxpayer written responses to  the four collection notices but also post-notice phase work, such as  taxpayer correspondence on defaulted installment agreements.", "Without performance measures, IRS cannot tell how well the notice phase  works and helps achieve any objectives that are established. In discussing  this effect with IRS officials, they cited a percentage\u2014total number of  cases disposed by the entire notice phase divided by the total number of  first notices issued in a given year \u2014as evidence that the notice phase is  working well. However, IRS has not established this percentage as a  performance measure or defined how it is to be consistently calculated.  For example, the official who calculated the percentage explained that  more than one formula could be used to calculate the percentage, such as  including or excluding deferred cases from the number of cases disposed.  Furthermore, establishing this measure as the only measure of notice- phase performance would not meet IRS\u2019s policy of having a set of  balanced measures that are linked to IRS goals, such as goals for customer  satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and business results.", "In addition to performance information, IRS would also benefit from using  cost information to make data-based decisions about notice phase  effectiveness. Officials in IRS\u2019s Office of Chief Financial Officer have  demonstrated the ability to determine full cost information on selected IRS  programs through a series of cost studies, but the notice phase was not  included in them. Even so, IRS has collected some information on the cost  to produce or mail collection notices to taxpayers. For just fiscal year 2006  and just the fourth notice (which is sent by certified mail), IRS tracked and  maintained postage cost data that showed IRS spent $22 million on  sending that notice type. According to IRS\u2019s comments on a draft of this  report (see appendix III), IRS has an effort underway that is intended to  address the lack of some types of cost information. IRS said that it  awarded a contract in August 2009, to help develop the Correspondence  Management Information System (CMIS) to provide, among other things,  data on the costs of notice printing and postage which will assist in  determining the full cost of notices. The full costs also include such things  as labor cost of processing payments or handling taxpayers\u2019  correspondence or telephone calls in response to notices.", "Related to the establishment of objectives and measurement of  performance against those objectives, the internal controls also envision  top management reviews. To ensure that agencies are achieving desired  program results, it is important to have a chain of performance reporting  leading to top-level management reviews and accountability for program  performance.

Without  documentation of when the other four rules were established, IRS lacked  information for tracking and evaluating events over time that could affect  how the rules operate. IRS officials\u2019 recollections of when the four rules  were established were imprecise and in one case depended on the  official\u2019s experiences in IRS. For example, an IRS official said the  minimum dollar rule was established as early as 1978 because the rule was  in effect when the official began working at IRS. Officials speculated that  the low dollar rule was established around 1995. Officials said the medium  dollar rule was established sometime in 1994 because an official had  retained a dated training manual on a related program that officials  recalled being established at the same time as the rule.", "IRS could not provide documentation on the rationales (such as the  factors considered or reasons for adopting the rule) for any of the rules we  reviewed. As with the dates that rules were established, we had to rely on  the recollections of IRS officials to determine why IRS had adopted the  rule and its purpose. Such sources were of limited use because of their  reliance on staffs\u2019 memories and because officials disagreed on some of  the rules, thus making it unclear what IRS\u2019s reasoning was for the rule. For  example, officials said that the reason IRS established the medium dollar  rule to defer sending certain cases to ACS was that using automatic offsets  of future tax refunds to collect these debts was less costly than using ACS.  However, another official said that the rule was established not so much  because of the relative costs of ACS but instead to stem the flow of paper  because, at the time IRS began deferring sending cases, IRS\u2019s process for  levying assets relied on paperwork, which overwhelmed the staffs. The  lack of documentation for the rationale of the rule\u2014the basic reasoning on  why the rule exists\u2014made it impossible to determine if the rule achieves  its intended purpose.", "IRS also lacked data supporting the rationales for the rules.

For the medium dollar rule, IRS managers who we  were told were most familiar with the rules originally said that a taxpayer  under this rule would receive four notices. The managers said that sending  four notices was to give the taxpayer the maximum opportunities to  respond given that IRS would not be taking further collection action if  payment or another response was not received.

The FSP contains some of the computer  commands that control the sending of notices. Officials said the FSP and  related system documents are the only documentation for the existence  and operation of the rules. According to IRS collection officials, the  language of the FSP is difficult to understand. Consequently, the managers  had to consult with MITS staff to explain the rules. One of the roles of  MITS is to translate operational requirements devised by the collection  function into computer programming language.", "Furthermore, not all collection notice rules are in the FSP. Some rules are  in at least one other information system\u2014the program requirements  package (PRP) of the master file, the information system that sends the  first collection notice to taxpayers. With more than one system, IRS has  limited assurance that the business rules are identical because changes in  one system may not also be made in all the systems. For example, the FSP  sends a notice for debts of $5 and above, but the PRP has a slightly higher  dollar threshold for taking further action. IRS officials were unaware of  this inconsistency, and, after our further discussion with them, they agreed  that the FSP rules should be amended to be consistent with the PRP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Does Not Have a Process to Evaluate Whether Its Business Rules Work as Intended", "paragraphs": ["A critical part of management control is monitoring to ensure that  programs are working as intended.

For the  remaining four rules we reviewed, IRS officials said that they had not  evaluated three rules and had evaluated one rule (the medium dollar rule)  but had no documentation of the evaluation. Without a process to evaluate  the business rules, IRS officials can not be assured that the rules work as  intended.", "IRS collection managers were unaware of evaluation of the minimum  dollar rule and had no documentation on the follow-up action that was  promised. IRS collection officials had originally told us that no evaluation  had been done for the minimum dollar rule. During our work, we  separately learned that IRS had done an evaluation in response to a 2004  Taxpayer Advocacy Panel (TAP) recommendation that the $5 threshold  be raised to $25. The evaluation report showed that IRS had done analyses  to consider such factors as the costs of sending and handling responses to  notices and potential lost revenue. Although the report concluded that  raising the threshold to the recommended level would not be cost- effective, it said that IRS would do further evaluation to determine if the  threshold should be increased to some amount between $5 and $25.  However, IRS officials could not provide any documentation that a follow- up evaluation had been done nor did IRS have plans to conduct such an  evaluation. Also, IRS officials could provide none of the data supporting  the report conclusions, such as information on the costs of sending and  handling responses to notices.", "For the medium dollar rule evaluation that IRS officials said was done, the  age of the evaluation and lack of documentation limited its usefulness. The  officials said that IRS had evaluated the medium dollar threshold in the  1980\u2019s and concluded that it was appropriate. As we noted earlier, the  intended purposes of all the rules we reviewed were undocumented. To  the extent that IRS\u2019s costs and collections may have been considered in  establishing the medium dollar rule, with changes over time\u2014including  possible changes in taxpayer behavior and IRS\u2019s processes along with the  certain change in the value of dollars due to inflation\u2014it is unclear how  the results of an evaluation done over twenty years ago would serve as  adequate assurance that a current business rule is appropriate. Over time,  various changes could affect the continued validity of any rationale. For  example, according to IRS officials, the current medium dollar threshold  was set in 1994 as part of a program for accelerating debts above a certain  amount to ACS to make outbound telephone calls to attempt collection.  According to IRS officials, the acceleration program was dropped after  one year because future funding was eliminated. Even so, the medium  dollar threshold has remained unchanged in the computer programming.", "IRS officials said that IRS has no requirement to periodically evaluate the  business rules. Because the business rules are not being regularly  evaluated, IRS risks that the rules will result in unnecessary costs or  missed collections. For example, IRS could defer sending a case for  collection action based on outdated assumptions about the costs of such  action. To the extent that evaluations are done, the lack of a system to  make managers aware of them or to maintain the evaluations and  supporting data limits their usefulness in making program decisions to  ensure that desired collection results are achieved at the least costs.", "According to its director, TACT also found that evaluations of business  rules were lacking and was considering recommending certain actions to  improve such evaluations.
