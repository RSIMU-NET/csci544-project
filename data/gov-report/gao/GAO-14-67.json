GAO identified and reviewed 70 Dodd-Frank rules that became effective from July 24, 2012, through July 22, 2013, to determine whether the required regulatory analyses and coordination were conducted; examined CFPB's policies, procedures, and other materials; developed indicators on the impact of the act's systemic risk-related provisions and rules; conducted a regression analysis to assess the act's impact on large bank holding companies; and interviewed federal financial regulators and officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and OMB."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies conducted the required regulatory analyses for all rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) that GAO identified and reviewed. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in coordination with the agencies, may not be consistently determining which rules are considered major rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Under the act, Congress is allowed to review major rules before they become effective. The act outlines criteria for determining whether a rule is major, such as whether it will result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. OMB is responsible for determining which rules are major under CRA but relies on agency analyses to help make the determination. OMB guidance does not address whether independent agencies should submit all rules for review or how they should apply major rule criteria. GAO found that some independent agencies submitted all their rules to OMB, but others did not. GAO also found inconsistencies in how these agencies applied the CRA criteria. For example, GAO found rules issued by different agencies that had similar economic impacts but were not similarly classified as major. These issues raise the risk of some rules not being properly classified as major, limiting Congress's ability to review these rules before they become effective.", "Federal regulators coordinated on 49 rulemakings pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act or voluntarily. As required by the act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) established a framework to coordinate its supervision activities with prudential regulators and is establishing a similar framework to coordinate with state regulators. In May 2012, CFPB and prudential regulators entered into an agreement that specifies how they plan to meet the act's coordination requirements for the supervision of large banks (i.e., more than $10 billion in assets). CFPB has entered into similar agreements with state regulators to coordinate examinations of banks and nonbank financial entities.", "The Dodd-Frank Act has not been fully implemented and its full impact remains uncertain. Using recently released data, GAO updated its prior report's indicators monitoring certain risk characteristics of large U.S. bank holding companies. Although changes in the indicators are not evidence of causal links to the act's provisions, some indicators suggest these companies, on average, have decreased their leverage and enhanced their liquidity since the act's passage. Moreover, GAO's updated regression analysis suggests that the act continued to have little effect on the funding costs of large U.S. bank holding companies but may have helped improve their safety and soundness. Based on its analysis of the act and market data, GAO also developed new indicators for this report to monitor the extent to which certain of the act's swap reforms are associated with their intended outcomes. These indicators establish baselines for measuring future changes. Finally, GAO examined federal financial regulators' plans to conduct retrospective reviews of their Dodd-Frank rules. Executive Order 13,579 asks independent agencies, including federal financial regulators, to develop plans to conduct retrospective reviews of existing rules that may be excessively burdensome or costly. Regulators have varied in their approaches and progress in developing and implementing such plans. Given the importance of such reviews, GAO recommended in 2011 that the regulators determine how they will measure the impact of Dodd-Frank regulations in their plans, but they have not done so to date. GAO maintains that doing so would position the regulators to make their future retrospective reviews as robust as possible."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB issue guidance to help standardize CRA processes.

The act responds to the  2007-2009 financial crisis that disrupted the U.S. financial system and  threatened not only the solvency of some large financial institutions but  also the health of the U.S. economy. Although the financial services  industry, academics, and others generally have supported the Dodd- Frank Act\u2019s goal of enhancing the stability of the U.S. financial system,  the act\u2019s provisions and their implementation have been subject to  debate. For example, no consensus exists on the extent to which the act  will help reduce the likelihood and severity of future financial crises or on  the magnitude of the costs that the act and its regulations\u2014individually  and cumulatively\u2014will impose on U.S. financial institutions and the  economy. Additionally, some market observers have raised concerns  about the pace of reform, with some suggesting that reform is occurring  too slowly and others arguing that it is moving too quickly.", "Federal rulemaking is subject to multiple statutory requirements and  executive orders. However, the extent to which the federal financial  regulators and other federal agencies are subject to these requirements  varies. For example, the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) impose regulatory analysis requirements  on federal agencies, including the federal financial regulators. PRA  requires agencies to justify collection of information from the public to  minimize the paperwork burden and estimate the time and expense  needed to comply with the paperwork requirements contained in their  rules. RFA requires agencies to assess the impact of their regulation on  small entities and consider regulatory alternatives to lessen the regulatory  burden on small entities. Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA),  before rules can take effect, federal agencies, including the federal  financial regulators, must submit their rules to Congress and the  Comptroller General, and rules deemed major by the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) generally may not become effective until  60 days after the rules are submitted. For agencies subject to Executive  Order 12,866 (E.O. 12,866), such major rules would be considered  significant regulatory actions and as such would be subject to formal  benefit-cost analysis. However, as independent regulatory agencies, the  federal financial regulators are not required to comply with executive  orders.", "Section 1573(a) of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing  Appropriations Act of 2011 amends the Dodd-Frank Act and mandates  that GAO conduct an annual study of financial services regulations,  including those of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  We issued our first two reports under this mandate in November 2011  and December 2012.regulatory analyses conducted by federal agencies in their Dodd- Frank rulemakings, including their assessments of which rules they  considered to be major rules;  interagency coordination by federal agencies in their Dodd-Frank  rulemakings and by CFPB with other agencies in its supervision  activities; and possible impact of selected Dodd-Frank provisions and their  implementing regulations and agency plans to assess such  regulations retrospectively.", "To examine agencies\u2019 regulatory analyses and coordination, we focused  on final Dodd-Frank rules that became effective from July 24, 2012,  through July 22, 2013, a total of 70 rules. To identify these rules, we used  a website maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that  tracks Dodd-Frank regulations. We corroborated the data with the federal  agencies and data from their websites.", "In examining the regulatory analyses of the federal agencies in our  review, we reviewed federal statutes, GAO studies, Federal Register  releases, and other material to identify and summarize the regulatory  analyses federal agencies are required to conduct, and conducted, for  Dodd-Frank rulemakings. Of the 70 rules within our scope, 59 rules were  substantive regulations\u2014 generally subject to public notice and comment  under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014and required the agencies to  conduct some form of regulatory analysis. Of the 59 rules, 10 were  classified as major under CRA. For those 10 rules, we compared the  regulatory analyses against principles in OMB Circular A-4, which  provides guidance on the development of such analyses. To examine  how OMB, in consultation with federal agencies, classifies rules as major,  we reviewed CRA, agency analyses, Federal Register releases of Dodd- Frank major rules, GAO reports, and other materials, and interviewed  officials from OMB and federal financial regulators. We relied on our  Federal Rules database to identify all Dodd-Frank rules classified as  major as of July 22, 2013\u201436 in total (including the 10 from the specified  time period mentioned above).", "To examine interagency coordination among the regulators, we reviewed  the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Register releases, and GAO reports to  identify the interagency coordination or consultation requirements for the  70 rules in our scope. We found evidence of coordination between the  rulemaking agency and other regulators for 49 of the 70 rules. We  reviewed the Federal Register releases of the final rules and interviewed  agency officials to document whether the agencies coordinated with other  U.S., foreign, or international regulators, either as required by Dodd-Frank  or on a voluntary basis. To examine steps CFPB took to comply with  Dodd-Frank requirements for interagency coordination and information  sharing in its supervision activities, we reviewed the act, CFPB  documents, and GAO reports. We also interviewed officials from CFPB  and the prudential regulators about such coordination.", "Finally, we took a multipronged approach to analyze what is known about  the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial marketplace. First, we  updated our indicators monitoring changes in certain characteristics of  systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) that might be affected  by Dodd-Frank regulations. Second, we updated our economic analysis  estimating changes in the (1) cost of credit provided by bank SIFIs and  (2) safety and soundness of bank SIFIs. Third, we developed indicators to  monitor the extent to which certain of the Dodd-Frank\u2019s swap reforms are  consistent with the act\u2019s goals. As new data become available, we  expect to update and, as warranted, revise our indicators and create  additional indicators. Fourth, to assess agency plans to conduct  retrospective reviews of existing rules, we reviewed executive orders;  OMB guidance; Federal Register releases, policies, and other agency  documents; and GAO reports. Finally, we interviewed agency officials  about their plans to conduct retrospective reviews of their Dodd-Frank  rules.

In 2012, CFTC and SEC jointly issued  a rule to further define certain swap terms, including swap and  security-based swap. In its analysis, CFTC noted that the  definitions, by themselves, would not have an annual effect on the  economy of $100 million but will affect a number of other rules,  including rules determined to be major rules. According to CFTC,  these other rules could not be made effective without the final  definitions rule; as a result, it concluded that the definitions rule would  have an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million.  CFTC and SEC also jointly issued a rule to further define certain  terms including swap dealer and security-based swap dealer. In its  analysis, SEC noted that these definitions, by themselves, would not  impose substantive requirements on dealers or major participants, but  that the rule should be considered major because it would set  boundaries that determine whether entities are subject to other rules,  including ones determined to be major rules.

As we have noted, the Dodd-Frank Act requires  the Federal Reserve to impose a variety of regulatory reforms on SIFIs,  including enhanced risk-based capital, leverage, and liquidity  requirements. These reforms may affect the safety and soundness of  bank SIFIs and the cost and availability of credit provided by bank SIFIs.  Although capital and leverage requirements may help reduce the  probability of bank failures and promote financial stability, they could  cause banks to raise lending rates and limit their ability to provide credit,  especially during a crisis. Similarly, while stricter liquidity requirements  may help reduce the probability of bank failures and promote financial  stability, banks could respond to these requirements by increasing  lending spreads to offset lower yields on assets or longer maturities on  liabilities. To the extent that they increase the cost and reduce the  availability of credit, these reforms may lead to reduced output and  economic growth.", "Our econometric analysis assesses the initial impact of the Dodd-Frank  Act\u2019s new requirements for bank SIFIs on (1) the cost of credit they  provide and (2) their safety and soundness. Our analysis leverages the  Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s requirement that bank holding companies with total  consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to enhanced  regulation by the Federal Reserve but other bank holding companies are  not. Specifically, we compare funding costs, capital adequacy, asset  quality, earnings, and liquidity for bank SIFIs and non-SIFI bank holding  companies before and after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank enhanced  prudential requirements. All else being equal, the difference in the  comparative differences is the inferred effect of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s  prudential requirements on bank SIFIs.", "Our approach allows us to partially differentiate changes in funding costs,  capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and liquidity associated with the  Dodd-Frank Act from changes due to other factors. However, several  factors make isolating and measuring the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s  new requirements for SIFIs challenging. The effects of the act cannot be  differentiated from the effects of simultaneous changes in economic  conditions, such as the pace of the recovery from the recent recession, or  regulations, such as those stemming from Basel III, or other changes,  such as in credit ratings that differentially may affect bank SIFIs and other  bank holding companies. In addition, many of the new requirements for  SIFIs have yet to be implemented. For example, the Federal Reserve is  required to implement enhanced prudential standards, including capital  requirements, stress testing, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty  credit limits, an early remediation regime, and risk-management and  resolution planning. Only rules for resolution planning and stress testing  have been finalized. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has proposed to  implement a quantitative liquidity requirement for bank holding  companies, savings and loan holding companies, and depository  institutions with more than $250 billion in total assets and has indicated  that it plans to impose a capital surcharge on the largest SIFIs.  Nevertheless, our estimates are suggestive of the initial effects of the  Dodd-Frank Act on bank SIFIs and provide a baseline against which to  compare future trends.", "Our estimates suggest that the Dodd-Frank Act has not been associated  with a significant change in U.S. bank SIFIs\u2019 funding costs (table 3). To  the extent that the cost of credit provided by bank SIFIs is a function of  their funding costs, the new requirements for SIFIs likely have had little  effect on the cost of credit to date.", "Our estimates also suggest that the Dodd-Frank Act is associated with  improvements in most measures of U.S. bank SIFIs\u2019 safety and  soundness. As shown in table 3, bank SIFIs appear to be holding more  capital than they otherwise would have held in every quarter since the  Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The quality of assets on the balance sheets  of bank SIFIs also seems to have improved since the Dodd-Frank Act  was enacted. The act is associated with higher earnings for bank SIFIs in  the time period after the act\u2019s enactment. It is also associated with  improved liquidity as measured by the extent to which a bank holding  company is using stable sources of funding. The only measure that has  not clearly improved since the act\u2019s enactment is liquidity as measured by  the capacity of a bank holding company\u2019s liquid assets to cover its volatile  liabilities.

Financial and nonfinancial firms use  swaps and other derivatives to hedge risk, to speculate, or for other  purposes. Unlike futures, which are standardized financial contracts that  are traded on exchanges, swaps traditionally have been privately  negotiated between two counterparties in the over-the-counter (OTC)  market. Swaps include interest rate swaps, commodity-based swaps,  equity swaps, and credit default swaps.", "In varying degrees and ways, swaps and other OTC derivatives played a  role in the most recent financial crisis. As FSOC reported, credit default  swaps (CDS), including AIG\u2019s large holdings of such swaps, exacerbated  the crisis because they were not well understood by regulators or market  participants. FSOC also noted that OTC derivatives generally were a  factor in the propagation of risks during the recent crisis because of their  complexity and opacity, which contributed to excessive risk taking, a lack  of clarity about the ultimate distribution of risks, and a loss in market  confidence. In that regard, the crisis illustrated that swaps and other OTC  derivatives can contribute to systemic risk in at least two ways. First,  while swaps can be used to manage risk and increase liquidity, swaps  generally have not been subject to regulatory requirements for margin  (i.e., collateral based on the market value of the swap). This allowed  some swap participants to take large speculative positions using a  relatively small amount of capital, thereby increasing leverage. Second,  swaps increased the interconnectedness of the financial system by  exposing many banks, financial entities, and end-users to the credit risk  of a small number of swap dealers. The concentration of most OTC  derivatives trading among a small number of dealers created the risk that  the failure of one of these dealers could expose counterparties to sudden  losses and destabilize financial markets.", "Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new regulatory framework  for swaps. The act authorizes CFTC to regulate \u201cswaps\u201d and SEC to  regulate \u201csecurity-based swaps\u201d with the goals of reducing risk,  increasing transparency, and promoting market integrity in the financial  system. Title VII includes the following four major swaps reforms.", "Registration and regulation. The title provides for the registration  and regulation of swap dealers and major swap participants, including  subjecting them to (1) prudential regulatory requirements, such as  minimum capital and minimum initial and variation margin  requirements and (2) business conduct requirements to address,  among other things, interaction with counterparties, disclosure, and  supervision.", "Mandatory clearing. The title imposes mandatory clearing  requirements on swaps, but exempts, among others, certain end  users that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.", "Exchange trading. The title requires swaps subject to mandatory  clearing to be executed on an organized exchange or swap execution  facility, unless no facility offers the swap for trading.", "Mandatory reporting. The title requires all swaps to be reported to a  registered swap data repository or, if no such repository will accept  the swap, to CFTC or SEC, and subjects swaps to post-trade  transparency requirements (real-time public reporting of certain swap  data).", "Figure 1 illustrates these reforms and some of the differences between  swaps traded on exchanges and cleared through clearinghouses and  swaps traded in the OTC market.", "According to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s legislative history, key elements for  reducing systemic risk include increasing the use of central  clearinghouses and appropriate margining and capital for OTC  derivatives. CFTC and SEC have issued final rules to implement many  of the regulatory frameworks for clearing standardized swaps. In  December 2012, CFTC issued a final rule establishing the first clearing  requirement for four types of interest rate swaps and two types of CDSs.  In July 2012, SEC issued a final rule on, among other things, the process  that the agency will use to determine whether a security-based swap is  required to be cleared but has not yet subjected any security-based  swaps to the clearing requirement. CFTC, SEC, and the prudential  banking regulators have proposed rules to implement Dodd-Frank\u2019s  margin and capital requirements for swap entities, but as of September  2013, these rules have not yet been finalized.listing select Dodd-Frank swap reform related rulemakings.)   (See app. VIII for tables  Once fully implemented, some provisions in Title VII of the act may help  achieve the goal of reducing risk, in part by increasing the central clearing  of swaps and posting of margin for uncleared swaps. We developed two  sets of indicators to measure changes in (1) the central clearing of swaps  and (2) the use of margin collateral for OTC derivatives. In this report,  these indicators provide a baseline for measuring future changes in the  central clearing of swaps and use of margin collateral, as the Dodd-Frank  swap reforms have not been fully implemented. In future reports, we plan  to update these indicators to determine whether changes in central  clearing and the use of margin collateral are consistent with the act\u2019s  swap reforms. Importantly, these indicators have several key limitations.  First, changes in our indicators do not necessarily suggest a change in  risk, because the intended outcomes of the swap reforms may not  necessarily reduce systemic risk. For instance, experts, including those  from the IMF, have noted that an increase in central clearing of swaps  may not, by itself, reduce risk and may increase risk. Second, our  indicators do not identify causal links between changes in swap market  and the Dodd-Frank Act, including its regulations. Rather, the indicators  begin to track changes in central clearing and collateralization in the  swaps since the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s passage to examine whether the  changes are consistent with the act\u2019s swap reform goals for central  clearing and collateralization.", "Federal financial regulators have reported that mandatory clearing  through clearinghouses for certain swaps can reduce risk and provide  other benefits. As noted by CFTC, central clearing mitigates counterparty  risk to the extent that the clearinghouse is a more creditworthy  counterparty relative to the original swap participants.have a variety of tools to monitor and manage counterparty risk, which  include the contractual right to collect initial and variation margin  associated with swap positions; issue margin calls whenever the margin  in a customer\u2019s account has dropped below predetermined levels; and  close out the swap positions of a customer that does not meet margin  calls within a specified period. Further, to the extent that swap positions  move from facing multiple counterparties in the OTC derivatives market to  being run through a smaller number of clearinghouses, clearing may  facilitate increased netting, which reduces operational risk and may  reduce the amount of collateral that a counterparty must post or pay in  terms of initial and variation margin. Although centralized clearing could  remove a large portion of the interconnectedness of current OTC markets  that leads to systemic risk, CFTC and others have noted that central  clearing, by its nature, concentrates risk in a handful of entities.", "We developed two complementary clearing indicators. Our first indicator  measures the gross notional amount of swaps that are required to be  cleared and are being cleared as a percentage of the gross notional  amount of swaps required to be cleared.  This indicator shows the progress being made by market participants in complying with any  mandatory clearing requirement. All else being equal, an increase in  this indicator would be consistent with the act\u2019s swaps reforms. However,  an increase in compliance with mandatory clearing requirements may not  increase central clearing overall if market participants substitute away  from swaps that are required to be cleared in favor of swaps that are not  required to be cleared. To assess the extent to which market  participants are substituting away from swaps that are required to clear,  we complement our first indicator with a second indicator that measures  the gross notional amount of swaps that are required to be cleared (but  are not necessarily cleared) as a percentage of the total gross notional  amount of the swaps market. This indicator shows the share of the swap  market comprised by swaps identified for mandatory clearing and helps  determine the extent to which changes in the first indicator represent   For example, an increase in the  increases in central clearing overall.first indicator\u2014the percentage of swaps that are required to be cleared  that are cleared\u2014would indicate an increase in central clearing overall if  the second indicator\u2014the percentage of all swaps that are required to  clear\u2014does not decrease at the same time. In contrast, if the first  indicator increases while the second decreases, then some of the  increase in the first indicator likely is due to substitution away from swaps  that are required to be cleared in favor of swaps that are not required to  be cleared, which is not consistent with the act\u2019s swaps reforms.", "Our indicators cover only the interest rate swaps and CDS markets,  because only certain of these types of swaps are currently subject to  CFTC\u2019s mandatory clearing requirement. These are the two largest swaps markets. Based on CFTC\u2019s Swaps Report, the total gross notional  amounts outstanding of the interest rate swap and CDS markets were  about $419 trillion and $20 trillion, respectively, as of August 30, 2013.", "The indicators are developed using data in the proposed version of  CFTC\u2019s Swaps Report, which are estimates from a variety of sources that  voluntarily submit the data. CFTC\u2019s final version of its Swaps Report  will use data collected in response to Dodd-Frank provisions, and CFTC  staff stated that the agency was working to implement this transition.", "Figure 2 shows the trends of our clearing indicators for interest rate  swaps from January 2013 through August 2013. Our first indicator shows  that market participants are making progress in meeting the clearing  requirement: The percentage of swaps required to be cleared and that  were cleared increased from around 53 percent to around 57 percent  (based on gross notional amounts). Currently, not all interest rate swaps  that are required to be cleared are being cleared, in part because CFTC  is phasing in the requirement by staggering the compliance dates for  different types of market participants and also because some nonfinancial  entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk are exempt  from the clearing requirement. The second indicator shows that interest  rate swaps that are required to be cleared made up about 88 percent of  the market (based on gross notional amount), and generally did not  decrease during the period. This indicates that the increase in the first  indicator represents an increase in central clearing that is consistent with  the act\u2019s swaps reforms.", "Figure 3 shows the trends of our two clearing indicators for CDSs from  January 2013 through August 2013. Our first indicator shows that, based  on gross notional amount, about 27 percent of swaps required to be  cleared were cleared at the end of the period, compared to about 24  percent at the beginning of the period. The second indictor shows that,  based on gross notional amount, CDSs required to be cleared accounted  for about 35 percent of the market at the end of the period, compared to  about 30 percent at the beginning of the period. This trend in the  percentage of all CDSs that are required to clear is not consistent with  market participants substituting away from CDSs that are required to  clear in favor of CDSs that are not required to clear. It follows that the  increase in the percentage of required-to-clear CDSs that cleared over  the period generally is consistent with the act\u2019s swaps reforms.", "We developed a second set of indicators to measure changes in the  collection of margin collateral for OTC derivatives. The first margin  indicator measures the fair value of collateral pledged by all  counterparties to secure OTC derivatives contracts as a percentage of  net current credit exposure to those counterparties for bank, financial, and  savings and loan holding companies that reported positive credit  exposure. The second set of margin indicators measures collateral  pledged by different types of counterparties\u2014banks and securities firms,  monoline financial guarantors, hedge funds, sovereign governments, and  corporations and all other counterparties\u2014as a percentage of credit  exposure to different types of counterparties. The net current credit  exposure approximates the credit loss that a bank, financial, or savings  and loan holding company would suffer if its counterparties defaulted on  their OTC derivatives contracts.swap entity can require its counterparties to post margin collateral in an  amount equal to or greater than the exposure of the contracts. An  increase in these indicators would suggest that holding companies are  requiring their counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral  against their credit exposure due to derivatives contracts overall, which  would be consistent with the purposes of the act\u2019s swap reforms.", "To protect itself from such a loss, a  Although CFTC, SEC, and the prudential regulators have not finalized  their margin rules for uncleared swaps, figures 4 and 5 show the trends in  our margin indicators from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth  quarter of 2012. Figure 4 shows that holding companies in our sample  have increased the rate of collateralization of their net current credit  exposure from OTC derivatives from 62 percent to 82 percent over the  period, suggesting that these holding companies are requiring their  counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral against their  derivatives contracts. However, as discussed later, aggregate measures  of collateralization rates can mask differences in collateralization rates for  different counterparty types.", "Figure 5 shows that the rate of collateralization of net current credit  exposure from OTC derivatives has consistently differed by the type of  counterparty, with hedge funds posting the most collateral as a  percentage of credit exposure and sovereign governments typically  posting the least. According to OCC, the rates differ, in part, because  swap dealers may require certain counterparties, such as hedge funds, to  post both initial and variation margin and other counterparties, such as  banks and securities firms, to post only variation margin. Depending on  how the margin rules are finalized, the rates of collateralization for some  counterparties may increase.", "Our margin indicators are subject to important limitations. First, both net  current credit exposure and the fair value of collateral are as of a point in  time because the fair values of derivatives contracts and collateral can  fluctuate over time. Second, an average collateralization of 100 percent  does not ensure that all current counterparty exposures have been  eliminated, because one counterparty\u2019s credit exposures may be  overcollateralized but another counterparty\u2019s credit exposure may be  undercollateralized. Third, our indicators measure the fair value of the  collateral held against net current credit exposures but do not necessarily  measure the risk of uncollateralized losses. The fair value of net current  credit exposure does not fully account for the riskiness of any single swap  contract, so it is possible for the rate of collateralization to increase while  the risk of uncollateralized losses also has increased, if a party has  entered into riskier swaps. Fourth, there are over 1,000 holding  companies in our sample, but less than 100 holding companies report  positive credit exposure to counterparties in OTC derivatives contracts  and five holding companies account for over 95 percent of the total gross  notional amount of all derivatives contracts reported by all of the holding  companies in our sample. Thus, trends in these indicators largely reflect  collateralization rates for a small number of holding companies. Finally,  these indicators do not reflect collateralization rates for companies, such  as standalone broker-dealers, that have credit exposure to counterparties  in OTC derivatives contracts but are not affiliated with a bank, financial, or  savings and loan holding company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Vary in Their Approaches and Progress in Developing Retrospective Review Plans", "paragraphs": ["Federal financial regulators vary in their approaches and progress in  developing and implementing plans to conduct retrospective reviews of  their existing Dodd-Frank and other rules in recognition of Executive  Order 13,579 (E.O. 13,579). Issued in July 2011, E.O. 13,579 seeks to  facilitate the periodic review of existing significant regulations by asking  independent regulatory agencies to consider how best to promote  retrospective analysis of rules that may be outmoded, ineffective,  insufficient, or excessively burdensome. Retrospective reviews  complement the prospective analysis that agencies conduct as part of  their rulemaking (discussed above) and can provide insights on how  regulations actually are working. E.O 13,579 represents the first time the  President has issued an executive order to ask independent regulatory  agencies to produce retrospective review plans for public scrutiny. But  independent regulators, such as the federal financial regulators, are not  required to follow this order.", "Most federal financial regulators told us that they were not developing  retrospective review plans specifically in response to E.O. 13,579. As a  matter of policy or to satisfy statutory obligations, federal financial  regulators generally had been conducting retrospective reviews before  the issuance of E.O. 13,579. In that regard, the prudential regulators told  us that they generally view their retrospective rule reviews conducted in  accordance with statute or policy to be consistent with the order\u2019s  principles and objectives. For example, prudential regulators noted that  the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996  (EGRPRA) requires them to review their regulations at least once every  10 years and identify and eliminate any regulatory requirements that are  outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. The regulators  reported on the results of their last EGRPRA review in July 2007, which  was done over a 3-year period. During the review, the regulators  undertook various efforts to reduce regulatory burden on their supervised  institutions, including by streamlining supervisory processes. They also  identified four areas to explore further for opportunities to revise  regulations: suspicious activity reports, lending limits, the Basel II capital  framework, and consumer disclosures. The next EGRPRA review must  be completed by 2016. Three prudential regulators told us that they are  actively planning for the review. According to one prudential regulator,  CFPB, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC, are working in a  collaborative fashion under the auspices of the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council to develop a program to conduct a  comprehensive review of the regulations under EGRPGRA. In addition,  some prudential regulators have conducted periodic, retrospective  reviews of their existing rules as a matter of policy or practice. For  example, NCUA has a policy of reviewing one-third of its rules on an  annual basis, and the Federal Reserve has a policy of reviewing each of  its rules at least once every 5 years. FDIC is undertaking a review of its  regulations to eliminate and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden in  light of the regulations it incorporated when it took on supervision of state- charted thrifts upon the dissolution of the Office of Thrift Supervision. In  addition, according to FDIC staff, the agency recently revised its policies,  in part, to reaffirm its commitment to periodically undertake a review of  each FDIC regulation and policy statement. Lastly, as part of its effort to  integrate the Office of Thrift Supervision into its agency, OCC has been  undertaking a comprehensive review of its and the Office of Thrift  Supervision\u2019s regulations to eliminate duplication and reduce  unnecessary regulatory burden.", "According to CFPB officials, the agency is not developing a retrospective  review plan in response to E.O. 13,579 but, instead, is focusing on  fulfilling its retrospective review requirements under section 1022 of the  Dodd-Frank Act. Under the act, CFPB is required to assess  retrospectively each significant rule or order adopted by CFPB under  federal consumer financial law to address, among other things, the rule or  order\u2019s effectiveness in meeting the act\u2019s purposes and goals. CFPB is  required to publish a report of its assessment no later than 5 years after  the rule or order\u2019s effective date, and is required to solicit public comment  to inform its assessment. The officials said that they are in the initial stage  of developing a review plan, which includes identifying what data will be  needed and how such data can be collected, but have not yet drafted a  plan. According to the officials, after the section 1022 reviews are  completed and based on any lessons learned, CFPB may develop a plan  pursuant to E.O. 13,579 to review its existing rules on a recurring basis.  In a related effort, CFPB requested public comment in December 2011 on  streamlining regulations it inherited from other federal agencies. As a  result of the comments received, CFPB has identified several priority  areas for regulatory action.", "Only CFTC and SEC voluntarily developed retrospective review plans in  response to the executive order. In a June 2011 request for information,  CFTC outlined a two-phase plan to conduct periodic, retrospective  reviews of its existing regulations. Under the first phase, CFTC has examined and revised a number of its existing regulations as part of its  implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the second phase, CFTC  plans to conduct retrospective reviews of the remainder of its regulations  after substantial completion of its Dodd-Frank rulemakings. CFTC has  provided OMB with periodic status reports on its retrospective review plan  and reported in July 2013 that it still is in phase one. In a September 2011  request for information, SEC requested public comments to assist it in  developing a retrospective review plan as part of its ongoing efforts to  update its regulations and in light of E.O. 13,579.

Also, CFPB is required to solicit public comment to inform  its statutorily required retrospective reviews.", "Prioritization. Per OMB\u2019s guidance, the plan should specify factors  that the agency will consider and the process that the agency will use  in setting priorities and selecting rules for review. To the extent  feasible, the plan should also include an initial list of candidate rules  for review over the next two years, with clear timelines and deadlines.  Regulators generally have not specified the factors that they will use  to prioritize and select rules for review but have indicated that they  plan to do so. CFTC and SEC asked for public comments on the  factors they should use to prioritize and select rules for review. In its  plan, CFTC noted that its Regulatory Review Group, consisting of  senior staff, will recommend to the CFTC Commission a list of  candidate rules for review, in part based on public comments. Under  the EGRPRA review, the prudential regulators are required to  categorize regulations by type and seek public comment on them to  identify regulatory areas that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly  burdensome. According to FDIC staff, prudential regulators are  developing a plan to efficiently and effectively complete the EGRPRA  review process. Lastly, CFPB\u2019s review under the Dodd-Frank Act  must cover all of its significant rules, and NCUA\u2019s review covers one- third of the agency\u2019s rules annually.", "Analysis of costs and benefits. Per OMB\u2019s guidance, agencies may  find it useful to engage in a retrospective analysis of the costs and  benefits (both quantitative and qualitative) of regulations chosen for  review. The guidance suggests that the plan may address the metrics  that the agency will use to evaluate regulations after they have been  implemented, and the steps the agency has taken to ensure that it  has high-quality data and robust models with which to conduct  retrospective analyses. Regulators generally have not yet specified  the metrics they will use to evaluate regulations or steps to be taken  to ensure that they have high-quality data with which to conduct their  retrospective analysis. SEC asked for public comments on, among  other things, how it can obtain and consider data and analyses to  assess the benefits of its rules. Likewise, CFPB officials told us that  they are exploring what data they may collect to analyze their rules.", "Structure and staffing. Per OMB\u2019s guidance, responsibility for  retrospective review should be vested with a high-level agency official  who can secure cooperation across the agency. The plan should also  consider how best to maintain sufficient independence from the  offices responsible for writing and implementing regulations. Finally,  the plan should identify possible actions to strengthen internal review  expertise, if necessary. Regulators generally expect their office of  general counsel or other nonrulemaking group to be responsible for  overseeing implementation of their plans. For example, SEC has  indicated that its Division of Economic and Risk Analysis will conduct  the retrospective evaluations, and CFTC plans to form a group of  senior staff that will implement its retrospective review plan. CFPB  officials told us that the agency\u2019s research group likely will oversee the  reviews. NCUA\u2019s Office of General Counsel conducts the agency\u2019s  retrospective reviews.", "Coordination with other forms of retrospective analysis and  review. Per OMB\u2019s guidance, many independent agencies already  are engaged in retrospective analysis and review under existing  requirements and authorities. The guidance states that it is  appropriate to use existing processes and information as significant  inputs into plans. As discussed, prudential regulators are using their  existing retrospective reviews in lieu of developing specific  retrospective review plans in response to E.O. 13,579.", "Revisiting their retrospective analyses of their Dodd-Frank regulations  after the regulations are implemented will allow regulators to determine  whether regulations are achieving their intended purpose without creating  unintended consequences that negatively impact the markets. Such  reviews can also signal whether changes should be made to the existing  rules to better achieve their intended purposes. In our prior work, we  identified procedures and practices that could be particularly helpful in  improving the effectiveness of retrospective reviews. In particular, we  noted that agencies would be better prepared to undertake reviews if they  had identified the needed data before beginning a review and, even  better, before promulgating the rule. If agencies fail to plan for how they  will measure the performance of their rules and how they will obtain the  data they need to do so, they may be limited in their ability to accurately  measure the progress or true effect of the regulations. In that regard, we  recommended in our prior report that the federal financial regulators  develop plans that determine how they will measure the impact of Dodd- Frank regulations\u2014for example, determining how and when to collect,  analyze, and report needed data.

As provided by CRA, these rules  could not take effect until the later of 60 days after Congress receives the  rule report, or 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register,  as long as Congress does not pass a joint resolution of disapproval. OMB  provided guidance on implementing CRA in 1999, but such guidance  does not establish standardized processes for submitting rules to OMB  for its review or applying CRA\u2019s criteria. In the absence of such guidance,  we found that federal financial regulators may have used different  processes for submitting their rules and analyses to OMB, and for  applying CRA criteria.

Treasury (on behalf of FSOC) and  NCUA provided written comments that we have reprinted in appendixes  IX and X, respectively. In its comment letter, Treasury noted that FSOC  has taken a variety of actions to facilitate coordination and consultation  among financial regulators, such as through its deputies and functional  committees, and continually seeks ways to further enhance collaboration.  We describe these actions in the draft report. In its letter, NCUA agreed  with our findings, conclusions, and recommendation.", "OMB staff provided comments on a draft of our report via e-mail through  their GAO liaison on November 25, 2013. In those comments, OMB  disagreed with our findings and recommendation concerning OMB\u2019s  application of the major rule criteria under CRA. Specifically, OMB  disagreed with our findings that OMB inconsistently applied CRA criteria  in its designation of major rules and stated that the examples in our draft  report are not actual inconsistencies in the application of the CRA criteria.  In addition, OMB noted that two of our examples reflected a challenge  faced by OMB in determining whether a rule is major. Specifically,  agencies often do not have the data needed to conduct a precise analysis  of a rule\u2019s economic impact but, nevertheless, will recommend that a rule  be designated as major if their analysis strongly suggests that the rule  may be major. OMB said that in these circumstances, it generally will rely  on an agency\u2019s expert judgment and concur with its recommendation.  Furthermore, OMB said that even if some rule determinations under CRA  were inconsistent, such outcomes may not result in any real-world  consequence. For example, a rule incorrectly determined to be non-major  under CRA could have an effective date less than 60 days after the rule\u2019s  submission to Congress, but only if the agency did not plan to set the  rule's effective date 60 or more days after the rule\u2019s submission. Finally,  given these concerns, OMB questioned what new guidance to agencies  would entail. Therefore, OMB suggested eliminating the recommendation  from the draft report.", "We maintain that the findings and recommendation on the major rule  designation process are appropriate. First, we did not seek to determine  whether any of the individual rules we reviewed were misclassified under  CRA. Instead, our analysis identified examples in which federal agencies  used different processes (1) for submitting their rules and supporting  analyses to OMB and (2) in applying the CRA major rule criteria, which  we concluded could lead to inconsistent classifications of similar rules  under CRA. Indeed, determining whether any of the rules we reviewed  actually were misclassified is not possible without clear guidance on  whether agencies, for example, may consider a rule's indirect  consequences, combine similar rules, or add a rule's benefits and costs in  developing their designation recommendation. Our recommendation  serves to address this gap in guidance and help ensure more  standardized processes. We clarified a heading in the draft report to  reflect our focus on the processes used by OMB and federal financial  regulators.", "Second, we agree that federal financial regulators face challenges in  quantifying the benefits and costs of their rules and have highlighted such  challenges in our prior reports. However, again, our findings and  recommendation focus on inconsistencies in the processes used by OMB  and federal financial regulators to designate major rules under CRA\u2014not  on the analyses conducted by the regulators.", "Third, CRA gives Congress 60 days to review a major rule before the rule  can become effective, during which time Congress can issue a joint  resolution disapproving the rule. While OMB notes that there might not be  a real-world consequence if a rule is misclassified as non-major, this  outcome relies on the issuing agency setting an effective date for the rule  of at least 60 days after a rule\u2019s submission to Congress. Moreover, such  a misclassification could infringe upon Congress\u2019s ability to reject the rule.  Additionally, under CRA, GAO is required to provide Congress with a  report on each major rule that contains GAO\u2019s assessment of each  issuing agency\u2019s compliance with the procedural steps required by  various acts and executive orders, including preparation of a cost-benefit  analysis. In its mandated annual reports to Congress discussing the  benefits and costs of federal regulations, OMB has stated that it uses  GAO major rule reports as the sole source of information for analyzing  major rules issued by independent regulatory agencies.misclassification of a major rule as non-major would mean that  information on that rule would not be highlighted to Congress and the  public in a GAO report and would, in turn, not be considered in OMB\u2019s  annual reports to Congress on the benefits and costs of federal  regulations.", "Finally, although OMB issued guidance to federal agencies in 1999 on  implementing CRA, the guidance did not clearly articulate the processes  agencies should use to (1) submit their rules and analysis to OMB or (2)  apply the CRA major rule criteria. In the absence of such guidance, we  found that federal financial regulators varied in the processes they used  to submit rules and analysis to OMB and their application of CRA criteria.  For example, as we discuss in the report, SEC and CFPB staff told us  that they did not know whether they were permitted to add costs and  benefits or combine rules, respectively, in assessing whether a rule was  major. In that regard, we maintain that additional guidance on the  processes we identified would enhance the ability of OMB and federal  financial regulators to fulfill their responsibilities under CRA.", "We are sending copies of this report to CFPB, CFTC, FDIC, the Federal  Reserve Board, FSOC, NCUA, OMB, OCC, SEC, Treasury, interested  congressional committees and members, and others.

More  specifically, we examined (1) the regulatory analysis conducted by federal  agencies in their Dodd-Frank rulemakings, including their assessments of  which rules they considered to be major rules under the Congressional  Review Act (CRA); (2) interagency coordination by the agencies in their  Dodd-Frank rulemakings and by the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau (CFPB) with other agencies in connection to its supervision of  large banks and certain nonbank financial service providers; and (3)  possible impact of selected Dodd-Frank provisions and their  implementing regulations and agency plans to assess such regulations  retrospectively.", "To examine the regulatory analyses and coordination conducted by the  regulators, we focused our analysis on final rules issued pursuant to the  Dodd-Frank Act that became effective from July 24, 2012, through July  22, 2013, a total of 70 rules (see app. II). To identify these rules, we used  a website maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that  tracks Dodd-Frank regulations. from the agencies under review.", "In this report, we use the terms \u201crules,\u201d \u201cregulations,\u201d or \u201crulemakings\u201d generally to refer  to Federal Register notices of agency action pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, including  regulations, interpretive rules, general statements of policy, guidance, and rules that deal  with agency organization, procedure, or practice. Combined with our past two reports, we  have reviewed all Dodd-Frank Act rules in effect as of July 22, 2013. See GAO, Dodd- Frank Act Regulations: Implementation Could Benefit from Additional Analyses and  Coordination, GAO-12-151 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 10, 2011), and Dodd-Frank Act  Regulations: Agencies\u2019 Efforts to Analyze and Coordinate Their Rules, GAO-13-101  (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 18, 2012). under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014and required the agencies to  conduct some form of regulatory analysis. For each of the 59 rules, we  reviewed final rule Federal Register releases to document and summarize  the analyses conducted by the regulators under review. Using GAO\u2019s  Federal Rules database we found that 10 of the 59 rules were classified  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the  rulemaking agencies, as major rules under CRA (that is, have resulted in  or are likely to result in an annual impact on the economy of $100 million  or more, a major increase in costs or prices, or significant adverse effects  on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on  the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based  enterprises in domestic and export markets). For agencies subject to  Executive Order 12,866 (E.O. 12,866), such major rules would be  considered significant regulatory actions and subject to formal benefit- cost analysis. We developed a data collection instrument to compare  and assess the regulatory analysis conducted for the 10 major rules  against the principles outlined in OMB Circular A-4, which provides  guidance to federal agencies on the development of regulatory analysis.  To conduct our analyses, we reviewed Federal Register releases of the  proposed and final rules. To examine how OMB, in consultation with  federal agencies, classifies rules as major, we reviewed CRA, GAO  reports, and other material. Rather than limiting our scope to major rules  effective from July 24, 2012, through July 22, 2013, we reviewed and  analyzed all final Dodd-Frank rules classified as major as of July 22,  2013. To identify such major rules, we relied on GAO\u2019s Federal Rules  database. We identified 36 major rules issued pursuant to the Dodd- Frank Act (which includes the 10 major rules mentioned above) and  corroborated our list with federal agencies under review. To examine the  basis for classifying the rules as major, we reviewed the impact analyses  prepared by the agencies and provided to OMB, if available; GAO reports  on major rules; and Federal Register releases on the rules. We also  interviewed officials from OMB and federal agencies about the processes  used to classify major rules.", "To examine interagency coordination among the regulators, we reviewed  the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Register releases, and GAO reports to  identify the interagency coordination or consultation requirements for the  70 Dodd-Frank rules within our scope. We also interviewed officials or  staff from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), CFPB,  and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to identify which  rules were subject to interagency coordination requirements under Titles  VII and X of the act. We found evidence of coordination between the  rulemaking agency and other regulators for 49 of the 70 regulations that  we reviewed. We reviewed the Federal Register releases of the proposed  and final rules and interviewed agency officials to document whether the  agencies coordinated or consulted with other U.S., foreign, or  international regulators, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act or on a  voluntary basis. To examine steps taken by CFPB to comply with the  act\u2019s interagency coordination and information-sharing requirements for  its supervision activities, we reviewed the act; CFPB\u2019s Supervision and  Examination Manual, memorandums of understanding with federal and  state regulators on interagency coordination, and other agency  documents; and GAO reports. We also interviewed officials from CFPB  and federal prudential regulators about their coordination with each other  and coordination challenges.", "Finally, we took a multipronged approach to analyze what is known about  the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial marketplace. First, we  used bank holding company data from the Federal Reserve Bank of  Chicago (from FR Y-9C), Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Federal  Reserve Board\u2019s National Information Center, to update our indicators  monitoring changes in certain characteristics of systemically important  financial institutions (SIFI) that might be affected by Dodd-Frank  regulations.impact of the act on SIFIs, the indicators have a number of limitations,  including that they do not identify any causal linkages between the act  and changes in the indicators. Moreover, factors other than the act affect  SIFIs and, thus, the indicators. Second, we used the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago data to update our economic analysis estimating  changes in the (1) cost of credit provided by bank SIFIs and (2) safety  and soundness of bank SIFIs. Our analysis does not differentiate the  effects of the act from simultaneous changes in economic conditions or  other factors that may affect such companies. Third, the Dodd-Frank Act  requires CFTC, SEC, and the prudential regulators to implement new  reforms for swaps and security-based swaps to reduce risk, increase  transparency, and improve market integrity. For example, the act provides  for the registration of swap dealers, including subjecting them to minimum  margin requirements, and authorizes CFTC and SEC to impose  mandatory clearing requirements on swaps. We developed margin and  clearing indicators that may reflect the act\u2019s impact on these activities  using bank holding company data from the Federal Reserve Bank of  Chicago (from FR Y-9C) and CFTC\u2019s Swaps Report, respectively. As new  data become available, we expect to update and, as warranted, revise  our indicators and create additional indicators to cover other provisions.  Although changes in our indicators may be suggestive of the act\u2019s impact  on the swaps market, the indicators have a number of limitations,  including that they do not identify causal linkages between the act and  changes in the indicators. Fourth, to assess agency plans to conduct  retrospective reviews of their existing rules, we reviewed executive  orders, including E.O. 13,579 that asks independent regulatory agencies  to prepare retrospective review plans; OMB guidance; Federal Register  releases, policies, and other agency documents pertaining to  retrospective reviews; and GAO reports. Finally, we interviewed federal  financial regulators about their plans to conduct retrospective reviews of  their Dodd-Frank rules.

The size and complexity indicators  reflect the potential for a single company\u2019s financial distress to affect the  financial system and economy. The leverage and liquidity indicators  reflect a SIFI\u2019s resilience to shocks or its vulnerability to financial distress.

Total assets do not reflect an  institution\u2019s risk exposure from off-balance sheet activities and generally  treat all assets as equally risky. The calculation of risk-weighted assets is  designed to reflect differences in risk, but the weights assigned to the  assets may not fully reflect the risk exposure associated with those  assets, for example, because assets in broad categories of loans all  receive the same risk weight.", "Our indicators suggest that large and other bank SIFIs have decreased  their leverage since the third quarter of 2010, but have slightly decreased  or not changed their leverage levels over the past year.", "Figure 9 shows that median tangible common equity as a percentage  of total assets generally continued its upward trend for large and other  bank SIFIs from the third quarter of 2010 through the second quarter  of 2013.

Short-term liabilities are balance  sheet obligations due within 1 year; an institution\u2019s short-term liabilities as  a percentage of total liabilities are a measure of its need for liquidity.  Liquid assets can easily be sold without affecting their price and, thus,  can be easily converted to cash to cover debts that come due.  Accordingly, liquid assets as a percentage of an institution\u2019s short-term  liabilities are a measure of access to liquidity. For example, if this  percentage is under 100 percent, the institution does not have sufficient  access to liquidity and is unlikely to have enough liquid assets to cover its  short-term debt. A limitation of both of these indicators is that they do not  include off-balance sheet liabilities, such as callable derivatives or  potential derivatives-related obligations. The second indicator also does  not include off-balance sheet liquid assets, such as short-term income  from derivative contracts.", "Our indicators show that U.S. bank SIFIs have improved their liquidity  from the third quarter of 2010 through the second quarter of 2013,  although one of our measures shows that large bank SIFIs\u2019 liquidity  deteriorated from mid-2012 to mid-2013. The figures also show that large  bank SIFIs held relatively more short-term liabilities and liquid assets to  cover such liabilities than other bank SIFIs.", "Figure 11 shows that median short-term liabilities as a percentage of  total liabilities for large bank SIFIs decreased from 55.1 percent to  52.0 percent (or by about 6 percent) over the period, but it increased  from mid-2012 to mid-2013, reversing a downward trend.

We compared the changes in the characteristics of U.S. bank SIFIs over  time to changes in the characteristics of other U.S. bank holding  companies over time.

A bank holding company\u2019s funding cost is the cost of  deposits or liabilities that it then uses to make loans or otherwise  acquire assets. More specifically, a bank holding company\u2019s funding  cost is the interest rate it pays when it borrows funds. All else being  equal, the greater a bank holding company\u2019s funding cost, the greater  the interest rate it charges when it makes loans. We measure funding  cost as an institution\u2019s interest expense as a percentage of interest- bearing liabilities.", "Capital adequacy. Capital absorbs losses, promotes public  confidence, helps restrict excessive asset growth, and provides  protection to creditors. We use two alternative measures of capital  adequacy: tangible common equity as a percentage of total assets  and tangible common equity as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.", "Asset quality. Asset quality reflects the quantity of existing and  potential credit risk associated with the institution\u2019s loan and  investment portfolios and other assets, as well as off-balance sheet  transactions. Asset quality also reflects the ability of management to  identify and manage credit risk. We measure asset quality as  performing assets as a percentage of total assets, where performing  assets are equal to total assets less assets 90 days or more past due  and still accruing interest, assets in non-accrual status, and other real  estate owned.", "Earnings. Earnings are the initial safeguard against the risks of  engaging in the banking business and represent the first line of  defense against capital depletion that can result from declining asset  values. We measure earnings as net income as a percentage of total  assets.", "Liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability to fund assets and meet  obligations as they become due, and liquidity risk is the risk of not  being able to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable  time period to meet obligations as they become due. We use two  different variables to measure liquidity. The first variable is liquid  assets as a percentage of volatile liabilities. This variable is similar in  spirit to the liquidity coverage ratio introduced by the Basel Committee  on Banking Supervision and measures a bank holding company\u2019s  capacity to meet its liquidity needs under a significantly severe  liquidity stress scenario. We measure liquid assets as the sum of cash  and balances due from depository institutions, securities (less pledged  securities), federal funds sold and reverse repurchases, and trading  assets. We measure volatile liabilities as the sum of federal funds  purchased and repurchase agreements, trading liabilities (less  derivatives with negative fair value), other borrowed funds, deposits  held in foreign offices, and large time deposits held in domestic  offices. Large time deposits are defined as time deposits greater than  $100,000 prior to March 2010 and as time deposits greater than  $250,000 in and after March 2010.", "The second liquidity variable is stable liabilities as a percentage of  total liabilities. This variable measures the extent to which a bank  holding company relies on stable funding sources to finance its assets  and activities. This variable is related in spirit to the net stable funding  ratio introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,  which measures the amount of stable funding based on the liquidity  characteristics of an institution\u2019s assets and activities over a 1 year  horizon. We measure stable funding as total liabilities minus volatile  liabilities as described earlier.", "Finally, we include a limited number of independent variables (Xbq) to  control for factors that may differentially affect SIFIs and non-SIFIs in the  quarters since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. We include these  variables to reduce the likelihood that our estimates of the impact of new  requirements for SIFIs are reflecting something other than the impact of  the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s new requirements for SIFIs.", "Nontraditional income. Nontraditional income generally captures  income from capital market activities. Bank holding companies with  more nontraditional income are likely to have different business  models than those with more income from traditional banking  activities. Changes in capital markets in the period since the Dodd- Frank Act was enacted may have had a greater effect on bank holding  companies with more nontraditional income. If bank SIFIs typically  have more nontraditional income than other bank holding companies,  then changes in capital markets in the time since the Dodd-Frank Act  was enacted may have differentially affected the two groups. We  measure nontraditional income as the sum of trading revenue;  investment banking, advisory, brokerage, and underwriting fees and  commissions; venture capital revenue; insurance commissions and  fees; and interest income from trading assets less associated interest  expense, and we express nontraditional income as a percentage of  operating revenue.", "Securitization income. Bank holding companies with more income  from securitization are likely to have different business models than  those with more income from traditional banking associated with an  originate-to-hold strategy for loans. Changes in the market for  securitized products in the period since the Dodd-Frank Act was  enacted may thus have had a greater effect on bank holding  companies with more securitization income. If bank SIFIs typically  have more securitization income than other bank holding companies,  then changes in the market for securitized products in the time since  the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted may have differentially affected the  two groups. We measure securitization income as the sum of net  servicing fees, net securitization income, and interest and dividend  income on mortgage-backed securities minus associated interest  expense, and we express securitization as a percentage of operating  revenue. Operating revenue is the sum of interest income and  noninterest income less interest expense and loan loss provisions.", "Foreign exposure. Changes in other countries, such as the  sovereign debt crisis in Europe, may have a larger effect on bank  holding companies with more foreign exposure. If bank SIFIs typically  have more foreign exposure than other bank holding companies, then  changes in foreign markets may have differentially affected the two  groups. We measure foreign exposure as the sum of foreign debt  securities (held-to-maturity and available-for-sale), foreign bank loans,  commercial and industrial loans to non-U.S. addresses, and foreign  government loans. We express foreign exposure as a percentage of  total assets.", "Size. We include size because bank SIFIs tend to be larger than other  bank holding companies, and market pressures or other forces not  otherwise accounted for may have differentially affected large and  small bank holding companies in the time since the Dodd-Frank Act  was enacted. We measure the size of a bank holding company as the  natural logarithm of its total assets.", "CPP participation. We control for whether or not a bank holding  company participated in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP)  component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to  differentiate any impact that this program may have had from the  impact of the Dodd-Frank Act.", "We also conducted several sets of robustness checks:", "We restricted our sample to the set of institutions with assets that are  \u201cclose\u201d to the $50 billion cutoff for enhanced prudential regulation for  bank SIFIs. Specifically, we analyzed two restricted samples of bank  holding companies: (1) bank holding companies with assets between  $25 billion and $75 billion and (2) bank holding companies with assets  between $1 billion and $100 billion.", "We examined different treatment start dates. Specifically, we allowed  the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s new requirements for SIFIs to have an impact in  2009 quarter 3, 1 year prior to the passage of the act. We did so to  allow for the possibility that institutions began to react to the act\u2019s  requirements in anticipation of the act being passed.", "We analyzed alternative measures of capital adequacy, including  equity capital as a percentage of total assets and Tier 1 capital as a  percentage of risk-weighted assets.", "We allowed the effect of the treatment to vary by quarter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data", "paragraphs": ["We conducted our analysis using quarterly data on bank holding  companies that filed form FR Y-9C obtained from the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago for the period from the first quarter of 2006 to the second  quarter of 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["Our econometric analysis assesses the initial impact of the Dodd-Frank  Act\u2019s new requirements for bank SIFIs on (1) the cost of credit they  provide and (2) their safety and soundness. Our analysis leverages the  Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s requirement that bank holding companies with total  consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to enhanced  regulation by the Federal Reserve but other bank holding companies are  not by comparing funding costs, capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings,  and liquidity for bank SIFIs and non-SIFI bank holding companies before  and after the implementation of the enhanced prudential requirements. All  else being equal, the difference in the comparative differences is the  inferred effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on bank SIFIs. While some of the  SIFI-related rulemakings have yet to be finalized, our estimates are  suggestive of the initial effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on bank SIFIs and  provide a baseline against which to compare future results.", "Our baseline estimates suggest that the Dodd-Frank Act has not been  associated with a significant change in U.S. bank SIFIs\u2019 funding costs  (table 12). To the extent that the cost of credit provided by bank SIFIs is a  function of their funding costs, the new requirements for SIFIs are likely to  have had little effect on the cost of credit to date.", "Our baseline estimates also suggest that the Dodd-Frank Act is  associated with improvements in most measures of U.S. bank SIFIs\u2019  safety and soundness. Bank SIFIs appear to be holding more capital than  they otherwise would have held in every quarter since the Dodd-Frank  Act was enacted (see \u201cBaseline\u201d column in table 12). The quality of  assets on the balance sheets of bank SIFIs also seems to have improved  since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The act is associated with higher  earnings for bank SIFIs in the time period after the act\u2019s enactment. It is  also associated with improved liquidity as measured by the extent to  which a bank holding company is using stable sources of funding. The  only measure that has not clearly improved since the act\u2019s enactment was  liquidity as measured by the capacity of a bank holding company\u2019s liquid  assets to cover its volatile liabilities. Thus, the Dodd-Frank Act appears to  be broadly associated with improvements in most indicators of safety and  soundness for U.S. bank SIFIs (relative to non-SIFI bank holding  companies).", "Our approach allows us to partially differentiate changes in funding costs,  capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and liquidity associated with the  Dodd-Frank Act from changes due to other factors. However, several  factors make isolating and measuring the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s  new requirements for SIFIs challenging. The effects of the act cannot be  differentiated from the effects of simultaneous changes in economic  conditions, such as the pace of the recovery from the recent recession, or  regulations, such as those stemming from Basel III, or other changes,  such as in credit ratings that differentially may affect bank SIFIs and other  bank holding companies. In addition, some of the new requirements for  SIFIs have yet to be implemented. Nevertheless, our estimates are  suggestive of the initial effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on bank SIFIs and  provide a baseline against which to compare future trends.", "The results of our robustness checks are as follows:", "Our results for funding costs are generally robust to restricting the set  of bank holding companies we analyze to those with assets of $25  billion-$75 billion, but our results for capital adequacy, asset quality,  earnings, and liquidity are not.", "Our results are generally robust to restricting the set of bank holding  companies we analyze to those with assets of $1 billion-$100 billion.", "Our results are generally robust to starting the treatment in the third  quarter of 2009, 1 year prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.  This finding is consistent with the idea that bank holding companies  began to change their behavior in anticipation of the act\u2019s  requirements, perhaps as information about the content of the act  became available and the likelihood of its passage increased.  However, there may be other explanations, including anticipation of  Basel III requirements, reactions to stress tests, and market pressures  to improve capital adequacy and liquidity.", "Our results for the impact on capital adequacy are generally similar  when we measure capital adequacy using Tier 1 capital as a  percentage of assets or risk-weighted assets but not when we  measure capital adequacy using equity capital as a percentage of  assets (see table 13).", "Our results are generally robust to allowing the treatment effect to  vary by quarter (see table 14)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Dodd-Frank Rules Implementing Central Clearing, Capital, and Margin Swap Reforms", "paragraphs": ["The following tables list select Dodd-Frank rules that implement sections  of Title VII related to central clearing requirements for swaps and security- based swaps, and margin and capital requirements for swaps entities, as  of November 15, 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Financial Stability Oversight Council", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the National Credit Union Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: GAO Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Richard Tsuhara (Assistant  Director), Silvia Arbelaez-Ellis, Timothy Bober, William R.
