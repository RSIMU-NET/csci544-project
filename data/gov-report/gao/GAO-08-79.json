As a result of the schedule changes, the full complement of systems and functionality that were originally planned will not be available for the Dress Rehearsal operational testing. This limitation increases the importance of further system testing to ensure that the decennial systems work as intended. The Bureau's project teams for each of the four IT acquisitions have performed many practices associated with establishing sound and capable risk management processes, but critical weaknesses remain. Three project teams had developed a risk management strategy that identified the scope of the risk management effort. However, not all project teams had identified risks, established mitigation plans, or reported risks to executive-level officials. For example, one project team did not adequately identify risks associated with performance issues experienced by mobile computing devices. In addition, three project teams developed mitigation plans that were often untimely or included incomplete activities and milestones for addressing the risks.

Delaying functionality  increases the importance of later development and testing activities, which  will have to occur closer to the census date. It also raises the risk of cost  increases, given the immovable deadline for conducting the 2010 Census.", "The Bureau\u2019s project teams for each of the four acquisitions have  implemented many practices associated with establishing sound and  capable risk management processes, but they are not always consistent:  the teams have not always identified risks, developed complete risk  mitigation plans, or briefed senior-level officials on risks and mitigation  plans. Among risks that were not identified are those associated with the  FDCA mobile computing devices and systems testing. Also, mitigation  plans were often untimely or incomplete. Further, no evidence was  available of senior-level briefings to discuss risks and mitigation plans.", "One reason for these weaknesses is the absence of Bureau policies for  managing major acquisitions, as we pointed out in earlier work.

According to the department, although  some minimal functionalities are not a part of the Dress Rehearsal, all  critical systems and interfaces would be tested during the 2008 Dress  Rehearsal. It planned to conduct additional fully integrated testing of all  systems and interfaces after the Dress Rehearsal, including the  functionalities not included in the Dress Rehearsal itself. It also planned to  incorporate lessons learned from the Dress Rehearsal in this later testing.  Nonetheless, the Bureau\u2019s test plans have not been finalized. Further, the  Dress Rehearsal will not include two critical systems (the DRIS telephone  system and the DADS II tabulation system). Thus, it remains unclear  whether testing will in fact address all interrelated systems and  functionality in a census-like environment. Consistent with our  recommendation, following up with documented test plans to do end-to- end testing would help ensure that decennial systems will work as  intended.", "With regard to risk management, the department said it plans to examine  additional ways to manage risks and will prepare a formal action plan in  response to our final report.

However, the project did not identify  significant risks for the project office to monitor and track related to  problems arising during the address canvassing component of the Dress  Rehearsal.

The CMMI model was  developed by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute  (SEI) and includes criteria to evaluate risk management for development  and maintenance activities. We adapted these CMMI criteria and  performed a Class B Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process  Improvement to evaluate the risk management of program teams and  contractors involved in the decennial system acquisitions and  development initiatives. In doing so, we selected leading practices within  the areas of preparing for risk management, identifying and analyzing  risks, mitigating risks, and executive oversight. We evaluated the practices  as fully implemented, partially implemented, or not implemented.

Specifically, we met with project team  officials for the four key decennial system acquisitions and their primary  contractors (Harris Corporation and Lockheed Martin), as applicable. We  also reviewed the lists of risks identified by each of the project teams and  their primary contractors and assessed their accuracy and completeness,  including whether the risks were associated with the acquisition\u2019s  development plans.", "We conducted our work from December 2006 through August 2007 in the  Washington, D.C., metropolitan area in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Key 2010 Census Information Technology Acquisitions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Harris Corporation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the department\u2019s letter dated  September 25, 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  Although the department states that it plans to test all critical systems  and interfaces either during or after the Dress Rehearsal, we are aware  of two critical systems (the DRIS telephone system and the DADS II  tabulation system) that are not to be included in the Dress Rehearsal,  and the Bureau\u2019s plans are not yet finalized. As a result, we stand by  our characterization that operational testing would take place during  the Dress Rehearsal without the full complement of systems and  functionality originally planned. Consistent with our recommendation,  following up with documented test plans to do end-to-end testing  would help ensure that systems work as intended.    2.  The department said that our statement could be interpreted that cost  increases resulted from an increase in the number of system  requirements. It said this is not entirely accurate because although  some requirements were added (generally related to security), other  cost increases were due to the process of developing detailed  requirements from high-level functional requirements. However, it is  our view that the process of developing detailed requirements from  high-level functional requirement does not inevitably lead to cost  increases if the functional requirements were initially well-defined.  3.  See comment 1.  4.  We have modified our report to reflect this additional information.", "However, although our discussion of schedule and cost changes  preceded our discussion of risk management, we did not intend to  imply that risk management weaknesses had contributed to these  changes. We revised our report to help clarify this.  5.  We have revised our report to clarify the use of automation for data  collection for all FDCA components.       6.  See comment 1.  7.  We agree that this statement is referring to all FDCA equipment,  infrastructure, and systems.   8.  We have revised our report to update the status of the systems.   9.  We have revised our report to reflect the status of the office site  selections.    10. See comment 2.  11. We disagree with the department\u2019s comment that \u201ccost overrun\u201d refers  to a contractor originally underestimating costs. We use \u201ccost overrun\u201d  to refer to any increase in costs from original estimates.  12. We have revised our report to reflect this information.  13. We have revised our report to add this information.  14. We agree that the FDCA project identified certain risks, as the  department describes. However, although it identified risks associated  with handheld mobile computing devices and assigned responsibility  for these to the contractor, it did not identify significant risks for the  project office to monitor and track related to problems arising during  the address canvassing component of the Dress Rehearsal. In addition,  although this project identified interface management as a risk, it did  not identify specific risks related to other systems. Accordingly,  although we modified our report to reflect this information, we did not  change our overall evaluation.  15. The department stated that for the FDCA and MTAIP projects, risk  status is regularly discussed with executive-level officials at  Commerce and the Bureau, and that it provided us with briefing slides  to support this statement. It said that it also uses other communication  channels to report project issues and risks. However, the evidence  provided did not show that FDCA and MTAIP risks were regularly  discussed with executive-level officials. For example, while the FDCA  project provided two presentations in October 2006 and March 2007,  these presentations did not have discussions of risk and mitigation  plans. Similarly, our review of the MTAIP project teams\u2019 presentations  during quarterly reviews did not show that risk status was discussed.  Therefore, we still conclude that these projects, unlike the other two,  did not have sufficient evidence that executive-level officials were  being regularly briefed on risk status.  16.
