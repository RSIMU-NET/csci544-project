Approximately 75 percent paid for reconstruction activities, with the remainder supporting humanitarian and quick-impact projects. Conversely, in 2002-2003, humanitarian and quick-impact assistance accounted for more than three-fourths of U.S. spending. The United States continued to be the largest donor, contributing about 38 percent of the $3.6 billion pledged by the international community. U.S. humanitarian assistance benefited vulnerable populations in fiscal year 2004. Further, the United States increased reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and made notable progress in several sectors through its \"Accelerating Success Initiative\". Although progress varied among sectors, the United States did not meet all of its targets due to security and other obstacles. For example, USAID intended to rehabilitate or build 286 schools by the end of 2004. However, owing to poor contractor performance and security problems, by September 2004 it had completed only 8. As in 2002-2003, complete financial information was not readily available, and USAID lacked a comprehensive strategy to direct its efforts. Further, USAID did not consistently require contractors to fulfill contract provisions needed to ensure accountability and oversight. USAID also did not systematically collect information needed to assess the progress of its major projects. Moreover, measures provided by the embassy to decision-makers in Washington did not comprehensively portray progress in each sector or the overall U.S. program. Deteriorating security, increased opium production, and delayed funding continued to obstruct U.S. reconstruction efforts in fiscal year 2004 and threatened the achievement of U.S. goals. Deteriorating security rendered large areas inaccessible to the assistance community, and the continued rise in opium production undermined legitimate economic activity. In addition, most assistance funds were not available until nearly 6 months into the fiscal year, preventing USAID from accelerating reconstruction efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2001, when U.S. and coalition forces removed the Taliban regime from  power in Afghanistan, the country faced the task of rebuilding itself.  Almost a quarter century of war and years of drought had destroyed  Afghanistan\u2019s government, judicial, economic, and social institutions and  its transportation, health, and other infrastructure. To help rebuild the  country and create a stable Afghan society that would not be a threat to  itself or others, in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 the United States spent $900  million on humanitarian and reconstruction projects. In June 2004, we  reported that U.S. humanitarian and short-term assistance over the 2-year  period had helped Afghanistan\u2019s vulnerable population but that longer-term  reconstruction efforts achieved limited results in creating a stable Afghan  society. Delayed U.S. funding, small staff size, inadequate working  conditions, and a lack of a comprehensive strategy impeded progress; at  the same time, security deteriorated and opium production increased.

We analyzed data on  obligations and expenditures by U.S. government agencies providing  assistance to Afghanistan in fiscal year 2004. We conducted reliability  checks of the financial data provided by U.S. agencies and determined that  the data are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis. To  determine the reliability of the data, we contacted each of the agencies  providing assistance and each of the offices within each agency responsible  for managing specific components of the assistance, cross-checked and  corroborated the financial information provided, and created a  consolidated financial database of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan. This  effort was necessary because there is no single, consolidated source of  obligation and expenditure data for U.S. assistance to Afghanistan.  Because U.S. assistance to Afghanistan is provided as part of a larger effort  by the international community, we also analyzed information on the  contributions of other donors. In addition, we traveled to Afghanistan in  October 2004 to examine U.S. assistance-related operations in the country.  While in Afghanistan, we spoke with officials from U.S., UN, and  nongovernmental organizations; private contractors; and the Afghan  government; however, the number and location of project sites we visited  in Afghanistan were limited owing to Department of State security  restrictions.

In addition, there were  delays in the project\u2019s initiative to draft and pass legislation, due to shifting  responsibility for legislative drafting from the Judicial Reform Commission,  a temporary entity, to the permanent Ministry of Justice.

In April  2004, as part of the Accelerating Success initiative, USAID increased  funding for the contract to $95.8 million. Most of the work under the  contract was implemented by advisors and operations staff assigned  primarily to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. As of August  2004, approximately 224 advisors were working within the Ministry of  Finance.

Accomplishments included the following:  Fiscal reform. Bearing Point developed a system to estimate  government revenues; introduced a taxpayer identification number  system; trained Afghans to develop and monitor budgets; established a  national payments system; developed a customs broker licensing  program, reformed customs operations and trained customs officials;  rehabilitated and equipped customs houses and border posts; and  developed a database of customs revenues.", "Banking reform.

The assistance provided helped the Afghan government  streamline its business license application process, reducing the time to  obtain a license from months to less than 1 day and reducing the number  of required signatures from 58 to 6. In addition, the contractor also  assisted the government in reviewing and drafting commercial decrees  and laws.", "Legal and regulatory reform. The contractor assisted Afghan  ministries in drafting key laws and establishing a telecommunications  regulatory body.", "Privatization. As of October 2004, little work had been conducted in  the area of privatization, because the Afghan government was not ready  to privatize state-owned enterprises.", "Despite these accomplishments and USAID\u2019s efforts to adjust the program  to meet the government of Afghanistan\u2019s needs, the Ministry of Finance  remained dissatisfied with the cost and quality of the assistance provided  by some of the expatriate advisors hired under the contract and sought to  terminate it. In mid 2004, the Afghan government requested a review of the  program. The first evaluation, completed in September 2004, found that,  among other things, Bearing Point lacked an effective means for  determining ministry needs. USAID disagreed with the evaluation\u2019s  findings and maintains that Bearing Point worked closely with the  ministries receiving assistance and worked proactively to meet their needs.  According to the Central Bank governor, the bank\u2014the other major  recipient of assistance under the contract\u2014was generally satisfied with the  assistance provided. In November, the Ministry of Finance agreed to allow  the contract to continue until its completion date, December 2005.", "In addition, in October 2004, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of  the Central Bank were still concerned that their agencies would not be able  to sustain operations after the program\u2019s completion. To address this  concern, USAID and Bearing Point initiated plans to transfer local Afghans  working as their contractors to Afghan civil service. These individuals  would be paid with funds provided by the international community through  the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. In addition, the Central Bank  began testing the abilities of its staff on a periodic basis to determine their  ability to work in the absence of international advisors and to identify areas  where additional training was needed prior to the Bearing Point contract\u2019s  completion.", "USAID\u2019s Afghanistan Primary Education Program (APEP) provided  educational and teacher-training programs to help improve basic  education; however, under the Accelerating Success initiative, very few  schools were constructed and other components were not integrated into  educational facilities as originally envisioned.", "USAID\u2019s education program originally focused its efforts in four areas:  textbook production and distribution, radio-based teacher training,  accelerated learning, and school construction. USAID provided the bulk of  its education assistance in Afghanistan through APEP, run by Creative  Associates International, Inc. APEP was designed to ensure that newly  constructed schools were functional centers of learning by providing  textbooks, skilled teachers and opportunities for accelerating the learning  of over-aged students. The Accelerating Success initiative increased  APEP\u2019s funding ceiling from $16.5 million to $87.6 million, but it decoupled  the provision of materials and training from school construction. The  initiative introduced three additional components: in-country textbook  production; educational support services to help reform policies, systems,  and programmatic changes; and enhanced monitoring and evaluation.  Progress under the APEP contract included the following: Textbook production: According to the USAID Regional Inspector  General, USAID exceeded its textbook production goal for 2004,  producing about 16.5 million books, but distribution was delayed.", "Radio teacher training: According to the targets in the original APEP  contract, the radio teacher training broadcasts aimed to improve the  teaching skills of about 30,000, or about 96 percent of all primary school  teachers by the end of 2004. Under the Accelerating Success initiative,  the goal was reduced to reaching up to 40 percent of Afghan teachers  nationwide. After a mid-2004 survey of, primarily, participants in U.S.  education programs, USAID concluded that 70 to 90 percent of all  primary school teachers were listening to the radio teacher training  broadcasts and the number of listeners was increasing monthly.", "Accelerated learning: APEP\u2019s goal was to raise the educational levels  of 80,000 over-aged students in 13 provinces and move them into age- appropriate levels by the end of 2004. Under the Accelerating Success  initiative, the goal was expanded to 170,000 students in 17 provinces.  Under both plans, APEP intended 70 percent of beneficiaries to be  female students. By the end of fiscal year 2004, USAID had met its  student enrollment objective, but less than 60 percent of students  enrolled were girls.", "School construction: According to contract and grant  documentation, targets for school rehabilitation or construction shifted  under the Accelerating Success initiative from 50 schools to 286 schools  by the end of 2004. By September 2004, implementing partners reported  that 77 schools had been refurbished and 8 were substantially complete.", "Educational support services: Under the Accelerating Success  initiative, APEP began to provide the Ministries of Education and Higher  Education with advisors to help draft education law, improve planning  capacity, and assess English language instruction needs.", "Monitoring and evaluation: Under the original contract, APEP  produced weekly or biweekly updates, quarterly progress reports, and  an evaluation of the radio-based teacher training component. The  expanded scope includes a national study of students trained under the  accelerated program.", "USAID also instituted several other smaller education-focused projects in  2004. These included a $10 million teacher-training institute and literacy  initiative and an $11 million dormitory to house between 1,100 and 1,500  university women in Kabul.", "Despite some accomplishments, the project\u2019s ambitious program made it  difficult to meet targets on many fronts. To address health sector issues,  USAID\u2019s Rural Expansion of Afghanistan\u2019s Community-based Healthcare  (REACH) program, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health,  established a nascent health care system and provided health services and  training for health providers. USAID\u2019s REACH program, implemented by  Management Sciences for Health (MSH) under a 3-year contract, was  designed to improve the health of women of reproductive age and children  younger than 5 years. USAID\u2019s Accelerating Success initiative increased  MSH\u2019s original ceiling of approximately $100 million to $129 million. The  initiative expanded the scope of work to include, among other things, tertiary care in addition to the project\u2019s original focus on rural health care.  USAID and MSH noted progress in five health care areas. The progress in  these areas as reported by MSH is as follows:  Health care facilities and community outreach. The program  reached its stated target of awarding $53 million in service delivery  grants to more than 250 clinical facilities in 13 provinces. Service in  these facilities covers a population of approximately 4.8 million.", "Training for rural health care providers. The REACH program did  not meet its fiscal year 2004 target of training 46 midwives and 2,060  community health workers. By the end of 2004, according to  Management Sciences for Health reports, 75 midwives were in training  in Kabul, although none had finished the course, and almost 1,500  community health workers had been trained.", "Public health education programs. REACH developed a policy on  health education with the Ministry of Public Health and helped the  ministry develop standard health promotion messages. Management  Sciences for Health reporting also indicated that REACH produced  seven radio dramas and trained 21 ministry and radio staff in radio  programming.", "Ministry of Public Health capacity. REACH developed a national  health management information system and played an advisory role in  health sector reform, financing, and planning, as well as hospital  management. The REACH program helped to create a new human  resources department in the health ministry and to review and update  the national human resources policy for health staff. REACH also  contributed to the development of the National Drug Policy, the  National Medicine Agency, and donation guidelines for drug and  equipment donors. According to a midterm evaluation of the program,  REACH\u2019s efforts have been sustainable.", "Clinic construction. According to contract and grant documentation,  targets for clinic rehabilitation or construction shifted under the  Accelerating Success initiative from 50 clinics to 253 clinics by the end  of 2004. By September 2004, implementing partners reported that 15  clinics had been substantially constructed and none had been  refurbished.", "USAID\u2019s ambitious health care program stretched the capacity of  contractors, making it difficult to implement many projects simultaneously.  For example, according to the December 2004 USAID-commissioned  midterm evaluation, despite targets established in 2003, few clinics had  communication materials designed to change the health-related practices  of Afghans and most clinics remained focused on curative, rather than  preventative, care. Further, the evaluation found that despite a greater need  for community midwives than for hospital midwives, REACH developed  the capacity to train equal numbers of hospital and community midwives.  In addition, although the development of a national infection prevention  program was added to the Accelerating Success initiative, the program\u2019s  schedule was delayed by 2 to 3 months owing to a delay in finding a  program manager.", "USAID\u2019s infrastructure program focused on some of Afghanistan\u2019s large  infrastructure needs, including construction of the primary highway and  emergency electricity provision to four cities; however, progress has been  limited. USAID designed the Rehabilitation of Economic Facilities and  Services (REFS) program, to promote economic recovery and political  stability in Afghanistan by repairing selected infrastructure. To ensure  sustainability, USAID also designed REFS to strengthen pertinent  institutions\u2019 management capacity, and to strengthen Afghan construction  companies\u2019 ability to build according to international standards. The Louis  Berger Group, Inc., implemented most of the infrastructure work through  2004 under the 3-year REFS contract. Under the Accelerating Success  initiative, USAID increased REFS\u2019 funding from $143 million to $665 million  and added 12 new awards with a collective funding ceiling of almost $400  million.", "USAID\u2019s fiscal year 2004 infrastructure programs included the following: Primary roads. USAID completed the first phase of the construction of  the Kabul-Kandahar Ring Road, which decreased travel time between  the two cities from several days to 6 hours. The second phase\u2014adding  layers of asphalt, bridges, culverts, shoulders, and signage\u2014was to be  complete by October 2004, but repair work continued into 2005. USAID  also mobilized contractors and started survey work to begin the next  section of the road, from Kandahar to Herat.", "Secondary and urban roads. By fiscal year 2004, work had begun on  one urban road in Kabul, diverting traffic away from the U.S. Embassy,  and one secondary road to provide access between Kabul and a  southern city, Gardez. In addition, according to contractor reports,  planning or construction of nine additional secondary roads began;  however, by the end of fiscal year 2004, four were postponed due to lack  of funding.", "Power. To increase the power supply around Kandahar in the south,  USAID began rehabilitation of two turbines for the Kajaki Dam. By the  end of fiscal year 2004, USAID was negotiating for construction of a  third turbine as well as seeking a solution to a power shortage in Kabul.  In the meantime, USAID supplied emergency power to Kabul, Kandahar,  Lashkar Gah, and Qalat by providing fuel for generators at the cost of  approximately $3 million per month.", "Irrigation. USAID began work on several irrigation projects: the  emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Saur-e-haus Dam,  spillway, and diversion channel; rehabilitation of the Zana Khan Dam;  the Sardeh Irrigation System; and three intake systems. By the end of  fiscal year 2004, construction of the Sardeh Irrigation System and two of  the intake systems had been completed.", "Water/wastewater. By September 2004, USAID had contracted for  water availability assessments for two planned communities and for  water system assessments and design upgrades for three provincial  capitals.", "Schools and clinics construction. In the initial infrastructure contract  with the Berger Group, USAID included the construction or  rehabilitation of 40 schools and clinics as an illustrative target to be  achieved by the end of 2003, with an additional 60 buildings to be  completed by the end of 2004. The actual job orders signed in July 2003  show that the Berger Group agreed to complete 55 schools and 78  clinics. By the end of September 2003, only 1 building was completed.  USAID reduced the Berger Group\u2019s responsibility to 105 buildings and in  May 2004 provided grants to five additional organizations, with the goal  of rehabilitating or constructing a total of 774 buildings by October 31,  2004. In mid-2004, owing to, among other things, the education and  health ministries\u2019 insistence on producing new as opposed to  refurbished buildings and a lack of progress by all implementing  partners, USAID, according to grant and contract documentation,  reduced its expectations to about 530 buildings and extended the  completion deadline to December 2004. By the end of fiscal year 2004,  the implementing partners reported having refurbished 77 buildings and  substantially completed new construction of 23 buildings.", "Because the Accelerating Success initiative emphasized visible  construction, in addition to time and funding constraints, USAID largely  abandoned the REFS contract\u2019s objective of building Afghan ministry  capacity in 2004. The Berger Group had recruited and hired experts to  supply intellectual capacity at the ministries of Public Works, Irrigation,  Health and Education; however, this project was discontinued in June 2004.", "Although U.S. agencies focused on 10 of the 13 women-centered  objectives legislated by Congress, the overall impact of these efforts has  not been measured. (See app. III, table 17 for progress on objectives.)  Unlike programs for most reconstruction sectors, no overarching contract  was let to implement women-centered programs. Instead, U.S.-funded  programs incorporated components that advanced the social, economic,  and political rights and opportunities of women, dedicating about $196  million to such initiatives. For example, USAID provided more than 90,000  girls with education equivalent to one or more grade levels through the  APEP accelerated learning program and trained community health care  workers and midwives through REACH. USAID also provided democracy  and governance technical assistance, which helped over 3 million women  register for, and vote in, the 2004 presidential elections. USAID also  implemented other projects, such as reconstructing a women\u2019s dormitory  to enable more than 1,100 young women to attend university in Kabul,  establishing a women\u2019s teacher training institute, and, according to USAID,  completing 3 of 17 planned women\u2019s resource centers in provincial  capitals. Other U.S. government agencies also incorporated women\u2019s issues  into their work. For example, the Department of State granted $75,000 to  train four Afghan woman judges in civil and family law. Likewise, the DOD  included \u201cPrinciples of non-discrimination: Women in Society\u201d and other  pertinent classes in their curriculum for training the Afghan National  Police.", "In addition, the U.S.-Afghan Women\u2019s Council was created to accelerate  progress by promoting public-private partnerships between U.S. and  Afghan institutions and mobilizing private sector resources to benefit  women. The council raised about $135,000 of private sector funds from  entities such as an America Online women executives group and Daimler- Chrysler. These funds supplemented various U.S. government projects,  including training of women judges, the Afghan Family Health Book, and  community banks and microfinance loans. Many of the other projects  sponsored by the council, such as the Women\u2019s Teacher Training Institute,  were funded and managed through USAID.

An Afghan government review of USAID\u2019s  economic governance program stated that the contractor had not  developed a formal process for assessing advisors as required in the  statement of work. Consequently, it was unclear how USAID or the  contractor assessed advisors\u2019 performance, determined whether the  advisors\u2019 knowledge had been transferred to Afghan counterparts (a key  aspect of the program), or monitored the program\u2019s progress. USAID  officials stated that the program\u2019s progress was tracked through weekly  and monthly progress reports. We found that although these reports  provided information on the status of activities, they did not contain  specific performance indicators to determine the impact of the project.

Likewise, the  only two measures where reported for the democracy and governance  sector, the number of courthouses constructed, and the number of judicial  personnel trained. Those measures did not capture the performance of the  diverse activities implemented in this sector. Further, the data reported in  some sectors did not always match contractor reports. For example,  although contractor reports indicted that 77 schools were refurbished and  8 were substantially complete, reports provided to Washington indicated  that only 39 schools had been constructed or rehabilitated.", "Program managers need accurate operational information, including  performance measures, to determine whether strategic objectives are  being met.

Staff at the USAID mission in Kabul continued to manage a much larger  amount of assistance than their counterparts at other missions.  Specifically, as of June 2004, staff at the mission in Kabul managed  approximately $27.5 million in assistance per staff member while  counterparts at other missions managed $1.2 million per staff member.

However, the group\u2019s  mandate, mission, roles, and responsibilities were not delineated or  incorporated into the embassy\u2019s Mission Performance Plan. In addition,  according to ARG, USAID, and Department of State officials, the ARG  focused its efforts on criticizing USAID programs rather than providing  constructive advice. As a result, animosity developed between the ARG  advisors and some USAID and embassy staff. According to USAID and  Department of State officials we spoke to, some ARG advisors did not  coordinate Afghan ministry meetings with embassy staff or inform them  about the meetings\u2019 results. State and USAID officials stated that because  separate meetings were being held, Afghan government ministries  sometimes received conflicting messages about U.S. reconstruction  activities. Further, some USAID contractors became confused by ARG  advisors\u2019 efforts to direct the reconstruction effort. For example, ARG  advisors responsible for economic governance issues tried to direct the  activities of USAID\u2019s contractor for that sector. To clarify lines of authority,  USAID informed its contractors that they were to take direction from  USAID alone. Most U.S. officials we spoke to in November 2004 stated that  coordination with the ARG had improved; however, the roles and  responsibilities of the ARG remained unclear.", "To enhance reconstruction efforts, the U.S. government increased the  presence in the PRTs of civilian personnel from the Department of State,  USAID, and other agencies. By September 2004, about 13 Department of  State, 8 USDA, and 13 USAID representatives were stationed alongside U.S.  military personnel in PRTs across Afghanistan. However, in the absence  of a common doctrine or set of best practices for incorporating civilian  personnel, coordination varied depending on each PRT commander\u2019s  priorities and personal relationships with civilian agency representatives.  In addition, we found that stationing civilian personnel in the PRTs did not  improve oversight of Kabul-based projects. In general, USAID personnel at  the PRTs focused on identifying, implementing, and coordinating PRT- based, quick-impact projects. Few USAID technical officers stationed in  Kabul used the USAID PRT staff to help monitor reconstruction projects.  We reported that in fiscal year 2003, neither USAID officers stationed in  Kabul nor at PRTs were able to identify the location of many Kabul-directed  projects in the field.

Others that did not produce  results, such as the natural resources consultative group, were effectively  disbanded. Although USAID participated in a number of the consultative  groups, some coordination issues remained. For example, according to  USAID officials there were extensive contacts between USAID,  contractors, and ministry officials, and ministries had to approve building  designs and site locations. However, officials from the Ministries of  Education and Health believed they had been excluded from participating  in the management of the construction of schools and clinics. Further, the  lack of coordination among the Ministry of Health, USAID, and the REACH  contractor to match clinic construction site selection with the location of  health service delivery grant activities caused a significant barrier to  expanding the basic provision of health services. The Minister of  Agriculture stated that he was not regularly informed about the U.S.  agriculture program\u2019s progress and was unable to respond to public  inquiries about the program, increasing skepticism as to whether any  assistance was being delivered.

With opium-related revenues equivalent to 50 to 60 percent of its GDP over the past 3 years, Afghanistan is on the verge of becoming a narco-state.  The increase in opium production and trafficking is threatening  reconstruction and state-building in Afghanistan, as well as the nation\u2019s  longer-term peace. It is undermining legitimate economic activities and the  establishment of the rule of law and is responsible for supporting factional  agendas and antigovernment elements, including warlords, local  commanders, and terrorist organizations. The drug trade is also impeding  the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants,  because those involved in the drug economy are developing and funding  private militias needed to run the drug business.

These actions have  included imposing bans on opium cultivation, drafting counternarcotics  strategies, establishing Afghan counternarcotics police organizations, and  launching limited eradication efforts (see app. IV for more details). U.S.  counternarcotics efforts in 2004 were led by the Department of State\u2019s  Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) Affairs.  Additional assistance was provided by DOD.

However,  the contractor did not have systems in place to capture information for all  measures.", "Of three primary awards for democracy and governance activities, USAID  required only one implementing partner MSI, to develop a performance  monitoring plan containing performance measures (see table 8). The other  two partners, The Consortium for Elections and Political Process  Strengthening and the Asia Foundation, were required to produce quarterly  reports but were not required to develop specific targets or intermediate  results. Consequently, the quarterly reports described activities undertaken  during that time period, rather than progress achieved against specified  targets.", "The economic governance contract did not specifically require the  contractor to develop performance measures. Instead, it required the  reporting of \u201cmilestones\u201d in quarterly work plans. No quarterly plans were  produced until July 2004; consequently, no measures were reported until  that time. (See table 10.)", "USAID required the health contractor, Management Sciences for Health  (MSH), to develop implementation plans and performance monitoring  plans. MSH reports on selected performance indicators in these plans  semiannually. (See Table 14)", "The reported measures also provide detailed narrative about progress on  primary and secondary road projects and ongoing power-generation  projects. Irrigation projects are tracked as part of the agriculture sector,  and school and clinic construction and renovation are tracked as parts of  the education and health sectors, respectively. The measures do not track  water and sanitation projects. See table 16 below.", "The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 and the 2004 Emergency  Supplemental legislated assistance to Afghan women. USAID implemented  and tracked most of these objectives either as part of their other sector  programs or through individual women-targeted projects (see table 17.)  However, no gender-specific performance measures of sector programs nor  the results of individual women-targeted projects were reported to the  Afghanistan Interagency Operations Group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["John Hutton, David Bruno, Miriam A.
