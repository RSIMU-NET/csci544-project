Agency officials identified resource constraints as a primary reason for their lack of progress in implementing such activities, and Corps officials said that not implementing these activities could potentially result in safety risks and federal financial risks for disaster relief, among other impacts.

The impact of  levee failures was brought to national attention in 2005, when waves from  Hurricane Katrina resulted in the overtopping and failure of levees in parts  of New Orleans contributing to major devastation, including at least 1,300  deaths. Addressing the damage from the hurricane cost the federal  government more than $16 billion in disaster relief, according to data from  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It is estimated  that, across the United States, there could be more than 100,000 miles of  levees, the majority of which\u2014over 85,000 miles\u2014are owned,  maintained, or operated by nonfederal stakeholders, such as states, local  governments, tribes, and private entities. FEMA data indicate that levees  are found in approximately 22 percent of U.S. counties, where almost half  of the U.S. population resides. According to the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers (Corps) and FEMA officials, the federal government does not  have a program overseeing all levees across the nation, and no national  standards exist for levee safety.", "A number of federal agencies have a role in levee-related activities, such  as inspections, inventories, assessments, training and assistance,  development of standards, mapping, and risk communication; however,  the Corps, within the Department of Defense, and FEMA, within the  Department of Homeland Security, are the two principal federal agencies  with authorities related to levees. The Corps has some responsibility for  approximately15,000 miles of levees under its Levee Safety Program,  including levees that the Corps has built and maintains, levees that it has  built but does not maintain, and levees that it did not build but  rehabilitates. The aim of this program, according to a Corps document, is  to better understand, manage, and reduce flood risks associated with  levees through such activities as maintaining a national inventory of  levees, inspecting and assessing the performance of certain levees, and  providing levee rehabilitation to eligible flood-damaged levees. FEMA  implements the National Flood Insurance Program, under which public  and private levees can be accredited as designed to withstand a certain  flood event. The program provided insurance to help protect over 5.1  million policyholders against flood losses in 2015.", "In 2007, Congress established the National Committee on Levee Safety  to develop recommendations for a national levee safety program. The  committee comprised 23 members, including both federal and nonfederal  stakeholders. In 2009, the committee recommended, among other things,  that federal levee-related programs be aligned to promote levee safety  nationwide. More specifically, the committee stated that all federal  programs that significantly impact governmental and individual decision  making in leveed areas must be aligned toward (1) the goal of reliable  levees, (2) an informed and involved public, (3) shared responsibility for  the protection of human life, and (4) mitigation of public and private  economic damages. In keeping with this goal, the committee called on the  Corps, with assistance from FEMA, to develop voluntary national levee- safety guidelines to help ensure best engineering practices for levees are  implemented throughout the nation at all levels of government. Further,  the committee discussed the potential for federal levee-related programs  to be aligned to provide incentives, such as financial or technical  assistance, to nonfederal stakeholders to promote more shared  responsibility for levee safety. In its report, the committee stated that the  average age of levees within federal levee-safety programs was  approximately 50 years but that many nonfederal levees could be much  older\u2014100 years old or more.", "In June 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of  2014 was enacted and included provisions to, among other things,  increase the capacity of nonfederal stakeholders to promote levee safety.

According to a Corps document, levees are usually earthen  embankments or concrete floodwalls, which have been designed and  constructed to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to reduce  the risk of temporary flooding. An American Society of Civil Engineers  public information document describes earthen levees as being  constructed from compacted soil that is typically covered with various  surface materials, such as grass, gravel, stone, asphalt, or concrete, to  help prevent erosion. The document further states that a floodwall is a  vertical levee structure usually erected in urban areas where there is  insufficient land for an earthen levee. Levees can either function  passively or can require active operations depending on their  components. Some levees have gates and pumps, for example, and may  require personnel to operate these devices in times of floods. Levees  typically require regular maintenance and periodic upgrades to retain their  level of protection. Maintenance can include such actions as removing  debris and unwanted vegetation from the levees, areas adjacent to  floodwalls, and channels; controlling damage caused by animals (e.g.,  filling burrows); painting or greasing structural components, such as metal  gates; and repairing concrete damage, particularly in northern climates  with severe freeze-thaw cycles.
