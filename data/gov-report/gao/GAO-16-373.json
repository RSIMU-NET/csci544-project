GAO visited the VCL's primary center and two backup call centers; tested VCL response time through a generalizable sample of covert telephone calls and a nongeneralizable sample of text messages in July and August 2015; reviewed internal reports and policies and plans; and interviewed VA and SAMHSA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) did not meet its call response time goals for the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL), although extended call wait times were not common. VA's goal is to answer 90 percent of VCL calls at the VCL primary center within 30 seconds. Currently, calls not answered within 30 seconds route to VCL backup call centers; however, for 5 months of fiscal year 2015, calls were routed to VCL backup call centers after 60 seconds. VA officials told GAO that VA data show about 65 to 75 percent of VCL calls were answered at the VCL primary center in fiscal year 2015 within either 30 or 60 seconds. GAO's covert testing in July and August 2015 confirms VA's data. Specifically, 119 covert test calls show that an estimated 73 percent of calls made during this period were answered within 30 seconds. GAO also estimates that 99 percent of all VCL calls during this period were answered within 120 seconds. GAO also covertly tested the VCL's text messaging services and found that 4 of 14 GAO test text messages did not receive responses. VA officials said they do not monitor or test the timeliness and performance of the VCL text message system and instead rely solely on the VCL's text messaging provider for these functions. VA officials told GAO that the provider had not reported any issues with the system, but the provider told GAO that routine testing of the VCL system is not conducted. Without routinely testing its text messaging system or ensuring that its provider does so, VA cannot identify limitations to this service.", "While VA has taken a number of steps to improve its monitoring of the VCL primary center operations, VA has not developed measurable targets and time frames for its key performance indicators, such as the program's percentage of abandoned calls. VA established a permanent VCL call center evaluation team and created a mechanism for tracking complaints about the performance of the VCL primary center from VCL callers or external parties. However, GAO found that VA has not specified quantifiable or otherwise measurable targets and has not included dates for when it would expect the VCL to complete actions covered by each key performance indicator. This is inconsistent with guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, VA cannot ensure that the VCL is providing consistent, high-quality services to callers and cannot effectively track and publicly report progress or results.", "VA established an interagency agreement with its service partner, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), to manage the shared operations of the VCL and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline), which include a single national toll-free number used by both. Despite these efforts to coordinate, VA and SAMHSA do not collect information needed to assess how often and why callers intending to reach the VCL do not follow voice prompts and instead reach Lifeline local crisis centers. VA officials told GAO that the type of information that would be needed to do so is not collected because VA has focused on addressing the concerns of those callers who did reach the VCL. In addition, SAMHSA officials said that they do not require Lifeline local crisis centers to collect this type of information, noting that it would be possible to collect it.

The Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) provides an array of health care services, including  mental health services and other benefits to over 21 million veterans and  their families. As part of the continuum of services it provides, VA  established the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) in July 2007.

Specifically, in its first full year of operation in fiscal year 2008, the VCL  received about 67,000 calls compared to about 534,000 calls received in  fiscal year 2015, an almost 700 percent increase. In response, VA  steadily increased the VCL\u2019s spending from about $3 million to $30 million  from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2015, devoting additional staff  and resources to the VCL over time. As VA endeavored to address  increasing numbers of requests for assistance, reports of dissatisfaction  with VCL service periodically appeared in the media, and the VA Office of  Inspector General was asked to investigate complaints about the VCL\u2019s  lack of timely response to callers. The Inspector General identified gaps  in the VCL quality-assurance process, including challenges associated  with supervisory review, tracking of issues, and collection and analysis of  data from VCL backup call centers. In addition, the Inspector General  found that in some cases callers did not receive immediate assistance  from responders.", "In response to accounts of dissatisfaction with VCL services, you asked  us to assess the effectiveness of VA\u2019s policies and procedures designed  to provide timely assistance to veterans through the VCL.

The test calls included a generalizable sample  of 119 calls that can be used to describe all callers\u2019 wait times when  calling the VCL during July and August of 2015. We also sent a  nongeneralizable sample of 15 test online chats to the VCL and 14 test  text messages during the same period. For these tests, we measured the  length of time between sending the outgoing message to the VCL and  receiving a response from a VCL responder. In addition, we examined  telephone call, online chat, and text message data and summary reports  from January 2013 through December 2015 that VA maintains related to  the timeliness of the VCL\u2019s operations. To determine the validity of these  data, we interviewed officials responsible for managing them and  compared our test call response data with VA\u2019s reported telephone data  for July and August 2015. On the basis of these actions, we found these  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing the quantity  of requests for services reaching the VCL.

Calls that are not answered at the VCL primary center  within 30 seconds of the time that the caller presses \u201c1\u201d during the Lifeline  greeting are automatically routed to one of five VCL backup call centers.  If a call is not answered by the VCL backup call center that initially  receives it, the call may be sent to another VCL backup call center.

VA implemented staggered shifts for responders  at the VCL primary center on September 6, 2015. Staggered shifts are  work schedules that allow employees to start and stop their shifts at  different times as a way to ensure better coverage during peak calling  periods. Specifically, it helps schedule more employees to work when call  volume is highest and fewer employees to work when call volume is  lowest. Additionally, staggered shifts help limit disruptions in service as  responders begin and end their shifts. By comparing VCL telephone call  data from September through December of 2014 to that of September  through December of 2015, we found that VA\u2019s implementation of  staggered shifts at the VCL primary center had mixed results.", "Overall: The average percentage of calls answered per hour at the  VCL primary center from September through December 2015\u2014after  staggered shifts were implemented\u2014was 75 percent, slightly less  than the average of 79 percent answered during the corresponding  period in 2014 before staggered shifts were implemented. However,  the VCL received an average of about 1.3 more calls per hour during  this period in 2015 than it received during the corresponding period in  2014 and, according to VA officials, the VCL primary center employed  fewer responder staff in 2015 than 2014.", "By day of the week: The average percentage of calls answered per  hour at the VCL primary center increased on Mondays to 89 percent  and Tuesdays to 83 percent after VA implemented staggered shifts,  up from 78 percent and 79 percent, respectively, during the  corresponding period in 2014. These increases suggest that  staggered shifts may have helped VA answer more calls at the VCL  primary center on these days because VCL call data from our analysis  indicate that these days of the week typically experienced the highest  number of calls prior to implementing staggered shifts, and VA  officials told us that they used the implementation of staggered shifts  to schedule more responders on these days. However, the average  percentage of calls answered per hour at the VCL primary center  decreased on Saturdays to 61 percent and Sundays to 70 percent  after VA implemented staggered shifts, down from 78 percent and 80  percent, respectively, during the corresponding period in 2014.", "By hours of the day: VA answered a higher percentage of calls at the  VCL primary center during the mid-day and evening hours after the  implementation of staggered shifts. Specifically, from 11:00 a.m. to  4:00 p.m. and from 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. the VCL primary center  answered a higher percentage of calls compared with the  corresponding periods in 2014. However, VA answered a lower  percentage of calls at the VCL primary center during overnight  hours\u2014midnight to 9:00 a.m.\u2014and in the early evening\u20145:00 p.m. to  8:00 p.m.\u2014compared to corresponding periods in 2014.", "To address staffing limitations and align the number of responders  available for each staggered shift according to demand, VA officials said  that VA planned to hire 63 additional responders for the VCL primary  center in fiscal year 2016 and assign these new responders to weekend  and evening shifts. This change would likely help improve the mixed  results we identified in our analysis of VA\u2019s implementation of staggered  shifts for responders. As of February 2016, VA officials said that 22  applicants had accepted employment offers and that VA planned to  extend employment offers to an additional 15 applicants. These officials  also noted that recent attrition at the VCL primary center was largely due  to VCL primary center responders being promoted into new positions at  the VCL primary center or to VCL primary center responders leaving  because their work with the VCL did not qualify as clinical hours required  for licensure in their specialties.", "New call-handling procedures. VA implemented new call handling  procedures at the VCL primary center beginning in June 2015 that  provided responders with specific guidance to more efficiently handle  \u201cnoncore\u201d callers\u2014those callers who were not seeking crisis assistance  but rather seeking help with other issues, such as help with veterans\u2019  benefits questions. For example, if a caller reached the VCL with a  question about VA disability benefits, the VCL primary center responder  would verify that the caller was not in crisis and transfer the caller to the  Veterans Benefits Administration to address the question. VCL telephone  call data provided by VA suggest that the average time VCL primary  center responders spend handling noncore calls decreased by  approximately 30 percent over a 5-month period after responder training  began on these new call-handling procedures. We would expect that as  the average time VCL primary center responders spend handling noncore  calls decreases, these responders should have more time available to  answer additional incoming calls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In July and August 2015, Most of Our Test Online Chats Were Answered Within 30 Seconds, but VA Did Not Ensure That Veterans Receive Responses through Its Text Messaging Service", "paragraphs": ["To determine the timeliness of the VCL\u2019s responses to online chats and  text messages, we conducted a covert test in July and August 2015 using  nongeneralizable samples of 15 online chats and 14 text messages.

VA officials noted and we observed during a site  visit that some incoming texts were abusive in nature or were not related  to a crisis situation. According to VA officials, in these situations, if this  is the only text message waiting for a response, a VCL responder will  send a response immediately. However, if other text messages are  awaiting responses, VA will triage these text messages and reply to those  with indications of crisis first. This triage process may have contributed to  the number of our test texts that did not receive responses within 2  minutes.", "The VCL\u2019s text messaging service provider offered several reasons for  the possible nonresponses that we encountered in our test results. These  included: (1) incompatibilities between some devices used to send text  messages to the VCL and the software VA used to process the text  messages, (2) occasional software malfunctions that freeze the text  messaging interface at the VCL primary center, (3) inaudible audio  prompts used to alert VCL primary center responders of incoming text  messages, (4) attempts by people with bad intentions to disrupt the VCL\u2019s  text messaging service by overloading the system with a large number of  texts, and (5) incompatibilities between the web-browsers used by the  VCL primary center and the text messaging software.", "VA officials told us that they do not monitor and test the timeliness and  performance of the VCL text messaging system, but rather rely solely on  the VCL\u2019s text messaging service provider for such monitoring and  testing.

Time frames for action are a required  element of performance indicators and are important to ensure that  agencies can track their progress and prioritize goals.", "Guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget states that  performance goals\u2014similar to VA\u2019s key performance indicators for the  VCL\u2014should include three elements: (1) a performance indicator, which  is how the agency will track progress; (2) a target; and (3) a period. VA  officials reported that they are currently implementing a comprehensive  process improvement plan, discussed later in this report, that will help  ensure the right structures and processes are in place, which they believe  are logical precursors to examining VCL outcomes and establishing  targets and time frames for performance indicators.

Clear  performance requirements for VCL backup call centers are important for  defining VA\u2019s expectations of these service partners. However, VA has  taken steps to strengthen the performance requirements of this contract  by modifying it in March 2015 and beginning the process of replacing it  with a new contract.", "October 2012 backup call coverage contract. This contract provided a  network of Lifeline local crisis centers that could serve as VCL backup call  centers managed by a contractor. This contractor was responsible for  overseeing and coordinating the services of VCL backup call centers that  answer overflow calls from the VCL primary center. This contract as  initially awarded included few details on the performance requirements for  VCL backup call centers. For example, the contract did not include any  information on several key aspects of VCL backup call center  performance, including: (1) the percentage of VCL calls routed to each  VCL backup call center that should be answered, (2) VA\u2019s expectations  on whether or not VCL backup call centers could use voice answering  systems or caller queues for VCL calls, and (3) VA\u2019s documentation  requirements for VCL calls answered at the VCL backup call centers.  Detailed performance requirements on these key aspects of VCL backup  call center performance are necessary for VA to effectively oversee the  performance of the contractor and the VCL backup call centers. By not  specifying performance requirements for the contractor on these key  performance issues, VA missed the opportunity to validate contractor and  VCL backup call center performance and mitigate weaknesses in VCL  call response. For example, representatives from one VCL backup call  center provided data that showed that the backup call center answered  about 50 percent of the VCL calls it received. However, without a  performance requirement establishing a standard for the percentage of  calls each VCL backup call center should answer, VA could not determine  whether this was acceptable performance for a VCL backup call center.  As of December 2015, this VCL backup call center reported that it had  improved its performance and answered about 66 percent of calls it  received from July 2015 to December 2015.", "VA officials told us about several concerns with the performance of the  backup call centers operating under the October 2012 contract based on  their own observations and complaints reported to the VCL. These  concerns included the inconsistency and incompleteness of VCL backup  call centers\u2019 responses to VCL callers, limited or missing documentation  from records of VCL calls answered by VCL backup call center  responders, limited information provided to VA that could be used to track  VCL backup call center performance, and the use of voice answering  systems or extended queues for VCL callers reaching some VCL backup  call centers. For example, VA officials reported that some veterans did  not receive complete suicide assessments when their calls were  answered at VCL backup call centers. In addition, VA officials noted that  they had observed some VCL backup call centers failing to follow VCL  procedures, such as not calling a veteran who may be in crisis when a  third-party caller requested that the responder contact the veteran.  According to VA officials, these issues led to additional work for the VCL  primary center, including staffing one to two responders per shift to review  the call records submitted to the VCL primary center by backup call  centers and to determine whether these calls required additional follow-up  from the VCL primary center. These officials estimated that 25 to 30  percent of backup call center call records warranted additional follow-up  to the caller from a VCL primary center responder, including  approximately 5 percent of backup call center call records that needed to  be completely reworked by a VCL primary center responder.", "March 2015 backup call coverage contract modification. Given these  concerns, in March 2015 VA modified the October 2012 backup call  coverage contract to add more explicit performance requirements for its  backup call coverage contractor, which likely took effect more quickly  than if the department had waited for a new contract to be awarded.  These modified requirements included (1) the establishment of a 24- hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week contractor-staffed emergency support line  that VCL backup call centers could use to report problems, (2) a  prohibition on VCL backup call centers\u2019 use of voice answering systems,  (3) a prohibition on VCL backup call centers placing VCL callers on hold  before a responder conducted a risk assessment, (4) documentation of  each VCL caller\u2019s suicide risk assessment results, and (5) transmission of  records for all VCL calls to the VCL primary center within 30 minutes of  the call\u2019s conclusion.", "Development of new backup call coverage contract. In July 2015, VA  began the process of replacing its backup call coverage contract by  publishing a notice to solicit information from prospective contractors on  their capability to satisfy the draft contract terms for the new contract; this  new backup call coverage contract was awarded in April 2016. We  found that these new proposed contract terms included the same  performance requirement modifications that were made in March 2015,  as well as additional performance requirements and better data reporting  from the contractor that could be used to improve VA\u2019s oversight of the  VCL backup call centers. Specifically, the proposed contract terms added  performance requirements to address VCL backup call center  performance\u2014including a requirement for 90 percent of VCL calls  received by a VCL backup call center to be answered by a backup call  center responder within 30 seconds and 100 percent to be answered by a  backup call center responder within 2 minutes. In addition, the proposed  contract terms include numerous data reporting requirements that could  allow VA to routinely assess the performance of its VCL backup call  centers and identify patterns of noncompliance with the contract\u2019s  performance requirements more efficiently and effectively than under the  prior contract. The proposed terms for the new contract also state that VA  will initially provide and approve all changes to training documentation  and supporting materials provided to VCL backup call centers in order to  promote the contractor\u2019s ability to provide the same level of service that is  being provided by the VCL primary center."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA and SAMHSA Do Not Collect Information Needed to Assess How Often and Why Callers Do Not Reach the VCL", "paragraphs": ["We found that when callers do not press \u201c1\u201d during the initial Lifeline  greeting, their calls may take longer to answer than if the caller had  pressed \u201c1\u201d and been routed to either the VCL primary center or a VCL  backup call center. As previously discussed, VA and SAMHSA  collaborated to link the toll-free numbers for both Lifeline and the VCL  through an interagency agreement. The greeting instructs callers to press  \u201c1\u201d to be connected to the VCL; if callers do not press \u201c1,\u201d they will be  routed to one of SAMHSA\u2019s 164 Lifeline local crisis centers. To mimic the  experience of callers who do not press \u201c1\u201d to reach the VCL when  prompted, we made 34 covert nongeneralizable test calls to the national  toll-free number that connects callers to both Lifeline and the VCL during  August 2015 and we did not press \u201c1\u201d to be directed to the VCL. For 23  of these 34 calls, our call was answered in 30 seconds or less. For 11 of  these calls, we waited more than 30 seconds for a responder to answer\u2014 including 3 calls with wait times of 8, 9, and 18 minutes. Additionally, one  of our test calls did not go through, and during another test call we were  asked if we were safe and able to hold. VA\u2019s policy prohibits VCL  responders from placing callers on hold prior to completing a suicide  assessment; Lifeline has its own policies and procedures.", "According to officials and representatives from VA, SAMHSA, and the  VCL backup call centers, as well as our experience making test calls  where we did not press \u201c1,\u201d there are several reasons why a veteran may  not press \u201c1\u201d to be routed to the VCL, including an intentional desire to not connect with VA, failure to recognize the prompt to press \u201c1\u201d to be directed to the VCL, waiting too long to respond to the prompt to press \u201c1\u201d to be directed to  the VCL, or  calling from a rotary telephone that does not allow the caller to press  \u201c1\u201d when prompted.", "VA officials said they had not estimated the extent to which veterans  intending to reach the VCL did not press \u201c1\u201d during the Lifeline greeting.  These officials explained that their focus has been on ensuring that  veterans who did reach the VCL received appropriate service from the  VCL primary center and backup call centers. In addition, SAMHSA  officials said that they also do not collect this information. These officials  reported that SAMHSA does not require the collection of demographic  information, including veteran status, for a local crisis center to participate  in the Lifeline network. However, they noted that SAMHSA could request  through its grantee that administers the Lifeline network that local crisis  centers conduct a onetime collection of information to help determine how  often and why veterans reach Lifeline local crisis centers. SAMHSA  officials explained that they could work with the Lifeline grantee to explore  optimal ways of collecting this information that would be (1) clinically  appropriate, (2) a minimal burden to callers and Lifeline\u2019s local crisis  centers, and (3) in compliance with the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s paperwork reduction and information collection policies. The  interagency agreement between VA and SAMHSA assigns SAMHSA  responsibilities for monitoring the use of the national toll-free number\u2014  1-800-273-TALK (8255)\u2014that is used to direct callers to both the VCL  and Lifeline. These responsibilities include monitoring the use of the line,  analyzing trends, and providing recommendations about projected needs  and technical modifications needed to meet these projected needs. Using  the information collected from the Lifeline local crisis centers on how often  and why veterans reach Lifeline, as opposed to the VCL, VA and  SAMHSA officials could then assess whether the extent to which this  occurs merits further review and action.", "Although the results of our test are not generalizable, substantial wait  times for a few of our covert calls suggest that some callers may  experience longer wait times to speak with a responder in the Lifeline  network than they would in the VCL\u2019s network. Without collecting  information to examine how often and why veterans do not press \u201c1\u201d  when prompted to reach the VCL, VA and SAMHSA cannot determine the  extent veterans reach the Lifeline network when intending to reach the  VCL and may experience longer wait times as a result. In addition,  limitations in information on how often and why this occurs do not allow  VA and SAMHSA to determine whether or not they should collaborate on  plans to address the underlying causes of veterans not reaching the VCL.  Standards for internal control in the federal government state that  information should be communicated both internally and externally to  enable the agency to carry out its responsibilities.

We  found that the VCL primary center responders are housed in two different  buildings originally designed for patient care delivery. According to VA  officials, these buildings do not reflect call center leading practices that  recommend large, open rooms that provide supervisors greater access to  the responders they oversee. However, in February 2016, VA officials  reported that the department committed funding to relocate the VCL  primary center operations to a renovated space on the VA medical center  campus. The relocation is to be implemented in two phases. VA officials  expect that the first phase, which includes moving administrative and  monitoring staff, will be completed in June 2016; the second phase will  relocate the rest of the VCL staff, including all responders. VA officials  said they anticipate that the second phase will be completed in fiscal year  2017. VA officials told us that they plan on using the National Call Center- Health Resource Center\u2019s large open-space layout as a model in  designing the VCL primary center\u2019s new space.

Currently, VA allows VCL primary center responders 30 seconds to  answer calls before routing them to VCL backup call centers for a  response. In February 2016, VA officials told us that they are considering  implementing this type of queue. According to these officials, they are  considering allowing VCL calls to remain at the VCL primary center for up  to 5 minutes and they explained that this 5-minute period was determined  based on feedback they received from veterans on how long they would  be willing to wait for a responder.

The VCL is accessed by calling a single national  toll-free number\u20141-800-273-TALK (8255)\u2014shared by both the VCL and  the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline). This toll-free number is  managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA). To conduct our nongeneralizable test, we  used a random sample of 34 covert test calls to conduct these tests  where we mimicked the experience of VCL callers who do not follow the  instructions of the voice prompt on this single national toll-free number to  press \u201c1\u201d in order to reach the VCL. To do this, we placed two test calls  where we did not press \u201c1\u201d as prompted to reach the VCL during each of  the scheduled primary sampling units in August 2015. We recorded the  wait times for each of the 34 test calls by calculating the amount of time  that elapsed between the moment that an automated message informed  us that the call was being transferred to a Lifeline local crisis center and  when a responder answered our call. We masked the origin of these calls  in a manner similar to that described for our generalizable sample of 119  test calls placed to the VCL. Although the 34 test calls were randomly  made, the results of these test calls are not generalizable due to the small  number of calls included in our sample."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Gabrielle M.
