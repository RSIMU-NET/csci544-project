IGPs can be proposed at any level\u2014district, regional, or national\u2014within IRS but are generally initiated at one or more of IRS\u2019 33 district offices. IRS staff propose IGPs on the basis of past audits or studies that have shown noncompliance for selected taxpayer populations, such as those in a particular occupation, industry, geographic area, or economic activity, or those claiming a particular tax exemption, deduction, or credit.", "During an IGP, IRS staff usually audit a limited number of taxpayers within the selected population. For IGP audits, IRS staff are to select tax returns after reviewing information available within IRS and from non-IRS sources such as banks, licensing and trade organizations, or other third parties. IRS believes that IGPs help IRS staff to select potentially noncompliant tax returns for audit that would not otherwise be identified as having audit potential. In this vein, IGPs have served as 1 of over 30 sources that IRS\u2019 Examination Division uses to identify returns with audit potential. In recent years, IGPs have accounted for less than 5 percent of the total number of returns selected for audit.", "In addition to using IGPs to identify noncompliance and take enforcement action, IRS also intended to use them to determine the reasons for noncompliance and recommend ways to reduce it. However, IRS has historically used IGPs as tools for enforcing tax laws rather than as research tools for collecting data about compliance within taxpayer populations. Our past work has discussed some of the problems with attempts to research noncompliance and related solutions through IGPs.For example, we raised concerns about whether IGPs (1) focused on taxpayer populations with significant compliance shortfalls and (2) collected statistically valid data that could be generalized to a larger population. As for IRS\u2019 management of IGPs, we pointed to the benefits of enhanced coordination across IGPs in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and to make fuller use of IGP results.", "In recent years, IRS has been going through a transition involving its framework for doing compliance research, including the use of IGPs as research tools. Under its 1997 compliance initiative proposal (CIP), IRS is attempting to link IGPs to a larger research framework and better manage IGPs to make them more useful for doing compliance research. In fact, IRS intends to refer to IGPs as \u201ccompliance initiatives.\u201d Recognizing these changes, IRS Examination officials continue to view IGPs as essential enforcement tools and sources for data on specific types of noncompliance.", "The revised framework also includes IRS\u2019 recent efforts to develop a more comprehensive and statistically valid approach to compliance research. Under this approach, IRS has created new research methods and tools as well as research units in each district to do compliance research and to oversee compliance efforts, such as IGPs. IRS hopes that this approach will produce valid research data to better identify significant noncompliance and the reasons for it, as well as to better test ways to reduce the noncompliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IGPs Nationwide and in Georgia", "paragraphs": ["IRS Examination staff can run IGPs in IRS\u2019 National Office, its 33 district offices, and its 10 service centers.

Over half of these IGPs (44) focused on four types of taxpayers: (1) businesses that potentially underreported income or overreported expense deductions; (2) businesses that potentially did not properly report or pay taxes, such as excise taxes on fuel, chemicals, or heavy vehicle use; (3) individual taxpayers who potentially claimed an improper exemption for dependents, a filing status (e.g., head of household), or earned income credit; and (4) businesses and individual taxpayers who potentially did not file required tax returns. The remaining 32 IGPs dealt with a wide range of suspected noncompliance involving topics such as the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, income from wagering, income from timber sales, and taxable events for individual partners or shareholders.", "We tracked the duration and audit results of Georgia IGPs that had closed at the time we did our work. Of the 76 IGPs, 41 were closed as of June 1997. The length of time that these 41 IGPs had remained open varied from 5 months to several years; more specifically, 23 of the 41 IGPs lasted 2 or more years. The audit results for the 41 IGPs also varied widely. These results included the number of returns audited, the additional taxes and penalties recommended, and the percent of audited returns that recommended no tax changes. For example:", "The number of returns audited ranged from 0 to 516 but usually involved fewer than 50. Of the 41 closed projects, 32 involved audits, and 9 involved no audits. Of the 32 projects involving audits, 23 were closed after auditing fewer than 50 returns each.", "The additional recommended tax plus penalty amounts per IGP ranged from $0 (in the 9 IGPs closed without any audits) to $269 million; of the 32 IGPs with audits, 11 recommended total additional tax amounts that exceeded $500,000, and 7 recommended total amounts exceeding $1 million.", "Of the 32 IGPs with audits, 3 closed with a no-change rate that exceeded 50 percent, meaning that over half of the audited tax returns in these 3 projects were deemed compliant and that the audits recommended no tax changes. Across all 32 IGPs, this no-change rate ranged from 0 percent to 60 percent, and the median no-change rate was about 20 percent.", "Appendix I to this letter provides specific details on IGPs in Georgia during fiscal years 1994-1996.

These controls and procedures are designed to guard against any improprieties and misuse of IGPs, as well as to better ensure productive use of audit resources. We did not test whether and how well these controls and procedures have worked. The following describes what these IGP controls and procedures have included.", "IRS requires that IGPs be authorized by a district director or higher level management official for a specified length of time. According to IRS officials, the process generally starts out informally when an IRS employee, usually a revenue agent, discovers an area of potential noncompliance. The revenue agent discusses the issue with a manager and IGP coordinator (who is to oversee and track all IGPs). If these parties agree about the potential for noncompliance, an Information Gathering Project Authorization (Form 6545) is prepared and forwarded, along with supporting documents, through various organizational levels for review and approval.", "IRS officials also review IGP proposals to ensure that the project conforms with Internal Revenue Manual requirements on IGPs. Among other things, the officials are to look at the (1) purpose and objective of the project; (2) data (such as compliance measures) that support the need for the project; (3) description of the data needed to do the project, including why and how the data will be used; and (4) time frames and resources necessary to complete the project. In addition, officials are to ensure that the project does not duplicate other IGPs and that the potential noncompliance, which is the focus of the project, can meet or exceed the noncompliance that would otherwise be identified through audits initiated under DIF criteria.", "If approved at each level, the proposal continues to move up the chain of command. At a district office, this chain of command generally includes the group manager of the revenue agent proposing the IGP; branch chief for that audit group manager; the chief of the Examination Division, who is responsible for all Examination activity in the district; and the district director, who is responsible for ultimate approval of the IGP as well as various other types of IRS activities within the district.", "In addition, other district Examination staff play a role in reviewing and approving IGPs. After the branch chief\u2019s review, the IGP coordinator and the chief of the Planning and Special Programs office (who is to oversee and track various types of Examination programs) have a role in coordinating any further review and approval. Once approved by the chief of the Examination Division, proposed projects are to be routed through the chief of the District Office of Research and Analysis, who is either to concur or not concur. The District Disclosure Office also reviews each IGP request. Following this, the district director reviews the proposal. If the director approves, work on the project can begin.", "Approved IGPs normally include an information gathering phase and an audit phase. During the information gathering phase, the project coordinator and/or project team\u2014usually two or more agents developing the IGP\u2014collect and analyze information on a particular type of taxpayer, such as child care providers. Techniques and sources for collecting information may include interviews with third parties as well as reviews of internal and external data related to the IGP. By analyzing the information, the project coordinator is to identify whether the apparent noncompliance is significant enough to warrant audits and, if so, which types of tax returns have audit potential and should be audited.", "In a 1994 report, we raised two concerns about the selection of returns to be audited under IGPs. We found that the controls and procedures (1) were not adequate to prevent Examination staff from selectively targeting individual taxpayers for audit, and (2) did not require a separation of duties between staff who identified the types of returns to audit and staff who selected the specific returns for audit. In July 1995, IRS issued new guidance to address these two concerns about IGP controls and procedures.", "Under this new guidance, the project coordinator is to work with the IGP coordinator to identify returns to be audited according to set criteria, such as the type of tax return, filing status, dollar threshold, and compliance issue being reviewed. The IGP coordinator is responsible for ordering the returns for audit under the project that meet these criteria. When the returns are received, the IGP coordinator (who is located in Planning and Special Programs) is responsible for getting them manually reviewed to check audit potential using the criteria selected by the project coordinator. Returns with audit potential are assigned for audit according to such criteria as the location of the taxpayer, grade levels of the agents, and their knowledge about the issues that are the focus of the IGP.", "The duration of the audit phase for an IGP depends on whether (1) the project team continues to find tax returns that fit into the defined category of taxpayers, and (2) the auditors find sufficient levels of noncompliance on the audited returns. More specifically, the IGP audits should find more noncompliance than that uncovered in audits routinely selected by IRS using the computer-generated score produced under DIF. Because of these controls, some IGPs terminate after a small number of returns are audited, compared to the number ordered and assigned. Upon termination of the IGP, IRS requires that a termination report be submitted to the IGP coordinator to document audit and other results.", "In 1997, IRS began implementing additional processes under CIP that cover all compliance initiatives, including IGPs. IRS intends for these processes to introduce more rigor so that the results from IGPs and other projects can be used for research purposes. CIP guidelines require substantially more documentation for proposed compliance projects than previously required. The proposals must identify the methodology to be used and the extent to which the project will improve compliance within the district. A district planning council is to submit the required documentation to the district director together with its recommendation to approve or disapprove the proposed project. Upon completion of an approved project, the results are to be reported to the planning council, which will make a recommendation to the district director to either continue, expand, or terminate the project, or to transform it into a fuller research project at the local or national level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish each objective, we interviewed responsible officials at IRS\u2019 National Office, the Atlanta District Office, and the Southeast Regional Office and collected data relevant to IRS\u2019 use of IGPs to detect noncompliance with the tax laws.", "To identify the number of IGPs open both nationwide and in Georgia in fiscal years 1994 through 1996, we reviewed available records from IRS\u2019 National Office and Georgia District.

IRS\u2019 National Office could not locate data on the total number of IGPs nationwide during fiscal year 1994.
