In 2006, participants in the two programs had contracts with the Department of Defense (DOD) worth $465 million annually to provide dining services at military dining facilities. The 2007 National Defense Authorization Act directed GAO to study the two programs. This report examines (1) differences in how the Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD programs provide food services for DOD and (2) differences in how contracts are awarded, prices are set, and program beneficiaries (i.e. persons with disabilities) are compensated. GAO interviewed program officials, conducted a survey of states with Randolph-Sheppard programs, and reviewed eight Randolph-Sheppard and six JWOD contracts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD programs use different procedures to provide food services to DOD. In Randolph-Sheppard, states act as prime contractors, and train and license blind individuals to act as managers of dining facilities. In most cases, the blind vendor relies on a food service company--known as a teaming partner--to assist in operations, provide expertise, and help with start-up costs. About half of the blind vendors are required to employ other persons with disabilities. JWOD is administered by an independent federal agency called the Committee for Purchase from People Who are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee for Purchase). The Committee for Purchase engages a central nonprofit agency to match DOD's needs with services provided by local nonprofit agencies. Most of the individuals working for these local nonprofit agencies are employed in less skilled jobs such as serving food or washing dishes. The Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD programs differ significantly in the way DOD dining contracts are awarded, how prices are set, and how participants are compensated. For Randolph-Sheppard, DOD awards contracts to the states either through direct negotiations or competition with other food service companies. In either case, DOD and the states negotiate the prices based on factors such as historical prices and independent government estimates. Under JWOD, competition is not a factor because DOD is required to purchase services it needs from a list maintained by the Committee for Purchase, which establishes fair market prices for these contracts. In terms of compensation, Randolph-Sheppard blind vendors generally received a percentage of contract profits, averaging about $276,500 per vendor annually. JWOD beneficiaries are generally paid hourly wages according to rules set by the federal government. For the three sites we visited, we estimate that beneficiaries received an average wage of $13.15 per hour, including fringe benefits. Given the differences in the roles of the beneficiaries of these two programs, comparisons of their compensation have limited value."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility program (Randolph-Sheppard)  The Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility program (Randolph-Sheppard)  and Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day program (JWOD) are two federal programs that  and Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day program (JWOD)  In 2001 and 2003, two court  operation of cafeterias on federal property.", "JWOD has changed its name to AbilityOne but will continue to use JWOD until it is  phased out in 2008.

In an effort to obtain additional insight into how the two  programs operate with respect to DOD food service contracts, the act also  required us to examine a sample of Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD food  services contracts that were in effect as of October 17, 2006. More  specifically, we were required to examine (1) differences in operational  procedures for how the Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD programs provide  food services for DOD, and (2) differences in how the contracts are  awarded, how prices are determined, and how program beneficiaries (i.e.  persons with disabilities) are compensated.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed pertinent documents and  interviewed officials from DOD, Education, an independent federal agency  called the Committee for Purchase from People Who are Blind or Severely  Disabled (Committee for Purchase); and organizations representing both  the Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD programs. We reviewed a sample of 14  contracts\u20148 Randolph-Sheppard and 6 JWOD contracts. We determined  that conducting a representative sample was not feasible based on our  preliminary work, which indicated wide variations in how the two  programs are structured and in how the Randolph-Sheppard program is  administered from state to state.  For these reasons, we selected a number  of contracts representing both programs and each of the military services,  as well as contracts that vary in terms of dollar value, size of military  facilities, and geographic location. As the sample was not representative,  results of our review cannot be projected to the entire universe of  contracts. To gather information on the responsibilities and compensation  of blind vendors, and their relationships with state licensing agencies, we  conducted a survey of the 24 states that have Randolph-Sheppard dining  facility contracts with DOD. All 24 states responded to our survey and  provided information for 39 military dining facilities contracts. In addition,  we visited military installations for 5 of the 14 contracts in our sample to  conduct file reviews, observe dining facility operations, and conduct in- depth interviews with pertinent officials and staff. We selected site visits  based on contracts administered under either the Randolph-Sheppard or  JWOD program, contract size, geographic dispersion, and DOD military  service. In terms of beneficiary compensation, we limited our review to  Randolph-Sheppard blind vendors and JWOD workers. Appendix I  contains more details about our scope and methodology.

The program trains and employs blind individuals to  operate vending facilities on federal property. While Randolph-Sheppard is  under the authority of the Department of Education, the states  participating in this program are primarily responsible for program  operations. State licensing agencies, under the auspices of the state  vocational rehabilitation programs, operate the programs in each state.  Federal law gives blind vendors under the program a priority to operate  cafeterias on federal property. Current DOD guidance implementing this  priority directs that a state licensing agency be awarded a contract if its  contract proposal is in the competitive range. In fiscal year 2006, all of the  activities of the Randolph-Sheppard program generated $692.2 million in  total gross income and had a total of 2,575 vendors operating in every state  except for Wyoming.", "In 1938 the Wagner-O\u2019Day Act established a program designed to increase  employment opportunities for persons who are blind so they could  manufacture and sell certain goods to the federal government. In 1971, the  Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day Act amended the program to include people with  other severe disabilities and allowed the program to provide services as  well as goods. The JWOD Act established the Committee for Purchase,  which administers the program. The Committee for Purchase is required  by law to designate one or more national nonprofit agencies to facilitate  the distribution of federal contracts among qualified local nonprofit  agencies. The designated national agencies are the National Industries for  the Blind and NISH, which represent local nonprofit agencies employing  individuals who are blind or have severe disabilities. These designated  national agencies charge fees for the services provided to local nonprofit  agencies. Effective on October 1, 2006, the maximum fee is 3.83 percent of  the revenue of the contract for the National Industries for the Blind, and  3.75 percent for NISH. The purpose of these fees is to provide operating  funds for these two agencies. In fiscal year 2006, more than 600 JWOD  nonprofit agencies provided the federal government with goods and  services worth about $2.3 billion. The JWOD program provided  employment for about 48,000 people who are blind or have severe  disabilities.", "Military dining contracts under the Randolph-Sheppard and JWOD  programs provide varying levels of service, ranging from support services  to full-food services. Support services include activities such as food  preparation and food serving. Full-food service contracts provide for the  complete operation of facilities, including day-to-day decision making for  the operation of the facility. As of October 17, 2006, DOD had 39  Randolph-Sheppard contracts in 24 different states. These contracts had  an annual value of approximately $253 million and were all for full-food  services. At the same time, DOD had 53 JWOD contracts valued at $212  million annually. Of these, 39 contracts were for support services and 15  were for full-food service. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Randolph- Sheppard and JWOD contracts with DOD dining facilities across the  country.", "In 1974, amendments to the Randolph-Sheppard Act expanded the scope  of the program to include cafeterias on federal property. According to a  DOD official, when DOD began turning increasingly to private contractors  rather than using its own military staff to fulfill food service functions in  the 1990s, state licensing agencies under the Randolph-Sheppard program  began to compete for the same full-food services contracts for which  JWOD traditionally qualified. This development led to litigation, brought  by NISH, over whether the Randolph-Sheppard Act applied to DOD dining  facilities. Two decisions by federal appeals courts held that the Randolph- Sheppard Act applied because the term \u201ccafeteria\u201d included DOD dining  facilities. The courts also decided that if both programs pursued the full- food service contracts for DOD dining facilities, Randolph-Sheppard had  priority.", "Congress enacted section 848 of the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2006 requiring the key players involved in each program to  issue a joint policy statement about how DOD food services contracts  were to be allocated between the two programs.  In August 2006, DOD,  Education, and the Committee for Purchase issued a policy statement that  established certain guidelines, including the following:    The Randolph-Sheppard program will not seek contracts for dining  support services that are on the JWOD procurement list, and Randolph- Sheppard will not seek contracts for operation of a dining facility if the  work is currently being performed under the JWOD program; JWOD  will not pursue prime contracts for operation of dining facilities at  locations where an existing contract was awarded under the Randolph- Sheppard program (commonly known as the \u201cno-poaching\u201d provision).", "For contracts not covered under the no-poaching provision, the  Randolph-Sheppard program may compete for contracts from DOD for  full-food services; and the JWOD program will receive contracts for  support services.  If the needed support services are on the JWOD procurement list, the  Randolph-Sheppard contractor is obligated to subcontract for those  services from JWOD.  In affording a priority to a state licensing agency when contracts are  competed and the Randolph-Sheppard Act applies, the price of the  state licensing agency\u2019s offer will be considered to be fair and  reasonable if it does not exceed the best value offer from other  competitors by more than 5 percent or $1 million, whichever is less.", "Congress enacted the no-poaching provision in section 856 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007.

The state  licensing agencies are responsible for training blind vendors to serve as  dining facility managers and placing them in facilities as new contracting  opportunities become available. According to our survey, the state issues  the vendor a license to operate the facility upon the successful completion  of the training program. Furthermore, many states said this process often  includes both classroom training and on-the-job training at a facility.

Specific responsibilities may include  managing personnel, coordinating with military officials, budgeting and  accounting, and managing inventory. An official representing state  licensing agencies likened the vendor\u2019s role to that of an executive and  said the vendor is responsible for meeting the needs of his or her military  customer. At one facility we visited, the vendor was responsible for  general operations, ensuring the quality of food, and helped develop new  menu selections. Of the 37 contracts where the state licensing agencies  provided information regarding whether the blind vendor visits his or her  facility, all stated that their blind vendors visit their facilities, and in most  cases are on site every day. Additionally, most state licensing agencies told  us that they have an agreement with the blind vendor that lays out the  state licensing agency\u2019s expectations of the blind vendor and defines the  vendor\u2019s job responsibilities.", "Most state licensing agencies rely on private food service companies to  provide the expertise to help operate dining facilities. According to our  survey, 33 of the 39 Randolph-Sheppard contracts relied on a food service  company\u2014known as a teaming partner\u2014to provide assistance in  operating dining facilities. The survey showed that in many cases, the  blind vendor and teaming partner form a joint venture company to operate  the facility with the vendor as the head of the company. The teaming  partner can provide technical expertise, ongoing training, and often  extends the vendor a line of credit and insurance for the operation of the  facility. Officials representing state licensing agencies told us that states  are often unable to provide these resources, and for large contracts these  start-up costs may be beyond the means of the blind vendor and the state  licensing agency. According to our survey, the teaming partner may assist  the state in negotiating and administering the contract with DOD.  Additionally, state licensing agencies told us that they often enter into a  teaming agreement that defines the responsibilities of the teaming partner.", "For 6 of the 39 contracts, the state licensing agencies reported that the  blind vendor operates the dining facility without a teaming partner. We  visited one of these locations and learned that the vendor has his own  business that he uses to operate the facility. This particular vendor had  participated in the Randolph-Sheppard program for almost 20 years and  operated various other dining facilities.", "In our survey, state licensing agencies reported that vendors in about half  (20 of 39) of the contracts are required to employ individuals who are  blind or have other disabilities, while others have self-imposed goals. In  other cases there may be no formal hiring requirements, but the state  licensing agency encourages the blind vendor to hire individuals with  disabilities.

For military  food service contracts, NISH acts as a central nonprofit agency and  administers the program on behalf of the Committee for Purchase. In this  role, NISH works with DOD to determine if it has any new requirements  for dining services. When it identifies a need, NISH will search for a  nonprofit agency that is able to perform the required service. NISH then  facilitates negotiations between DOD and the nonprofit agency, and  submits a proposal to the Committee for Purchase requesting that the  specific service be added to the JWOD procurement list. If the Committee  for Purchase approves the addition, DOD is required by the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to obtain the food service from the entity on  the procurement list.  In some instances, a private food service company  is awarded a military dining facility contract and then subcontracts with a  JWOD nonprofit agency to provide either full or support food services. For  example, the Marine Corps awarded two regional contracts to Sodexho\u2014a  large food service company\u2014to operate its dining facilities on the East  and West Coasts. Sodexho is required by its contracts to utilize JWOD  nonprofit agencies and uses these nonprofit agencies to provide food  services and/or support services at selected Marine Corps bases.

For nonprofit  agencies with multiple JWOD contracts, the 75 percent direct labor  requirement is based on the total for all of these contracts.  Therefore one  contract may be less than 75 percent but another contract must be greater  than 75 percent in order for the total of these contracts to meet the 75  percent requirement. NISH is responsible for ensuring that nonprofit  agencies comply with this requirement, and we previously reported that it  performs site visits to all local nonprofit agencies every three years, in  order to ensure compliance with relevant JWOD regulations.

Under the  Randolph-Sheppard program, Education\u2019s regulations provide for giving  priority to blind vendors in the operation of cafeterias on federal property,  provided that the costs are reasonable and the quality of the food is  comparable to that currently provided. The regulations provide for two  procedures to implement this priority. First, federal agencies, such as the  military departments, may engage in direct, noncompetitive negotiations  with a state licensing agency. Of the eight Randolph-Sheppard contracts  we reviewed in detail, six had been awarded through direct negotiations  with the state licensing agency. In most of the eight cases, the contract  was a follow-on to an expiring food service contract. The second award  procedure involves the issuance of a competitive solicitation inviting  proposals from all potential food service providers, including the relevant  state licensing agency. The solicitation will specify the criteria for  evaluating proposals, such as management capability, past performance,  and price, and DOD will use these criteria to evaluate the proposals  received. When the competitive process is used, DOD policy provides for  selecting the state licensing agency for award if its proposal is in the  \u201ccompetitive range.\u201d  Of the eight Randolph-Sheppard contracts we  reviewed, only two involved a solicitation open to other food service  providers, and there was no case in which more than one acceptable  proposal was received such that DOD was required to determine a  competitive range.", "The prices of contracts under the Randolph-Sheppard program are  negotiated between DOD and the state licensing agency, regardless of  whether DOD uses direct negotiations or seeks competitive proposals.  Negotiations in either case typically begin with a pricing proposal  submitted by the state licensing agency, and will then involve a  comparison of the proposed price with the prices in previous contracts, an  independent government estimate, or the prices offered by other  competitors, if any. In some cases, DOD will seek the assistance of the  Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in assessing various cost aspects  of a proposal. All of the Randolph-Sheppard contracts we reviewed were  generally firm, fixed price. Some had individual line items that provided  for reimbursing the food service provider for certain costs incurred, such  as equipment maintenance or replacing items. In most cases, the contract  was for a base year, and provided for annual options (usually four) that  may be exercised at the discretion of DOD.

The Service Contract Act (SCA) was  enacted to give employees of contractors and subcontractors labor  standards protection when providing services to federal agencies. The  SCA requires that, for contracts exceeding $2,500, contactors pay their  employees, at a minimum, the wage rates and fringe benefits that have  been determined by the Department of Labor to be prevailing in the  locality where the contracted work is performed. However, the SCA  hourly rate would not be used if there is a collective bargaining agreement  that sets a higher hourly wage for selected workers.

The blind vendors who  participate in the Randolph-Sheppard program seek to become  entrepreneurs by gaining experience managing DOD dining facilities. In  this respect, although most of these vendors require the assistance of a  private food service teaming partner, they are compensated for managing  what can be large, complicated food service operations. By contrast,  because the participants of the JWOD program perform work activities  that require less skill and experience, and who might otherwise not be able  to secure competitive employment, they are compensated at a much lower  rate than the Randolph-Sheppard vendors.

For these contracts, we requested the source  selection memorandum, the acquisition plan, the basic contract, and the  statement of work. For two of these contracts, the Randolph-Sheppard  prime contractor for full-food services subcontracted with a JWOD  nonprofit agency for support services. We determined that it was not  feasible to review a representative sample of contracts based on our  preliminary work, which indicated wide variations in how the two  programs are structured and how the Randolph-Sheppard program is  administered from state to state. For these reasons, we selected a number  of contracts to review in order to ensure representation of both programs,  as well as ensure a balance of contracts based on dollar value, size of  military facility, branch of the military, and geographic location. As the  sample was not representative, results of our review cannot be projected  to the entire universe of contracts. In addition, we visited the military  installation for 5 of the 14 contracts in our sample in order to observe  dining facilities and their operations, as well as interview pertinent  officials and staff, including the blind vendor or JWOD agency  management whenever possible. Again, these five locations were selected  to ensure representation of both programs, as well as variation in  geographic location, contract size, and military branch. In terms of  beneficiary compensation, we limited our review to Randolph-Sheppard  blind vendors and JWOD workers. For the JWOD program, we obtained  average hourly wages, average hourly fringe benefits, and average total  hours worked during the year for JWOD employees at selected sites.  We  did not obtain compensation amounts for the managerial employees for  any JWOD nonprofit agencies.", "To obtain information on the relationships between state licensing  agencies and blind vendors, we conducted a survey of the 24 state  licensing agencies we determined to have Randolph-Sheppard military  dining contracts. We asked questions regarding the roles and  responsibilities of blind vendors, the vendor\u2019s relationship with the state  licensing agencies, and the role played by teaming partners. We  administered this survey between April and July 2007. We pretested this  survey with program directors and modified the survey to take their  comments into account. All 24 state licensing agencies responded to our  survey for a response rate of 100 percent and provided information for 39  military dining facilities contracts. Additionally, we requested information  for the 40 blind vendors with military dining contracts to determine their  annual compensation. For the 39 contracts, there were 40 blind vendors as  one contract utilized two vendors. We received compensation information  for 38 of the 40 blind vendors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Jeremy D.
