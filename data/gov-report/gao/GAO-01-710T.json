To ensure that people claiming DI benefits can obtain legal representation at a fair price, the Social Security Act requires that SSA regulate the fees that attorneys charge people to represent their disability claims before the agency. Balancing the needs of claimants with those of their attorneys, the act limits the amount of fees that attorneys can charge claimants, but also guarantees that those fees will be paid from the claimants\u2019 past-due benefits. Over the years, however, relations between SSA and attorneys representing DI claimants have become increasingly strained. While SSA points to the growing administrative burden of processing these fees, attorneys are frustrated with delays in receiving their fees. The situation intensified recently after the Ticket to Work Act imposed an assessment (or \u201cuser fee\u201d) to be deducted from the attorney fees. This act tied the amount of the user fee to SSA\u2019s administrative costs in providing fee services, requiring SSA to determine (for calendar years after 2000) the percentage rate necessary for \u201cfull recovery of the costs of determining and certifying fees,\u201d not to exceed 6.3 percent.", "The Ticket to Work Act required us to study various aspects of attorney fee services in the DI program. My remarks today focus on (1) our evaluation of SSA\u2019s estimate of its administrative costs, (2) the time it takes SSA to process the fee payments, (3) whether efficiencies in SSA\u2019s operations might reduce costs and processing times of fee payments, and (4) other matters related to the services and the user fee. In June 2000, we reported our preliminary results to the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee on Ways and Means.", "In summary, although SSA\u2019s administrative costs serve as the benchmark for the user fee, precise measurement of these costs is difficult. The fee services are only a small part of SSA\u2019s operations, and SSA\u2019s information systems do not routinely track the type of data necessary for careful measurement of these costs. SSA recently estimated that it cost $54 million to process attorney fees in 2000\u2014about 10.5 percent of the total fees of $512 million paid to attorneys in that year. Our review of this estimate indicated that it was likely too high. However, because data limitations and uncertainty as to what costs should be counted made exact correction impracticable, we attempted instead to calculate a rough \u201clower bound\u201d for the amount of these costs. This analysis set the lower bound for SSA\u2019s administrative costs at $35.4 million, or about 6.9 percent of total attorney fees, exceeding the 6.3 percent threshold of the user fee.", "In the past year, SSA improved the timeliness of its fee payments considerably, but major delays continue in some cases. Between June and December 2000, SSA paid fees in 50 percent of the cases within 60 days following issuance of the final administrative decision finding the claimant eligible for DI benefits. This was more timely than in the same period in 1999, when it processed only 4 percent of the fee payments within 60 days of the decision. For the most part, processing time shrank because the Ticket to Work Act eliminated a 15-day period set aside to allow claimants a specific time to protest the attorney fee. However, over 20 percent of the payments made in both years still took longer than 6 months from the date of the final decision. Factors causing delay in both years include extra time needed to finish processing certain claims\u2014for example, if a claimant received state workers\u2019 compensation payments, SSA must contact the state to verify the amount the claimant received and offset the amount against past-due DI benefits.", "According to SSA officials, both staff cost reduction and further improvements to payment timeliness could result from automating its process to pay attorneys. SSA\u2019s cost estimate showed the bulk of its administrative costs as related to a manual process for paying attorneys their fees. Although we did not attempt to quantify the amount of cost savings from automating these manual procedures, we believe it would likely be significant\u2014in 1999, for example, individual clerks manually calculated and entered data for 166,000 attorney payments. SSA has repeatedly postponed plans to automate the process, citing higher priorities for other projects. Currently, however, SSA is planning to automate the attorney payment process, but has yet to complete its plans or to commit budget funds for the project.", "Finally, as required by the Ticket to Work Act, we considered a variety of potential changes to the attorney fee structure, some of which raised concerns. For instance, one issue related to a potential change that would link the user fee to the timeliness of the SSA payment, decreasing the fee if the SSA payment were not timely. However, some claims for DI routinely need additional processing time, such as those requiring verification of workers compensation payments. To fairly administer such a provision, SSA would need to differentiate between cases where delays involve additional processing and those cases with no need for additional processing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The DI program, created in 1954, provides monthly cash benefits to workers who have become severely disabled and to their dependents and survivors. These benefits are financed through payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers and by the self-employed. Proof of disability can involve complex technical issues, and section 206(a) of the Social Security Act permits claimants to appoint an attorney to represent them at proceedings before SSA, at any level of administrative review.", "The disability claims process is complex, multilayered, and lengthy. The following scenario portrays the process for DI claimants who are typically represented by an attorney before SSA\u2014i.e., those cases where the claim is ultimately appealed to SSA\u2019s Office of Hearing and Appeals (OHA). Initially, the claimant would have filed a claim for DI benefits with a local SSA field office. This office would have then forwarded the claim to a state agency to examine the claimant\u2019s evidence for medical disability. The state agency would then have denied the claim in an initial review and denied it again after reconsidering the claim. Once SSA notified the claimant of denial of benefits, the claimant would have then appealed to OHA. At OHA, the claimant would have had a hearing before an administrative law judge who would have reversed the decision of the state agency, finding the claimant eligible for DI benefits. Generally, the claimant appoints an attorney for the OHA level appeal.", "The fees that attorneys representing DI applicants can charge are limited by law and must be approved by SSA. Since 1967, SSA has administered fee payments to attorneys representing DI claimants. To be compensated, attorneys must file with SSA either a fee agreement\u2014a formal contract signed by the applicant and the attorney setting the fee as a percentage of the applicant\u2019s past-due benefits\u2014or a fee petition that lists the specific costs associated with the case. Of the two, the fee agreement is the much simpler arrangement; generally, it specifies fees limited to 25 percent of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits up to a maximum of $4,000. In contrast, the fee petitions require attorneys to itemize expenses and hourly charges, and SSA must determine a reasonable fee to compensate the attorneys. Assuming either a fee agreement or a fee petition is approved, SSA withholds the amount of the fee from the beneficiaries\u2019 past-due benefits and pays the attorneys directly.", "Historically, attorneys representing claimants before SSA submitted fee petitions for their services. As the percentage of claimants represented by attorneys in DI hearings increased from 19 percent in fiscal year 1967 to 66 percent in fiscal year 1987, fee petitions became a significant administrative burden for SSA. To alleviate some burden, the Congress streamlined the fee approval process in 1990 to allow attorneys to use the much simpler fee agreement in cases where SSA finds the claimant eligible for past-due benefits. Since the introduction of fee agreements in 1991, their use has become nearly universal\u2014in 2000, 88 percent of the attorney fees were based on fee agreements. However, even with the prevalence of the simpler fee agreement, SSA continued to have significant delays in paying attorney fees, and attorneys increasingly turned to court action to obtain their fees.", "In 1995, SSA proposed to stop processing attorney fees for DI claimants, and estimated that, if this were done, it would save $20 million in administrative costs. This cost estimate was the basis for a 6.3 percent assessment on attorneys for use of SSA\u2019s processing services enacted in the 1999 Ticket to Work Act, a charge deducted directly from the attorney\u2019s fee. Under this law, SSA is to determine (for calendar years after 2000) a percentage rate that allows \u201cfull recovery of the costs of determining and certifying fees to attorneys for the past-due benefits of the claim,\u201d but is not to exceed 6.3 percent of the total fee.

Neither OHA nor the processing centers routinely collect information that specifically identifies the costs associated these services. To develop its estimate, SSA relied on various data it adapted from its regular operations, as well as surveying its regional offices to determine time spent on attorney fees in OHA. Our review indicated flaws in these data and suggested that the original estimate should be adjusted downward. However, without adequate data, we were unable to make exact corrections to the estimate. Instead, we made rough assumptions with the best available data and we limited our costs to those related to attorney fee processing but clearly unrelated to normal case processing. Using these assumptions\u2014which may result in understating SSA\u2019s actual costs\u2014we approximated the lower bound of SSA\u2019s administrative costs.

Within SSA, its field offices, OHA, and the processing centers all have important roles in managing a disability claim. However, for the most part, OHA and the processing centers have the central functions of fee processing. OHA must review and approve fee arrangements, while the processing centers pay the attorney fee once the amount of past-due benefits is determined.", "For OHA fee approval services, SSA estimated costs of $12 million for 1999\u2014which we restated in terms of 2000 costs as $13.8 million. Within OHA only a small portion of staff time is spent reviewing fee arrangements. For fee agreements, SSA estimated that its staff spent about 1 1/2 hours handling each agreement during an OHA appeal that may take about 1 year to complete. However, the small amount of time spent reviewing each fee agreement becomes significant when all such review time is totaled. For example, OHA processed about 179,000 fee agreements in 1999\u2014if each took 1 1/2 hours to process, the total time to process would be the equivalent of 129 work years and result in millions of dollars of costs.", "While OHA did not have an information system that routinely collected data about the time spent on each fee arrangement, it used operational data to determine the general types of work considered related to these costs\u2014for example, approving fee agreements, reviewing administrative disputes, etc. For each category of work, OHA developed a series of tasks necessary to perform the work. Then, to obtain information on how long it took to complete each task, OHA surveyed its regional offices.", "Most of SSA\u2019s administrative costs, however, were for paying the attorney fees\u2014in 2000, SSA estimated that this service by its processing centers cost $40.2 million, or three-quarters of the total estimate of $54 million. For the most part, this cost relates to manually handling the attorney payments. Once a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits are determined, a clerk manually processes the payment\u2014filling out a form that shows what payment is authorized, calculating the user fee, and giving the form to the data entry clerks for further processing. As with the OHA fee approvals, even though the time on each task may be small, it becomes significant when all such time is summed up.", "To develop its estimates for payment processing, SSA relied on the cost allocation system it uses in its normal operations. SSA generally uses this system to account for the expenses of its various types of work so that the proper trust fund account can be charged; the system allocates SSA\u2019s administrative costs to one of the various trust funds SSA administers. Although the system was not developed to analyze the costs related to fee payments, SSA has adapted it to collect data on attorney fee work. Even so, when SSA used the data from this system to make its estimate, it had to first remove costs unrelated to processing attorney fees for DI claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flaws in SSA\u2019s Estimate Suggest That Downward Adjustment is Needed", "paragraphs": ["Our review of SSA\u2019s estimate indicated that it is likely too high.

For example, there was no data available to calculate exactly how much overtime had been used to process the payment backlogs. As another example, while SSA officials agreed that the majority of staff that routinely work on payment processing tasks had lower salaries than the average calculated, they were unable to provide us with more specific data on staff costs. Furthermore, it was not always clear as to what costs should be included in the estimate\u2014 for instance, we eliminated certain costs related to handling attorney inquiries because we believe that they included instances of normal case processing unrelated to the steps needed to process attorney payments. SSA officials, on the other hand, argued that these same costs should be included because they were handling matters dealing with attorneys.", "Although we were unable to precisely correct for each of these adjustments, we approximated a \u201clower bound\u201d of SSA\u2019s administrative costs.

Recently, SSA conducted a 1-day sample of cases with attorney fees that looked at factors, such as those listed above, that complicate the payment process. Of the 669 attorney fees processed on August 10, 2000, 48 percent had some factor that complicated the processing of the case.

An official representing SSA hearing officers told us that he believed that applicants with a legal representative tended to fare better than those without one because the cases are better presented in the OHA proceedings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Representation of DI Claimants Since Implementation of the User Fee", "paragraphs": ["In general, legal representation of DI claimants in OHA proceedings has steadily increased in the past 2 years.

The attorney would deposit the check into an escrow account and pay the past-due benefits, minus his or her fee, to the claimant.", "Such a change could have serious policy implications, however. For instance, SSA currently attempts to pay the claimant as soon as possible after a favorable decision. Joint checks might delay payment to the claimant because the claimant would need to wait until the attorney deposited the check into an escrow account. Also, using a joint check would reduce SSA\u2019s ability to enforce the fee limits and could increase the risk that attorneys might short-change claimants. A number of administrative issues would need to be addressed, as well. Because SSA must report the claimant\u2019s benefits to the Internal Revenue Service, it must track the amount each claimant receives. With joint checks, the attorney would need to certify to the amount provided to the claimant.

SSA estimated the costs for the two major components of these services (1) the 1999 Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) fee approval process; and (2) the 2000 fee payment process. We describe our adjustments to the costs of each component in separate sections below. In general, we were unable to precisely correct the estimate because of inadequate data and unclear cost definition. However, with rough adjustments to the original estimate, we have attempted to approximate a \u201clower bound\u201d of the SSA costs. We have discussed each of our adjustments, and our proposed corrections, with SSA officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OHA Fee Approval Process", "paragraphs": ["According to SSA\u2019s estimate, OHA staff spent 236 work years on about 206,000 fee approval actions, at a cost of $13 million in 1999. These actions included approval of both fee agreements and fee petitions, as well as reviews of disputes over fees. The vast majority of these actions involved approval of fee agreements\u2014in 1999, OHA approved about 179,000 fee agreements.", "The cost estimate, however, included work not related to disability insurance (DI) cases and used an unrealistically high estimate of staff time taken to review fee agreements. While we could identify these problems, we could only approximate the actual adjustment needed to correct the original estimate because of insufficient data.", "First, the estimate included costs spent on cases that were not DI cases. In 1999, there were about 185,000 OHA cases with attorney representation that resulted in favorable decisions for the claimant. However, of these cases, only about 79 percent (146,000) involved claims for DI benefits and the remaining 21 percent (39,000) involved claims for benefits under the SSI program only. SSA officials acknowledged that their estimate included work on fee approvals for other than DI cases, but they were unable to provide us with a more detailed breakout of workload (e.g., the number of fee agreements that were also DI cases).", "In addition, the SSA estimate appears to overstate the time it takes to routinely handle a fee agreement. Over the past 10 years, SSA\u2019s role in regulating attorney fees have become much less burdensome. With the simplified fee agreement, SSA staff can, for the most part, verify that the claimant has agreed to pay his or her attorney 25 percent of past-due benefits, instead of reviewing itemized hourly charges commonly presented in fee petitions. Despite the steady trend towards uniform use of the simplified fee agreement, the most recent estimate of the time it takes to review a fee agreement is twice that used in SSA\u2019s 1995 cost estimate. In 1995, SSA estimated that it took about 45 minutes of staff time to review and process a fee agreement. In 1999, however, its estimate of the same review had risen to 94 minutes per agreement. The 1999 estimate included about 47 minutes to evaluate whether each agreement meets the regulatory criteria\u201432 minutes by a senior case technician, and once this is done, 15 minutes by the administrative law judge (who also takes 6 minutes to sign each agreement). After the judge signs the order, the estimate included 16 minutes for a clerk to mail the fee approval agreement (with the rest of the case file) to the payment processing center.", "While we were unable to quantify the actual staff time, the 1995 estimate of 45 minutes appears to be the better approximation of staff time spent handling routine fee agreement approvals, particularly in view of the increasingly uniform use of this simplified fee contract. To develop the 1999 estimate of staff time, SSA officials told us that they polled the OHA regional offices in a 4-day period. They received responses from only 6 of the 10 regional offices, and those responses included wide variations for staff time\u2014for instance, the estimate for the review by the administrative law judge went from 1 minute to 5 days. Additionally, the time for the mailing the fee agreement included the time spent to mail the entire OHA decision.", "Our review suggests that the OHA costs in 1999 may be as low as $6.4 million, or 51 percent of the original estimate. Our adjustments to the OHA estimate are as follows: 1.  Because SSA could not provide us with a detailed breakout of the OHA work on DI cases, we reduced the total estimate by 21 percent\u2014the proportion of non-DI cases in the OHA 1999 workload. This adjustment reduced the estimate by $2.7 million, to $10.3 million. 2.  Once we removed the non-DI cases from the estimate, we then reduced the estimate of staff time spent on fee agreement approval by one-half, roughly the difference between the 1995 and the 1999 staff estimate. This change lowered the OHA estimate by $3.9 million (30 percent), to $6.4 million. 3.  We restated the estimated costs in terms of costs in 2000, to be comparable to SSA estimates of processing costs. To do this, we inflated the estimated costs (and our proposed adjustments) by 6.6 percent, the amount by which the cost of the average OHA staff year increased in 2000 over 1999.", "The original OHA estimate, our adjustments to the estimate, and the limitations to these adjustments are shown in table 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fee Payment Processing Costs", "paragraphs": ["According to SSA, its payment processing centers took 673 work years to process $512 million in attorney fee payments in 2000, at a cost of $40.2 million. SSA developed this estimate from the standard system of cost allocation it uses at the payment centers. Under this cost allocation system, each payment center\u2019s workload is quantified by a random check, conducted daily, of the work done by all employees at the center. Each type of work at the payment centers is categorized, and one major category of work includes that done on attorney fee processing. This work category (called \u201catfee\u201d in the centers) includes all work done at the payment centers related to handling and paying fee agreements and fee petitions. The work includes all cases that involve attorney fees\u2014field office cases (initial determinations and reconsiderations) as well as OHA cases.", "Our review indicated that the payment processing estimate appears high. It included an incorrect cost amount; failed to adjust for one-time use of premium overtime pay to reduce processing backlogs; included costs not clearly associated with fee payments; and it used average salary costs when the staff who routinely work on most payment processing receive below-average pay. However, we were, for the most part, unable to make precise adjustments for these problems because of limited data and unclear definitions as to what counts as a fee processing cost.", "First, the original estimate erred in a calculation of the total estimate by using the wrong amount of total costs for the largest processing center. In creating the estimate, SSA used an incorrect category from its cost accounting system to calculate the center\u2019s costs. This cost category included costs unrelated to the work necessary to process attorney fees.", "Second, the estimate did not adjust for premium overtime pay. Because the user fee required by the Ticket to Work Act was effective February 1, 2000, SSA staff worked overtime in February and March to clear out the backlog of fee payment cases pending as of February 1. According to testimony by SSA\u2019s Assistant Commissioner before the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee on Ways and Means, in June 2000, SSA provided an extra 111 staff work years to handle the backlog of fee cases, diverting resources from other workloads to process the claims on a priority basis.", "Third, the general \u201catfee\u201d work category used to designate attorney fee processing in the centers appears to include subcategories of work too broad to be included in the estimate\u2014in our view, the subcategories include work that would be necessary for normal case processing even if SSA did not pay attorney fees. According to staff in the centers, the subcategory \u201catfee misc\u201d includes correspondence from attorneys that cannot be clearly categorized as dealing with either fee agreements or fee petitions. For example, a letter would be classified as \u201catfee misc\u201d if it included issues related to the claimant as well as a question about fees. One supervisor told us that the designation of work category was made by a GS 4 or 5 file clerk who would classify any correspondence with an attorney\u2019s letterhead as \u201catfee misc\u201d if the letter could not be clearly identified to another specific work category.", "Finally, the staff salary costs included in the estimate should be adjusted to reflect more accurately the lower staff salaries of the technicians who routinely work on payment processing. SSA\u2019s estimate is based on the average salary of all its employees who work on DI cases involving OHA decisions. However, the staff working on these cases includes both claims authorizers (generally paid a GS-11 salary) and benefit authorizers (generally paid between GS-7 and GS-9 salaries). For the most part, the lower-paid benefit authorizers process the attorney fees, while the higher- paid claims authorizers perform the main case processing. From SSA data, it appears that over 50 percent of the work on DI cases with OHA decisions is case processing work routinely performed by the higher-paid claims authorizers.", "Taking into account the points noted above, we believe that the \u201clower bound\u201d costs for the processing centers could be as low as $28.6 million. Our calculation of the adjusted estimate is as follows: 1.  We corrected the SSA estimate for an error in its calculations of the processing center costs. This correction reduced the estimate by $1.9 million (5 percent) to $38.3 million. 2.  We adjusted for the premium overtime pay. We reviewed data provided by SSA on the increase in overtime pay in 2000 over the prior year. Using this information, we allocated a part of the increase in overtime pay to the center\u2019s attorney fee work, reducing the estimate by $0.5 million (1 percent) to $37.8 million. 3.  We eliminated the costs associated with the subcategory \u201catfee misc\u201d from the costs. When these costs were subtracted from the estimate, the original estimate was reduced by $5.5 million (13.7 percent) to $32.3 million. Because some of the work included in this subcategory was likely to be directly related to the fee processing, eliminating this subcategory most likely understated some of SSA\u2019s actual costs. 4.  We adjusted the estimate to better reflect the below-average pay of the staff who routinely handle attorney fee processing. SSA was unable to provide us with data to precisely allocate the salary costs of those working on fee processing; hence, we assumed that all staff who worked on attorney fee processing were paid at a GS-8 step 5 level ($33,202) in 2000, while all the rest of the staff who worked on the same cases were paid at GS-11 step 5 level ($44,369). This adjustment reduced the original estimate by $3.7 million (9.2 percent) to $28.6 million.", "The adjustments to the payment processing estimate are summarized in table 3."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
