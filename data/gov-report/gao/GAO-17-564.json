Expanded access requests must be submitted to FDA but manufacturers must also grant permission for patients to access their investigational drugs. Of the nearly 5,800 expanded access requests that were submitted to FDA from fiscal year 2012 through 2015, FDA allowed 99 percent to proceed. Almost 96 percent of these requests were for single patients (either emergency or non-emergency). FDA's review process for expanded access requests is designed such that all requests are either allowed or not allowed to proceed within 30 days of receiving each request. FDA typically responded to emergency single-patient requests within hours and other types of requests within the allotted 30 days.", "FDA and other stakeholders, including a non-profit organization and a drug manufacturer, have taken steps to improve the expanded access process and patient access to drugs. For example, in response to concerns that the process to request expanded access to drugs was complex and cumbersome, FDA simplified its website, guidance, and the forms required for the most common types of requests. Efforts by other stakeholders include a project to educate and streamline the process by which institutional review boards approve treatment plans for expanded access drug use and a pilot advisory group to help a drug manufacturer manage expanded access requests. Some states have also enacted \u201cRight-to-Try\u201d laws to facilitate patient access to investigational drugs. These laws provide liability and licensing protections for manufacturers and providers under state law if an adverse event\u2014such as an adverse reaction to the drug\u2014occurs with patients who were allowed access to investigational drugs. However, some stakeholders GAO interviewed cited concerns that these laws may not help patients access drugs, in part because they do not compel a manufacturer to provide access.", "Manufacturers sponsoring clinical trials must submit safety reports to FDA that include adverse events data resulting from clinical trials and any expanded access use, to be used in assessing the safety of a drug within the drug approval process. FDA reported using these data from expanded access use in a few cases during the drug approval process but not more widely, because its use does not have the same controls as clinical trials. FDA officials reported that they communicate with manufacturers on how they will use expanded access adverse events data. However, GAO's review of documents FDA uses to communicate with drug manufacturers about the expanded access program found that only one included a reference to its use of these data, and it did not include specific examples of how the data might be used. Further, some of the manufacturers told GAO the guidance was unclear. These manufacturers noted that the lack of clear information can influence their decision whether to give patients access to their drugs because of their concerns that an adverse event will result in FDA placing a clinical hold on their drug, which could delay its development. This could impact FDA's goal of facilitating expanded access to drugs for treatment use by patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, when appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FDA should clearly communicate how it uses adverse events data from expanded access use in the drug approval process.

When expanded access use is for an  immediately life-threatening disease or condition, the available  scientific evidence, taken as a whole, must provide a reasonable  basis to conclude that the investigational drug may be effective for the  expanded access use and would not expose patients to an  unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury.", "FDA officials told us that, in addition to these criteria, agency reviewers  will also consider whether submitted requests have provided sufficient  information to allow FDA to make an informed decision on the request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA and Others Have Taken Steps to Improve the Expanded Access Program and Patient Access to Investigational Drugs, but Stakeholders Continue to Cite Concerns", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA Continues to Undertake Efforts to Improve the Expanded Access Program", "paragraphs": ["According to FDA officials and stakeholders, FDA has undertaken efforts  to improve the expanded access program.

FDA guidance  specifies that safety data, which include any unexpected adverse events  that are associated with the use of a drug, even during expanded access  use, must be reported along with safety data from clinical trials. Agency  officials noted that these data can contribute important safety information  that might not otherwise be collected in clinical trials and that they take  into account the context of the expanded access situation, such as use in  patients with serious or life-threatening ailments, when reviewing new  drug applications (NDA) and biologics license applications (BLA). For  example, officials said that in some cases adverse events data from  expanded access use can identify rare side effects not detected in clinical  trials, as well as inform FDA reviewers of any safety issues involving  patient populations that were not otherwise included in the drug\u2019s clinical  trials. FDA\u2019s primary goal of the expanded access program is to allow  patients with no other options access to investigational drugs when  appropriate. Data from expanded access use can also help FDA meet its  agency goal of collecting meaningful data about the use of investigational  drugs.", "However, several stakeholders we spoke with, including the selected  manufacturers, raised concerns that FDA is not clear about how it uses  expanded access adverse events data in its review of NDAs and BLAs.

Some of the manufacturers  reported that they have concerns about the possibility that FDA\u2019s use of  adverse events data from expanded access requests would result in a  clinical hold on their drug, which would halt all testing on human subjects  and, as a result, delay the drug\u2019s development process. One study  included a review of ten years (2005 through 2014) of expanded access  data to determine how often a clinical hold was put on a drug that was  obtained via expanded access. This review only found two instances in  which adverse events from expanded access use contributed to a  decision to have a clinical hold put on a drug.

Specifically, our review of FDA\u2019s regulations and nine related documents  FDA uses to communicate with manufacturers regarding expanded  access use found little information communicating how FDA uses adverse  events data from expanded access in new drug application reviews. Our  review included FDA\u2019s three new guidance documents on expanded  access, four letters of acknowledgement FDA sends to sponsors after  they submit an expanded access request, and two guidance documents  on IND safety reporting (a 2012 final document and 2015 draft of new  guidance).

According to FDA officials, it included this reference in response to  manufacturer\u2019s requests that more clarity be provided on how these data would be used. Although FDA took steps to improve its communication on  this, the information in the document is vague in that it contains few  details and no specific examples. The specific language is as follows:  \u201c\u2026There are a small number of cases in which FDA has used  adverse event information from expanded access in the safety  assessment of a drug. However, FDA reviewers of these adverse  event data understand the context in which the expanded access  use was permitted (e.g., use in patients with serious or  immediately life-threatening diseases or administered in a clinical  setting (not clinical trial)) and will evaluate any adverse event data  obtained from an expanded access submission within that  context\u2026.\u201d", "According to standards for internal control in the federal government,  management should ensure adequate means of communicating with  external stakeholders who have a significant impact on the agency  achieving its goal.
