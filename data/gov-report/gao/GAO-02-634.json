The most frequently diverted prescription drugs are those that are prone  to abuse, addiction, and dependence, such as hydrocodone (the active  ingredient in Lortab and many other drugs), diazepam (Valium),  methylphenidate (Ritalin), and oxycodone (the active ingredient in  OxyContin and many other drugs). According to the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA), increases in the extent of prescription drug abuse  and in emergency room admissions related to prescription drug abuse, as  well as an increase in the theft and illegal resale of prescription drugs,  indicate that drug diversion is a growing problem nationwide. In 2000, the  most recent year for which data are available, about 9 million Americans  aged 12 and older reported using prescription drugs, including pain  relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, or sedatives, for nonmedical purposes.  The abuse of illegally diverted prescription drugs is associated with  serious consequences, including addiction, overdose, and death.", "Fifteen states currently operate prescription drug monitoring programs  (PDMPs) as a means to control the illegal diversion of prescription drugs.  PDMPs collect, review, and analyze prescription data from pharmacies.  They provide data and analysis to state law enforcement and regulatory  agencies to assist in identifying and investigating activities potentially  related to the illegal prescribing, dispensing, and procuring of prescription  drugs. Because of your interest in the issues of prescription drug diversion  and control, you asked us to address the following questions: (1) How do  the 15 PDMPs compare across states in terms of objectives, design, and  operation? (2) What benefits have state PDMPs produced? (3) What  challenges do states face in implementing and using PDMPs?

We selected these three  because they were the most recently established programs. We  interviewed PDMP administrators and stakeholders in these three states.  Although the stakeholders varied in each state, they included officials of  state medical and pharmacy associations, state attorneys general offices,  state drug enforcement agencies, state police, and a state medical  examiner\u2019s office. We also spoke with officials from practitioner licensure  boards and state law enforcement agencies, as well as DEA  representatives. We also discussed PDMPs with officials from Purdue  Pharma L.P., the manufacturer of OxyContin and other prescription drugs.  To determine what activities are being pursued at the national level to  reduce illegal diversion of prescription drugs, we interviewed experts from  DEA, the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws, the National  Association of State Controlled Substance Authorities, and the Bureau of  Justice Assistance in the Department of Justice, and reviewed pertinent  documents.

PDMPs have  also been used to educate physicians, pharmacies, and the public about  the existence and extent of diversion, diversion scams, and the drugs most  likely to be diverted by individuals. Programs have provided educational  materials to physicians on ways to prevent drug diversion and to educate  their patients about the diversion problem. They have evaluated  prescribing patterns to identify medical providers that may be  overprescribing and inform them that their patterns are unusual. They  have also identified patients who may be abusing or diverting prescription  drugs and provided this information to practitioners. For example, PDMPs  in Nevada and Utah send physicians drug utilization letters containing  patient information that signal potential diversion activity, including the  number and types of drugs prescribed to the patient during a given time  period and the pharmacies that dispensed the drugs. PDMPs have also  provided physicians with information on addiction treatment options for  patients identified as drug abusers or diverters.

As shown in table 1, nine PDMPs  cover only Schedule II controlled substances, which have the highest  potential for abuse and addiction. Two states, Kentucky and Utah, cover  all schedules, and Nevada covers Schedules III and IV, as well as II.  Washington\u2019s program is used as a disciplinary tool and covers a variety of  controlled substance schedules on a case-by-case basis for each  practitioner. Most experts agree that covering all schedules prevents drug  diverters from avoiding detection by bypassing Schedule II drugs and  switching to drugs in other schedules. Program officials in Kentucky and  Utah also told us that covering all schedules allows them flexibility to  respond if drugs on other schedules become targets for diversion.  Covering more than Schedule II drugs greatly increases the number of  prescriptions that must be reported to the state PDMP.

If users want PDMP reports to  reflect more timely information, dispensing entities would have to report  their data at the time of sale, rather than submitting data biweekly or  monthly, to capture the most recent prescription dispensing. If users want  to be alerted if a certain drug, practitioner, or pharmacy may be involved  in a developing diversion problem, PDMPs would have to initiate periodic  data analysis to determine trends or patterns. Such PDMP enhancements  would entail additional costs, including costs for computer programming,  and data analysis.

Law enforcement officials told us that they view these  drug history checks as initial deterrents\u2014a front-line defense\u2014to prevent  individuals from visiting multiple physicians to obtain prescriptions,  because patients are aware that physicians can review their prescription  drug history. For an individual who may be seeking multiple controlled  substance prescriptions, the check allows a physician to analyze the  prescription drug history to determine whether drug treatment appears  questionable, and if so, to verify it with the listed physicians. In Kentucky,  a physician can request a PDMP report the same day as a patient\u2019s  appointment, and usually receives the patient\u2019s drug history report within  4 hours of making the request.

PDMPs, particularly those with  electronic databases, raise additional confidentiality concerns, however,  because their databases contain complete dispensing records that can  more quickly identify individual patients, physicians, and pharmacies and  provide an individual report on their prescription drug history. Physicians  are concerned that their prescribing decisions and patterns may be  questioned and that they could be investigated without sufficient cause.  Some physicians contend that patients may suffer because physicians will  be reluctant to prescribe appropriate controlled substances to manage a  patient\u2019s pain or treat their condition.

For  example, some state laws to regulate controlled substances and to operate  a PDMP include health privacy protection provisions. In addition, states  with PDMPs generally have statutory and regulatory protections to limit  access and use of confidential health care data, as well as statutory  penalties for misuse. Under Kentucky\u2019s electronic PDMP, for example, the  authorized users of its information are statutorily delineated, the knowing  misuse of the data can result in a felony conviction, and the PDMP itself is  statutorily accountable for ensuring that only authorized users receive its  data. Kentucky law also prohibits any person who receives PDMP data  from sharing that information with anyone else, unless required by a court,  and the Kentucky PDMP advises data recipients of this prohibition.  Nevada\u2019s state law similarly protects the confidentiality of its PDMP  information by requiring a court order for disclosure to nonauthorized  entities. Also, Nevada\u2019s Board of Pharmacy has legal authority to discipline  and fine an individual for violating the confidentiality law.

It recommended that PDMPs cover all schedules of  controlled substances, use some form of an electronic monitoring system,  safeguard the confidentiality of the prescription data collected, analyze the  data to provide information for law enforcement and medical  professionals, provide education to health professionals regarding the  monitoring system and pain management, and include an evaluation  component to assess its costs and benefits. Along with its work group  report, the Alliance provided a draft model state law.", "The Alliance also facilitates communication between states that are  considering a PDMP and states that have programs in place, and provides  technical assistance to states on implementing its recommendations. It  reviews draft bills and provides information on current PDMP status,  trends, and legal matters to state legislatures.

It has  also provided states with computerized information and intelligence on  the distribution of certain controlled substances and coordinated major  investigations. In addition, DEA has served as a program resource for  states seeking assistance with developing PDMPs and drafting and  promulgating regulations.", "Over the past 11 years, three states have obtained federal funds to initiate  PDMPs: Kentucky (1998), Massachusetts (1992), and Oklahoma (1991).  More recently, additional funding has been made available for grants to  states that are planning to start a PDMP or expand an existing program.  Two million dollars in grants from the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of  Justice Assistance is to be administered jointly with the DEA. DEA and  the Bureau of Justice Assistance designed the grant program to allow  states with legislation or regulations for a PDMP program in place or  pending to apply for funding. There are also grants available for states  with existing PDMPs to improve program capabilities through enhanced  technology. According to DEA, seven New Program Grants of $180,000  and two Enhanced Program Grants of $220,000 will be available.

Prescription drug  monitoring programs offer states a more efficient means of detecting and  deterring illegal diversion.

A lack of awareness of  the magnitude of the problem, concerns about confidentiality on the part  of patients, physicians, pharmacists, and legislators, and difficulty in  accessing funding have kept the numbers of PDMPs low.", "Cooperative efforts at the state and national levels are seeking to  overcome these challenges and increase the number of states with  programs. For states considering establishing PDMPs, the report by the  Alliance\u2019s Prescription Monitoring Work Group provides a useful roadmap  of the critical factors each state needs to consider in order to create an  effective program.
