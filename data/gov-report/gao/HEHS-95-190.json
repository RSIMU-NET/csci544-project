In May 1995, veterans were awaiting decisions on over 450,000 compensation and pension claims and VA was taking over 5 months on average to process original disability compensation claims. Although these numbers represent some improvement over the immediately preceding years, no such improvement has been shown in appeals processing. At the end of 1994 over 47,000 appeals were before the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. On average, veteranscould expect to wait almost 2-1/2 years from the date of their original claim to receive a decision on these appeals. Many veterans will, therefore, experience a significant delay in receiving benefits they are entitled to.", "Over the last 5 years, numerous studies have made recommendations to improve VA claims processing and many of these recommendations have focused specifically on appeals processing. In response to these studies, recent legislation, and other management initiatives, VA has implemented many changes and plans more efforts to address problems at both its regional offices (VARO) and the Board. In spite of these actions, however, VA officials foresee continued problems with appeals processing.", "Although the recommendations were wide-ranging, three areas were most frequently targeted. Appendix I summarizes recommendations and VA actions in two of these areas: (1) improving staff performance through training, guidance, and standards and (2) increasing process efficiency through actions such as automation, revised procedures, and increased staffing.

In that year the Court of Veterans Appeals, established by the Veterans\u2019 Judicial Review Act (P.L. 100-687, Nov. 18, 1988), began to hear cases. With the Court in place, the Board is no longer the final step in the claims adjudication process. Veterans who disagree with Board decisions may now appeal to the Court. Additionally, under some limited circumstances, either veterans or VA may appeal Court decisions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.", "Veterans appeal relatively few VARO decisions.

Rockefeller IV, then Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell asked us to review several aspects of the Board\u2019s processing of appeals. During our preliminary work we identified several recently completed reviews of VA\u2019s appeals process. We also determined that VA had made progress in implementing two types of recommendations frequently cited in these studies\u2014those dealing with improving staff performance and with making the process more efficient\u2014but substantially less progress in a third area, interaction among VA organizations responsible for appeals processing. In subsequent discussions with the requesters\u2019 staffs we agreed to focus our review on (1) the current state of appeals processing, including trends in timeliness and backlog, and (2) the extent to which VA has implemented study recommendations, especially those designed to help VA organizations work together to improve claims and appeals processing to better serve the veteran.", "Through discussions with Board officials and others, we identified seven studies that included adjudication of veterans\u2019 appeals. The studies were completed between May 1990 and March 1995. The studies contained 89 recommendations. To better understand the intent of some recommendations and obtain further insights of those who had participated in the studies, in some cases, we also discussed the recommendations with members of the study groups.", "We reviewed the following seven studies that evaluated aspects of the appeals process:", "1990 GAO report, (Veterans\u2019 Benefits: Improved Management Needed to Reduce Waiting Time for Appeal Decisions (GAO/HRD-90-62, May 25, 1990) discussed the lack of timeliness in VA appeals processing.", "1992 Task Force on the Impact of the Judicial Review Act of 1988 evaluated the effect of the Court on workload and timeliness.", "1993 Blue Ribbon Panel on Claims Processing made recommendations to shorten the time it takes to make disability decisions, including appeals.", "1994 Analysis of Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals Remands (VBA\u2019s study of almost 700 remanded cases) sought to improve the timeliness of the service VA provides to customers who appeal a decision.", "1994 Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals Select Panel on Productivity Improvement developed recommendations to reduce appeal processing time.", "1995 VA\u2019s Compliance With the Court of Veterans Appeals (a committee appointed by the Secretary of VA) investigated issues raised by the Court\u2019s Chief Judge.", "1995 VA Inspector General Audit of Appeals Processing Impact on Claims for Veterans\u2019 Benefits reviewed the impact of appeals and the appeals process.", "We also included in our review actions taken beyond specific study recommendations, including the Board\u2019s plans for reorganization and implementation of two key pieces of legislation that mandated or allowed changes in claims processing: The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals Administrative Improvement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-271, July 1, 1994) and the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Improvements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-446, Nov. 2, 1994). Among other things, these laws allowed single-member Board decisions and required VAROs to place a priority on adjudicating appeals remanded by the Board. To determine the status of the recommendations and other actions, we interviewed officials of three VA organizations directly involved in appeals processing\u2014VBA, the Board, and the VA Office of the General Counsel\u2014in Washington, D.C. We also reviewed pertinent documents and records obtained from these organizations, as well as relevant VHA policies; VHA publishes the guidance used by its physicians in performing disability determination examinations.", "Additionally, to provide examples of the adjudication process and problems identified in the studies, we reviewed a small sample (39) of appeals that the Board remanded during the period January 27 to 31, 1995. We selected the cases from the 290 that were remanded during this period.", "Although the Board decides appeals about all aspects of veterans programs, including, for example, health care, home loans, and education, over 90 percent of appeals concern claims for disability compensation and pension benefits originally decided by VAROs. Therefore, we focused on these types of appeals. The Board remands appeals to the agency of original jurisdiction, which could be organizations within VA other than VBA. However, because we focused on compensation and pension appeals, we refer throughout this report to VBA, which is the agency of original jurisdiction for these types of claims.", "We did not assess either the efficiency of VA\u2019s claims and appeals adjudication operations or the impact that implementing the study recommendations would have on operations.

However, as shown in figure 2.1, this increase began to skyrocket after 1991. Overall, the backlog increased by almost 175 percent, from about 17,000 in 1991 to over 47,000 in 1994. In large part this increase is due to the decrease in the Board\u2019s productivity\u2014the number of decisions rendered annually. This decrease began about the time the Court began remanding cases to the Board for lack of completeness. Although the number of appeals received by the Board annually has decreased slightly in recent years, the backlog has grown substantially as the number of decisions the Board rendered decreased. The number of decisions dropped from about 45,000 in 1991 to about 22,000 in 1994. Given that the number of decisions rendered annually is significantly lower than the number of appeals being filed (about 35,500 in 1994), the backlog can be expected to continue to increase.", "Appeals processing time is also on an upward course. On average, appeals decided in 1990 that were not remanded took about 16 months from the time the veteran notified the VARO that he or she disagreed with the VARO\u2019s decision until the Board made its decision. In 1994, an appeal took over 24 months to process, a 50-percent increase in 4 years. During a large part of that time the appeal is \u201cin queue\u201d at the Board, awaiting its turn. The portion of time the appeal was before the Board\u2014after the VARO had reconsidered the appeal based on the veteran\u2019s notice of disagreement and certified the appeal to the Board\u2014increased 100 percent, from 6 months in 1990 to 12 months in 1994. Board officials acknowledged that as the backlog increases the processing time will also rise. Unlike VBA, the Board has not established claims processing timeliness goals. VBA has established goals for some types of claims. For example, its goal for original compensation claims is 106 days. However, the Board has not established any similar types of goals.", "Another measure of this increase is the Board\u2019s response time, defined as the number of days it will take the Board to render decisions on all pending appeals. The Board\u2019s response time rose from 240 days in 1992 to 781 days in 1994; as of July 1995, the response time for fiscal year 1995 was estimated at 694 days.", "These statistics are even more alarming because about one-half the Board\u2019s decisions are not final. Increasingly, the Board is remanding cases to the VAROs for additional development and reconsideration. The percentage of cases remanded has increased substantially. Before 1991, about 20 percent of cases were remanded annually. This percentage began rising in 1991 to its current rate of about 50 percent. The number of remands peaked at about 17,000 in 1992; there were about 11,000 remands in 1994. (See fig. 2.2.) Additionally, in 1994, over 34 percent of appeals being remanded to the VAROs had already been remanded one or more times.", "Remands can add substantially to Board workload. Board data show that about 75 percent of the cases remanded to a VARO are again denied and returned to the Board. Thus, about 8,000 of the 11,000 claims remanded by the Board in 1994 can be expected to be returned; this is about 20 percent of the 35,500 appeals the Board received in 1994. Furthermore, average processing time is higher for remanded cases and also has been rising. In 1990, the Board averaged just over 17 months to process a remanded appeal, but by 1994 the time had increased by over 60 percent to almost 28 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Claims Adjudication Process Can Be Cumbersome", "paragraphs": ["The claims adjudication process in VA has evolved over many years and seeks to provide the veteran every opportunity to prove his or her claim and to obtain benefits. The basic process, which starts with filing a claim with a VARO, allows each claim up to five considerations, as follows:", "VARO staff decide whether to grant the benefits after obtaining and considering all relevant information, such as military service and medical records, and in most cases a physical examination by a VHA physician. If the veteran notifies the VARO that he or she disagrees with the decision, the VARO will reconsider the case and if it does not grant the requested benefits it will issue a statement of the case summarizing the reasons. If the veteran still disagrees, he or she can file an appeal. The VARO will again reconsider the case and if all claimed benefits still are not granted it will send the appeal to the Board. However, any amount granted by the VARO is received by the veteran while the amount under appeal is being decided by the Board.", "The Board makes its decision.", "If benefits are still denied, the veteran can take his or her claim to the Court.", "But this process can become increasingly complex. At any time before a claim is appealed to the Court, the veteran can ask and will be given an opportunity for a hearing. If the hearing is before a VARO hearing officer, the hearing officer may also consider the claim and grant benefits if evidence in the hearing warrants. If the claim has already been appealed, a Board member would conduct the hearing and consider the evidence presented in arriving at a Board decision. Much of this process, such as when veterans may receive hearings and from whom, is set forth in legislation and regulations.", "The veteran may also introduce new evidence during the process, requiring VA to then obtain that evidence and decide if it is relevant and, if so, consider it in the decision. Under VA regulations, unless the veteran shows good cause, all new evidence must be submitted within 90 days after the VARO notifies the veteran that his or her appeal has been forwarded to the Board. The Board is usually liberal in its interpretation of good cause, according to a Board official; thus, veterans frequently submit new evidence after the 90-day period.", "Also, the veteran may claim a new or increased disability after the appeal is in process, in which case, unless the veteran waives his or her right for reconsideration, the VARO must complete any required additional development, often including a new physical examination, and then reconsider the claim. Again, the veteran\u2019s right to revise a claim during the adjudication process is set forth in legislation, regulations, and Court decisions.", "Figure 2.3 illustrates this process. If the Board remands the claim to the VARO, much of the process may be repeated, since the remand usually will require additional development and reconsideration.", "Additionally, even if the veteran has received a final decision on a claim he or she may seek to reopen the claim with the submission of new and material evidence. This is considered a new claim in VA\u2019s processing system. Board officials pointed out that even if the evidence is not new and material a decision by both VBA and, if the decision is appealed, by the Board is required to adjudicate the claim."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Cite the Act and Court Decisions as Key Factors in Increased Board Workload", "paragraphs": ["VA officials stated that increased responsibilities imposed on VA by the 1988 act and Court decisions have contributed directly to the substantial increase in claims and appeals processing times as well as to the increased number of remanded decisions. Board officials stated that the impact of the act and the Court began to be felt in 1991, after the Court began issuing decisions in 1990.", "Officials cited increased responsibilities in two areas as having the greatest impact: the need to fully explain the reasons and bases for decisions and VA\u2019s duty to assist the veteran in filing a claim. Board officials point to the expanded requirements to explain the reasons and bases for their decisions as one of the key reasons for the 50-percent reduction in Board productivity. They noted, for example, that these requirements, such as specifically discussing the merit and weight given to each item of evidence, have substantially increased the complexity of each decision in terms of both its length and the time it takes to prepare it. The decrease in the Board\u2019s productivity is also reflected in a substantial growth in the per-case costs that the Board incurs to process appeals. As figure 2.4 shows, the Board\u2019s per-case cost was relatively stable until 1991, when it began to increase rapidly. The costs grew from about $400 in 1990 to $1,250 in 1994.", "The increased duty-to-assist requirements fall heaviest on the VAROs, which have primary responsibility for developing claims. However, given that the failure to comply with some aspect of duty to assist is a reason for the majority of remanded cases, the Board, too, feels the impact. Data from the February 1994 VBA remand study show that 60 percent of the remands involved the need to accomplish additional case development; that is, in the Board\u2019s view, VAROs had failed to satisfy their duty-to-assist responsibilities by not making sufficient effort to obtain some type of evidence in support of appellants\u2019 claims. Board data also point to the substantial impact of the duty-to-assist requirement. The data show that claims are remanded, on average, for 2.6 reasons. The Board categorizes these data into 20 reasons; only 4 are cited in over 20 percent of the cases and 3 of those directly relate to duty-to-assist requirements.", "Officials also noted that both the act and Court decisions have placed greater emphasis on procedural requirements, resulting in remands for failure to follow technical procedures. The following case serves as an example. A veteran\u2019s ex-wife was appealing a VARO decision not to apportion part of the veteran\u2019s pension for the period of time they were separated before their divorce. The VARO denied the ex-wife\u2019s claim because the veteran had provided financial support during that time and apportioning his benefits would have caused an undue financial hardship. The Board remanded the appeal, directing the VARO to comply with contested claim procedures by notifying the veteran of the appeal. Yet the claim file indicates that the veteran was aware of the appeal, because his representative provided evidence to the Board at an informal hearing on the appeal.", "Board and VBA officials agree that in many of these cases the likelihood of a change in the decision\u2014that is, in the veteran being granted benefits\u2014is virtually nonexistent. In the past, officials said, the Board often would not have remanded such cases because the final result would have been the same. Now, with the possibility of judicial review before them, the Board does remand the case to ensure all necessary procedures are followed.", "Finally, both Board and VBA officials said that cases often are remanded so that the VARO can apply a new rule\u2014that is, a rule articulated by the Court after the VARO makes its decision but before the Board closes the case. Court decisions must be applied to all pending cases. Thus, even if the VARO applied the law appropriately at the time that its decision was made, if an applicable Court decision is issued before the Board makes a final decision, the Board will remand the case to the VARO to apply the newly stated requirements. For example, in one case a VARO denied death compensation to a veteran\u2019s wife based on VA regulations that were in effect at the time. While the case was pending before the Board, the Court held that a portion of the regulation used in deciding the case was invalid. Therefore, the Board remanded the case. Data available from the Board indicate, however, that this is a relatively infrequent occurrence. No more than 6 percent of the cases remanded were because of laws, regulations, or Court decisions that became effective after the VARO\u2019s decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Process May Contribute to Problems", "paragraphs": ["Some officials we spoke to see the process itself as part of the problem, and the studies we reviewed made several recommendations to change various aspects of the process. Legislative or regulatory changes are needed before these recommendations can be implemented, however, and in some cases concerns have been raised about the possible negative impact on veterans seeking benefits.", "One recommendation limits the time in which the veteran may introduce new issues to the appeal. The Inspector General found that allowing veterans to introduce new evidence and issues at virtually any time in the appeals process caused significant delays in many cases. In March 1995 he recommended that veterans not be allowed to add new issues or evidence once the VARO certified the appeal to the Board; a new appeal would have to be filed on new issues. A recent VBA study of a small sample of appeals seems to support the potential benefit of this recommendation. The study found that in all cases the hearing officer\u2019s decision was correct (over one-half the cases had a VARO hearing); only after the hearing and after new evidence and issues had been included were problems found. VBA is currently considering how to implement the Inspector General\u2019s recommendation, including deciding if a legislative change is necessary.", "Another recommendation seeks to change the process in another way. The Board\u2019s Select Panel on Productivity Improvement called for the Board to obtain the evidence needed to decide appeals. Thus if additional information were needed, the Board would obtain it directly from the source rather than remanding the claim back to the VARO to get it. This recommendation is intended to reduce the time spent preparing cases by eliminating the need for formal statements between the Board and VAROs about additional required evidence. In addition, the chairman of the panel noted that the suggested change would use Board members and staff attorneys to prepare decisions, rather than VARO staff who are not attorneys, and thus better ensure that the decisions meet the Court\u2019s requirements. VA is drafting revised regulations to enable it to test this approach.", "Another recommendation by both the Select Panel and VA\u2019s Inspector General is to allow VARO hearing officers to conduct hearings for the Board. The studies point to several positive benefits of this change, including a reduction of travel costs for Board members and the opportunity for more cases to be resolved in VAROs. A legislative change is needed to implement this recommendation.", "The Inspector General also recommended eliminating the requirement for statements of the case for disability claims. Currently, VAROs must prepare a statement of the case for each claimant who initiates an appeal. The purpose of this statement is to aid the claimant by describing the issues on appeal and summarizing the evidence of record, applicable laws and regulations, and reasons for the decision. The report suggested that VA\u2019s responsibility to provide the claimant with the legal citations on which the decision is based could be met by including those citations in the rating decision rather than in the statement of the case as is currently done. Again, a legislative change is needed before VA can implement this recommendation.", "Concerns have been raised about some of these recommendations, most frequently focused on the potential negative effect on those seeking benefits. Both veterans service organizations and VA\u2019s Inspector General disagree with the recommendation to have the Board obtain information directly, concerned that already overburdened Board staff would get further behind. While this concern might be overcome by adding staff to the Board, perhaps from VAROs, some veterans service organizations were also concerned that this recommendation would eliminate one step in the process that could allow cases to be granted by VAROs. Likewise, the Disabled American Veterans representative on the Select Panel disagreed with the recommendation concerning hearing officers, stating that it would prevent the appellant from having the hearing before the person who would decide the case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The appeals process is very cumbersome and additional efforts to identify ways to streamline it are warranted.

These types of differences not only contribute to inefficient adjudication, but also inhibit VA\u2019s ability to clearly define its responsibilities and the resources necessary to carry them out.

Additionally, VBA, in consultation with General Counsel staff, puts out written guidance shortly after such Court decisions. This written guidance has limitations, however. First, the Board does not participate in developing it. Additionally, the full impact of Court decisions may not be immediately clear so that this written guidance may not capture all needed changes. Board interpretations of Court decisions can evolve over time as individual Board decisions more fully or clearly articulate the principles included in specific Court decisions.

This type of concern was echoed more recently by both the May 1994 VBA Analysis of Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals Remands and the June 1994 Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals Select Panel on Productivity Improvement. The VBA analysis recommended that an active working group be established with representatives from the Board, VBA, and where appropriate VHA to address problem areas so that VA as a whole could provide better service to the veteran. Likewise, the Select Panel recommended that a steering group composed of VBA, VHA, the Board, and veterans service organizations meet at least quarterly to recommend changes concerning the quality and timeliness of claims processing.", "Some officials we spoke to also suggested that the organizations may have difficulty working together to resolve issues, especially those that directly affect individual organization resources. Some suggested that a broader organizational restructuring may be needed. For example, staff familiar with VBA and Board activities suggested that working groups comprised of representatives of equal status\u2014that is, without designating someone to be in charge\u2014are ineffective. Likewise, the chairman of the Select Panel on Board Productivity noted that someone above each of the organizations needed to be involved to ensure resolution of problems.", "Others familiar with the system also suggested a variety of changes. The Chief Judge of the Court, expressing dissatisfaction with VARO implementation of Court decisions, suggested that VAROs should be placed directly within the chain of authority of the Court. Likewise, an official in VA\u2019s General Counsel suggested that Board members be stationed in the VAROs, improving communication and reducing processing time. Similarly, the chairman of the Select Panel on Board Productivity suggested that the introduction of the Court created an entirely new set of circumstances and that the Board\u2019s role may need to be fundamentally changed. He pointed out, for example, that as the process is currently structured, the Board and VBA hand appeals back and forth to each other and neither organization is held accountable for the total action. The Chairman of the Board has also noted that since the Court became operational the Board\u2019s role is a hybrid\u2014on the one hand judging VARO decisions and on the other making its own decisions about appealed cases. While not suggesting a specific resolution of the issue, he has suggested that it may be necessary to redefine the Board\u2019s role."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Officials Point to Extensive Communication Among Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Officials pointed to a variety of formal and informal communications involving organization officials and staff.

They also pointed out that many of the authors of the studies we reviewed were representatives from several key VA organizations, thereby assuring that they worked together to identify problems and solutions.", "More specifically, in the fall of 1994, the Deputy Secretary of VA started holding monthly meetings with the Chairman of the Board and the Under Secretary for Benefits to discuss claims processing issues. The Chairman of the Board also noted that he meets with VA\u2019s General Counsel and the Under Secretary for Benefits as needed to iron out any problems that come up. Although VA never established a focal point as we recommended, the Chairman said that the meetings between key officials, in essence, ensure a focal point for agency actions in appeals processing. He could not identify specific policy or procedural changes resulting from these meetings, explaining that the meetings would be only a part of the process for developing such changes.", "VA officials told us that the ongoing, formal strategic planning process\u2014preparing a written strategic plan\u2014does not include a focus on responding to requirements of judicial review. They said that this recommendation, which was made in September 1992, was not considered pertinent when the new administration took over in January 1994 with new strategic planning priorities. However, the Chairman again pointed to the meetings of key organization officials as, in essence, constituting a strategic planning forum. The Chairman suggested that under earlier administrations the key VA organizations were, perhaps, less willing to work together, but that the current Secretary has put a priority on VA organizations working together to serve the veteran. He also said that actions such as those taken as part of the budget process and in response to the Select Panel recommendations demonstrate that VA is, in fact, addressing issues resulting from judicial review.", "Likewise, the working groups recommended by the VBA Remand Analysis and the Select Panel were not established, even though officials in both VBA and the Board had agreed to do so. VA officials reiterated that many meetings already occur between representatives of the organizations. Officials cited triad meetings\u2014monthly meetings of staff from the Board, VBA, and General Counsel\u2014as especially significant. Officials said that these meetings are intended to resolve intra-agency issues. Staff members who attend these meetings told us that the primary focus of the meetings is on individual cases, for example, agreeing on a Department position on a claim appealed to the Court, rather than on more general procedural or policy issues. VA officials pointed out, however, that the need for policy or procedural changes can be identified from discussions of individual cases and provided an example of a procedure that was worked out between the Board and VBA at those meetings. (It dealt with whether the Board or VBA would notify the claimant about a particular type of Board decision.)", "VA officials also said that they were reluctant to establish working groups such as that recommended in the Select Panel report to identify problems because doing so would duplicate the efforts of the Veterans Claims Adjudication Commission. The Commission is charged with making recommendations to improve VA\u2019s claims adjudication process. Commission officials told us that they were sympathetic with VA\u2019s reluctance to devote resources to yet another study of the claims processing issue or to develop solutions now that might be overcome by recommendations of the Commission. However, they were uncertain about the extent to which their study and recommendations would include the overall organizational structure or interaction among the various VA organizations responsible for claims adjudication.

One relates to how current a medical exam needs to be for cases sent to the Board. In 1990, we reported that VAROs were using different standards; some delayed decisions to obtain new exams for appealed claims, others did not. We recommended that VA provide VAROs guidance on this issue. The 1991 Chairman\u2019s memorandum to Board members pointed to additional issues related to inconsistencies between Board interpretations of requirements and VARO staff practices. These included the need for examinations by specialists, the need for the physician to review the entire claim file before completing a physical examination, and the need for VARO\u2019s to \u201ctry again\u201d to obtain information.

However, Board officials cautioned that appeals may be remanded for several reasons and changing policies and practices in the areas cited above may not affect the remand rate overall.

For example, officials noted that the development required in the above case study would require substantial resources even for that one case. Similarly, during our discussion with Board and VBA officials concerning the need for the VHA physician to have the claim file, VBA officials said that doing that in most cases raises resource issues, including the time it takes to transfer the file and the difficulty in keeping track of the file once it leaves the VARO. VHA also may have difficulty meeting this requirement. For example, the Secretary\u2019s Court of Veterans Appeals Fact-Finding Committee reported in February 1995 that VHA often uses contract physicians to perform the physical examinations on veterans claiming disability compensation. The report noted one such physician as saying that VA did not pay him enough to spend the time it would take to review the claim file, even if VBA sent it.", "The impact that various interpretations of requirements has on resources underscores the need for organizations to agree on what those requirements are.

More generally, Board decisions\u2014interpreting requirements set forth in law and Court decisions\u2014can expand the level of effort VAROs must expend in assisting veterans in filing claims. Similarly, VARO actions directly affect Board workloads. For example, the increase in the number of remands increases the Board workload in the form of claims returned for a second Board review.

These efforts should be ongoing to ensure such consistency, obtaining General Counsel opinions where needed and to ensure that any resource or organizational difficulties are identified and resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In a meeting on August 15, 1995, VA\u2019s Chief of Staff, the Under Secretary for Benefits, the Chairman of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, and other key officials commented on a draft of this report. The VA officials acknowledged that appeals processing is one of the most serious problems currently facing the agency. They stated that they concurred with our recommendation and that the Deputy Secretary sees clearly identifying and resolving problems with the claims adjudication process as his responsibility. They see the recommendation as reemphasizing the importance of efforts under way by the Deputy Secretary and other key officials to solve this problem.", "The officials said that they have been focused on the overall issue of VBA/Board timeliness for some time and that efforts to improve the timeliness of VARO claims processing have been successful. They said that emphasis and resources will continue to be devoted to improving VBA timeliness, but that increased attention now has been placed on the Board and on the VBA/Board interface. The officials indicated that they are committed to reducing appeal processing time significantly. They noted that three presidential appointees confirmed by the Senate are directly responsible to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary for taking the steps necessary to improve timeliness and that the Deputy Secretary is actively involved in ensuring that each facet of the adjudication structure works with the common goal of putting veterans first. Each official understands the necessity for early identification and resolution of inconsistent interpretations of law. They also noted that specific actions to ensure identification and resolution of problems have been suggested in the many studies already done. Officials said that many of these ideas have been or will be implemented and that those discussed in our report are good ideas. They also said that the actions that are not being done need to be done, and those that are not being done well must be improved. They believe that the necessary mechanisms are in place to identify any inconsistent interpretations and resolve them through the General Counsel. Officials said that time will tell if this increased awareness and focus will resolve the problem.", "We agree that the active involvement of the Deputy Secretary, especially with an increased focus on appeals, could have a positive impact on resolution of appeals problems. This is especially true if actions previously recommended are implemented and if, through existing mechanisms, such as the permanent working group, VA actively pursues the issue of inconsistent interpretations and other interface problems. VA officials, however, did not offer any details of actions expected to be taken."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
