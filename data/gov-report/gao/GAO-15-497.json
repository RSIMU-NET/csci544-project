The phrase \u201cinternal control\u201d does not refer to a single event, but rather a series of actions that occur throughout an entity's operations on an ongoing basis for safeguarding assets and preventing and detecting errors and fraud. DOT provided evidence that the design of its TRANServe debit card program aligns with each of the five internal control standards as identified in GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and as described below.", "Control environment : DOT has established a control environment framework for the TRANServe debit card program by, among other things, setting the program's primary goal as enhancing internal controls to deter waste, fraud, and abuse of transit benefits.", "Risk assessment : DOT established the position of internal controls officer, in 2007, to examine control activities and identify potential program vulnerabilities through the testing of debit card controls.", "Control activities : TRANServe has established mechanisms for controlling the use of the debit card.

From 2011 to 2013, TRANServe staff tested the debit card with transit agencies in eight areas across the country, making dozens of purchases of both transit-related and consumer-related products. In most cases the purchase restriction succeeded in preventing the debit card from purchasing non-transit-related products. In the few cases where the restriction failed, TRANServe took steps to have additional restrictions placed on the debit cards. Once it completed the tests in each region, TRANServe sent the test results to IRS, and once IRS was satisfied with the final results, IRS officials sent DOT an e-mail confirming that the debit card qualified as a transportation fringe benefit in that area.

Morgan to obtain transaction records during the field  testing phase.", "Figure 4 shows how TRANServe implemented its field tests of the debit  cards in each of the eight service areas.", "According to TRANServe officials, TRANServe staff reviewed the test  results for each service area to determine whether the debit card  restrictions were effective. The testers compiled information about their  purchases and obtained transaction reports from J. P. Morgan.  TRANServe reviewed this information in order to verify that the debit card  restriction held and that the card was used only for authorized purchases.  In some instances, TRANServe subsequently worked with J. P. Morgan  to implement MID blocks. In other situations, TRANServe worked with the  respective transit authorities to ensure proper usage of the debit card.  Following each of the field tests, TRANServe shared the results with IRS  and obtained IRS\u2019s comments or questions about the tests and results.  Once IRS was satisfied with the final results in a service area, IRS sent  TRANServe an email correspondence to confirm its understanding of the  test results and that based on such test results, the debit card constitutes  a transit pass and qualifies as a transportation fringe benefit. TRANServe  substantially completed the roll out of the debit-card program by the end  of fiscal year 2014.", "In each service area, TRANServe completed a number of debit card  transactions, to test whether the debit card was sufficiently restricted.", "Service area 1: TRANServe began field tests in the area between July  and September 2011. Testers completed 103 point-of-sale tests, of  which 87 of the transactions passed (i.e., the card restrictions held so  that it could only be used to purchase transit media), 10 failed, and 6  were not completed for reasons such as the merchant did not have  the item in stock. Seven of the 10 failed transactions resulted from  one merchant\u2019s overriding declined payments, and the remaining 3  purchases were at parking garages that used an accepted MCC.  According to TRANServe officials, TRANServe worked with its  financial agent to stop this merchant from overriding transactions and  planned to use anomaly testing to further detect parking garage  transactions. In November 2011, based on the test results, IRS  officials confirmed to TRANServe that based on the test results the  debit card constitutes a transit pass in the Norfolk and Baltimore  metropolitan regions. In the National Capital Region, the debit card  satisfied the requirements for a bona fide cash reimbursement  program for purposes of transit systems that do not accept the local  smart card (i.e., Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority  SmarTrip\u00ae card), which is a transit pass.", "Service area 2: TRANServe began field tests in the area between July  and September 2011. Testers completed 130 point-of-sale tests, of  which 122 of the transactions passed and 8 transactions failed. The  failed transactions resulted from merchants\u2019 overriding declined  payments and approving transactions at certain parking garages.  TRANServe indicated it would work with its financial agent to stop the  merchants from overriding transactions and it would continue to  monitor the parking garage activities through anomaly testing. In  January 2012, IRS officials confirmed that, based on the test results,  the debit card constitutes a transit pass in the service area.", "Service area 3: TRANServe began field tests in the area between  January and March 2012, but excluded one potential target area,  Milwaukee, because research on transit in the city indicated too few  locations to purchase fare media with credit or debit cards. Testers  completed 175 point-of-sale tests, of which 174 of the transactions  passed and one transaction failed. This transaction involved the  tester\u2019s making a purchase of a non-transit-related item at a transit  store location that offered consumer merchandise. According to  TRANServe, it worked with the transit authority to change its  procedures so that only transit fare media can be purchased with the  debit card. In March 2012, IRS officials confirmed that, based on the  test results, the debit card constitutes a transit pass in the service  area.", "Service area 4: TRANServe began field tests in the area between July  and September 2012. Testers completed 80 point-of-sale tests, of  which all of the transactions passed. In May 2013, IRS officials  confirmed that, based on the test results, the debit card constitutes a  transit pass in certain parts of the service area (specifically, in  Portland and in Seattle\u2014although the pass is limited to use at national  van pool companies in Seattle).", "Service area 5: TRANServe began field tests in the area between  April and June 2012. Testers completed 52 point-of-sale tests, of  which all of the transactions passed. In December 2012, IRS officials  confirmed that, based on the test results, the debit card constitutes a  transit pass in certain parts of the service area (specifically, Boston  and Newark). At that time, IRS was still evaluating TRANServe  information provided for Buffalo, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.  TRANServe subsequently completed additional tests in these  locations. The tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the card  restrictions, and IRS officials agreed later in December 2012 and  March 2013 that, based on the test results, the debit card qualified as  a transit pass in these locations.", "Service area 6: TRANServe began field tests in the area between  January and March 2012. Testers completed 151 point-of-sale tests,  of which 149 transactions passed and 2 failed. These transactions  involved the purchase of parking passes through a transit authority.  TRANServe did not roll out the debit card in this segment of the  service area because it could not resolve the co-mingling of transit  and parking purchases. In August 2012, IRS officials confirmed that,  based on the test results, the debit card constitutes a transit pass in  certain parts of the service area (specifically, Los Angeles, El  Segundo, San Jose, San Diego, San Francisco, and Oakland).", "Service area 7: TRANServe began field tests in the area between  April and June 2012. Testers completed 84 point-of-sale tests, of  which 82 transactions passed and 2 failed because the tester was  able to purchase non-transit-related items at a transit authority store  and bike rental shop. TRANServe worked with J.P. Morgan to block  purchases at those locations. In December 2012, IRS officials  confirmed that, based on the test results, the debit card constituted a  transit pass in certain parts of the service area (specifically, Salt Lake  City, Ogden, Albuquerque, Denver, and Phoenix). At that time, IRS  was still evaluating DOT\u2019s information provided for Honolulu.  Following additional points of sale tests by TRANServe, IRS  confirmed that, based on the test results, the debit card constituted a  transit pass in Honolulu for van pool and bus service.", "Service area 8: TRANServe began field tests in the area between  April and June 2012. Testers completed 79 point-of-sale tests, of  which all of the transactions passed. In May 2013, IRS officials  confirmed that, based on the test results, the debit card constitutes a  transit pass in certain part of the service area, specifically Dallas,  Houston, San Antonio, St. Louis, and Kansas City."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation and  Internal Revenue Service for review and comment.
