While an independent NASA office reviewed the estimate developed by the program and as a result the program made some adjustments, officials did not commission the development of a separate independent estimate to compare to the program estimate to identify areas of discrepancy or difference. In addition, the program did not cross-check its estimate using an alternative methodology. The purpose of developing a separate independent estimate and cross-checking the estimate is to test the program's estimate for reasonableness and, ultimately, to validate the estimate. The continued accuracy of the estimates is also questionable because officials have no plans to update the original estimates created in 2013. GAO's cost estimating best practices call for estimates to be continually updated through the life of the program to provide decisionmakers with current information to assess status. Moreover, as stressed in prior GAO reports, SLS cost estimates only cover one SLS flight in 2018 whereas best practices call for estimating costs through the expected life of the program.", "Limited cost and schedule reserves place the program at increased risk of exceeding its cost and schedule commitments. Although the SLS program is committed to a November 2018 launch readiness date, it has been pursuing an internal goal for launch readiness of December 2017, with the time between December 2017 and November 2018 being designated as schedule reserve. The SLS program expects to use a significant amount of schedule reserve, in part to address some technical challenges, and plans to shift its internal goal from December 2017 to tentatively July 2018. This shift will reduce the amount of available schedule reserve from 11 months to just 4 months. In addition, the program planned for cost reserves of less than 4 percent each year and has already allocated those funds for this year, which leaves no reserve funding available to address unanticipated issues.", "Earned value management (EVM) data for SLS remains incomplete and provides limited insight into progress toward the program's external committed cost and schedule baselines because it tracks progress relative to the program's internal goals\u2014which have proven unrealistic. EVM data is intended to provide an accurate assessment of program progress and alert managers of impending schedule delays and cost overruns. GAO analysis of available SLS contractor EVM data indicated that the contractors may incur cost overruns ranging from about $367 million to about $1.4 billion, which is significantly higher than what the contractors were reporting\u2014$89 million. SLS is implementing a program-level EVM system that, once complete, will include all contractor work and work conducted in-house by NASA and may provide more comprehensive information on program progress relative to internal goals.

To develop the estimate, officials  used a detailed work breakdown structure\u2014the structure used to define in  detail the work necessary to accomplish program objectives\u2014that is  traceable to the cost of each work element and the contract statement of  work and documented ground rules and assumptions. To fully meet the  criteria for being comprehensive, however, the estimate should define in  detail all costs through the expected life of a program. The estimate  satisfied NASA\u2019s cost estimating approach for Human Exploration  programs by including life-cycle costs through launch readiness for EM-1,  but did not include any costs for deployment and operation and  maintenance of SLS beyond the first flight. These costs will likely far  exceed the costs of development through the first flight. For example, in  October 2009, the Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee  reported that the fixed costs of the facilities and infrastructure associated  with the Shuttle program were about $1.5 billion a year. Given that  NASA hopes to operate the SLS for decades, it is reasonable to expect  that the deployment and operation and maintenance costs\u2014which should  be included in a reliable estimate of life-cycle costs\u2014alone for the SLS  will outweigh the agency\u2019s current estimated cost of $9.7 billion. NASA  has stated that cost estimates do not need to cover the program from  \u201ccradle to grave.\u201d Rather, NASA\u2019s position is that the program\u2019s estimate  is only meaningful up to the time that the SLS is delivered for its first  launch, because the agency is taking what it calls a capability approach.  Therefore, NASA has only estimated costs of the program to the point at  which the capability will be achieved. Furthermore, NASA has yet to  determine the number of launches, their missions, or the operating  lifetime for the program, which according to agency officials makes it  difficult to estimate the total costs of the program. Nevertheless, Office of  Management and Budget guidance and GAO\u2019s Cost Assessment Guide  indicate that life-cycle cost estimates should encompass the full life cycle  of a program.", "Well Documented: The SLS cost estimate substantially met the criteria  for being well documented; however, some explanations to support the  estimate were missing. A well-documented cost estimate includes  thorough documentation and is traceable to information sources. We  found that the SLS cost estimate documentation discusses, and is  consistent with, the program\u2019s technical baseline and provides evidence  that the cost estimate was reviewed by management. The estimate also  included explanations for how the estimates for the underlying  components were created through an assessment of likely costs for each  part of the system supplemented with an engineering review. In some  instances, however, explanations of how historical data were normalized,  that is, adjusted to support the estimate, were missing. For example, the  cost estimate does not explain how historical costs for the space shuttle  main engine were normalized to support the estimate. The purpose of  data normalization is to make a given data set consistent with and  comparable to other data used in the estimate so that they can be used  for comparison analysis or as a basis for projecting future costs.  Insufficient documentation of how the historical data were adjusted can  hinder understanding and proper use of the estimate.", "Accurate: The SLS cost estimate substantially met the criteria for being  accurate, but the continued accuracy of the estimate is in question  because officials have no plans to periodically update the estimate.  Accurate cost estimates are based on assessments of most likely costs,  adjusted properly for inflation, and contain few, if any, minor mistakes. In  addition, a cost estimate should be updated regularly to reflect significant  changes in the program. The SLS cost estimate meets most of these  characteristics as it is based on an assessment of likely costs, is adjusted  properly for inflation, and contains few if any mistakes. Contrary to best  practices, however, NASA does not periodically update the estimate  based on actuals, which limits its use as a management tool for  monitoring progress and planning future work. The program prepared its  cost estimate and JCL in calendar year 2013. GAO\u2019s cost estimating best  practices call for estimates to be continually updated through the life of  the project, ideally every month as actual costs are reported in earned  value management reports. Best practices also call for a risk analysis and  risk simulation exercise\u2014like the JCL analysis\u2014to be conducted  periodically through the life of the program, as risks can materialize or  change throughout the life of a program. Unless properly updated on a  regular basis, the cost estimate cannot provide decisionmakers with  accurate information to assess the current status of the project.", "Agency officials have indicated that the SLS program has no plans to  update the cost and schedule estimates underlying the JCL or the JCL  itself, which calls into question the continued accuracy of the estimates.  NASA\u2019s policy for space flight program and project management requires  a program\u2019s committed cost estimate to be updated (rebaselined) if it  exceeds the external baseline committed cost by 30 percent or more, and  if a project is rebaselined, the JCL should be recalculated and approved  as part of the rebaselining process. The NASA Cost Estimating  Handbook, however, indicates that program cost estimates should be  updated when program content changes and as programs move through  their life-cycle phases and conduct milestone reviews, and recognizes  that estimates regularly updated based on actual program performance  give decisionmakers a clearer picture for major decisions. In addition,  through our work assessing large scale programs at the Department of  Defense we have found that some programs update cost estimates  annually and regularly report progress relative to both threshold and  objective targets.", "Credible: The SLS cost estimate only partially met the criteria for  credibility because the SLS program did not cross-check the results of the  estimate and did not commission an independent cost estimate. The  purpose of developing a separate independent estimate and cross- checking the estimate is to test the program\u2019s estimate for  reasonableness and, ultimately, to validate the estimate. Consistent with  best practices, the program conducted a risk and uncertainty analysis that  calculated the likely cost and schedule consequences on the program for  each risk identified and conducted a duration sensitivity analysis to  determine how varying the lengths of different tasks affected the program.  Contrary to best practices, however, the SLS program did not cross- check the results of its cost estimate. The main purpose of cross- checking is to determine whether alternative estimating methods produce  similar results. If cross-checking confirms the results of the estimate, then  confidence in the estimate increases, leading to greater credibility. In  addition, project officials did not commission an independent cost  estimate\u2014a separate estimate produced by an organization outside of  the SLS program chain of command\u2014which is considered one of the best  and most reliable estimate validation methods because it provides an  independent view of expected program costs that tests the program  office\u2019s estimate for reasonableness. An estimate that has not been  reconciled with an independent cost estimate has an increased risk of  being underfunded because the independent cost estimate provides an  objective and unbiased assessment of whether the project estimate is  realistic. Because the cost estimate only partially met the criteria for  credibility, the estimate does not fully reflect the characteristics of a  quality estimate and cannot be considered fully reliable.", "While the program did not commission an independent estimate, NASA\u2019s  Independent Program Assessment Office (IPAO)\u2014which reviews NASA  programs at key decision points in the life cycle to support approval  decisions by the agency leadership\u2014did review the program\u2019s cost  estimate at the program\u2019s Key Decision Point C (KDP-C) review. KDP-C  is the point in NASA\u2019s project life cycle where baseline cost and schedule  estimates are established and projects begin implementation. During this  review, the IPAO found that the SLS JCL process and cost model were  sound; however, the IPAO also found that the program\u2019s initial SLS cost  estimate appeared optimistic relative to predictions based on historical  data from similar programs. For example, the IPAO reported that the  program was underestimating the likely range of cost growth for four key  elements\u2014software development, core stage qualification, core stage  testing, and procurement of the interim cryogenic propulsion stage.

Schedule reserve  is extra time, with the money to pay for it, in the program\u2019s overall  schedule in the event that there are delays or unforeseen problems. For  the SLS program, the 11-month difference between the program\u2019s internal  launch readiness goal and its committed schedule baseline represents  the program\u2019s schedule reserves. Cost reserves are additional funds that  can be used to mitigate problems during the development of a program.  For example, cost reserves can be used to buy additional materials to  replace a component or, if a program needs to preserve schedule, cost  reserves can be used to accelerate work by adding extra shifts to  expedite manufacturing and save time. Because NASA anticipated a  relatively flat budget for SLS, the agency chose to limit cost reserves and  rely on schedule reserve\u2014the 11 months between the internal launch  readiness goal in December 2017 and the committed baseline in  November 2018\u2014as the primary way to mitigate risk. The SLS program,  however, is planning to use 7 of the 11 months of schedule reserve,  which would delay its planned goal for launch readiness for EM-1 from  December 2017 to, tentatively, July 2018. At this point, the agency has  not, however, delayed its baseline commitment date of November 2018.  As a result, the agency would have only 4 months of schedule reserve  remaining between July 2018 and November 2018 to address any further  problems that it may encounter. See figure 3.", "Complex development efforts like SLS must plan to address myriad risks  and unforeseen technical challenges. As mentioned above, cost and  schedule reserves are one way to address risks and challenges. NASA\u2019s  Marshall Space Flight Center, which manages the SLS program, has  guidance requiring programs to present their planned cost and schedule  reserves for approval prior to key milestones, but the guidance does not  establish specific requirements for reserve levels. However, other NASA  centers, such as the Goddard Space Flight Center\u2014the NASA center  with responsibility for managing other complex NASA programs such as  the James Webb Space Telescope\u2014has requirements for the level of  both cost and schedule reserves that projects must have in place at KDP- C. At KDP-C, Goddard flight projects are required to have cost reserves  of 25 percent or more and 1 month of schedule reserve for each year of  development from KDP-C to the start of integration and testing, 2 months  per year for integration and test through shipment to the launch site, and  1 week per month from delivery to launch site to actual launch.", "As a result of flat funding requests, the SLS program has very low levels  of cost reserves compared to other programs and to cost reserve  guidance of NASA centers. The IPAO noted that the program\u2019s planned  cost reserves at the time of its review\u20146 percent\u2014were too low and  compared poorly to other development programs which normally had 30  percent cost reserves at a similar stage of development. To execute  within the anticipated flat funding profile, the program extended its  development schedule and limited the amount of cost reserves  available\u2014about $50 million each year, which is about 3.7 percent of the  fiscal year 2016 budget request for the program. Program officials stated  that these cost reserves were completely allocated to technical risks  during the budget planning process, which leaves the program with  schedule reserves as its sole resource to address unanticipated issues  throughout the year. Operating with schedule reserves as the only option  for addressing challenges, however, increases risk to the program\u2019s  launch readiness date because any issue that occurs will impact the  overall schedule.", "On a program like SLS such challenges are likely. For example, the  current internal launch date delay is due, at least in part, to problems that  are requiring the program to modify one of the four contracts for its major  elements (the core stage, boosters, main engines, and interim upper  stage). According to program officials, the program is modifying the core  stage contract, in part, because the tooling that will be used to  manufacture the 212-foot-tall core stage was vertically misaligned by the  subcontractor during its installation. According to officials, the  misalignment would have prevented production of the core stage. The  necessary repairs are currently scheduled to be completed in August  2015.", "To address this challenge, as mentioned above, the program is  anticipating using 7 of its 11 months of schedule reserve and will have  only 4 months of schedule reserve to address risks with 3.5 years  remaining until the program\u2019s committed baseline launch readiness date.  The program, however, has yet to begin integration and testing where we  have previously found projects can expect to encounter challenges that  will impact schedule. Similarly, as part of its analysis of the SLS cost  and schedule estimates, the IPAO reported that, based on its review of 20  historical NASA projects, the majority of schedule growth occurs after  critical design review, which for SLS is currently scheduled for summer  2015. While the current delay has not impacted the program\u2019s November  2018 baseline commitment, it will increase risk to the committed date  because\u2014as noted above\u2014the project has limited cost reserves and will  now have limited schedule reserves to address any future problems or  delays at the point when problems are most likely to occur.", "Using schedule reserve alone, rather than in combination with cost  reserves, does not provide the program with the same level of flexibility to  mitigate risks to maintain planned cost and schedule. GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide states that all development programs  should have cost reserves. Problems always occur, and program  managers need ready access to funding in order to resolve them without  adversely affecting the program. In the case of SLS, if further problems  arise associated with the program\u2019s main cost drivers\u2014such as design  and manufacturing of the core stage or developing the integrated flight  software\u2014the program officials will likely have to use what remains of the  program\u2019s schedule reserve to resolve these problems. As the program  has limited cost reserves, this would put the committed launch readiness  date at risk.", "This approach\u2014using only schedule reserve to address challenges\u2014also  leaves the program in the position of potentially having to, for example,  descope planned work or to further delay test events or launch readiness  in order to address technical risks and challenges, should those  challenges exceed available resources. Both options have long-term  risks. For example, if certain development efforts are deferred beyond  EM-1, technical risk to EM-1, EM-2, or both may increase and could put  additional cost and schedule pressure on EM-2\u2014the first crewed flight\u2014 because more work would then be required within EM-2\u2019s schedule  before the program could achieve launch readiness. However, if  development work\u2014such as data analysis or a test event\u2014is eliminated  altogether, that loss of potential information may increase technical risk to  EM-1. Similarly, delaying planned work is generally not a viable long-term  solution. NASA has found that deferring planned work to stay within  available budget often leads to increased costs in the long term. For  example, in October 2010, the Independent Comprehensive Review  Panel that reviewed the James Webb Space Telescope program found  that delaying work due to inadequate cost reserves did not control  program costs. Doing so delayed and increased costs\u2014typically two or  threefold\u2014due to inefficiencies visited upon other dependent tasks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Earned Value Management System Remains Incomplete and Provides Limited Insight into Progress toward External Committed Cost and Schedule Baselines", "paragraphs": ["NASA is using contractor earned value management (EVM) data as an  additional means to monitor costs for SLS, but the EVM data remain  incomplete and provide limited insight into progress toward the program\u2019s   Program officials  external committed cost and schedule baselines.indicated that the current SLS contractor performance measurement  baselines\u2014which establish the program scope, schedule, and budget  targets to measure progress against\u2014are all based on the program\u2019s  more aggressive internal goal for launch readiness for EM-1 in December  2017 and not its external committed date of November 2018.

The SLS  program-level EVM system, however, is not yet fully implemented.", "Specifically, because the core stage contract is being modified, EVM data  will have to be reset to new performance measurement baselines. The  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11 and Capital  Programming Guide requires EVM for major acquisitions with  developmental effort. According to this guidance, when there is both  government and contractor work, the data from the two EVM systems  must be consolidated at the reporting level for total program management  and visibility. Pulling together EVM data from multiple levels into a  program-level report gives officials a comprehensive outlook of its cost  and schedule and provides the project manager with early warning of  potential cost and schedule overruns. In November 2012, we  recommended that NASA establish a time frame by which all new  spaceflight projects will be required to implement NASA\u2019s newly  developed program-level EVM system. This system should improve  management and oversight of its spaceflight projects by providing a  consolidated tracking mechanism for all of the contract and NASA work  conducted for a program. NASA officials stated that this SLS program- level EVM system would allow the program to better monitor progress  relative to the committed cost and schedule baselines by comparing the  aggregated EAC for both NASA and contractor work to the committed  cost and schedule baselines.", "The delay in implementing program-level EVM data is, in part, due to the  fact that the program was still in the process of modifying the core stage  contract. According to program officials, they identified discrepancies  between the agency\u2019s and the contractor\u2019s positions during the core stage  contract integrated baseline review\u2014a review conducted by program  management to ensure a mutual understanding of the contract\u2019s  performance measurement baseline. Specifically, program officials  determined that the core stage contract needs to be modified to  accommodate delays associated with addressing technical issues with  misaligned tooling and to resolve differences between the program and  the contractor regarding the level of funding available to begin work on  the exploration upper stage. Further, NASA officials stated that the  program-level EVM will not fully reflect program progress until a new  internal program launch readiness goal is set and contract performance  measurement baselines are updated to reflect these new goals for all  NASA and contractor activities. The officials also stated that the internal  program launch readiness goals will not be set until after the agency has  a better understanding of the expected fiscal year 2016 appropriations  and has completed the planning for the fiscal year 2017 budget request.  Operating without program-level EVM leaves SLS at risk of encountering  unexpected cost and schedule growth.", "Both contractor and program-level EVM data, however, is only reported  relative to the December 2017 date, according to program officials. The  potential impact of cost and schedule growth relative to the program\u2019s  external committed cost and schedule baseline of November 2018 is  neither reported nor readily apparent and renders the EVM data less  useful in support of management decisions and external oversight. Major  NASA programs are required by statute to report annually to certain  congressional committees on changes that occurred over the prior year to  the program\u2019s committed cost and schedule baseline, among other   As this report reflects cost and schedule overruns that have  things.already occurred, it does not serve as a mechanism to regularly and  systematically track progress against committed baselines so that  decisionmakers have visibility into program progress and can take  proactive steps as necessary before cost growth or schedule delays are  realized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The SLS program has not updated its cost and schedule estimates since  2013, rendering them less reliable as program management and  oversight tools. Since the estimates were created, the program has  received substantial funding increases in 2014 and 2015 but has also  realized both expected and unexpected risks that are forcing the program  to delay its internal goal for launch readiness. The program\u2019s cost and  schedule estimates, however, do not reflect all of these changes or the 2  years of additional contractor performance data that the program has  accumulated since 2013. Without regular updates, developed in  accordance with best practices\u2014including cross-checking to ensure  credibility and thorough explanations of how the updates were prepared\u2014 cost estimates lose their usefulness as predictors of likely outcomes and  as benchmarks for meaningfully tracking progress. Updated cost and  schedule estimates would provide program and agency officials with a  more informed basis for decision making and provide the Congress with  more accurate information to support the appropriation process. In  addition, tracking and reporting progress relative to the external cost and  schedule baseline commitments on only an annual basis and only once  issues have already occurred limits NASA\u2019s ability to continually monitor  progress and forecast potential risks to these cost and schedule  baselines, such that proactive action can be taken by decisionmakers.  Until a comprehensive program-level EVM system, reporting to a realistic  performance measurement baseline, is fully implemented, agency  leadership and external stakeholders will lack an accurate measure of the  program\u2019s true progress. Further, by pursuing internal launch readiness  dates that are unrealistic, the program leaves itself and others in a  knowledge void wherein progress relative to the agency\u2019s commitments is  difficult to ascertain. As the EVM system only tracks progress toward the  program\u2019s internal goals, the program lacks a mechanism to track  progress to its external cost and schedule baseline commitments. Without  such a tracking tool, stakeholders will lack early insight into potential  overruns and delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the SLS cost and schedule estimates better conform with  best practices and are useful to support management decisions, GAO  recommends that the NASA Administrator direct SLS officials to update  the SLS cost and schedule estimates, at least annually, to reflect actual  costs and schedule and record any reasons for variances before  preparing their budget requests for the ensuing fiscal year. To the extent  practicable, these updates should also incorporate additional best  practices including thoroughly documenting how data were adjusted for  use in the update and cross-checking results to ensure they are credible.", "To provide more comprehensive information on program performance,  the NASA administrator should direct the SLS program to expedite  implementation of the program-level EVM system.", "To ensure that decisionmakers are able to track progress toward the  agency\u2019s committed launch readiness date, the NASA administrator  should direct the SLS program to include as part of the program\u2019s  quarterly reports to NASA headquarters a reporting mechanism that  tracks and reports program progress relative to the agency\u2019s external  committed cost and schedule baselines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["NASA provided written comments on a draft of this report. These  comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, NASA concurred with our  three recommendations. NASA agreed that updating cost and schedule  estimates is a program management best practice and indicated that  moving forward the program would use its budget formulation processes  to update its cost and schedule estimates for the first demonstration of  the initial SLS capability on Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) following the  enactment of NASA\u2019s final appropriations each fiscal year. We are  encouraged that NASA plans to update its cost estimate for SLS annually.  To satisfy the recommendation, we would expect that any updates would  address the deficiencies we identified in NASA\u2019s original estimate for  SLS, including thoroughly documenting how data were adjusted for the  update and cross-checking the results to ensure credibility. NASA also  recognized that having an EVM system in place is a program  management best practice useful for ensuring effective program control.  NASA indicated that it is in the process of implementing program-level  EVM but that the system would not be fully in place until the stages  contract is modified and an independent baseline review is completed in  the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. We appreciate that NASA plans to  implement the program level EVM system as soon as the stages contract  is rebaselined, but we remain concerned that the stages contract will  remain undefinitized until spring 2016. We reported in July 2014 that the  stages contract had remained undefinitized for an extended period and  that leaving the SLS contracts undefinitized for extended periods placed  the government at increased risk of cost and schedule growth and limits  the program\u2019s ability to monitor contractor progress. Likewise, until  certified EVM data from the stages contract is available, the SLS program  will lack a key tool for tracking and forecasting progress as the program  approaches its committed November 2018 launch readiness date. NASA  also agreed that the program should implement a reporting mechanism  that tracks and reports program progress relative to the agency\u2019s external  committed cost and schedule baselines. NASA indicated that the SLS  program-level EVM system would satisfy this recommendation when it is  fully implemented and included as part of the SLS program\u2019s normal  quarterly reporting to the Exploration Systems Development Division at  NASA Headquarters. Given that EVM data is typically reported relative to  contractual targets, in this case the program\u2019s internal goals, we would  expect that these quarterly reports would also include additional elements  addressing progress relative to the program\u2019s external committed cost  and schedule baselines.", "We are sending this report to NASA\u2019s Administrator and to appropriate  congressional committees.

We examined documents supporting the cost and schedule  estimates, such as detailed spreadsheets that contain cost, schedule, and  risk information and the timing and availability of funding and reserves.  We also met with independent reviewers of the SLS Joint Cost and  Schedule Confidence Level (JCL), reviewed their report on the program,  and determined the extent to which the SLS program addressed any  concerns the reviewers raised concerning the JCL estimate. In addition,  we met with program and agency officials to discuss the baseline cost  and schedule estimates, potential program schedule changes, and the  program\u2019s cost and schedule reserve postures, among other issues. We  did not assess the credible or controlled criteria of the schedule estimate  as the estimate was completed to support a JCL. The controlled criterion  deals, in part, with updating the schedule periodically. A JCL, however, is  not designed to be used as an updating tool. The credible criterion  relates, in part, to a risk assessment of the schedule. The summary  schedule estimate, however, was developed specifically for use in  developing the SLS program\u2019s JCL, which requires its own risk  assessment to calculate probability of meeting cost and schedule  baselines, and would make the schedule estimate risk assessment  unnecessary in this instance.", "To assess the availability of program cost and schedule reserves for  resolving development challenges, we analyzed budget requests,  appropriations, and program budget projections.
