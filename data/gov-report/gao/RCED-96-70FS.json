Among these standards are numeric limits on the concentrations of toxic chemicals in the environment, which were intended to ensure an adequate level of protection for public health. (See sec. 1 for more background information on standards.) Those responsible for cleaning up Superfund sites, however, have raised concerns that complying with these standards can result in more extensive and costlier cleanups than are necessary to safeguard public health. One criticism is that states, when setting standards, may choose stringent limits that are not based on a consideration of the human health risks posed by contaminants. Another concern is that using standards to determine the extent of cleanup does not allow a consideration of specific sites\u2019 conditions, such as the local climate, that may increase or decrease the health risks posed.", "As background for your deliberations on the use of standards as requirements for cleanups, you asked us to provide information on the bases for states\u2019 standards. Specifically, you asked us to determine whether states, (1) when setting numeric standards, based them on estimates of the human health risks posed by exposure to contaminants and, (2) when using such standards, provided the flexibility to adjust the level of cleanup prescribed by the standards to take into account the conditions and risks found at individual hazardous waste sites. You also expressed interest in the degree of correspondence between the states\u2019 standards and the federal standards that may be applied to the cleanup of groundwater determined to be a potential source of drinking water. We summarized preliminary information on these matters in a June 1995 testimony and are now presenting our final results.", "In conducting our work, we surveyed the 33 states with the greatest number of Superfund sites, which together covered 91 percent of the sites on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) nationwide list of the hazardous waste sites posing the greatest risks to human health and the environment. We asked these states about their standards for soil and groundwater because these are the two media most frequently cleaned up at Superfund sites. We also limited our focus to chemical-specific standards that set numeric limits on concentrations of chemicals in order to protect public health. Twenty-one of the surveyed states had established such standards for soil, groundwater, or both. In all, 13 states had set soil standards, while 20 had set groundwater standards; about half of the 21 states had set both types of standards. (See app. I for more information on our objectives, scope, and methodology and app. II for a listing of the surveyed states that had set standards.)", "In summary, we found the following:", "When developing their standards, 20 of the 21 states told us that they had based them, at least in part, on estimates of the human health risks posed by exposure to chemical waste. For example, they considered the increased probability that a person would develop cancer or another illness from such exposure. These states either adopted existing federal standards that were based on such risk estimates or developed their own standards, taking risk into account. Most of the 20 states said that in addition to health risks, they considered other factors in setting their standards, such as the cost and technical feasibility of achieving the necessary cleanup. When setting their standards for groundwater used as drinking water, the states typically based them on the federal drinking water standards. However, we found that some states had set some of their standards at levels that differed from the levels in the federal standards. These differing standards tended to be more stringent than the federal standards. (See sec. 2 for a more detailed discussion of the bases for the states\u2019 soil and groundwater standards.)", "When applying their standards to determine the extent of the cleanup needed at a Superfund site, the states in our survey said that they provided more flexibility to adjust the cleanup level derived from their soil standards than from their groundwater standards, to reflect the specific conditions and health risks at that site. More than half of the states with soil standards regularly allowed the cleanup levels based on these standards to be adjusted for site-specific conditions, such as the amount of exposure to the contaminants that people are likely to have. In contrast, less than a fourth of the states with standards for groundwater that is or could be used as drinking water said that they allowed the cleanup levels based on these standards to be adjusted. This relative inflexibility reflected the states\u2019 concerns that groundwater be conserved as a potential source of drinking water. Some of the states that did not allow such adjustments did provide a degree of flexibility by setting different standards for different projected uses of land or groundwater. (See sec. 3 for a more detailed discussion of the extent to which the states said that they were flexible in applying soil and groundwater standards.)", "We based our analysis on the results of telephone interviews we conducted with the 33 states surveyed and a review of background documents on standards and risk assessment. To verify our analysis, we gave each state a written summary to review and made any necessary changes. We also provided copies of a draft of this report to EPA officials, including the Director of the Office of Emergency and Remedial Response and officials responsible for working with state Superfund programs, for their review and comment. EPA generally agreed with the report and provided several technical changes and clarifications on the Superfund law\u2019s requirements for cleanups, which we incorporated. We conducted our work from March 1995 through March 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 10 days after the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Administrator of EPA, and other interested parties.

Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which created the Superfund program in 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assesses uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and places those posing the greatest risks to human health and the environment on the National Priorities List (NPL) for cleanup. As of September 1995, this list included 1,232 sites.", "Cleanup standards and the degree of cleanup needed for Superfund sites are discussed in section 121(d) of the CERCLA statute, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). This section requires that Superfund sites be cleaned up to the extent necessary to protect both human health and the environment. In addition, cleanups must comply with requirements under federal environmental laws that are legally \u201capplicable\u201d or \u201crelevant and appropriate\u201d (ARAR) as well as with such state environmental requirements that are more stringent than the federal standards. Furthermore, Superfund cleanups must at least attain levels established under the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, where such standards are relevant and appropriate as determined by the potential use of the water and other considerations.", "The federal standards most frequently considered relevant and appropriate for groundwater cleanups at Superfund sites are set under the Safe Drinking Water Act. This act establishes standards, called maximum contaminant levels (MCL), for certain contaminants in water delivered by public drinking water systems. As of March 1996, the MCLs included numeric limits on about 70 contaminants. The MCLs take into account estimates of the human health risks posed by contaminants. They also consider whether it is technically and economically feasible to reduce the contamination to a level that no longer poses a health risk. Although MCLs are legally applicable to drinking water systems, section 121(d) of CERCLA generally requires that they be considered relevant and appropriate standards for cleaning up contaminated groundwater that is a potential source of drinking water. For example, the MCL for benzene is 5 micrograms per liter. This concentration would generally be the cleanup level for benzene in groundwater that is a potential source of drinking water unless the state has promulgated a more stringent standard or other requirement that is relevant and appropriate.", "There are few federal standards for contaminants in soil that are considered potentially applicable or relevant and appropriate except those for certain highly toxic contaminants, most notably polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and lead. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, EPA sets requirements for cleaning up PCB contamination. In addition, EPA has issued guidance for cleaning up lead in soil.", "Early in its investigation of a site, EPA determines, on the basis of the contamination present and the conditions at the site, which chemical-specific and other standards may be considered applicable or relevant and appropriate. As EPA proceeds with the selection of a cleanup method, it adjusts the list of standards to be considered on the basis of information gained during its investigation. Among the potential standards considered are any state environmental standards that are more stringent than the federal standards for the same contaminants.", "In addition to numeric standards for specific contaminants, some states have set more generalized standards or policies that may have to be considered when cleaning up Superfund sites. For example, some states have established \u201cantidegradation\u201d policies for groundwater that could require more stringent cleanups than cleanups based on health risks. These policies are intended, among other things, to protect the state\u2019s groundwater as a potential source of drinking water.", "If federal or state standards do not exist for a given contaminant, the party responsible for cleaning up a Superfund site may use a site-specific risk assessment to help establish a cleanup level for that contaminant. A risk assessment evaluates the extent to which people may be exposed to the contaminant, given its concentration and the physical characteristics of the site. For example, the type of soil and the depth of the groundwater may affect whether and how quickly waste will migrate and reach a population. A risk assessment uses exposure and toxicity data to estimate the increased probability, or risk, that people could develop cancer or other health problems through exposure to this contamination. A risk estimate can be used along with the proposed waste management strategy to help determine the extent of the cleanup necessary at a site.", "EPA has published guidance for conducting risk assessments, a set of documents referred to collectively as the Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund. These documents outline the well-established risk assessment principles and procedures that can be used to gather and assess information on human health risks. The documents also include information on mathematical models that can be used to estimate health risks at a site, given the contaminants present and the means of exposure to them. In addition to this guidance, EPA maintains an Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an on-line database on the toxicity of numerous chemicals, and publishes the Health Effects Assessment Summary Tables (HEAST), another source of information on contaminants\u2019 toxicity. EPA uses this guidance in conducting baseline risk assessments at Superfund sites, which it uses in deciding whether the human health and environmental risks posed by the contaminants are serious enough to warrant cleaning up the sites. Some states also use EPA\u2019s risk assessment guidance in setting their standards for specific chemicals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bases States Used in Developing Standards", "paragraphs": ["States that have set environmental standards have made decisions about what levels, or concentrations, of chemical contaminants can remain at hazardous waste sites after cleanups. We analyzed the processes that the states in our survey said they went through, as well as the factors that they said they took into consideration, in developing their soil and groundwater standards. In this section, we first summarize (1) the extent to which the states based their soil standards on estimates of the human health risks posed by contaminants at the sites and (2) the methods that the states used to estimate these risks. We then report on the factors other than health risks that the states said they considered when developing their soil standards. Since the bases for the states\u2019 standards for groundwater differed somewhat from those for soil, we summarized the information on groundwater standards separately.

These states said that they had used EPA\u2019s guidance, either alone or in combination with their own methodologies and policies, to estimate health risks. (See table 2.2.) For example, Pennsylvania said that it had used EPA\u2019s guidance to estimate the toxicity of contaminants and its own model to estimate how much contamination from the soil might travel into groundwater. These estimates are two of the major components in the health risk calculation. uses at Superfund sites, which extends from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1 million. As shown in table 2.2, eight states chose the more stringent risk level of 1 in 1 million for individual carcinogens in soil, while five states chose the somewhat less stringent risk level of 1 in 100,000.

In some locations, certain contaminants may exist naturally in the soil in concentrations differing from those that would be allowed under standards based on risks to human health. For such contaminants, the states typically set their standards at the naturally occurring levels rather than at the levels based solely on risk. In some cases, this practice would result in less stringent cleanups than would be necessary to meet the risk-based standards.

All of the preventive action limits are more stringent than the corresponding federal MCLs. They limit the concentrations of chemicals that can cause cancer to one-tenth the concentrations allowed under the MCLs, and they limit the concentrations of chemicals that can cause other health effects to one-fifth the concentrations allowed under the MCLs. However, the state allows exemptions for contaminants that occur naturally at levels exceeding the preventive action limits.", "Nearly all of the states had only a few, if any, standards for contaminants that were less stringent than the corresponding federal MCLs.
