Although the Navy resolved many of the defects by the end of the post-delivery period, as the table below shows, quality problems persisted and work was incomplete when the selected ships were turned over to the operational fleet.", "Fleet officials reported varying levels of concern with the overall quality and completeness of the ships, such as with unreliable equipment or a need for more intense maintenance than expected. For CVN 78 and DDG 1000, the Navy plans to complete significantly more work and testing during the post-delivery period than the other six ships GAO reviewed. As such, these ships are at a greater risk of being provided to the fleet at the end of their post-delivery periods with incomplete construction work and unknowns about quality.", "The Navy's ship delivery policy does not facilitate a process that provides complete and quality ships to the fleet and practices do not comport with policy. The policy emphasizes that ships should be defect-free and mission-capable, but lacks clarity regarding what defects should be corrected and by when. Without a clear policy, Navy program offices define their own standards of quality and completeness, which are not always consistent. Further, because the Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) does not inspect ships at the end of the post-delivery period, it is not in a position to verify each ship's readiness for the fleet, as required by Navy policy. The Navy has not assessed the costs and benefits of ensuring INSURV does this. Addressing these policy concerns would improve the likelihood of identifying and correcting deficiencies before fleet introduction and increase consistency in how the Navy defines quality.", "The Navy does not use consistent definitions for key milestones in its reports to Congress\u2014such as delivery or Initial Operational Capability (IOC)\u2014and, therefore, these milestones are not as informative as they could be regarding ship quality and completeness. For example, the Navy has routinely declared IOC on new ship classes without having demonstrated that ships are able to perform mission operations\u2014contrary to Department of Defense (DOD) guidance, which, for nearly all acquisition models, generally states that IOC should be declared only after successful operational testing that demonstrates performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Navy should revise its ship delivery policy to identify what kinds of defects should be corrected and by when and study how to best ensure that INSURV verifies ships.

In May 2009, we compared Navy  shipbuilding with commercial shipbuilding and generally found that the  Navy accepts significantly more risk when it builds ships compared to  commercial shipbuilders and buyers. In November 2013, we found  significant quality problems with Navy ships at delivery\u2014noting that the  Navy regularly accepts ships with numerous deficiencies. In September  2014, we found that Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) 1 and 2, while legally  accepted by the government, had quality problems that persisted after  delivery. And in November 2014, we found that shifting construction work  on the CVN 78 aircraft carrier to the post-delivery period could obscure  the total cost of the ship and result in the need for additional funding to  complete the ship during post-delivery.

In addition, you asked us to review the  period after ship delivery, including the extent to which and why the Navy  defers construction work to the post-delivery period, specifically as it  relates to aircraft carrier and lead ship construction. For this review, we  assessed: (1) the extent to which the Navy provides complete, quality  ships to the fleet that are free of government and contractor deficiencies;  (2) the extent to which the Navy\u2019s policy governing ship delivery facilitates  efforts to deliver complete and quality ships; and (3) the extent to which  reports to Congress on the progress of shipbuilding programs consistently  define key milestones such as ship delivery and initial operational  capability.", "To gain an understanding of the post-delivery period for Navy ships, we  selected eight ships for review.

Among the six selected ships we reviewed, a  majority of the required shipboard system certifications were incomplete  at delivery, and a large number of these were completed during the post- delivery period. However, in some cases, certifications were not  completed before these ships were provided to the fleet, which could  have restricted the conduct of certain mission-critical functions. In some  cases in which the ship was provided to the fleet with incomplete  certifications, the program office continued to oversee the completion of  this work shortly after OWLD; in other cases, however, the fleet was  responsible for the certifications. For instance, three ships\u2014LCS 3, LCS  4, and LHA 6\u2014were provided to the fleet without full aviation  certifications, restricting these ships\u2019 aviation operations until the  certification requirements were met. In the case of LHA 6, the ship was  not authorized to fully operate the Joint Strike Fighter when the ship was  provided to the fleet, even though the Navy spent $60 million during the  post-delivery period modifying it for Joint Strike Fighter operations. One of  the items preventing a full aviation certification on LHA 6 was incomplete  work on a lithium-ion battery shop, which charges and stores batteries  used by the Joint Strike Fighter for a variety of purposes, including  starting the aircraft\u2019s integrated power system. According to a senior fleet  official, work on the lithium-ion battery shop was not scheduled for  completion until December 2016, 9 months after the ship was provided to  the fleet.

While the  fleet submits casualty reports starting at delivery, the program office is  responsible for correcting construction-related problems prior to providing  a ship to the fleet. Fleet officials stated that casualty reports submitted  within the first 3 months of fleet operations are generally indicative of the  ship\u2019s quality, since the crew will begin more fully operating the ship\u2019s  systems and equipment and submitting casualty reports when they  identify problems. However, officials from several program offices  disagreed with this assessment and stated that some deficiencies after  the ship is provided to the fleet are due to operator error and are not  related to construction quality.

For  example, on LHA 6, the program office did not repair an electronic  warfare system before the end of the post-delivery period, resulting in a  casualty report when the ship was provided to the fleet. In addition, four  ships had equipment that failed during the post-delivery period and failed  again within 3 months\u2014requiring the fleet to pay for at least a portion of  the repair. Furthermore, DOT&E reports confirm that these same pieces  of equipment were found to be unreliable during testing, except for the  equipment on LHA 6 because this ship has yet to be tested.

The program offices generally define quality as the degree to  which the ship is constructed according to its contract specifications\u2014that  is, the design of the ship. In contrast, according to fleet managers and  maintenance officials, the fleet\u2019s assessment of quality is based on a  ship\u2019s operational capability and maintenance considerations. For  example, program officials stated that the contractor-furnished  communications system on LCS 3 and LCS 4, discussed in table 6,  meets quality expectations because it was installed in accordance with  the contractor\u2019s specifications. However, fleet officials have found this  system to be of poor quality because it is unreliable and difficult to  maintain. According to fleet officials, not addressing these types of quality  issues by the end of the post-delivery period results in shifting costs to the  fleet\u2019s operations and maintenance funding and contributes to a  maintenance backlog from the first day the fleet is responsible for the  ship.

This will, in turn, lead to the  Navy conducting more work during the post-delivery period than the other  ships we reviewed, including deferring a substantial amount of  construction work to the post-delivery period to save money, reach  delivery more quickly, or incorporate later versions of technology, among  other reasons.", "For CVN 78, cost growth and delays led the Navy to accept delivery of  the aircraft carrier with a substantial amount of incomplete work. In the  case of DDG 1000, the Navy has planned a two-phase construction  approach in which the hull, mechanical, and electrical systems were  delivered first, prior to the combat systems. The Navy is now planning a  delivery approach for CVN 79, the second ship in the Ford class, which  is similar to that of DDG 1000. For CVN 78 and DDG 1000, the Navy  plans to complete significantly more work and testing during the post- delivery period than the other six ships we reviewed. As such, CVN 78  and DDG 1000 are at greater risk of being provided to the fleet at the  end of their post-delivery periods with incomplete construction work and  unknown quality.", "The Navy took delivery of CVN 78 with a significant amount of work  scheduled for completion during the post-delivery period, including  completing construction and executing a number of tests and trials. Some  of this work, particularly several tests and trials, is not scheduled until  after the ship will have been provided to the fleet (following OWLD). For  example, at delivery, the ship will have yet to complete its navigation  certification and cybersecurity inspection; in addition, as planned, the  carrier will not yet have all of the certifications necessary to conduct  aviation operations, among other things. The magnitude of construction  work that has been deferred to the post-delivery period has also  contributed to the Navy\u2019s decision to schedule combat and warfare  systems certification after the ship is provided to the fleet. For this reason,  CVN 78 will not be ready for deployment until fiscal year 2021 at the  earliest, even though the Navy accepted delivery of the ship in May 2017  and plans to provide it to the fleet in fiscal year 2019, as shown in figure  3.", "The completion of the aircraft carrier\u2019s outstanding tests and trials,  deferred construction, and other work is planned to cost nearly $780  million and take more than 4 years to complete. For example, the Navy  plans to spend over $400 million to conduct several years of testing,  including full ship shock trials, total ship survivability trial, and operational  testing, with associated maintenance to correct deficiencies from these  tests and trials. As we have previously found, construction challenges and  continuing work on maturing technologies\u2014combined with a $12.9 billion  construction cost cap, which the program office is actively managing to\u2014 have resulted in the Navy\u2019s decision to accept delivery of CVN 78 with  incomplete work.", "The timely and successful execution of tests and trials during the post- delivery period remains dependent on the maturity of key technologies,  including the advanced arresting gear (used to stop aircraft on the flight  deck), dual band radar (used to track aircraft among other tasks), and  advanced weapons elevators (used to move ordnance). For instance,  program officials reported that only 2 of the 11 advanced weapons  elevators will be installed prior to delivery; the installation, testing, and  certification of the other 9 elevators have been deferred to the post- delivery period. Additionally, while installation of the advanced arresting  gear and dual band radar is complete on CVN 78, the Navy plans to  continue testing these systems during the post-delivery period to verify  they will perform as intended. It is likely that significant work will be  required on all three of these systems during CVN 78\u2019s post-delivery  period, particularly because DOD\u2019s Director of Operational Test and  Evaluation found in June 2016 that each system continues to have poor  or unknown reliability. According to DOT&E\u2019s report, these reliability  issues are the most significant risk facing the program.", "Beyond the completion of these tests and trials, in November 2014, we  found that CVN 78 will have significant incomplete construction work at  delivery, which is being deferred to the post-delivery period. This  deferred work included building 367 compartments that were de-scoped  from the shipbuilding contract, installing 12 government furnished  systems not completed during construction, installing 10 modernized  systems, and completing at least 147 other work deferral requests. The  CVN 78 program office estimates that this deferred work will cost at least  $65 million. Table 7 provides examples of construction work on CVN 78  that has been deferred to the post-delivery period.", "Due to the magnitude of deferred work planned for the CVN 78 post- delivery period, PEO Aircraft Carriers has determined that a final contract  trial, which typically occurs before the post-shakedown availability per the  Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy, would be of limited utility for CVN 78. Instead,  the Navy\u2019s senior aircraft carrier acquisition official has requested the  CNO waive the requirement for a final contract trial and grant permission  for the program to conduct a special trial after the post-shakedown  availability, when the deferred work will be complete and the crew will  have completed training on the aircraft carrier\u2019s new systems. When  requesting this permission, the official provided the CNO with advance  notice that the program would require a waiver at delivery for the work  that will be deferred to the post-delivery period.", "By design, the Navy planned to deliver DDG 1000 in two phases\u2014the  first phase included only the hull, mechanical, and electrical systems of  the ship, followed by a second phase to activate the combat systems. In  May 2016, the Navy accepted delivery of the hull, mechanical, and  electrical portion of the ship and is now beginning post-delivery efforts,  including combat systems activation and the installation of several  shipboard systems, such as the navigation system, the close-in gun  system, the communications system, and advanced flight deck lighting.  Following combat systems delivery planned for fiscal year 2018, DDG  1000 will begin 2 years of tests and trials, during which time the ship will  complete various certifications and an operational evaluation.", "As a result of delays during construction of the hull and the two-phased  approach, 24 required shipboard system certifications were incomplete at  delivery, including the certifications for aviation and navigation. For  example, testing of the advanced stabilized glide slope indicator, which is  a helicopter landing system that previously encountered challenges and  delays on LCS 3 and 4, was deferred to the post-delivery period. Given  the scope of deferred work and testing, DDG 1000 will not be provided to  the fleet until fiscal year 2020 (potentially a delay of more than a year  from the Navy\u2019s estimates in 2016), making this the longest post-delivery  period of the eight ships we reviewed.

In particular, several of these officials stated that the  Navy may decide to leave some deficiencies uncorrected if the repair  would be cost-prohibitive or if the deficiency has minimal impact on the  capability of the ship. The current ship delivery policy does not account  for these situations. In practice, ship program offices balance risk and  cost when choosing what deficiencies to correct during the post-delivery  period.

Operational suitability assesses the reliability,  maintainability, and availability of a ship, which inform the Navy\u2019s  assessment of the probability that the ship will perform without failure for  a certain period of time and in certain conditions. While the Navy  conducts testing to determine the operational suitability of new ship  classes, program offices do not factor these tests into their assessment of  full mission capability and therefore do not consider the results of these  tests prior to providing new ships to the fleet. For example, the Navy  decided to provide LHA 6 to the fleet before it had completed these tests.  In addition, CVN 78, also a lead ship, is planned to be provided to the  fleet prior to undergoing an operational suitability assessment during  testing. The policy does not address the role of operational suitability in a  ship\u2019s ability to be mission-capable or whether a ship should be provided  to the fleet that has yet to be operationally tested.", "Furthermore, the ship delivery policy makes no distinction between early- in-class ships and later-in-class ships, which Navy program and fleet  officials identify as a key predictor of completeness and quality, with  earlier ships being more likely to experience problems. For example,  three of the six ships we reviewed (LCS 3, LCS 4, and LHA 6), all earlier  in class, were provided to the fleet either without being tested or after  being found unsuitable for fleet operations due to unresolved concerns  regarding the equipment reliability, maintainability, crew training, or other  aspects crucial to successfully demonstrating adequate mission  performance.", "Table 9 illustrates the status of operational suitability of the classes of  ships at the time the six ships we reviewed were provided to the fleet.", "One reason later-in-class ships are generally better quality than earlier-in- class ships is that the Navy makes corrections based on tests and  feedback from operational missions that may be factored into the design  and construction of future ships.

We have identified this issue in our previous work and made  recommendations, which have not been addressed to date. Specifically,  in November 2013, we found that CNO officials stated that the intention of  the ship delivery policy was for ships to be defect-free and fully mission- capable when delivered from the shipbuilder; that is, at the beginning of  the post-delivery period. At the same time, however, we also found that  program officials believed a ship did not need to be free from deficiencies  and fully mission-capable until it was provided to the fleet, that is, at the  end of the post-delivery period. We recommended in our November 2013  report that the Navy clarify the policy with regard to the point at which  deficiencies are to be fully corrected. DOD partially concurred with this  recommendation and stated that the Navy\u2019s goal is to reduce the number  of deficiencies at delivery to zero \u201cwhen practical,\u201d although the ship  delivery policy itself includes no such caveat. The Navy revised its ship  delivery policy in October 2014 to clarify roles and responsibilities, among  other things, but the timing of defect correction and mission capability was  neither clarified nor addressed. Office of the CNO officials stated that they  were not aware of our recommendation when revising the policy.", "Similarly, in speaking with a range of officials across the Navy for this  review, we continued to find conflicting views on when ships are to be  deficiency-free and mission-capable. CNO officials responsible for the  policy told us that ships should be free of all deficiencies by the time they  are provided to the fleet, meaning at the end of the post-delivery period at  OWLD, which is a change from their previous interpretation of the ship  delivery policy that they authored. However, the policy does not include  this clarification on the timing. In contrast, INSURV officials told us they  believe the policy states that the shipbuilder should deliver defect-free  ships at the beginning of the post-delivery period, with a few exceptions  for items that can only be accomplished during the post-delivery period.  However, as noted above, the Navy often delivers ships with open starred  deficiencies, INSURV\u2019s most severe category of ship deficiency. For the  eight ships we reviewed, INSURV identified a total of 117 starred cards  before delivery during acceptance trials. Twelve starred cards were  corrected prior to delivery while the remaining 105 were waived by the  CNO. Despite these deficiencies, INSURV recommended that the CNO  accept the ships. In fact, INSURV officials stated that they have only  recommended against delivery one time in 18 years. Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government require objectives to be clear  and measureable. Without clarifying when ships should achieve a certain  level of completeness and quality, the Navy does not have a clear  standard or objective against which it can measure the condition of its  ships and ensure quality."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "INSURV Does Not Verify Ship Quality When Ships Are Provided to Fleet, as Required by Policy", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy identifies INSURV as the independent  entity charged with verifying the quality of ships at delivery and  recommending introduction to the fleet. But we found a disconnect  between the Navy\u2019s policy and INSURV\u2019s practice. While INSURV makes  a recommendation for ship delivery, officials stated that they do not make  a recommendation for provision to the fleet because ship trials are not  well-timed to independently verify the completeness and quality of ships  at the point when they are provided to the fleet. As figure 5 illustrates,  INSURV currently conducts acceptance trials and final contract trials prior  to delivery and the post-shakedown availability, respectively, but does not  conduct a trial between the post-shakedown availability and the end of  the post-delivery period (at OWLD)\u2014the point at which ships are provided  to the fleet.", "Significant work is conducted during the post-shakedown availability. For  the six ships we reviewed that have completed the post-delivery period,  post-shakedown availability costs ranged from approximately $30 million  to $83 million per ship and ranged in duration from 3 months to 16  months. According to INSURV officials, the post-shakedown availability  used to be a minor availability but, increasingly, ships are undergoing  higher intensity and more complex activities during this period, including  correcting starred INSURV deficiencies, finishing construction, installing  new systems, and modernizing equipment. For instance, of the four ships  we reviewed that had starred deficiencies waived at delivery, all four had  starred cards that remained open during INSURV\u2019s final contract trials  because the program office planned to fix these deficiencies during the  post-shakedown availability. The correction of these starred deficiencies  was therefore not inspected by INSURV. According to INSURV officials,  because a significant amount of work is conducted during the post- shakedown availability, the ship\u2019s condition at final contract trials is not  indicative of the ship\u2019s condition when it is provided to the fleet following  this availability. Therefore, INSURV cannot make a recommendation for  fleet introduction based on the final contract trial\u2014INSURV\u2019s last  inspection before ships are provided to the fleet.", "As a result, the Navy is providing ships to the fleet with systems and  equipment that were repaired or changed during the post-shakedown  availability and have not been verified by INSURV, creating a greater  potential for breakdowns or failures that would be the responsibility of the  fleet to repair. For example, INSURV identified leaking couplings during  LPD 25\u2019s acceptance trial in October 2013. The LPD 17 program repaired  the couplings during the ship\u2019s post-shakedown availability in June  2015\u2014after INSURV had conducted the final contract trial in November  2014. The ship was then provided to the fleet in July 2015. Shortly after  the ship was provided to the fleet, according to fleet engineers and  operators, the new couplings\u2014designed to last the life of the ship\u2014failed  again, requiring the fleet to pay approximately $600,000 every 3 months  to replace them each time they failed. The root cause remains under  investigation, according to fleet engineers, although program officials  stated that the leaks were due to a manufacturing defect that has now  been corrected. In another example, INSURV identified several issues  with LCS 3\u2019s anchor that precluded the crew from retrieving it. The LCS  program office repaired the anchor during the post-shakedown  availability, following final contract trials. Following fleet introduction, the  anchor failed again, and the fleet was required to fix it.", "Under the current practices, INSURV also does not have an opportunity  to inspect ship changes that are implemented during post-shakedown  availability. LHA 6, for example, was modified so it can operate with the  Joint Strike Fighter\u2014these changes totaled approximately $60 million\u2014 but INSURV did not inspect the changes. Resolving complications from  this work, such as issues with the lithium-ion batteries we noted above,  will be the fleet\u2019s responsibility. Lastly, several programs install new  equipment during the post-shakedown availability, such as aviation and  information technology systems. In the absence of an INSURV fleet  introduction recommendation, the Navy\u2019s current practice does not align  with its ship delivery policy, and uninspected equipment is provided to the  fleet.", "There are some rare cases in which INSURV and the program office have  agreed to inspect specific issues after the post-shakedown availability  and before the ship is provided to the fleet. For instance, INSURV  conducted a limited post-repair trial on LCS 3 that looked at a few specific  issues, such as the anchor, and it plans to conduct a special trial on CVN  78 following the aircraft carrier\u2019s post-shakedown availability.", "Navy program office and INSURV officials cited two factors that influence  the timing of final contract trials. First, the final contract trial occurs just  prior to the end of the guaranty period, which enables INSURV to identify  deficiencies the contractor may be responsible for correcting prior to the  expiration of the guaranty period. Second, INSURV and program  officials stated that final contract trials inform the program office\u2019s  prioritization of deficiency correction during the post-shakedown  availability. Program officials stated that this ensures that construction  funding (SCN) is obligated for the highest-priority post-delivery work  before OWLD\u2014the final point at which the Navy can obligate shipbuilding  and conversion funds before providing the ship to the fleet. While the  timing of final contract trials facilitates the prioritization and funding of  post-delivery work, it is not optimally aligned to verify that the work  completed during post-shakedown availability meets quality standards  before a ship is provided to the fleet.", "INSURV officials stated that there could be benefits to conducting an  additional trial before providing a ship to the fleet. For example, they  could re-inspect deficiencies, like the ones noted above, that the program  office corrects during the post-shakedown availability. These inspections  could, in turn, reduce the likelihood that systems and equipment break  down shortly after ships are provided to the fleet. However, INSURV and  Navy program officials also pointed out that conducting another trial after  the post-shakedown availability would require additional funding. The  Navy has not evaluated the cost or quality risks associated with providing  the fleet with unverified repairs and equipment\u2014such as the fleet\u2019s costs  to repair construction defects\u2014against the costs of conducting an  additional INSURV trial after the post-shakedown availability.

In many cases, several  years will pass between delivery and provision to the fleet, and even at  that point, more time may be required before a ship is ready to deploy.

In the December 2015 Selected Acquisition  Report, the Navy indicated lead ship delivery would be April 2016, and  the ship was subsequently delivered in May 2016.

The Navy reported the carrier\u2019s delivery date as June 2022 in its schedule  of events, but stated in the executive summary that the carrier will not be  deployable until 2027, after it goes through a second phase of  construction.

According to this legislation, the  delivery of a ship shall occur when (1) the Secretary of the Navy  determines the ship is assembled and complete and (2) custody of the  ship and all of its systems are transferred to the Navy. The legislation  further requires the Navy to review the planned delivery dates for ships  under construction and adjust them, if the planned dates did not reflect a  level of construction completeness in line with the new criteria.

Congress directed the  Navy to certify adjusted delivery dates for all ships under construction to  the congressional defense committees by January 1, 2017, and to include  these revised dates in the next Selected Acquisition Reports and budget  documents sent to Congress. In February 2017, the Navy adjusted the  delivery dates for these four ships to coincide with the completion of  significant construction events following preliminary acceptance, such as  the activation of DDG 1000\u2019s combat systems. As noted above,  however, Navy ships are not fully complete until at least OWLD\u2014when a  ship is provided to the fleet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Reports Do Not Use Consistent Criteria to Assess Ship Initial Operational Capability", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s Selected Acquisition Reports to Congress also state when  ship classes achieve IOC; however, the reports generally do not state the  criteria the Navy used to make these capability determinations, and the  criteria used are not consistent with DOD guidance. In January 2015,  DOD updated its acquisition guidance to include a number of program  models that DOD agencies and military services can use to structure  programs for the purpose of attaining knowledge prior to committing to  more purchases. In nearly all acquisition program models, DOD guidance  states that IOC occurs toward the end of operational testing. Even the  most aggressive model of delivering programs, the accelerated  acquisition program\u2014which by design accepts significant risk to add  capability in a compressed time frame (such as during a time of war)\u2014 defines IOC as occurring simultaneously with operational testing, not  before testing. DOD acquisition guidance and GAO best practices state  that testing provides critical information to make informed production and  other acquisition decisions.", "The Navy\u2019s criteria for declaring IOC differs across ship classes, and  none of them require achieving favorable results from operational testing.  Of the eight ships we reviewed, program offices had used two sets of  criteria for IOC, both of which were schedule-driven rather than capability- driven milestones; that is, they did not take into account the successful  completion of operational testing. Table 10 shows the ship classes for the  eight ships we reviewed, how the programs defined IOC, and the status  of operational testing at the time the Navy declared IOC for the class.", "For several of the ships we reviewed, the Navy defined and declared IOC  for the ship class without ever testing the operational capabilities of, or  deploying, the lead ship. As a result, achieving IOC did not provide an  indication that the ships could conduct operations as intended, which can  provide a false sense of the ships\u2019 capabilities. For instance, after the  Navy declared IOC for the LPD 17 class, the lead ship suffered a severe  engineering casualty during its first deployment that limited its availability  for several years. After this incident, the Navy\u2019s Commander of  Operational Test and Evaluation reported that the LPD 17 class of ships  was not operationally suitable and was operationally effective with the  exception of the combat system. After nearly 3 years of follow-on tests  and a considerable number of design changes to correct problems, the  Navy\u2019s testers determined in December 2012 that the LPD 17 class was  operationally suitable and operationally effective\u20144 years after the Navy  originally declared IOC for the class, with 10 ships completed or under  construction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Shipbuilding is a complex endeavor, and a certain amount of deficiencies  can be expected. However, all of the Navy ships we reviewed were, or  likely will be, provided to the fleet with outstanding deficiencies,  incomplete certifications, or open casualty reports, among other quality  issues\u2014resulting in additional costs that the fleet will have to bear.  Moreover, the Navy has made liberal use of the various exceptions to its  process for some of its most expensive and technologically sophisticated  ships\u2014namely, the CVN 78 and DDG 1000 classes\u2014to allow these ships  to be delivered in a substantially incomplete state, placing the fleet at  even greater risk of absorbing excessive costs and having to face  unknowns about ship quality. While Navy officials offered some reasons  that ships are accepted in incomplete states, the ship delivery policy  makes no reference to these reasons. The policy states that ships should  be defect-free and mission-capable, but these objectives are not defined.  Further, INSURV\u2019s only post-delivery trial is not well-timed to  independently verify the completeness and quality of ships before they  are provided to the fleet. As a result, key quality control measures in the  Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy are not implemented, resulting in uninspected  systems and equipment being provided to the fleet, with no verification of  completeness and quality at this key milestone.", "The Navy\u2019s Selected Acquisition Reports to Congress do not clearly  communicate its ships\u2019 progress and completion, which can inhibit  oversight, particularly for measuring results. Simply reporting delivery  dates does not signify a ship\u2019s completeness or readiness to deploy, as  there is considerable variation in the level of completeness of ships at  delivery, and it will still be several additional years before ships are ready  to deploy. Recent legislation has established criteria for ship delivery  dates that, depending on its implementation, may help improve the  consistency and clarity of the Navy\u2019s reporting to Congress on this  milestone. Similarly, IOC is reported but does not signify that ships have  successfully demonstrated capability. Without consistent and meaningful  capability and schedule milestones, decision makers may not be able to  understand the progress toward ship completion or may be surprised to  learn of complications after the ship appeared to be delivered or  completed, which may require additional funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should direct the Secretary of the Navy to take  the following four actions:  1.  Revise the Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy to clarify what types of  deficiencies need to be corrected and what mission capability  (including the levels of quality and capability) must be achieved at (1)  delivery and (2) when the ship is provided to the fleet (at OWLD). In  doing so, the Navy should clearly define what constitutes a complete  ship and when that should be achieved.  2.  Reconcile policy with practice to support INSURV\u2019s role in making a  recommendation for fleet introduction. Accomplishing this may require  a study of the current timing of ship trials, and the costs and benefits  associated with adding an INSURV assessment prior to providing  ships to the fleet.  3.  Reflect additional ship milestones in Selected Acquisition Reports to  Congress, including OWLD and readiness to deploy.  4.

In its  written comments, which are reprinted in appendix III of this report, DOD  did not concur with two recommendations, partially concurred with a third  recommendation, and fully concurred with a fourth recommendation. DOD  provided technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "With regard to our first recommendation, DOD disagreed with our focus  on OPNAVINST 4700.8K as the primary criteria for assessing Navy ship  quality and completeness when ships are provided to the fleet, stating  that multiple instructions govern this process. This response was  puzzling, as we reviewed relevant Navy policies and confirmed with  acquisition officials within the Department of the Navy that OPNAVINST  4700.8K is the primary policy governing the quality standards for Navy  ships at delivery. The statute and two policies that other policies DOD  references in its response are not focused on construction and the post- delivery period and do not provide guidance on the level of quality and  completeness expected when ships are provided to the fleet. Therefore,  we focused on OPNAVINST 4700.8K because it is the only Navy  instruction that attempts to set a quality standard for Navy ships rather  than provide guidance on managing the inspection process. As such we  maintain that OPNAVINST 4700.8K should be clarified regarding the level  of quality and completeness required of Navy ships at key points in the  shipbuilding process. By not acknowledging the importance of  OPNAVINST 4700.8K and establishing a clear and comprehensive  quality standard, the Department of the Navy is missing an opportunity to  improve the quality of its ships and risks continuing to provide ships to the  fleet with significant quality problems.", "With regard to the second recommendation, DOD did not agree to study  the current timing of ship trials or the costs and benefits of conducting an  additional INSURV assessment prior to providing ships to the fleet. In  particular, DOD stated that the current timing of Navy inspections is  deliberate because it enables INSURV to inspect the ship and identify any  additional deficiencies for correction during the post-shakedown  availability. However, while the timing of final contract trials facilitates the  prioritization of post-delivery work, as our report points out, it is not  optimally aligned to verify that the work completed during post- shakedown availability meets quality standards before a ship is provided  to the fleet. For example, for the eight ships we reviewed, 90 percent of  the 117 starred cards identified during acceptance trials were waived by  the CNO prior to delivery and we found that many of these cards are  corrected during the post-shakedown availability, which is after final  contract trials\u2014INSURV\u2019s final review before a ship is provided to the  fleet. As a result, INSURV does not have an opportunity to verify that  even the Navy\u2019s most significant issues have been corrected before ships  are provided to the fleet at the time of OWLD. By refusing to even  consider changes to the status quo, the Navy may be missing an  opportunity to improve the quality of ships delivered to the operational  fleet.", "With regard to the third recommendation, DOD agreed to report OWLD in  its Selected Acquisition Reports to Congress but disagreed with reporting  the ready-to-deploy date for its ships, noting that operational factors  outside of acquisition concerns can affect the timing of this milestone. We  acknowledge that ready-to-deploy decisions reside with fleet  commanders and are independent of acquisition milestones. However,  we maintain that this date is important for Congressional oversight  because it remains the best milestone for determining when a ship has  achieved a sufficient level of completeness to operate, under the Navy\u2019s  current framework for ship delivery.", "DOD agreed with our fourth recommendation, stating that the criteria for  IOC are defined in each ship class\u2019 Capability Development Document or  Operational Requirements Document and that, for ships that have not  achieved IOC, it will include that definition in the Selected Acquisition  Reports. The response, however, did not indicate that DOD will ensure  that the criteria used to declare IOC aligns with DOD guidance.

To select  case studies for this review, we identified Navy ships which were either  delivered within the last 5 years or are likely to be delivered within the  next year, and were constructed by a variety of shipyards. We also  avoided using multiple ships from the same class or variant, and selected  a mix of early- and late-in-class ships. These parameters resulted in  reviewing the following ships as a non-generalizable sample: DDG 112,  SSN 782, LPD 25, LCS 3, LCS 4, LHA 6, DDG 1000, and CVN 78. Six of  these ships (DDG 112, SSN 782, LPD 25, LCS 3, LCS 4, and LHA 6) had  finished their post-delivery periods at the time of our review, while CVN  78 and DDG 1000 had not. For the purposes of this review, the delivery  date marks the beginning of the post-delivery period and the obligation  work limiting date (OWLD) is the end of the post-delivery period. Table 11  provides additional information on the 8 ships selected as case studies for  this review.", "To assess the extent to which the Navy provides quality, complete ships  to the fleet, free of government and contractor deficiencies, we reviewed  Navy documentation related to the delivery and subsequent post-delivery  period for selected new construction ships. For each case study, we  reviewed such documentation as Chief of Naval Operations waivers for  delivery, readiness briefings for Navy Board of Inspection and Survey  (INSURV) trials, trial cards and reports, the form DD-250 Material  Inspection and Receiving Report, operational assessments, and the  Transfer Book, among others. Through our review of this documentation,  we assessed what construction work was incomplete or deficient when  each case study ship was delivered to the Navy from the shipbuilder; the  availabilities, tests, and trials each ship completed during the post- delivery period; and the condition of each ship when it was provided to  the fleet following the post-delivery period. In particular, for the selected  ships that have already completed the post-delivery period, we assessed  the number and type of INSURV-identified deficiencies at the time of ship  delivery and tracked these through the post-delivery period to determine  whether they were passed to the fleet. Additionally, we identified which  shipboard system certifications were required for these ships and  evaluated Navy documentation and supplementary program office  information to determine when these certifications were completed. We  also reviewed Navy casualty report data at the time ships were passed to  the fleet. Senior fleet personnel told us that the first 3 months after a ship  is passed to the fleet are indicative of the condition the ship was passed  to the fleet as crewmembers gain an understanding and operate these  systems. Thus, we aggregated the open category 2 and 3 casualty  reports during the three months following OWLD to understand the status  of the ship at this time. For CVN 78 and DDG 1000, the two ships which  have not yet completed the post-delivery period, we reviewed the Navy\u2019s  post-delivery plans for these two ships, including proposed schedules and  plans to complete deferred construction. To gain additional understanding  of how and why the Navy decides to accept delivery from the shipbuilder  and provide to the fleet ships that are not free of deficiencies, we  interviewed officials from several Navy entities, including the shipbuilding  program office for each case study ship, the Supervisor of Shipbuilding,  Conversion, and Repair (SUPSHIP), INSURV, Naval Air Systems  Command, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and  representatives from the fleet, among others. The fleet officials we met  with were senior leaders of the Navy commands responsible for operating  and maintaining these vessels, as well as port engineers, senior crew  members (such as the commanding officer and chief engineer), and other  individuals with management and technical responsibilities for maintaining  the ships. We generally reported statements that were widely agreed  upon.", "To evaluate the extent to which the Navy\u2019s policy governing ship delivery  facilitates efforts to deliver complete and quality ships, we reviewed the  Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy covering trials, delivery, and post-delivery  activities (referred to as the Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy)\u2014 Office of the  Chief of Naval Operations Instruction (OPNAVINST) 4700.8K\u2014and  identified the key terms, roles, responsibilities, and processes associated  with post-delivery. Through our review of Navy shipbuilding and quality  assurance guidance\u2014such as OPNAVINST 4730.5R (Trials and Material  Inspections of Ships Conducted by the Board Of Inspection And  Survey)\u2014and through interviews with acquisition officials, we determined  that OPNAVINST 4700.8K was the primary policy governing ship quality  and completeness and the Navy\u2019s program offices verified this  conclusion. We further examined this policy to determine the objectives,  processes, and definitions of key terms that were relevant to the scope of  our engagement, and assessed these elements of the policy for both  internal consistency and consistency with other Navy and DOD guidance.  We conducted interviews with the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations,  Navy program officials, Naval Sea System Command directorates,  SUPSHIP, INSURV, Navy general counsel, fleet maintenance officials,  and other entities to determine how organizations across the Navy  interpret the Navy\u2019s ship delivery policy. We also reviewed Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government and determined which  standards were relevant to the Navy\u2019s post-delivery process. In reviewing  the Navy\u2019s quality practices, we focused on INSURV and SUPSHIP\u2019s  respective roles in ensuring quality ships are built. We assessed INSURV  and SUPSHIP reports, talked to inspectors, and read the guidance  governing these organizations to look at how these organizations improve  ship quality. In addition, we evaluated the results against the Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government to assess the extent to  which the Navy controls ship quality as an outcome or objective.", "To determine the extent to which reports to Congress on the progress of  shipbuilding programs consistently define key milestones, we obtained  and reviewed the Selected Acquisition Reports and budget justification  documents for the ship classes of each of the eight ships we reviewed  going back at least two fiscal years.
