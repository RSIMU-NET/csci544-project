GAO also was asked to develop case studies to illustrate the effects of these problems on soldiers and their families and to determine ways that Congress could make the debt collection process more soldier friendly."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Continuing pay problems resulted in overpayments and debt for sick and injured Army soldiers serving in GWOT. As with GAO's prior work, these pay problems resulted in significant frustration and financial problems for the soldiers and their families. Our audit of separated Army GWOT soldier debt identified nearly 1,300 separated battle-injured soldiers and soldiers who were killed in combat during the first 4 years of GWOT deployment who had incurred a total of $1.5 million in debt as of September 30, 2005. DOD has authority to write off debts of deceased soldiers and generally does not pursue collection action on the debts of soldiers who were killed in action. However, we found that hundreds of battle-injured soldiers were pursued for repayment of military debts through no fault of their own, including at least 74 soldiers whose debts had been reported to credit bureaus and private collection agencies at the time we initiated our audit in June 2005. Although the Debt Collection Act gives DOD authority to use these debt collection tools, in response to our audit, the Army temporarily suspended collection action on debts of battle-injured soldiers until a determination could be made about whether these soldiers' debts were eligible for relief. In addition our investigation of pay problems related to Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers assigned to the Fort Bragg MRPU identified overpayments of approximately $218,000 related to 232 sick and injured soldiers. Many sick and injured Fort Bragg soldiers faced garnishment of wages and other debt collection action resulting from their pay errors. Congress recently gave the Department of Defense (DOD) authority to cancel some GWOT soldier debts. Because of restrictions in the law, debts of injured soldiers who separated at different times can be treated differently, and soldiers who paid their debts are not eligible for refunds. Also, because this authority expires in December 2007, soldiers and their families could face bad credit reports and visits from collection agencies in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent work on Army  military pay. This testimony, which is the fifth in a series of reports and  related testimonies to this committee, is part of a continuing body of work  related to military and travel pay for soldiers who have served in the  Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) since the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001. Our previous work identified hundreds of Army National Guard  and Reserve soldiers who experienced substantial pay and travel  reimbursement problems caused primarily by ongoing challenges in the  areas of human capital, processes, and automated systems. Our recent  work, which is presented in two reports that the committee is releasing  today, presents two more examples of the overall result of a broken  military pay system.", "Collection action on military debt has affected GWOT soldiers from all  Army components\u2014Active, National Guard, and Reserve\u2014and involves  soldiers who were injured or killed in combat as well as soldiers who  suffered from sickness and nonbattle injuries. Our Fort Bragg investigation  looked into allegations that there were overpayments made to sick and  injured in-service soldiers who were in Medical Retention outpatient  status. The Fort Bragg Medical Retention Processing Unit (MRPU) is 1 of  23 Army MRPUs. Once overpayments are identified, they result in debt,  which must be repaid to the government. Our audit of soldier debt focused  on GWOT soldiers who were injured in battle and had separated from the  service and soldiers who were killed in combat and owed military debt  related to overpayments and other errors. We performed our Fort Bragg  investigation from August 2005 through March 2006 in accordance with  quality standards for investigations established by the President\u2019s Council  on Integrity and Efficiency. We performed our soldier debt audit from  June 2005 through March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.", "The Debt Collection Act of 1982 provides a statutory basis for federal  agencies to use appropriate debt collection tools, such as interest charges,  offset, and private collection agencies. Collection action on military debts  consists of pay offset for soldiers who are still in the service and escalates  to collection through debt notification letters, credit bureau reporting, and  private collection agency action when soldiers have left the service and  have not paid their military debts. Debts of separated soldiers may also be  collected through offsets against federal income tax refunds; retirement  pay; and federally administered benefits payments, such as Social Security  Administration benefits. These offsets are handled by the Department of  the Treasury Offset Program, referred to as TOP.", "Today, I will summarize the results of our recent work with respect to the  (1) overpayments made to Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers at  the MRPU at Fort Bragg and the extent and reported causes of debt for  battle-injured Army soldiers who have left the service and (2) the effects of  overpayments and debt-related problems for case study soldiers and their  families. Debt collection action presents the most serious hardships on  injured soldiers who face physical limitations and continuing medical  treatment. I will also discuss the Army\u2019s actions to address pay and debt  management problems and how current debt relief authority can be made  more soldier-friendly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Continuing Pay Problems for Army Soldiers", "paragraphs": ["Continuing pay problems resulted in overpayments and debt for sick and  injured GWOT Army soldiers.

As illustrated by our  case studies, which are discussed in the next section of our testimony,  changes in duty status and location occur when soldiers become sick or  injured or they do not deploy with their units and when soldiers are  injured after deployment or sustain battle injuries and are medically  evacuated.", "Our investigation into allegations of pay problems related to 37 soldiers  assigned to the MRPU at Fort Bragg identified actual overpayments of  approximately $218,000 to 232 sick and injured Army National Guard and  Reserve soldiers in outpatient status during the period April 2003 through  June 2005. These overpayments occurred in part because unit and medical  commanders failed to record changes in duty status and location of sick  and injured soldiers. Data available during our case studies showed that it  took from 14 to 203 days to stop overpayments once a soldier visited the  Finance Battalion. As demonstrated in our past reports, finance offices in  theater were often unable to start or stop hostile fire pay or hardship duty  pay as required because of problems with human capital, processes, and  the lack of integrated pay and personnel systems. When overpayments  were not detected or they were not detected in a timely manner, the dollar  amount of soldier debts continued to increase. Debts that remained unpaid  after these soldiers left the service were subject to collection through  credit bureau reporting, private collection agencies, and TOP offsets of  income tax refunds and other designated federal payments.", "Our audit of separated Army GWOT soldier debt identified nearly 1,300  battle-injured soldiers who left the service owing $1.5 million, including  almost 900 battle-injured soldiers whose debts totaled about $1.2 million  and about 400 soldiers who died in battle whose debts totaled over  $300,000. As a policy, DFAS does not pursue collection action on the debts  of fallen soldiers. However, Army and DFAS officials told us that under  certain circumstances, military debt can be satisfied from the final pay of  fallen soldiers. In addition, DFAS may pursue collection of debts of other  deceased soldiers. We found that hundreds of separated battle-injured  soldiers were pursued for repayment of military debts that occurred  through no fault of their own, including 74 soldiers whose debts had been  reported to credit bureaus, private collection agencies, and TOP at the  time we initiated our audit in June 2005. Although the Debt Collection Act  gives DOD authority to use these debt collection tools, in response to our  audit, the Army temporarily suspended collection action on debts of  battle-injured soldiers until a determination could be made about whether  these soldiers\u2019 debts were eligible for relief.", "As illustrated in figure 1, Army and DFAS data for fiscal years 2002  through 2005 showed that 73 percent of the debts for the nearly 1,300  separated battle-injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat related to  errors in pay calculations, combat pay errors, and erroneous leave  payments during fiscal years 2002 through 2005. The remaining 27 percent  of these soldiers\u2019 debts related to repayment of enlistment bonuses (11  percent) where soldiers did not complete the required term of service or  they improperly received more than one bonus; payments for tuition and  training (6 percent) where soldiers did not complete their training or they  did not fulfill service requirements related to their training; and other  expenses (8 percent) related to unpaid bills for family medical services,  housing and household moves, insurance premiums, travel advances, and  loss or damage of government property. The reasons for the remaining  debt (2 percent) were not recorded in the Defense Debt Management  System.", "Figure 1. Dollar Amounts of Battle-Injured and Fallen Soldier Debts by Major  Reason.", "Other debts relate to provisions in law and DOD business rules in effect at  various times. For example, until mid-2005, soldiers were required to repay  portions of their enlistment bonus, special pay, and educational benefits  and stipends when they failed to fulfill their required terms of service  because of early separation as a result of their war injuries. According to  DFAS officials, although unit commanders and finance offices are  authorized to write off debts for lost and damaged equipment when  soldiers who were injured or killed by hostile fire are medically evacuated  from the theater of operation, they have not always done so. In addition,  unpaid bills for family medical services, housing and household moves,  insurance premiums, and outstanding travel advances generate debt.  Because Army units and medical facilities have not always prepared or  processed changes in orders when a soldier\u2019s duty status or location  changed, soldiers do not have the documentation needed to submit  vouchers for travel reimbursement. The new WIA Support Team\u2019s  standard operating procedures for soldier pay account review require  identification and processing of all soldier travel claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overpayments and Debt Collection Action Have Placed Significant Hardship on Sick and Injured Soldiers and Their Families", "paragraphs": ["Debt collection actions have caused a variety of problems for injured and  sick Army GWOT soldiers.

Work performed for both of  our reports also showed that when debts were not paid after the soldiers  separated from the service, they were subject to credit bureau reporting  and collection agency actions and offsets. Out-of-service debt collection  actions created additional hardships on the soldiers by preventing them  from paying for basic household expenses, getting loans to buy houses or  automobiles or pay off other debt, and sending several of the soldiers into  financial crisis.

One  soldier said he had no money for food while several soldiers told us they  received assistance from family members. When these soldiers leave the  Army, they generally do not have jobs and many of them face continuing  medical treatment for battle injuries, making it difficult to hold a job.
