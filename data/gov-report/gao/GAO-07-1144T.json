Clearly lower short-term deficits are better than higher short-term deficits. However, our real challenge is not short-term deficits, rather it's the long-term structural deficits and related debt burdens that could swamp our ship of state if we do not get serious soon. Specifically, while our near-term fiscal picture is better, our long-term fiscal outlook is not. Health care costs are still growing faster than the economy and the population is still aging. Indeed, what we call the long-term fiscal challenge is not in the distant future.

Figures 2  and 3 illustrate just how much worse the situation has become. Both  figures show the potential fiscal outcome under our \u201cBaseline extended\u201d  scenario. Figure 2 shows the fiscal outlook in 2001 and figure 3 shows the  outlook now. The contrast is dramatic. Even with the surpluses of 2001,  we had a long-term problem, but it was more than 40 years out. Although  an economic slowdown and decisions driven by the attacks of 9/11 and the  need to respond to natural disasters have contributed to the change in  outlook, they do not account for the dramatic worsening in the long-term  outlook since 2001. Subsequent tax cuts and the passage of the Medicare  prescription drug benefit in 2003 were major factors.", "Figure 3 illustrates today\u2019s cold hard truth: that neither slowing the growth  in discretionary spending nor allowing the tax provisions to expire\u2014nor  both together\u2014would eliminate the longer-term imbalance. This is even  clearer under our alternative scenario based on recent trends and policy  preferences (see fig. 4). Growth in the major entitlement programs\u2014 primarily health spending\u2014results in an unsustainable fiscal future  regardless of whether one assumes future revenue will be somewhat  above historical levels as a share of the economy as in the first simulation  (fig. 3) or at historical levels as shown in figure 4.", "Rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem;  they are our nation\u2019s number one fiscal challenge. Just last week, GAO  released the results of our latest fiscal modeling efforts showing that state  and local governments\u2014absent policy changes\u2014will also face large and  growing fiscal challenges beginning within the next few years. As is true  for the federal budget, growth in health-related spending\u2014Medicaid and  health insurance for state and local employees and retirees\u2014is the  primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing the state and local  governments. In short, the fundamental fiscal challenges of all levels of  government are similar and linked. Further, escalating health care costs  are also a major competitiveness challenge for American businesses and a  growing challenge for many Americans. As such, solutions to address  these challenges should be considered in a strategic and integrated  manner.", "The longer-term fiscal challenge we face is not solely a federal one\u2014it is a  national one.

Reporting and  debate are often focused on what the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA)  called discretionary\u2014the one-third of the budget that goes through the  annual appropriation process: Is funding for specific programs being cut  or increased? Is \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo little\u201d being spent in a given area?   I would be the last person to say this isn\u2019t important. Much of what the  American people think of as government is contained in that part of the  budget. Further, as I have said before, I believe that reexamining \u201cthe  base\u201d is something that should be done periodically regardless of fiscal  condition\u2014all of us have a stewardship obligation over taxpayer funds.  We have programs still in existence today that were designed 20 or more  years ago\u2014and the world has changed. However, I would suggest that as  constraints on discretionary spending continue to tighten, the need to  reexamine existing programs and activities becomes greater.", "Certainly controlling discretionary spending is important, but\u2014as  everyone in this room knows even with the large costs associated with the  \u201cGlobal War on Terrorism\u201d and Iraq\u2014discretionary spending is not the  part of the budget that drives the long-term fiscal imbalance. As figure 6  shows, mandatory programmatic spending\u2014that is mandatory spending  excluding interest\u2014has grown from 27 percent of the federal budget in  1965\u2014the year Medicare was created\u2014to 42 percent in 1985 to 53 percent  last year. Total mandatory spending including net interest\u2014has grown  from 34 percent in 1965 to 62 percent last year. Both the CBO baseline  estimates and the President\u2019s Budget proposal show this spending growing  even further.", "This growth\u2014in particular rising health care spending\u2014will have  significant implications not only for the budget, but also for the economy  as a whole. Figure 7 shows the total future draw on the economy  represented by Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Under the 2007  Trustees\u2019 intermediate estimates and CBO\u2019s 2005 midrange Medicaid  estimates, spending for these entitlement programs combined will grow to  over 15 percent of GDP in 2030 from today\u2019s 8.9 percent. Taken together, it  is clear that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid represent an  unsustainable burden on the federal budget, our economy, and future  generations. Ultimately, the nation will have to decide what level of  benefits and spending it wants and how it will pay for these benefits.", "Although these three programs dominate the long-term outlook, they are  not the only federal programs or activities that bind the future. The federal  government undertakes a wide range of responsibilities, programs, and  activities that may either obligate the government to future spending or  create an expectation for such spending. Part of what we owe the future is  leaving enough flexibility to meet whatever challenges arise. So beyond  dealing with the \u201cbig 3,\u201d we need to look at other policies that limit that  flexibility\u2014not to eliminate all of them but to at least be aware of them  and make a conscious decision to reform them in a manner that will be  responsible, equitable, and sustainable. GAO has described the range and  measurement of such fiscal exposures\u2014from explicit liabilities such as  environmental cleanup requirements to the more implicit obligations  presented by life-cycle costs of capital acquisition or disaster assistance.", "Last year the U.S. government\u2019s major reported liabilities, social insurance  commitments, and other fiscal exposures continued to grow. They now  total approximately $50 trillion\u2014about four times the nation\u2019s total output  (GDP) in fiscal year 2006\u2014up from about $20 trillion, or two times GDP in  fiscal year 2000. Absent meaningful reforms, these amounts will continue  to grow every second of every minute of every day due to continuing  deficits, known demographic trends and compounding interest costs.  While it is hard to make sense of what \u201ctrillions\u201d means, one way to think  of these numbers is that if we wanted to put aside today enough to cover  these promises, it would take $170,000 for each and every American,  including newborns, or approximately $440,000 per American household.  Considering that median household income is about $46,000, the  household burden is about 9.5 times median income.", "Just two weeks ago the Office of Management and Budget released its mid- session budget update\u2014showing further improvement in this year\u2019s  budget deficit. This \u201cgood news,\u201d however, did not signal any improvement  in the long-term outlook. The problem isn\u2019t this year\u2019s deficit\u2014or even the  deficit in 2012.

Given the focus of this hearing, let me  elaborate.", "BEA\u2014of which PAYGO was a part\u2014had a number of strengths its  predecessor, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, lacked. Consistent with good  practice in designing incentives, it focused on what Congress and the  administration could control\u2014spending and tax decisions\u2014rather than on  outcomes driven by external changes. In addition, enforcement was  targeted\u2014further encouraging compliance with the discretionary caps and  PAYGO rules. There is broad consensus among observers and analysts  who focus on the budget that the controls contained in the Budget  Enforcement Act constrained spending for much of the 1990s. However,  since the BEA was focused on deficit reduction, its effectiveness  deteriorated with the achievement of near-term surpluses. Although the  BEA statutory PAYGO rules were extended twice, they expired in 2002.", "Earlier this year, both the Senate and the House adopted rules reinstating  PAYGO discipline on both sides of the ledger. Then why should we  consider restoration of statutory PAYGO? The obvious answer ties to  enforcement and duration: it may be easier to waive a rule than ignore a  law, and a law can carry a penalty designed to encourage compliance. I  will defer to Director Orszag and some of the technical experts on the next  panel as to the details of how any sequester or enforcement mechanism  should be designed. However, I will note that it should be unpleasant  enough to encourage compliance but not so draconian as to be  implausible. The goal of any penalty should be to encourage compliance,  not to encourage avoidance or merely impose the penalty.", "As I have said before, when you are in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  digging. Discretionary caps and PAYGO are designed to stop the digging.  There are two reasons to impose PAYGO on both the direct spending and  the revenue side of the budget. The first is obvious\u2014both affect the  bottom line. The second\u2014and perhaps as important\u2014is that applying  PAYGO only to spending is likely to lead to more programs being designed  as tax preferences. Tax preferences are like a form of back door spending.  As a result, they need to be subject to additional transparency and controls  as well. We have previously reported on these tax expenditures, which are  often aimed at policy goals similar to those of federal spending programs.  Revenues forgone through tax expenditures\u2014unless offset by increased  taxes or lower spending\u2014increase the unified budget deficit and federal  borrowing from the public (or reduce the unified budget surplus available  to reduce debt held by the public). Unlike discretionary spending  programs, which are subject to periodic reauthorization and annual  appropriation, tax expenditures are\u2014like entitlement programs\u2014 permanent law and generally not subject to a recurring legislative process  that would ensure systematic annual or periodic review. BEA\u2019s statutory  PAYGO regime applied to both mandatory spending and revenues\u2014and so  limited the ability to create or expand either spending entitlements or tax  expenditures unless offsetting funds could be raised. Since tax provisions  are not as visible in the budget as spending programs, there is already  some incentive to use tax provisions rather than spending programs to  accomplish programmatic ends; imposing controls on spending programs  but not on tax provisions would only increase this incentive. It would be  an unfortunate consequence if the restoration of the PAYGO rule were to  lead to an increase in the portion of the budget on automatic pilot and  therefore reduce both transparency and control."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Moving Beyond PAYGO: Process and Presentational Changes to Increase Transparency and Focus on Long-Term Consequences", "paragraphs": ["The PAYGO requirement prevented legislation that lowered revenue,  created new mandatory programs, or otherwise increased direct spending  from increasing the deficit unless offset by other legislative actions. While  PAYGO constrained the creation or legislative expansion of direct  spending programs and tax cuts, it accepted the existing provisions of law  as given. It was not designed to trigger\u2014and it did not trigger\u2014any  examination of \u201cthe base.\u201d Furthermore, cost increases in existing  mandatory programs were exempt from control under PAYGO and could  be ignored. However, constraining legislative actions that increase the cost  of entitlements, mandatories, and tax expenditures is not enough. Looking  ahead, the budget process will need to go beyond limiting expansions.  Existing programs cannot be permitted to be on autopilot and grow to an  unlimited extent. Since the spending for any given entitlement or other  mandatory program is a function of the interaction between eligibility  rules and the benefit formula\u2014either or both of which may incorporate  exogenous factors such as economic downturns\u2014the way to change the  path of spending for any of these programs is to change their rules or  formulas. In January of last year, we issued a report on \u201ctriggers\u201d\u2014some  measure that when reached or exceeded, would prompt a response  connected to that program. By identifying significant increases in the  spending path of a mandatory program relatively early and acting to  constrain it, Congress may avert much larger and potentially disruptive  financial challenges and program changes in the future. A similar approach  could be applied to those tax expenditures that operate in many ways like  mandatory spending programs. Some years ago, Mr. Chairman, you had  suggested a kind of \u201clook back\u201d trigger\u2014a requirement that the President  and the Congress monitor the path of existing entitlements and make an  explicit determination about whether to accept growing costs or to take  action to change the path.", "I know it comes as no surprise to anyone in this room that I believe we  need to increase the understanding of and focus on the longer term in our  policy and budget debates.

Since then\u2014at the request of some Members\u2014I have had those ideas put  into legislative language as a basis for discussion. Today I\u2019d like to  elaborate a little on some of those ideas. They fall into three broad  categories: increased information and reporting by the executive branch\u2014 both in the President\u2019s budget proposal and in other statements for the  public; more information for the Congress, and an annual GAO report.

This should be  provided as supplementary information in the President\u2019s budget  along with information on the long-term costs of major tax  expenditures.

This summary report presents key information in a way  more accessible to the press and lay reader. I believe it has  contributed to improved understanding about the condition of these  programs. As the Comptroller General I sign the audit report on the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the U.S. Government (CFS).  Despite the fact that we must disclaim our opinion on the  statements I believe they contain important information. The report  is, however, too thick and very hard to read.
