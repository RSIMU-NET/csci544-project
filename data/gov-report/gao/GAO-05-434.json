Further, U.S. authorities are becoming  increasingly concerned about the prospect of combined physical and cyber  attacks, which could have devastating consequences. Table 1 lists sources  of threats that have been identified by the U.S. intelligence community and  others.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about attacks from  individuals and groups with malicious intent\u2014such as crime, terrorism,  foreign intelligence gathering, and acts of war. For example, in February  2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director testified before the  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence about current threats\u2014including  cyber threats\u2014to the United States. He stated that the cyber threat to the  United States is serious, and the number of actors with both the ability and  the desire to use computers for illegal and harmful purposes continues to  rise. The Director added that individuals or groups from foreign states,  including foreign governments, continue to pose threats to our national and  economic security because they have the resources to support advanced  network exploitation and attack. In addition, he stated that \u201cterrorists show  a growing understanding of the critical role of information technology in  the day-to-day operations of our economy and national security and have  expanded their recruitment to include people studying math, computer  science and engineering.\u201d The Director further stated that although  individual hackers do not pose a great threat, hackers intent on stealing  information or motivated by money are a concern\u2014adding that \u201cif this pool  of talent is utilized by terrorists, foreign governments or criminal  organizations, the potential for a successful cyber attack on our critical  infrastructures is greatly increased.\u201d", "Analyses by various organizations have also demonstrated the increasing  threats that are faced by critical infrastructure sectors in the United States.  For example, in May 2004, the E-Crime Watch\u2122 survey of security and law  enforcement executives found that 43 percent of the respondents reported  \u201can increase in electronic crimes and intrusions over the previous year and  70 percent reported at least one electronic crime or intrusion being  committed against their organization.\u201d Regarding the source of the  electronic crime or intrusion, 70 percent of respondents reported that they  knew the source. The respondents most frequently identified hackers (40  percent), followed by current and former employees and contractors (31  percent), as the greatest threats to cybersecurity.  Similarly, respondents to  the 2003 Computer Security Institute and Federal Bureau of Investigation  Computer Crime and Security Survey identified independent hackers as the  most likely source of cyber attacks, as shown in table 2.", "As larger amounts of money are transferred through computer systems, as  more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities  increasingly rely on commercially available information technology, the  likelihood increases that information attacks will threaten vital national  interests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Attacks Are Expanding and Tools Are Readily Available", "paragraphs": ["According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, terrorists, transnational  criminals, and intelligence services are quickly becoming aware of and  using tools such as computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs,  and eavesdropping programs (\u201csniffers\u201d) that can deny access, degrade the  integrity of, intercept, or destroy data (see table 3).", "Viruses and worms are commonly used to launch denial-of-service attacks,  which generally flood targeted networks and systems by transmitting so  much data that regular traffic is either slowed or stopped. Such attacks  have been used ever since the groundbreaking Morris worm, which  brought 10 percent of the systems connected to the Internet to a halt in  November 1988. In 2001, the Code Red worm used a denial-of-service  attack to affect millions of computer users by shutting down Web sites,  slowing Internet service and disrupting business and government  operations.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, intrusion  tools have become more readily available and relatively easy to use.  Frequently, skilled hackers develop exploitation tools and post them on  Internet hacking sites. These tools are then readily available for others to  download, allowing even inexperienced programmers to create a computer  virus or to literally point and click to launch an attack. According to the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, 30 to 40 new attack tools  are posted on the Internet every month. Experts also agree that there has  been a steady advance in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technologies. Intruders quickly develop attacks to exploit vulnerabilities  that have been discovered in products, use these attacks to compromise  computers, and share them with other attackers. In addition, they can  combine these attacks with other forms of technology to develop programs  that automatically scan the network for vulnerable systems, attack them,  compromise them, and use them to spread the attack even further."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cyber Vulnerabilities Have Increased", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the growing threat from terrorists, transnational criminals,  foreign intelligence services, and hackers, there has been a growing  number of software vulnerabilities. Flaws in software code that could  cause a program to malfunction generally result from programming errors  that occur during software development. The increasing complexity and  size of software programs contribute to an increase in software flaws. For  example, Microsoft Windows 2000 reportedly contains about 35 million  lines of code, compared with about 15 million lines for Windows 95. As  reported by the National Institute of Science and Technology, based on  studies of code inspections, there can be as many as 20 flaws per thousand  lines of software code. While most flaws do not create security  vulnerabilities, the potential for these errors reflects the difficulty and  complexity of delivering trustworthy code. By exploiting software  vulnerabilities, hackers and others who spread malicious code can cause  significant damage, ranging from defacing Web sites to taking control of  entire systems and thereby being able to read, modify, or delete sensitive  information; disrupt operations; launch attacks against other organizations\u2019  systems; or destroy systems.", "Between 1995 and 2004, the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s CERT\u00ae  Coordination Center (CERT/CC) reported that 16,726 security  vulnerabilities had resulted from software flaws.

The worm was  programmed to launch a denial-of-service attack against Microsoft\u2019s  Windows Update Web site, and it affected a wide range of systems and  caused slowdowns and disruptions in users\u2019 Internet services. For  example, the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration was forced to shut  down its computer systems.", "In June 2003, the U.S. government issued a warning concerning a virus  that specifically targeted financial institutions. Experts said the  BugBear.b virus was programmed to determine whether a victim had  used an e-mail address for any of the roughly 1,300 financial institutions  listed in the virus\u2019s code. If a match was found, the software attempted  to collect and document user input by logging keystrokes and then  provide this information to a hacker, who could use it in attempts to  break into the banks\u2019 networks.", "In May 2004, we reported that according to a preliminary study  coordinated by the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis,  on January 25, 2003, the SQL Slammer worm (also known as \u201cSapphire\u201d  and \u201cSQL Hell\u201d) infected more than 90 percent of vulnerable computers  worldwide within 10 minutes of its release on the Internet. As the study  reports, exploiting a known vulnerability for which a patch had been  available since July 2002, Slammer doubled in size every 8.5 seconds and  achieved its full scanning rate (55 million scans per second) after about  3 minutes, causing considerable harm through network outages.  Further, the study emphasized that the effects would likely have been  more severe had Slammer carried a malicious payload, exploited a more  widespread vulnerability, or targeted a more popular service. Despite its  lack of malicious payload, Slammer caused significant damage, exacting  a toll on several large companies and municipalities that found their  internal networks deluged with data from the virus. Major financial  institutions reported problems; for example, one reported that a  majority of its automatic teller machines were unable to process  customer transactions for several hours. The attack disrupted  operations for several hours at a 911 call center that served two  suburban police departments and at least 14 fire departments. A  commercial airline had flights delayed or canceled because of online  ticketing and electronic check-in problems.", "In November 2002, a British computer administrator was indicted on  charges that he accessed and damaged 98 computers in 14 states  between March 2001 and March 2002, causing some $900,000 in damage.  These networks belonged to the Department of Defense, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, and private companies. The  indictment alleges that the attacker was able to gain administrative  privileges on military computers, copy password files, and delete critical  system files. The attacks rendered the networks of the Earle Naval  Weapons Station in New Jersey and the Military District of Washington  inoperable.", "The CERT/CC has noted that attacks that once took weeks or months to  propagate over the Internet now take just hours\u2014or even minutes\u2014 because automated tools are now available. For instance, while Code Red  achieved an infection rate of over 20,000 systems within 10 minutes in July  2001, about a year and a half later, in January 2003, the Slammer worm  successfully attacked at least 75,000 systems, infecting more than 90  percent of vulnerable systems within 10 minutes.", "According to CERT/CC, due to the widespread use of automated tools that  have made attacks against Internet-connected systems so commonplace, it  no longer publishes the number of incidents that are reported.

In his  November 2002 congressional testimony, the Director of the CERT Centers  at Carnegie Mellon University noted that supervisory control and data  acquisition systems and other forms of networked computer systems had  been used for years to control power grids, gas and oil distribution  pipelines, water treatment and distribution systems, hydroelectric and  flood control dams, oil and chemical refineries, and other physical  infrastructure systems. These control systems are increasingly being  connected to communications links and networks to enhance performance  and to reduce operational costs by supporting remote maintenance, remote  control, and remote update functions. They are potential targets for  individuals intent on causing massive disruption and physical damage. The  use of commercial-off-the-shelf technologies for these systems\u2014without  adequate security enhancements\u2014can significantly limit available  approaches to protection and may increase the number of potential  attackers.", "As components of control systems increasingly make critical decisions that  were once made by humans, the potential effect of a cyber attack becomes  more devastating. For example, a failed control system was a contributing  factor in the widespread east coast electrical blackout of August 2003.  While investigations later found that this incident was not the result of a  deliberate attack, DHS officials stated that the significant involvement of a  control system highlighted the fact that a physical system or location could  be accessed through a cyber connection. Another example occurred in  August 2003; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission confirmed that earlier  that year the Slammer worm had infected a private computer network at a  nuclear power plant, disabling a safety monitoring system for nearly 5  hours. The plant\u2019s process computer failed, and it took about 6 hours for it  to become available again. The worm reportedly also affected  communications on the control networks of at least five other utilities by  propagating so quickly that control system traffic was blocked. Looking  ahead, 66 percent of the technology experts and scholars who responded to  a 2004 survey on the future of the Internet believe that at least one  devastating cyber attack will occur on the networked information  infrastructure or the country\u2019s power grid within the next 10 years.", "In March 2004, we reported on the significant challenges of securing  controls systems, including technical limitations, perceived lack of  economic justification, and conflicting organizational priorities.

Infrastructure sector officials stated that the lack of stable  leadership has diminished NCSD\u2019s ability to maintain trusted relationships  with its infrastructure partners and has hindered its ability to adequately  plan and execute activities. According to one private-sector representative,  the importance of organizational stability in fostering strong partnerships  cannot be over emphasized.", "Organizational authority: NCSD does not have the organizational  authority it needs to effectively serve as a national focal point for  cybersecurity. Accordingly, NCSD officials lack the authority to represent  and commit DHS to efforts with the private sector.  Infrastructure and  cybersecurity officials, including the chairman of the sector coordinators  and representatives of the cybersecurity industry, have expressed concern  that the NCSD\u2019s relatively low position within the DHS organization hinders  its ability to accomplish cybersecurity-related goals. NCSD\u2019s lack of  authority has led to some missteps, including DHS canceling an important  cyber event without explanation and taking almost a year to issue formal  responses to private sector recommendations resulting from selected  National Cyber Security Summit task forces\u2014even though responses were  drafted within months.", "A congressional subcommittee also expressed concern that DHS\u2019s  cybersecurity office lacks the authority to effectively fulfill its role. In 2004,  the subcommittee proposed legislation to elevate the head of the  cybersecurity office to an assistant secretary position. Among other  benefits, the subcommittee reported that such a change could  provide more focus and authority for DHS\u2019s cybersecurity mission,   allow higher level input into national policy decisions, and   provide a single visible point of contact within the federal government  to improve interactions with the private sector.", "Hiring and contracting:  Ineffective DHS management processes have  impeded the department\u2019s ability to hire employees and maintain contracts.  We recently reported that since its inception, DHS\u2019s leadership has  provided a foundation for maintaining critical operations while undergoing  transformation. However, in managing its transformation, we noted that  DHS still needed to overcome a number of significant challenges, including  addressing systemic problems in human capital and acquisition systems.  Federal and nonfederal officials expressed concerns with DHS\u2019s hiring and  contracting processes. For example, an NCSD official reported that the  division has had difficulty in hiring personnel to fill vacant positions. These  officials stated that once they found qualified candidates, some candidates  decided not to apply and another withdrew his acceptance because they  felt that the DHS hiring process took too long. In addition, an NCSD official  stated that there had been times when DHS did not renew NCSD contracts  in a timely manner, requiring that key contractors work without pay until  approvals could be completed and payments could be made. In other cases,  NCSD was denied services from a vendor, because DHS had repeatedly  failed to pay for its services. External stakeholders, including an ISAC  representative, also noted that NCSD is hampered by how long it takes  DHS to award a contract.", "Awareness of DHS roles and capabilities: Many infrastructure  stakeholders are not yet aware of DHS\u2019s cybersecurity roles and  capabilities. Department of Energy critical infrastructure officials stated  that the roles and responsibilities of DHS and the sector-specific agencies  need to be better clarified in order to improve coordination. In addition,  during a regional cyber exercise, private-sector and state and local  government officials reported that the mission of NCSD and the  capabilities that DHS could provide during a serious cyber-threat were not  clear to them.

The ability to develop partnerships greatly enhances the agency\u2019s ability to  identify, assess, and reduce cyber threats and vulnerabilities, establish  strategic analytical capabilities, provide incident response, enhance  government cybersecurity, and improve international efforts. According to  one infrastructure sector representative, effective partnerships require  building relationships with mutually developed goals, shared benefits and  responsibilities, and tangible, measurable results. However, this individual  reported that DHS has not typically adopted these principles in pursuing  partnerships with the private sector, which dramatically diminishes  cybersecurity gains that government and industry could otherwise achieve.  For example, DHS has often informed the infrastructure sectors about  government initiatives or sought input after most key decisions have been  made. Also, DHS has not demonstrated that it recognizes the value of  leveraging existing private sector mechanisms, such as information-sharing  entities and processes already in place and working. In addition, the  instability of NCSD\u2019s leadership positions to date has led to problems in  developing partnerships. Representatives from two ISACs reported that  turnover at NCSD has hindered partnership efforts. Additionally, IT sector  representatives stated that NCSD needs continuity of leadership, regular  communications, and trusted policies and procedures in order to build the  partnerships that will allow the private sector to share information.", "Information sharing: We recently identified information sharing in  support of homeland security as a high-risk area, and we noted that  establishing an effective two-way exchange of information to help detect,  prevent, and mitigate potential terrorist attacks requires an extraordinary  level of cooperation and perseverance among federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector. However, such effective  communications are not yet in place in support of our nation\u2019s  cybersecurity. Representatives from critical infrastructure sectors stated  that entities within their respective sectors still do not openly share  cybersecurity information with DHS. As we have reported in the past, much  of the concern is that the potential release of sensitive information could  increase the threat to an entity. In addition, sector representatives stated  that when information is shared, it is not clear whether the information will  be shared with other entities, such as other federal entities, state and local  entities, law enforcement, or various regulators, or how it will be used or  protected from disclosure. Representatives from the banking and finance  sector stated that the protection provided by the Critical Infrastructure  Information Act and the subsequently established Protected Critical  Infrastructure Information Program is not clear and has not overcome the  trust barrier. Alternatively, sector representatives have expressed concerns  that DHS is not effectively communicating information with them.  According to one infrastructure representative, DHS has not matched  private sector efforts to share valuable information with a corresponding  level of trusted information sharing. An official from the water sector noted  that when representatives called DHS to inquire about a potential terrorist  threat, they were told that DHS could not share any information and that  they should \u201cwatch the news.\u201d", "Providing value: According to sector representatives, even when  organizations within their sectors have shared information with NCSD, the  entities do not consistently receive useful information in return. They  noted that without a clear benefit, they are unlikely to pursue further  information sharing with DHS. Federal officials also noted problems in  identifying the value that DHS provides. According to Department of  Energy officials, DHS does not always provide analysis or reports based on  the information that agencies provide. Federal and nonfederal officials also  stated that most of US-CERT\u2019s alerts have not been useful because the  alerts lack essential details or have been based on already available  information. Further, Treasury officials stated that US-CERT needed to  provide relevant and timely feedback regarding the incidents reported to it.", "Clearly, these challenges are not mutually exclusive.

The  director stated that continued and expanded stakeholder involvement is  critical and identified some of NCSD\u2019s significant activities\u2014many of  which are discussed in the body of this report. However, the director noted  that DHS does not agree that the challenges it has experienced have  prevented it from achieving significant results in improving the nation\u2019s  cybersecurity posture. In addition, DHS did not concur with our  recommendations to (1) develop a prioritized list of key activities for  addressing the underlying challenges and (2) identify performance  measures and milestones for fulfilling its prioritized responsibilities and for  performing activities to address its challenges and track organizational  progress. Specifically, the director reported that DHS already uses a  prioritized list, performance measures, and milestones to guide and track  its activities and sought additional clarification of these recommendations.

This view was  reiterated by the federal and nonfederal stakeholders we interviewed.", "Regarding our recommendations, while we agree with DHS that its  strategic plan for cybersecurity identifies a number of activities (along with  some performance metrics and milestones) that will begin to address the  challenges, this plan does not include specific initiatives that would ensure  that the challenges are addressed in a prioritized and comprehensive  manner. For example, the strategic plan for cybersecurity does not include  initiatives to help stabilize and build authority for the organization. Further,  the strategic plan does not identify the relative priority of its initiatives and  does not consistently identify performance measure for completing its  initiatives. As DHS moves forward in identifying initiatives to address the  underlying challenges it faces, it will be important to establish performance  metrics and milestones for fulfilling these initiatives. In fact, in its strategic  plan for cybersecurity, DHS acknowledges that it needs to establish  performance measures and milestones and to collect performance data for  its key initiatives.", "Regarding our previous recommendations related to information sharing,  DHS identified plans for fulfilling our recommendations but did not provide  any evidence that these efforts were completed. For example, in November  2004, DHS reported that by June 2005, it planned to develop an information- sharing plan including the elements we recommended; however, DHS has  not yet completed this plan and has not provided any evidence that this  plan will include the key elements we had recommended. In addition, in  regard to our recommendation that DHS develop appropriate policies and  procedures for information sharing and coordination within DHS and with  other federal and nonfederal entities, DHS reported that it has many  information sharing initiatives and high-level documents. However, DHS  did not specify any DHS-level policies or procedures for information  sharing.

We also reported that the center did not have the  industry-specific data on factors such as critical systems components,  known vulnerabilities, and interdependencies. Therefore, we  recommended that responsible executive-branch officials and agencies  establish a capability for strategic analysis of computer-based threats,  including developing a methodology and obtaining infrastructure data. In  response to specific questions on these topics in April 2005, NCSD officials  acknowledged that work remains to be done in developing cyber-related  strategic analysis and warning capabilities. They stated that there is still no  generally accepted methodology for analyzing strategic cyber-based threats  and that NCSD is in the process of developing industry-specific data.
