Many of the officials with whom GAO spoke at selected sub-agencies at the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Agriculture (USDA), and Education (Education) were unfamiliar with the Career Roadmap and made limited use of the training resources. Further, OMB and CFOC do not collect detailed user data or feedback, limiting their abilities to determine the usefulness of these resources.", "GAO found that sub-agencies at HHS, USDA, and Education vary in following leading training practices for planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating their grants training programs. Additionally, HHS, USDA, and Education could not readily identify grants management specialists\u2014the 1109 job series\u2014or employees in other job series working on grants without querying each sub-agency. These agencies cannot do so because their central offices do not have a reporting mechanism tracking their sub-agencies' grants workforce. Further, agency central offices do not evaluate sub-agency grants training efforts. Without sufficient monitoring and oversight, the agencies cannot have reasonable assurance that their sub-agencies are sufficiently training their grants workforce so they have the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to properly manage, administer, and monitor the billions of dollars that the federal government spends on grants annually."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations including that OMB, working with the CFOC, should (1) publicize the Career Roadmap and (2) collect data metrics and user feedback on its use.

Federal grants play an important role  in achieving national objectives and have grown considerably in value  and complexity over the past three decades. Therefore, it is important  that the federal workforce that manages, administers, and monitors grants  has the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform these  functions effectively.", "The important role that training plays in the effective management of  grants can be seen, for example, in the fact that in December 2017, the  Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency identified  \u201cgrants oversight\u201d as one of six critical issues in the federal government.

In addition, we used data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise  Human Resource Integration (EHRI) system to report government-wide  data on the grants management specialist 1109 job series. The 1109 job  series is a classification for those federal employees whose job  responsibilities primarily involve management of grants. To determine the  reliability of the EHRI data, we reviewed EHRI documentation and  interviews from a previous GAO engagement completed in October 2016.

Figure 2 below illustrates the four  distinct phases of the grants lifecycle.", "Given the billions of dollars in federal grants funding that are awarded  every year, effective training could help provide grants managers with the  skills and competencies they need to better manage and oversee those  dollars. As one example of the importance of rigorous grants  management and training, in April 2017 we found that Education grants  staff inconsistently documented key required monitoring activities and, as  a result, about $21 million in discretionary grants lacked the correct  documentation of grantee performance. We recommended that  Education establish and implement detailed written supervisory review  procedures for official grant files to provide reasonable assurance that  grant staff perform and document key monitoring activities. Education officials agreed with the recommendation and said they would develop a  department-wide standard operating procedure (SOP) that will, among  other things, provide standards for timeliness of documenting key  monitoring and administrative activities and require the periodic review of  grant files. Officials expect to complete the SOP by September 30, 2018.", "In 2011, OMB established the Council on Financial Assistance Reform  (COFAR), an interagency group of executive branch officials with the  stated aim of creating a more streamlined and accountable structure to  coordinate financial assistance, including grants. In 2012 and again in  fiscal years 2016 and 2017, COFAR identified the need to develop a  qualified and professional workforce as one of six priorities to guide its  work on grants management reform. According to OMB staff, they  disbanded COFAR on June 15, 2017 as part of OMB\u2019s efforts to reduce  grants-related requirements once COFAR had recommended policies and  actions to effectively deliver financial assistance. COFAR\u2019s  recommendations resulted in the Uniform Administrative Requirements,  Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, which is  intended to improve performance, transparency, and oversight for federal  awards.", "Moving forward, the responsibility of coordinating financial assistance  priorities was given to the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC), a  group of 24 agency chief and deputy chief financial officers that work  together to improve financial management in the U.S. government.  According to OMB staff, the controller of OMB\u2019s Office of Federal  Financial Management is the chair of the CFOC. In addition, OPM is  responsible for providing leadership and guidance over federal agency  training to ensure the effective promotion and coordination of federal  agency training programs and operations.

As of June 2018, this continued to be the  case. By contrast, there are government-wide training requirements for  the acquisitions workforce intended to help ensure its quality and  effectiveness. For example, OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy  (OFPP) provides government-wide guidance on managing the  acquisitions workforce. The Federal Acquisition Institute, which  coordinates with the OFPP, promotes the development of the civilian  acquisitions workforce. Further, OFPP has developed Federal  Acquisition Certification requirements for acquisition professionals serving  as contracting staff, contracting officer\u2019s representatives, and  program/project managers. Notably, in fiscal year 2017, the federal  government spent approximately $166 billion more on grants to state and  local governments than it did on federal acquisitions. OMB staff explained that the acquisitions workforce faces more requirements  because contracts have more uniform requirements and are specified in  law. They stated that grants, on the other hand, are diverse and are  established by individual statutes with varying conditions.", "Our work in the acquisitions area identifies the importance of providing  reasonable assurance of an appropriately trained staff through  certification. Certification programs are designed to ensure that  individuals attain the knowledge and skills required to perform in a  particular occupation or role by establishing consistent standards. For  example, for the acquisition workforce, OFPP requires a minimum set of  career-specific courses, along with education and experience  requirements, to obtain certification. To ensure acquisition professionals  remain current on acquisition policies and practices, OFPP also requires  the acquisition workforce to meet continuing learning requirements. See  appendix I for a comparison of training for the federal acquisition  workforce versus the federal grants workforce.", "Education, HHS, and USDA delegate the decision to their various sub- agencies of whether grants employees should obtain professional grants  certifications.

Our framework identifies four  components of the training and development process: (1) Planning, (2)  Design and Development, (3) Implementation, and (4) Evaluation. Within  each component, the guide identifies leading practices and questions for  agencies to consider when assessing each of these four components. We  compared current grants training practices at the selected agencies and  sub-agencies with selected leading training practices from the guide. We  found variation among sub-agencies in following those selected training  practices.", "Planning: skills and competencies assessment. In our guide, we  stated that effective workforce planning and training begins with a skills  and competency assessment. A leading practice under this component is  that agencies use an organization-wide knowledge and skills inventory  and industry benchmarks to help identify performance problems in their  workforces. We stated that workforce planning should entail the  collection of valid and reliable data on such indicators as distribution of  employees\u2019 skills and competencies.", "Officials we interviewed at all the selected sub-agencies explained that  grants training needs are primarily identified by grants management  supervisors or self-identified by grants workforce employees.

In fiscal year 2017, FNS  also conducted a nationwide qualitative survey of its grants  employees to identify training gaps and needs. The remaining  three sub-agencies we reviewed informally identify skills gaps and  training needs through ongoing discussions between supervisors  and grants employees and during annual performance  evaluations.", "Officials from Education\u2019s central Learning and Development  office stated they issue a department-wide competency  assessment and training needs assessment to the various  department sub-agencies annually or bi-annually. Officials from  Education\u2019s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education sub- agency told us they also conduct their own grants workforce  learning needs assessment examining grants tasks, content  knowledge, and general skills.

Design and Development involves identifying specific training  and development initiatives that the agency will use, along with other  strategies, to improve individual and agency performance. One of the  leading practices under this component is choosing the most appropriate  mix of centralized and decentralized management of training programs;  internal and external training sources; and training delivery mechanisms  (e.g., classroom, computer-based, on the job, etc.). All three agencies  provide the majority of their grants training at the sub-agency level.

CGMOs then decide how to  disseminate this information within their respective sub-agencies  (e.g., through webinars, teleconferences, or ad hoc trainings). An  HHS council comprised of CGMOs also meets on a quarterly or  biannual basis to discuss new grants policy and requirements.  Further, HHS\u2019s central grants offices are developing a  foundational \u201cGrants 101\u201d course to help standardize a baseline of  grants knowledge across all of HHS\u2019s sub-agencies, which they  expect to complete by November 2018.

For example, Education\u2019s OCFO provides  agency-wide training on discretionary and formula grants financial  and budgetary courses; Learning and Development provides  introductory grant courses; and Risk Management Services  provides risk-based grants training covering topics including cost  analysis, budgetary review, monitoring grants, and uniform  guidance. Additionally, Education\u2019s sub-agencies provide mission-  and program-specific grants training to augment the centrally  provided trainings.", "Centralized and decentralized training approaches may present different  advantages for agencies and sub-agencies. On the one hand, efficiencies  may be achieved by centralizing the design and delivery of some grants  training that has widespread applicability throughout the agency.  Additionally, if each sub-agency is responsible for implementing its own  grants training program, the potential exists for inconsistent grants  workforce training across the agency. On the other hand, each sub- agency is able to tailor the training to its own needs when it manages and  provides the training itself. In making this decision, it is important for  agencies to carefully analyze and consider trade-offs.", "Implementation: establishing agency-level accountability.  Implementation involves ensuring effective and efficient delivery of  training and development opportunities in an environment that supports  learning. One of the leading training practices under this component is an  agency organization that is held accountable, along with the line  executives, for the maximum performance of the workforce. According to  our Human Capital Guide, there are different ways of ensuring  accountability, including establishing clear lines of authority in agency  policies, issuing agency-wide guidance to ensure consistency, and  establishing a central oversight office, among others.", "We found variation among the three selected agencies in following this  leading training practice with HHS and Education having some agency  level of accountability but USDA having less.", "HHS\u2019 central Office of Grants Policy, Oversight, and Evaluation  assigns desk officers to work with sub-agency CGMOs in helping  them understand available training resources and needs. HHS  also has an Executive Committee for Grants Administration Policy  Council that meets quarterly to discuss regulations, policies, and  grants administrative requirements. This committee is made up of  CGMOs from each HHS sub-agency.

In this way, agencies can better ensure the  maximum performance of the grants workforce.", "Evaluation: using data to assess training results. Evaluation involves  assessing the extent to which training and development efforts contribute  to improved performance and results. A selected leading training practice  under this component is the use of performance data (both qualitative and  quantitative measures) to assess the results achieved through training  and development efforts.", "The three agencies we reviewed primarily conduct evaluation at the sub- agency level. The sub-agencies vary as to how they carry out their  evaluations and few use any quantitative performance measures to  determine if training was successful.", "HHS officials stated the central offices do not measure the  effectiveness of training, nor is there centralized information  sharing on how well training works. Officials at the HHS sub- agencies we reviewed told us they primarily use informal feedback  such as ongoing conversations between employees and  supervisors after training completion and supervisor observations  of employee performance to determine if grants training is  successful. Officials at HHS\u2019 Health Resources and Services  Administration also said they receive data regarding employee  scores on required grants training courses. Some HHS sub- agencies use an external vendor for some grants training and  employees complete a survey at the end of each of these courses,  but HHS officials do not see those results. HHS officials rely on  employee feedback after training completion to determine if  external vendor training is effective.", "Officials at the USDA sub-agencies we reviewed told us they  primarily use informal feedback through supervisory review of  employee performance and employee individual development  training plans; internal local level reviews and audits of grant  processes; and some course completion surveys.", "Officials at Education\u2019s central Learning and Development office  told us they conduct electronic course evaluation surveys.
