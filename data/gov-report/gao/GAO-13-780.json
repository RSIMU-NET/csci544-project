Under a  fee-for-service system, health care providers claim reimbursement from  state Medicaid programs for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries.  Under a Medicaid managed care system, states contract with managed  care organizations to provide or arrange for medical services, and  prospectively pay the organizations a per person, or capitated, payment.

In 2009, an estimated 5.8 million adult Medicaid  beneficiaries, or 30 percent of all adult Medicaid beneficiaries, were  diagnosed with some type of mental illness. States that provide mental  health services through limited benefit plans establish these delivery  systems under Medicaid waivers. Sections 1115 and 1915(b) of the  Social Security Act allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  waive certain federal requirements, such as limitations on a state\u2019s ability  to require certain beneficiaries to enroll in managed care. States that  provide Medicaid benefits through managed care arrangements, including  limited benefit plans, must comply with certain requirements, including  those requiring states to establish procedures to monitor managed care  program operations.

Activities to  coordinate mental and physical health care services include sharing  information\u2014such as medical records, test and lab results, and  prescribed medications\u2014across providers and care delivery sites. States  and limited benefit plans can implement specific care practices with the  purpose of facilitating communications and the sharing of information.  Care coordination is particularly important for Medicaid beneficiaries with  mental illnesses because they are more likely to have other medical  conditions requiring ongoing physical health care services than  beneficiaries without mental illnesses.

Michigan required its limited  benefit plans to coordinate with the criminal justice system, including  police/sheriffs, court personnel, and attorneys.", "All four states\u2019 contracts with limited benefit plans required the plans to  undertake specific activities to facilitate coordination of mental and  physical health care services. These required activities generally fell into  the following categories: sharing information and establishing  communications between providers and across care settings; identifying  patients\u2019 mental and physical health care needs and creating individual  care plans; and developing measures and collecting data on coordination  of care.", "All four states required limited benefit plans to implement mechanisms  to share information or standardize communications between  providers and across care settings. For example, contracts in Florida,  Michigan, and Washington required limited benefit plans to develop  written plans or agreements outlining when, and in some cases how,  care will be coordinated between mental health, primary care, and  other providers.

For example, in 2012, officials from all  four states reported that their state implemented Medicaid policies  allowing providers to bill for two services, such as mental and physical  health care services, in one day for the same beneficiary. In doing so,  limited benefit plans can work to integrate and improve access to care by  providing mental and physical health services at the same location and  allowing both providers to receive reimbursement for services furnished  on the same day. Since 2012, officials from two of the four states reported  that they have taken steps to further integrate mental and physical health  care services. Officials from Kansas reported that in January 2013 the  state stopped providing mental health services through a limited benefit  plan and implemented a comprehensive managed care arrangement  providing both mental and physical health care services to Medicaid  beneficiaries, and officials from Florida reported that the state is taking  steps to implement similar arrangements in 2014.", "During 2011 and 2012, all four states we studied conducted a variety of  reviews that were either directly focused on the coordination of mental  and physical health care services or assessed such coordination as part  of broader reviews.

Federal law requires EQROs to annually review Medicaid managed  care plans, including limited benefit plans that provide inpatient  services. These reviews assess limited benefit plans\u2019 strengths and  weaknesses with respect to quality, timeliness, and access to health  care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. All three states in  which limited benefit plans were subject to these reviews\u2014Florida,  Michigan, and Washington\u2014had EQRs conducted that included an  assessment, in either 2011 or 2012, of limited benefit plans\u2019  compliance with care coordination contract requirements. In  Michigan, the EQR findings did not include any specific results on  care coordination in 2011, but found that the state and limited benefit  health plans were in compliance with managed care requirements and  contractual agreements. In Washington, the EQR findings in 2011  questioned the effectiveness of one limited benefit plan\u2019s intervention  to increase the quality of care coordination, including the validity of the  methods used to assess care coordination. In Florida, officials  reported that the EQR is conducted annually in conjunction with two  process improvement projects. One limited benefit plan in this state  participated in a project that examined the documentation of services  in an effort to improve communication and coordination of services  between physical and mental health providers in limited benefit plans.  This project is still ongoing.", "Internal onsite reviews are reviews conducted by the state Medicaid  agency at providers or managed care plan offices, or at locations  where Medicaid beneficiaries receive services. Three of the four  states\u2014Florida, Michigan, and Kansas\u2014conducted onsite reviews  during the 2011 through 2012 time period. Florida officials reported  that the state conducted onsite reviews annually to evaluate limited  benefit plans\u2019 administrative and clinical compliance, including care  coordination. Some of these reviews identified needed improvements;  for example, in a 2012 review of one limited benefit plan in Florida, the  state found that the plan needed to establish a process for providing  Medicaid beneficiaries immediate access to psychiatric services upon  their release from a jail or juvenile detention facility to ensure  prescribed medications were available. Michigan officials reported that  their reviews occurred biennially and, in part, assessed limited benefit  plans\u2019 capacity to coordinate physical and mental health services for  Medicaid beneficiaries. Some of these reviews identified needed  improvements; for example, in a 2011 review of one limited benefit  plan, the state was unable to find evidence of communication and  coordination between a psychiatric hospital and a Medicaid  beneficiary\u2019s primary care physician or health plan and recommended  that the limited benefit plan devise a coordination plan. In 2011 and  2012, Kansas conducted an onsite review of the one limited benefit  plan that state contracted with to examine plan guidelines used to  identify and authorize the coordination of care for beneficiaries with  high needs, including those with certain mental health diagnoses. In  regard to care coordination, the state found that the limited benefit  plan met its contractual requirements and had an acceptable process  to identify Medicaid beneficiaries with high physical and mental health  needs, and provided these beneficiaries with ongoing care  coordination between their mental health providers and other  providers and entities delivering treatment and service.

At a minimum, a state is required to conduct an  independent assessment for its first two waiver periods. Of the four  states, Kansas was the only state required to conduct an independent  assessment during the time period of our review because it began  providing mental health services through a contract with a limited  benefit plan under a waiver in 2007. Kansas\u2019 2009 assessment found  that a small percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in the  limited benefit plan received care coordination, and recommended  that the state should increase the share of beneficiaries receiving  these services.
