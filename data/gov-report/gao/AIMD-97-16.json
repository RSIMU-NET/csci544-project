Concerns that the cash-based budget badly distorted information on credit programs led to the inclusion of accrual-based costs in the budget for credit programs as the result of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Similar concerns have been raised about other programs\u2014most notably insurance and federal employee pensions. In 1992, the Bush administration proposed to change the budget treatment of insurance programs from a cash basis to an accrual basis. Although the proposal was not enacted, analysts continue to assess the merits of accrual-based budgeting for such programs.", "Because of his concern that for some federal programs, the cash-based budget does not provide a complete picture of the consequences of the government\u2019s actions, the Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget asked us to evaluate the use of accrual-based budgeting for federal insurance programs. He believes that making the government\u2019s cost of these programs more visible will improve budget decision-making."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal budget serves as the primary financial plan of the government. As such, difficult decisions concerning resource allocation and fiscal policy are framed by the information provided in the budget. Historically, government outlays and receipts have been reported on a cash or cash-equivalent basis. Receipts are recorded when received and expenditures are recorded when paid, without regard to the period in which taxes and fees were assessed or the costs incurred. For most federal programs, cash-based reporting provides adequate information on and control over the government\u2019s spending commitments because the time between when a liability is incurred and when it is paid is short. Costs to the government are known at the time the decision is made to provide budget authority, and cash outlays generally capture the fiscal effects of the government\u2019s spending. However, for certain programs, such as federal insurance in which the government\u2019s commitment can involve cash flows to and from the government over many years, the actual cost to the government may not be fully recognized with cash-based reporting.", "The failure of the cash-based budget to provide timely signals to policymakers on the rapidly deteriorating financial condition of the nation\u2019s deposit insurance system and growing federal commitments for deposit insurance during the 1980s has been widely cited as a vivid illustration of the shortfalls of cash budgeting for federal insurance programs. Although GAO and some industry analysts raised concerns about the rapidly rising deposit insurance costs that were accruing to the government, corrective action was delayed and the government\u2019s ultimate cost increased. If the budget had recognized the government\u2019s expected cost of deposit insurance, the government\u2019s ultimate cost might have been lower if such recognition had prompted earlier actions by policymakers to limit losses. Instead, the budget did not report these costs until institutions were closed and depositors paid. In addition, by not reflecting the government\u2019s deposit insurance liabilities as they accrued, the cash-based budget proved to be a poor gauge of the program\u2019s economic impact. Delay in recognizing these costs obscured the government\u2019s underlying fiscal condition during and after the crisis. Furthermore, not only was the cash-based budget slow to recognize these costs, but it may have also created incentives to delay closing insolvent institutions (to avoid increasing the annual deficit), which increased the ultimate cost to the government. This experience with deposit insurance heightened concerns that the cash-based budget was not providing adequate information on the potential cost of other federal insurance commitments.", "In a series of reports in the 1980s on managing the cost of government, GAO advocated the use of some accrual cost measures in the budget.Specifically, we reported that due to the budget\u2019s exclusive focus on cash transactions, the costs of some programs, including retirement, insurance, and credit, may not be accurately reflected in the budget. However, given the limitations of governmentwide accounting systems, we suggested that budget reporting could be improved by recording annual accrued costs for selected programs. Since then, budget reporting has gradually been modified using accrual measures to recognize the government\u2019s cost for certain programs. For example, in 1985, budgeting for military retirement costs was moved to an accrual basis reflecting\u2014at the program level\u2014the government\u2019s expected costs for retirement benefits as they are earned. These program level accrued amounts are offset so that total budget outlays and the deficit are not affected by this change. Similarly, beginning in 1987, accruing retirement benefit costs not covered by employee contributions are now charged to employing agencies for civilian employees covered under the Federal Employees Retirement System.", "More recently, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed the method of controlling and accounting for credit programs to an accrual basis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Credit Reform Marked a Significant Departure From Cash-Based Budgeting", "paragraphs": ["On November 5, 1990, the Federal Credit Reform Act was signed into law, as Title 13B of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508). The act, which legislated changes GAO and others advocated,addressed many of the concerns raised by various analysts by changing the budget reporting of the cost of credit programs from a cash basis to an accrual basis. Because the federal government uses loans and loan guarantees to achieve numerous policy objectives, the scope of this change was far-reaching. In fiscal year 1996, for example, the federal government entered into commitments to make or guarantee loans totaling approximately $200 billion.", "Prior to credit reform, outlays for credit programs were reflected in the budget only when cash was disbursed. The full amount of a direct loan was reported as an outlay, ignoring the fact that many would be repaid. In the case of loan guarantees, initially no outlays were reported. This ignored the fact that some of the guaranteed loans would be defaulted upon and thus require future outlays. Consequently, the cash basis of reporting overstated the cost of direct loans in the year they were made because it ignored repayments and understated the cost of loan guarantees in the year they were issued by ignoring defaults. This deficient reporting skewed cost comparisons between programs with similar purposes but different funding approaches (i.e., direct loans, loan guarantees, or grants). Further, the relative cost of such programs in comparison to other federal spending was also misrepresented. By incorporating accrual cost measures in the budget for loan and loan guarantee programs, credit reform improved these cost comparisons.", "Credit reform addressed the shortfalls of cash-based reporting for credit program costs by requiring the budget to include the estimated cost to the federal government over the entire life of the loan or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis. For purposes of the Credit Reform Act, the estimated cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee is now the sum of all expected costs\u2014including interest rate subsidies and estimated default losses\u2014and all expected payments received by the government over the life of the commitment, discounted by the interest rate on Treasury securities of similar maturity to the loan or guarantee. Reestimation of the cost of loans disbursed or guaranteed in a given year is required over the life of the commitment. This more accurate reporting of credit program costs allows for more efficient allocation of budget resources and improved measurement of these programs\u2019 economic impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Reform Requires Recognition of Estimated Costs When the Government Enters Into a Commitment", "paragraphs": ["Credit reform was significant not only because it changed the budget reporting for credit programs from a cash basis to an accrual basis but also because it prescribed a more prospective form of accrual measurement than required by generally accepted accounting standards used in financial statements prepared prior to credit reform. Traditional accounting standards required the recognition of all losses and expenses incurred during a reporting period, including those that have occurred but have not yet been reported. In other words, a cost would be accrued when it was more likely than not that a borrower had defaulted on his or her loan. In contrast, credit reform requires recognition of the expected costs of new loans and guarantees (on a net present value basis) at the time the credit is extended. This \u201crisk-assumed\u201d approach recognizes the expected cost to the government before the government commits itself to future losses inherent in the credit issued.", "For example, prior to credit reform, if the government decided to provide $3 million in direct loans, the cash budget would have shown an outlay in the first year of $3 million. Repayments by borrowers would be recorded when received in future years, and, when some borrowers defaulted, net payments received by the government would simply be lower. Under traditional accrual accounting no cost would be shown in the first year since repayment is expected, but in subsequent years when some borrowers defaulted, the unpaid principle would be recognized as a cost. Thus, in neither case was the government\u2019s cost recognized correctly at the time the decision was made to authorize the loans. In contrast, using the risk-assumed basis of credit reform, an estimate of the government\u2019s cost would be recorded when the government made the commitment to provide the loans.", "Adopting a full credit reform approach to deposit insurance has one major advantage and one major disadvantage . . . . The advantage is that only the accrual recognition of costs will provide an early warning of financial disaster in the budget. The disadvantage is that estimating the cost of deposit insurance\u2014when cost is incurred\u2014is very difficult.", "OMB also reported that accrual-based budget reporting for deposit insurance could be an improvement over the current approach and outlined specific financial and econometric models that could be used to estimate deposit insurance costs as they arise. OMB recommended that these cost measures be further developed, tested, and validated before deciding whether or how to bring accrual-based estimates into the budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bush Administration Proposed Extending Credit Reform Principles to Insurance Programs", "paragraphs": ["In the President\u2019s fiscal year 1993 budget, less than a year after OMB and CBO reported on the budget treatment of deposit insurance, the Bush administration proposed applying credit reform principles to budgeting for deposit insurance and pension guarantees. Under the proposal, other insurance programs would be moved to an accrual basis the following year. The administration emphasized earlier concerns that cash-based budgeting for insurance programs did not provide clear and timely measurement of their cost to the government. It maintained that budget reporting for these programs on an accrual basis would provide policymakers with the information and incentives necessary to control their costs.", "The similarities between loan guarantees and federal insurance were noted in the administration\u2019s proposal. In both cases the government commits to paying some or all of future costs under specified conditions in exchange for a fee or premium. As with the new treatment of credit programs, the proposal called for the recognition of the government\u2019s cost of new or expanded insurance coverage at the time the insurance is extended. The cost of the risk assumed by the government would be estimated on a net present value basis and would include all expected costs and collections related to the coverage extended. OMB showed estimates of the new accrual-based measures in the budget for deposit insurance and pension guarantees. These measures were based on complex, newly developed estimation methodologies using options pricing models. Legislation to effect the new budget reporting was introduced in the Congress.", "Despite continued concern about the cash basis of reporting for insurance programs, both GAO and CBO objected to the administration\u2019s proposal at the time. GAO affirmed its long-standing support of reporting accrual-based costs in the budget but concluded that the proposal made at that time was flawed. GAO and CBO questioned the sufficiency of available data and estimation methodologies necessary to make reasonably accurate accrual cost estimates. Both agencies expressed concern about the rush to implement a major conceptual and technically challenging change in budget reporting without thorough study. CBO also reported that by changing the way shortfalls in program funding would be financed, the proposal could have increased taxpayer liability for these programs.", "Another major concern surrounding the initiative was the budget treatment of savings stemming from deposit and pension insurance program reforms that were also proposed. On a cash basis, these savings would not have been recognized for several years in the budget, but, by recording their effects on an accrual basis, the administration was able to show savings in fiscal years 1992 and 1993 to offset revenue lost from proposed tax reductions. CBO concluded that the savings achieved by the administration\u2019s program reforms should not be available to pay for other policy initiatives. As a result, most observers viewed the accrual-based budgeting proposal as an accounting gimmick rather than a way to improve budget reporting for insurance programs. The merits of accrual-based reporting for these programs were overshadowed by these concerns. No action was taken by the Congress on the legislation.", "Since the Bush administration\u2019s proposal for changing the budget treatment of insurance programs, OMB has continued work on developing methodologies to estimate the risk-assumed cost of deposit insurance and pension guarantees. At the request of the Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget and because of continued interest in this area, we undertook this study to more thoroughly develop the issues involved in changing the budget treatment of insurance programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget asked us to review the budget treatment of federal insurance programs to assess whether the current cash-based budget provides complete information and whether accrual concepts could be used to improve budgeting for these programs.

Programs included in our study are shown in table 2.1. OMB\u2019s list forms the basis of its annual analysis of credit and insurance programs, which, in recent years, has been part of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the President\u2019s budget. We added one program to the OMB list\u2014the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance program. This program was included by FASAB as federal insurance in its recommended accounting standards for federal liabilities. Of the veterans life insurance programs underwritten by the federal government, we include only those which are still open to new participants.", "In undertaking this study, we acknowledge that there is not universal agreement on which programs constitute federal insurance. The programs we included in our analysis share some, but not necessarily all, the characteristics of private insurance. Conversely, some programs not on our list have some of the characteristics of programs on our list. The diversity of the programs undertaken by the federal government could result in disagreement about what constitutes a federal insurance program. Valid arguments may be made for additions to or deletions from the list of insurance programs to consider for an accrual-based budgeting approach. This is but one of many issues policymakers face in incorporating accrual concepts in the budget.", "To accomplish our objectives, we focused our analysis on the sufficiency of information provided for resource allocation and fiscal policy with the recognition that budget reporting must be understandable and facilitate budget control and accountability. This premise is grounded in the work of the 1967 President\u2019s Commission on Budget Concepts, which stressed that resource allocation and fiscal policy outweigh all other uses of the budget, such as the cash and debt management activities of the Treasury and analyses of the impact of federal activity on the financial markets. To assess the sufficiency of information in the budget for these purposes, we reviewed the programs\u2019 current budget treatment, consulted with budget experts, and analyzed historical data on budgeted and actual insurance outlays.", "To develop approaches for using accrual concepts in the budget and to identify trade-offs among approaches, we began by reviewing the Bush administration\u2019s 1992 proposal to adopt accrual accounting for federal insurance programs. We surveyed existing research on the budget treatment of insurance programs conducted by OMB, CBO, and other budget analysts. We examined various reports and documents pertaining to the accrual-based approach for loan and loan guarantee programs prescribed by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. We studied the accounting standards for insurance activities promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for private sector entities and FASAB for the federal government.", "To identify potential implementation issues, we convened panels of federal insurance agency officials and staff to gather information on the operation of the programs and the agencies\u2019 risk assessment capabilities. We also obtained their views on the potential benefits and drawbacks to the use of accrual-based budgeting. When we could not convene a panel or when key agency personnel were unavailable, we obtained written responses to our questions. We also discussed potential implementation issues with budget experts familiar with the implementation of accrual-based budgeting for credit programs.", "To identify issues related to developing risk-assumed cost estimates, we interviewed agency actuaries, economists, and other staff responsible for risk assessment. We also analyzed documentation supplied by the agencies and prior GAO reports on individual programs. In addition, we retained the services of an independent contractor to assist us in reviewing OMB\u2019s options pricing models for deposit insurance and pension guarantees. As part of the contractor\u2019s review, it assessed the validity of using options pricing concepts and techniques to estimate insurance liabilities, the technical sophistication and data requirements of OMB\u2019s models, and the reliability of OMB\u2019s model estimates for budget and policy decision-making.", "We did not test or validate (1) any of the other estimation methodologies currently used by the agencies for risk assessment or rate-setting or (2) any of the methodologies that could potentially be used for these purposes.", "We performed our work in Washington, D.C., from September 1995 through November 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

From a federal budgeting perspective, these programs present significant challenges because the insured events tend to be catastrophic or volatile in nature and may not occur for years after the government\u2019s commitment is extended. Although several financial measures are available for insurance programs, estimates of the risk assumed by the federal government\u2014the key information for budget decision-making\u2014have been limited. Despite some common elements, these programs vary significantly in several respects, including size, length of the government\u2019s commitment, frequency of activation, and financing. These differences warrant consideration in determining the appropriate budget treatment for these programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Insurance Programs Cover a Wide Variety of Risks", "paragraphs": ["The federal government insures individuals and firms against a wide variety of risks ranging from natural disasters under the flood and crop insurance programs to bank and employer bankruptcies under the deposit and pension insurance programs. Other federal insurance programs provide life insurance for veterans and federal employees and political risk insurance for overseas investment activities. The federal government also provides protection against war-related risks and adverse reactions to vaccinations. Further, in recent years, proposals have called for extending federal insurance activities to cover natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.", "Some federal insurance programs have a statutory intent to provide subsidized coverage while others do not. In some cases, the government subsidizes insurance programs in order to achieve a public policy objective. For example, catastrophic coverage under the crop insurance program is fully subsidized in an attempt to reduce reliance on ad hoc disaster assistance. The Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance Program provides life insurance coverage to veterans with service-connected disabilities based on rates for healthy individuals or free to totally disabled veterans. In other cases, as noted later in this chapter, the federal government may intend to provide unsubsidized insurance. However, regardless of statutory intent, whenever federal insurance is underpriced relative to its long-run cost, those who are insured receive a subsidy because premiums will not cover program costs. Table 2.1 provides an overview of the programs included in our study. More detailed program summaries are provided in the appendixes to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Federal Insurance Programs Complicate Budget Treatment", "paragraphs": ["The budget treatment of federal insurance programs is complicated by the characteristics of the risks covered. In general, these programs assume risks that the private sector has historically been unable or unwilling to undertake. Ideally, individual risks should be independent and of sufficient number to reasonably project losses and adequately pool risk to be insurable. In addition, the occurrence of losses should be accidental or unintentional in nature and capable of being measured. Many of the risks undertaken by the federal government lack these key conditions for ideal insurability. Without these insurable conditions, establishing an actuarially sound rate structure is difficult and the likelihood of adverse selectionand moral hazard increases. From a federal budget perspective, the lack of these insurable conditions presents significant challenges.", "The risks insured by the government are often hard to predict and catastrophic in size. In general, the lack of an actuarial base, an ever-changing environment, and low participation rates make it difficult to assess risk assumed and set premiums commensurate with the risk insured. For example, officials at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) cited the lack of an actuarial base as a factor in the limited availability of private sector political risk insurance. Further, some risks assumed by the federal government are not independent in that losses may strike a large number of insureds at the same time. For example, weather-related events may reduce crop yields over large areas of the nation in the same year. Similarly, changes in macroeconomic conditions may have widespread effects on banks and pension plans covered under the deposit and pension insurance programs.", "Achieving adequate participation to spread risks may also be problematic. For example, our previous work found that the majority of federal crop insurance policies are in the contiguous areas of the Midwest and the Plains States. Similarly, those living in concentrated areas with the greatest risk of flooding are most likely to buy flood insurance while those with lower risk are not. Finally, according to agency officials, the war-risk and political risk insurance programs provide only a limited number of policies covering diverse events with strong individual and case-specific identities.", "The catastrophic nature of these risks and the impediments to broad-based participation reduce the ability of an insurer to pool risk\u2014an important way insurers reduce the costs of bearing risk. When insured events affect a large number of the insured population at the same time, the likelihood that the insurer would have to make large claim payments in a relatively short period of time increases. When there are only a few insured, the insurer is unable to pool risk and thus may be subject to virtually the same uncertainties of random experience as the insured.", "OMB has cited the government\u2019s size and sovereign power as providing it with the unique ability to offer insurance when the private market is unable or unwilling to do so. Some analysts contend that the size of the government makes it better able to absorb large losses if insurance reserves are not sufficient. Over time, by providing ongoing insurance, the government may be able to recoup some of these losses with future premium collections, thus in effect pooling risks over time. In addition, the government can attempt to spread the cost of these risks by providing insurance nationwide and/or mandating participation. Further, some analysts cited the government\u2019s unique status as advantageous in monitoring and mitigating these types of risks. For example, for a community to participate in the flood insurance program, it must enact and enforce minimum flood plain management standards. Similarly, federally insured banks and thrift institutions must adhere to numerous regulations and periodic examinations.", "Whatever the merits of the federal government as an insurer, the same characteristics that inhibit private insurance firms from covering these risks also complicate budgeting for them at the federal level. In some cases, the volatile and/or catastrophic nature of the insured risks make pooling risk and estimating claims on an annual basis difficult, if not impossible. For some programs, such as life and pension insurance, claims may not be expected to occur for years or even decades after the government\u2019s commitment is made. Thus, a key budget consideration is how and when the government\u2019s costs for these programs should be recognized in the budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Information for Budget Decision-making\u2014 the Risk Assumed by the Government\u2014Is Not Readily Available", "paragraphs": ["As a general principle, decision-making is best informed if the government recognizes the costs of its commitments at the time it makes them. However, despite numerous financial measures, in most cases, the expected cost of the government\u2019s insurance commitments is not readily available. Table 2.2 provides several financial measures for the programs in our study including face value, net outlays, liability for claims, and net position. As discussed in the following sections, each of these measures provides useful information but, in most cases, does not adequately capture and isolate the cost of the risk assumed by the federal government at the time the insurance is extended. However, to the extent practicable, the government\u2019s ultimate cost is key information that ought to be considered in making budget decisions.", "Face value represents the total amount of insurance outstanding. For example, the face value of deposit insurance is the total insured deposits held by financial institutions. As such, it provides a measure of the maximum exposure undertaken by the federal government. As shown in figure 2.1 and table 2.3, the face value of federal insurance (in constant dollars) grew substantially between 1975 and 1990. The majority of this increase is attributable to the two largest insurance programs, pension and deposit insurance. For fiscal year 1995, the estimated face value of major federal insurance programs was approximately $5 trillion\u2014more than half of which was deposit insurance. Figure 2.1 shows the trend in the face value of major federal insurance programs.", "While face value provides one measure of program size, it overstates the potential cost to the government. The probable cost to the government is most likely some percentage of the total face value. However, a single fixed percentage cannot be used as a proxy for exposure since the government\u2019s risk varies based on a variety of factors, such as the nature of insured risk and the extent to which premium collections offset costs. Thus, a self-supporting insurance program with a relatively high face value may have a lower potential cost to the government than a subsidized insurance program with lower face value.", "Other financial measures may also be of limited help in assessing the cost of the risk assumed by the government at the time the insurance commitment is extended. For example, the outlays recorded in the President\u2019s budget provide a measure of an insurance program\u2019s estimated and actual annual cash flows but, in most cases, does not capture the government\u2019s cost of insurance commitments at the time they are extended. In addition, cash outlays may be subject to significant volatility due to the irregular and catastrophic nature of some insured risks, such as natural disasters. Chapter 3 discusses in detail the shortcomings of the current cash-based budget reporting for federal insurance programs.", "Further, while the claims liability and net position reported in the financial statements for federal insurance programs provide useful measures of the programs\u2019 financial condition based on insured events that have occurred, these measures do not, in most cases, capture the expected cost of claims inherent in the government\u2019s commitment. In general, the financial statement liability is an estimate of the amount needed to settle unpaid and expected claims related to insured events that have occurred on or before the reporting date. Net position is the difference between an entity\u2019s assets and liabilities.

If the primary objective of the budget is to track annual cash flows, then it is appropriate to record the $1 million cash inflow and to offset the aggregate deficit accordingly, as is currently the case. However, if the objective is to provide information on the government\u2019s cost when program decisions are made then it is appropriate to recognize a net cost of the present value of $2 million in the year the insurance is extended.

In an environment of limited resources, decisions are based on the relative budgetary cost of each potential use. To permit fully informed choices and provide for budget control, the cost for each alternative use of federal resources must be clear and directly related to the commitments undertaken by the government. Full cost information in the budget not only allows policymakers to make relative cost comparisons but can also warn of estimated increases in costs when they are still controllable.

The length of the government\u2019s commitment (policy duration) or the time between the occurrence of an insured event and the payment of claims (the claim settlement period) may extend over several years. In addition, erratic cash flows may result from temporary (working capital) transactions or from the nature and timing of insured events. The different reasons for the time lags between collections and payments among the various insurance programs are important because they influence both the extent to which cash-based budgeting is a deficient measure of program costs and the effectiveness of alternative accrual cost measures in overcoming these deficiencies.", "A mismatch between collections and payments may occur when the government\u2019s commitment extends over multiple years or budget periods. As table 3.1 shows, several federal insurance programs\u2014those offering multiyear fixed term, renewable term, or noncancelable coverage\u2014commit the government for extended periods. For example, OPIC provides multiyear political risk coverage for up to 20 years. In addition, some budget and financial experts view PBGC\u2019s pension guarantee as a long-term, renewable, or noncancelable commitment. In all these cases, the extension of the insurance and the collection of premiums may occur years, even decades, before the insured event occurs and claim payments come due. As a result, there can be years in which an insurance program\u2019s current cash collections are estimated to exceed current cash payments, and the program appears to be profitable regardless of its expected long-term cost to the government.", "Time lags between the occurrence of an insured event and the payment of claims may also result in a mismatch between collections and payments. While some insurance programs pay claims within one or two budget cycles, several do not. For example, during the savings and loan crisis, a number of factors, such as inadequate regulatory oversight and the insurance fund\u2019s lack of cash, delayed action to close failed institutions and pay depositors. A different set of factors create a delay in the pension guarantee program. Benefit payments of terminated plans assumed by the PBGC may not be made for years, even decades, because plan participants generally are not eligible to receive pension benefits until they reach age 65. Once eligible, these benefits are paid over a period of years or even decades. Payment of claim awards under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) may not be made for several years after the injury occurs or not at all. The total time lag is the sum of (1) the time between the occurrence of the adverse event and the filing of a petition for payment, (2) the time taken to reach a judicial decision with respect to the petition, and (3) the time between the decision to grant an award and payment.

During the savings and loan crisis, large temporary cash flows (working capital) resulting from the acquisition and sale of assets from failed institutions distorted the government\u2019s cost for deposit insurance in the cash-based budget. In years that assets were acquired, the full amount of cash required was recorded as an outlay; later, when the assets were sold, the proceeds were recorded as income. As a result, the cash-based budget overstated the cost of the deposit insurance in some years and understated it others.", "The catastrophic or uneven occurrence of some insured events also increases the difficulty in achieving the proper matching of insurance collections and payments on an annual cash flow basis. The focus on annual cash flows generally is not compatible with budgeting for these types of events because it is difficult to estimate the occurrence of the insured events and pool risk on an annual basis. This is true even when it is possible to estimate the long-term expected cost of the program. For example, while it is possible to estimate with a fair degree of accuracy the probability that floods will occur over a considerable number of years, predicting the timing and magnitude of any particular flood by more than a few days is considered impossible. Thus, even if long-term flood losses are correctly estimated, losses in a considerable number of years may deviate significantly from the long-term average.

For decades, the deposit insurance program appeared to provide an efficient and self-financing form of protection. During this period, the program had positive cash flows and reduced the federal budget deficit. Yet, in the 1980s and early 1990s, over 1,600 banks and nearly 1,300 thrifts failed, resulting in direct costs to taxpayers of $125 billion. Although GAO and others raised concerns about these rapidly growing costs, corrective actions were delayed. The cash-based budget was slow to recognize the government\u2019s mounting cost of resolving insolvent institutions because cash outlays were not required until actions were taken to close them and protect depositors. These costs had already been incurred by the time they were disclosed in the budget. Furthermore, the cash-based budget may have also created an incentive to delay closing insolvent institutions (to avoid increasing the annual deficit), which increased the government\u2019s ultimate cost of resolving the crisis. Since the crisis, the condition of the deposit insurance funds has improved dramatically. Once again, the deposit insurance programs appear healthy and are generating budgetary cash income\u2014approximately $8.4 billion for fiscal year 1996\u2014that offset the aggregate deficit.", "In a similar pattern, the cash-based budget did not signal the deteriorating financial condition of PBGC. As shown in figure 3.1, the cash-based budget consistently has reported collections exceeding payments (negative outlays), while the program\u2019s financial statements, which take into account the present value of insured benefits the government has incurred, reported an accumulated deficit. For example, in 1981 when the account containing PBGC\u2019s cash flows was put on-budget, the cash-based budget showed cash income of $29 million while the financial statements showed an accumulated deficit of about $190 million. Over a decade later, in fiscal year 1992, the cash-based budget continued to provide an optimistic picture, showing cash income of $654 million, while the financial statements reported a larger accumulated deficit of about $2.4 billion.", "The cash-based budget has continued to be a poor gauge of PBGC\u2019s financial condition in recent years.

The cash-based budget, however, did not reflect this turnaround. In fact, cash income reported in the budget during this period was, on average, lower than in the previous 4 years when PBGC\u2019s financial condition was deteriorating. Further, despite the improvement in PBGC\u2019s financial condition, OMB\u2019s more prospective estimate of the program\u2019s future cost, included in the Analytical Perspectives of the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 1997 Budget, ranges from $30 to $60 billion.

Accrual-based budgeting would allow for the recognition of future costs at the time commitments are made. However, insurance is dissimilar to loan guarantees in some ways that present additional challenges for cost estimation and budget control. These issues need to be dealt with carefully before accrual-based budgeting can be applied to federal insurance programs. For example, the benefits of accrual-based budgeting depend heavily on whether reasonable cost estimates are currently available or can be developed. In some cases, estimating the risk assumed by insurance programs may be a greater challenge than for some credit programs.", "Accrual-based reporting recognizes transactions or events when they occur regardless of when cash flows take place.

To do this, the budget should provide the information and incentives necessary to assess the future implications of various choices. For federal insurance programs, the information needed for budgeting is roughly analogous to the insurance rate-setting process because the relevant question in assessing the government\u2019s ultimate cost is whether premiums over the long term will be sufficient to cover losses and, if not, what subsidy the government is agreeing to provide. That is, when the federal government decides to undertake the role of the insurer, policymakers need information on the cost of the risk inherent in the government\u2019s commitment.", "The risk-assumed cost measure would provide the prospective information necessary for budget decisions about insurance programs. For insurance programs, risk assumed generally refers to the portion of the full risk premium based on the expected cost of losses inherent in the government\u2019s commitment that is not charged to the insured. As a result, the government\u2019s subsidy cost\u2014the difference between the full-risk premium and actual premiums charged\u2014may be more visible in the budget process. Thus, the use of risk-assumed estimates in the budget would provide the information necessary for assessing the cost of establishing reserves and the ability of an insurance program to pay future losses. This approach is similar to that used under credit reform to measure the cost of direct loans and loan guarantees. However, because of the wide variety of risks covered by federal insurance programs, the risk-assumed concept may be interpreted differently depending on the nature of the program. For example, the time horizon used to estimate the risk assumed by the government under deposit insurance may be shorter than that used to estimate the risk assumed in providing life insurance coverage to federal employees.", "The risk-assumed concept expands upon the standards used for financial statement reporting. Except in the case of life insurance, the risk-assumed concept takes a longer look forward than standards used to recognize insurance liabilities in financial statements. Under standards developed by FASAB, the financial statements for all federal insurance programs must recognize a financial statement liability based on insured events that have been identified by the end of the accounting period. The standard requires recognition of the expected unpaid net claims inherent in insured events that have already occurred, including (1) reported claims, (2) claims incurred but not yet reported, and (3) any changes in contingent liabilities that meet the criteria for recognition. Life insurance programs are required to recognize a liability for future policy benefits in addition to the liability for unpaid claims. This means that except for life insurance, no liability for an insurance cost is recognized in the financial statements until it is probable that a cost has actually been incurred and the amount of the cost can be reasonably estimated. These liability reporting requirements closely parallel the liability reporting requirements for private sector insurance companies and are based on the principles that are essential to support the purposes of financial statement reporting.", "In developing these standards, FASAB also recognized the importance of the risk-assumed measure for federal insurance programs. Because the risk-assumed measure provides important information beyond that included in the financial statement liability, FASAB recommended and the final standards require that this information be disclosed as supplemental information beginning with financial statements for fiscal year 1997.However, concerns about the measurability and the exact nature of some risks assumed by the government dissuaded FASAB from recommending the use of risk-assumed estimates as the basis for liability recognition in the financial statements. Disclosure of risk-assumed estimates provides users with a broader and prospective cost measure that FASAB believes is relevant in assessing whether future budget resources will be sufficient to sustain public services and meet obligations.", "The accrual-based cost measures appropriate for the budget differ from those appropriate for financial statements largely because of differences in the primary purposes of the information, the nature of the federal budget environment, and differences in the acceptable level of uncertainty for financial statements and budget projections. In the past, CBO and OMBhave expressed concerns about the limitations of traditional financial reporting standards for assessing future budgetary costs of insurance programs. Generally speaking, traditional financial statement reporting is of limited use for budget purposes because, in most cases, it does not recognize the potential costs of claims that have not yet been incurred or the present value of future premiums that offsets future budgetary costs. Federal accounting standards requiring supplemental disclosure of an estimate of the risk assumed should improve the recognition of these potential costs in federal financial statements.", "The benefits achieved by budgeting using financial statement liability recognition standards would vary across the insurance programs. The benefits achieved depend primarily on the length of time between the occurrence of insured events and payment of claims. For some programs, the traditional liability recognition standards may yield information not very different from what is currently reported on a cash basis in the budget. However, for programs with long time lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the payment of claims, such as pension and deposit insurance, budgeting based on financial statement liability standards might provide earlier budget recognition of the costs incurred than does cash-based budgeting. In these cases, the earlier recognition could reduce the incentive to delay the payment of claims and would allow for some earlier action to reduce future costs. In most cases, however, this approach would not be as forward-looking as the risk-assumed concept and, therefore, would not provide recognition of the risks inherent in the government\u2019s commitment at the time that the insurance is extended. It is at that time that decisions can be made to change the extent of the risk being assumed by the government. Since the financial statement liability standards generally report costs that have been incurred as the result of past decisions, using that standard for estimating the government\u2019s cost in the upcoming budget year may not provide signals of the government\u2019s risk exposure early enough so as to maximize options available for limiting program costs. This is true because the range of options for changing the program to reduce the government\u2019s costs may be more limited after the cost has been incurred than it would have been when the insurance was extended. Nevertheless, until risk-assumed estimates are fully developed, insurance programs\u2019 financial statements, which are included in the budget appendix, provide policymakers with valuable information on insured events (losses) that are probable and measurable as of a given date and should be considered in budget discussions.", "Table 4.1 compares the potential benefits of accrual-based budgeting using these two cost recognition standards.

Thus, policymakers would be encouraged to examine the underlying benefits and structure of insurance programs before large losses accumulate. Since policymakers are prompted to take action to reduce costs when costs are still controllable, the potential for unintended subsidies may be reduced. For example, according to OMB, the subsidy conveyed by deposit insurance rises with increased exposure, such as an increase in the number of weak institutions, and falls as policies are put in place that effectively limit risk-taking with insured funds. Thus, if properly recognized in the budget, the growing subsidy cost for deposit insurance would have signaled policymakers in the 1980s that thrifts and banks were undertaking greater risks and depending more heavily on deposit insurance guarantees.", "In cases where the Congress intends to provide a subsidy in order to achieve some public policy objective\u2014as is the case for some veterans life insurance programs and the flood insurance program\u2014accrual-based budgeting would prompt recognition of the subsidy cost at the time the coverage is extended.

Unlike cash-based budgeting that delays cost recognition and does not encourage early action to control cost, the earlier cost recognition provided by an accrual basis shifts the budget incentives in favor of reforms aimed at controlling costs. For example, under some accrual-based budgeting approaches, policymakers would be faced with a choice of providing additional government funding to cover shortfalls, raising premiums, or otherwise reducing program benefits to reduce future costs. However, the extent to which budget incentives are changed depends on the nature of the particular insurance program, the accrual-based budgeting approach used, and the extent to which budget recognition leads to choices between additional funding and programmatic changes.

As a result, cost comparisons with programs whose costs are fully reflected on a cash basis will be distorted. Accrual-based budgeting allows for better relative cost comparisons by recognizing the government\u2019s expected costs for insurance commitments at the time decisions are made. For example, for fiscal year 1993, an accrual-based budget would have shown that PBGC had a potential future cost to the government rather than being an income generator as reflected in the cash-based budget.

This would occur because losses for some programs are highly variable from year to year and for other programs may not occur for many years. As a result, when premiums and the government subsidy exceed claim payments, funds could be held in reserve for expected future claims.", "The establishment of reserves may be particularly important given that many of the risks insured by the federal government are catastrophic in size and/or erratic in occurrence. The uneven occurrence of these risks makes estimating funding needs on an annual basis difficult because actual losses in any particular year may vary, in some cases significantly, from the estimated annual cost based on the long-term expected risk. For example, a widespread drought can result in claim payments in a single year to a large proportion of farmers insured under the crop insurance program. Charging premiums sufficient to cover a catastrophic loss in any one year would be prohibitively expensive. As a result, in order for the program to be financially sound, amounts sufficient to cover high or catastrophic losses need to be accumulated over a number of years. Other federal insurance programs, such as life and pension insurance, commit the government to making payments many years in the future. As a result, premiums collected over the duration of the policy must be held in reserve to pay the promised benefits at some future date. If, over time, sufficient reserves are accumulated to pay expected costs, the program would be fully funded.

Under accrual-based budgeting, federal borrowing (or a reduction in other spending) would still be necessary when the insurance fund redeemed its Treasury securities to make cash payments if insurance claims exceeded premiums collected from the public in a given year.

Discerning the economic impact of insurance programs can be difficult, but private economic behavior generally is affected when the government commits to providing insurance coverage and thus lowers the risk to the insureds. Therefore, accrual-based budgeting, which, by recognizing the government\u2019s costs at the time the insurance is extended, would better reflect the timing and magnitude of the economic impact of these programs than the current cash-based reporting of outlays in the budget.

However, it does not appear that the benefits of accrual-based budgeting would be as great for programs that offer short-duration insurance coverage and experience relatively frequent claims, such as crop or flood insurance.

Unfortunately, these probabilities are not known with certainty for most activities more complex than the toss of a fair coin. However, for activities in which data on actual outcomes exist, the underlying probabilities can be estimated based on the law of large numbers. When these conditions are understood and the probabilities of future events can be inferred, estimates are said to be made under the condition of risk. In other words, since the possibility of each outcome can be estimated, the risk undertaken by the insurer can be measured. However, when underlying conditions are not fully understood estimates are made under uncertainty. For most federal insurance programs, this latter case holds due to the nature of the risks insured, program modifications, and other changes in conditions that affect potential losses. Thus, estimating the government\u2019s subsidy cost, including the time period considered, may vary by program out of necessity.", "Complete data on the occurrence of insured events over a sufficiently long period and under similar conditions are generally not available for many federal insurance programs.

FIA officials told us that this model is based on generally accepted actuarial principles and has been used by the agency for years to set premium rates for unsubsidized insurance policies. They told us that the model and its output, however, do not undergo regular external reviews. In addition to the rate-setting methodology, the FIA has worked on developing catastrophic loss estimates that may prove useful in assessing the appropriateness of reserve levels under an accrual-based budgeting approach. As an alternative to the detailed rate-setting model, some budget experts suggested that historical averages\u2014which do not include catastrophic losses unless they have occurred during the chosen experience period\u2014may provide a sufficient basis for measuring the program\u2019s accrual-based costs.", "Flood hazards have several characteristics that are important in considering risk assessment and budgeting for the NFIP. Although the timing and magnitude of floods is considered unpredictable by more than a few days or hours, the probability that they will occur is measurable with a fair degree of accuracy. Flood losses are very predictable in that they occur in well-defined areas and are inevitable in these areas over the long run. However, as noted in chapter 3, the erratic nature of floods can have serious implications for risk assessment and budgeting. A Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) study points out that while most property and casualty insurance is based on realized losses over a period of time, this approach is not applicable to flood insurance because of the highly skewed nature of flooding losses. Rather than following the normal bell-shaped statistical curve, there are many small to moderate floods, some larger floods, and a few extremely large ones. As a result, an average of even a considerable number of years may differ significantly from the true long-term average.", "The NFIP illustrates this point. The NFIP is not actuarially sound even though it has achieved a goal of collecting premium income sufficient to at least cover expenses and expected losses for an average historical loss year. This is because the historical experience period, beginning in 1978, does not include any loss years that can be considered to be of a catastrophic level for the program. As a result, the average historical loss year involves fewer claim losses than the expected per annum claim losses in future years. Thus, the premium income currently collected by the program may not be sufficient to build reserves for potential catastrophic losses.", "Despite this limitation, some budget experts indicated that they thought it acceptable to use historical averages as the basis for measuring the program\u2019s accrual cost in the budget while providing some additional funding mechanism, such as the program\u2019s borrowing authority, to cover catastrophic losses. Funding this amount would allow for the accumulation of reserves during years where losses are less than the historical average. According to the FIA, this level of funding in conjunction with the program\u2019s borrowing authority of $1 billion should be sufficient to cover costs approximately 85 percent to 90 percent of the time. Further, the average historical loss year is not a static measure and could be expected to move toward the long-term average as the experience period increases over time. Nevertheless, if the objective of adopting accrual-based budgeting is to recognize the currently unrecognized government subsidy and/or to accumulate reserves to cover future losses, including catastrophic losses, then the program\u2019s long-term expected cost is the most appropriate measure to use as the basis for measuring the government\u2019s cost in the budget.", "FIA officials told us that they were reasonably confident that the actuarial rate-setting method currently used to establish premium rates for unsubsidized polices could be used to generate reasonable estimates of the expected long-term risk for all policies.

These rates are based on available hydrological data, flood insurance claims and simulations, as well as engineering and actuarial judgment. According to FIA officials, the key components of the method are (1) probability estimates of the frequency with which floods of different severity will occur and (2) estimates of associated structural property damage incurred due to different types of floods. Program expense items, such as administrative costs, are also accounted for in the actuarial rates. These rates are based on actual risk exposures and generally vary according to risk-related features, such as the flood zone, the elevation of the structure, and the amount of insurance purchased.", "As is often the case in modeling, professional judgments and assumptions are necessary to overcome data limitations. For example, the flood histories used to develop the original estimates of the probability of floods of different severity were generally not very long. Consequently, modifications had to be made to prevent statistical bias. In our discussions, FIA officials described the measurement of flood frequency as \u201cgood as the state of the art\u201d but noted that not every area has been studied in depth due to resource constraints. Agency officials said that in these cases, the frequency estimates are based on various histories and statistical analysis which ad hoc studies have shown to yield reliable results. In addition, the original estimates of the structural damage caused by floods of various depths were based on engineering studies and available flood claims. According to agency officials, these estimates are regularly updated with claims data, and credibility analysis is used to check validity. Appendix IV provides a more detailed description of the model and its key data elements.", "According to FIA, additional assumptions and judgments would be necessary if the model were to be used for the entire program because there is currently a lack of information on pre-flood insurance rate map (FIRM) properties. FIA said that a current study on the impact of charging actuarial rates for pre-FIRM properties will be gathering additional information on these properties. Agency officials also noted that a trade-off exists between the benefits of more precise estimates and the cost of making these improvements. While factors such as the frequency of remapping and rezoning may affect the quality of the model\u2019s estimates, the costs of these studies should also be considered. For example, agency officials stated that even if sampling were done to get more precise estimates of the evaluations for pre-FIRM properties, the cost of this type of refinement could outweigh the potential benefits of improved estimates.", "FIA has also done some work on developing catastrophic loss estimates that may be useful in assessing the program\u2019s appropriate reserve levels under an accrual-based budgeting approach. According to FIA, the method used to estimate catastrophic funding levels uses additional statistical analysis and simulations in conjunction with the hydrologic method and is more complex than the actuarial rate-setting method alone. An FIA official estimated that catastrophic reserve levels of $4.5 billion to $5 billion should be sufficient 99.9 percent of the time. In recent years, FIA has been unable to establish reserves and has had to borrow funds from and repay funds to the Treasury to cover excess losses. These estimates of catastrophic reserve requirements were described as orders of magnitude, suitable for program planning purposes, rather than precise estimates. The FIA official explained that the closer the actual reserve funding level gets to the estimated amount, the more important data limitations and underlying assumptions become.", "In summary, FIA has an established method for setting risk-related premiums for its unsubsidized policies. According to FIA, this methodology could be extended to generate risk-assumed estimates for the entire program. In addition, FIA\u2019s work on catastrophic reserve requirements may prove useful in assessing the appropriateness of reserve levels under an accrual-based budgeting approach. However, while this work should provide a useful foundation for developing risk-assumed estimates, FIA indicated that some modifications and refinements would be desirable before these estimates are used for accrual-based budgeting purposes and fully funding a reserve level target.

According to FCIC, the basic rate-setting methodology used by the agency\u2014the loss cost ratio method\u2014is commonly used in the insurance industry. Within agriculture, it is used by the rating bureaus that support the crop-hail insurance industry. Although this methodology could be used as the basis for measuring the program\u2019s cost in an accrual-based budget, several implementation issues stemming largely from the diversity of crop risks and timing differences between the budget cycle, the rate-setting process, and the exposure period would have to be overcome. In addition, some limitations in the methodology\u2019s underlying data and assumptions have been identified. According to the FCIC, internal reviews of the model and its key assumptions are ongoing and an external review of the model by an actuarial firm is underway. This external review should provide additional insights to help evaluate the model\u2019s ability to generate risk-assumed estimates for accrual-based budgeting and identify areas for continued improvement. The last comprehensive review of the methodology was completed in 1983 by the same firm.", "The nature of crop losses makes risk assessment challenging. In prior reports, we have identified inherent problems in the ability to pool and assess the risk of crop losses. Crop losses are not normally independent\u2014some perils are likely to strike a large number of insured farmers in the same crop year. Further, it is difficult to align premium rates directly with risk because the risk associated with growing a particular crop varies by county, farm, and farmer. For example, the risk associated with a particular farmer is influenced by a variety of factors, including farm management practices, soil type, and the productivity of individual tracts of land. Monitoring these individual risks may be neither feasible nor cost-effective. In addition, crop risks are volatile. The performance of any specific crop or any area of the country is subject to wide variations depending on the state of nature. In general, the performance of any particular crop in a county is characterized by relatively infrequent catastrophes of moderate to extreme severity and a number of annual spot losses resulting from noncatastrophic events, such as hail.", "As a result, the program\u2019s rate-setting methodology is complex. To align crop insurance premium rates with the associated risk, FCIC establishes rates that vary by crop, location (county), farm, and farmer. Because of all the combinations involved, literally hundreds of thousands of premium rates are in place. These rates are adjusted annually using a multistep process involving considerable computer analysis and professional judgment. FCIC begins the process each year by looking at crop insurance experience over the past 20 years (if available) for each county and state. On the basis of county and state historical experience, FCIC sets basic rates for each crop in each county at the 65-percent coverage level for average production. These basic rates are adjusted for specific risk classifications including each farming type (such as whether the insured acreage is irrigated or dry land) and for each crop type (such as winter wheat or spring wheat). Using these basic rates, FCIC makes several adjustments to establish rates for other coverage levels and for farmers whose production levels differ from the county\u2019s average. FCIC\u2019s rate-setting methodology is described in more detail in appendix IV.", "FCIC agreed that this methodology could be used to estimate the program\u2019s expected risk but noted that data for detailed rate-setting are not available at the time the budget year submission is prepared. Because the risk of crop damage is closely aligned with specific characteristics of the crop, county, and individual farming practices, detailed information on the composition of coverage extended is necessary to provide projections of the full risk assumed for policies issued in any given year. However, detailed information on the composition and volume of policies and updated premium rates are not available at the time the budget year submissions are made. FCIC said that reasonable projections of insurance coverage can be made on a national scale at a higher level of aggregation, such as by crop type, but considerable uncertainty surrounds more detailed projections of specific policy coverage, such as crop-county combinations. Since estimates based on the actual composition of policies provide a more appropriate measure of the risk assumed, adjustments based on more detailed information may have to be made when the information becomes available.", "According to FCIC\u2019s senior actuary, FCIC currently bases its budget estimate on current year sales data adjusted for several factors, such as projections of commodity prices, planted acres, and anticipated changes in premium rates. He agreed that this more aggregated approach would provide a sufficient basis for an accrual-based budget year estimate, even though the data for detailed rate-setting, including crop/county level data, are not available when the budget submission is prepared. He said that the more detailed rate-setting methodology could subsequently be used to re-estimate the government\u2019s risk for actual policies issued during the year by \u201crepricing\u201d these polices using the full risk premium rates when sufficient information becomes available. The difference between the full risk premium for policies issued and actual premium collections would constitute the government\u2019s subsidy costs for policies issued in a given year. He agreed that the full risk premiums, which take into account specific risk and generally include amounts for catastrophic losses, are probably the appropriate basis for establishing reserves under an accrual-based budgeting approach. Even with this, there are decisions to be made about the confidence placed in these estimates, which\u2014like other risk assessment models\u2014depends on the acceptance of the methodology\u2019s underlying assumptions and data limitations.", "A key assumption of the FCIC\u2019s rate-setting methodology is that the 20-year base period is sufficient to assess the program\u2019s future costs. The FCIC\u2019s senior actuary acknowledged that the appropriate period to use is debatable and that any finite number of years is inadequate to observe all possible states of nature or to assess the probability of each state of nature. He explained that the 20-year rolling average has been used primarily due to concerns about the availability, quality, and applicability of data from the early years of the program.", "Our previous work found that premium rates depend heavily on the number of years included in the experience period and the weight assigned to each year. For example, in 1983 USDA\u2019s consultant suggested changing from the current methodology of giving equal weight to each of the 20 years\u2019 experience to giving greater weight to more recent years\u2019 experience. We found that the consultant\u2019s approach had a significant impact on the premium rates for three crops of the six major crops we reviewed. The USDA consultant is evaluating whether the trend in losses in recent years requires a change in the methodology.", "Another key assumption is that the sample of previous buyers of crop insurance is adequately representative of future buyers. Recent changes in the program have resulted in changes in the characteristics of the buyer population. As such, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the future composition of the insurance portfolio. The model is also based on a number of secondary assumptions. These include the choice of parameters used to (1) allocate basic rates to the various components of risk, such as crop type and planting practice, and (2) adjust the basic rates for different coverage and production levels.", "Our previous work raised concerns about the adjustments made to the basic rate level to arrive at rates for coverage and production levels that differ from those of the basic rate. These adjustments are important because the majority of all crop insurance is purchased at rates for coverage and production levels that differ from those covered under the basic rates. However, our previous work found that these adjustments did not result in rates that are aligned with risk. For example, to set the rates for the 75-percent and 50-percent coverage levels, FCIC applies preestablished mathematical factors to the basic rate. According to our analysis of six major crops, the rates for this insurance were too high at the 75-percent coverage level and too low at the 50-percent coverage level in relationship to the basic rates. FCIC, using a mathematical model that sets rates according to preestablished relationships between production levels, also adjusts the basic rates for production for farmers whose historical production levels are above or below the county\u2019s average. However, as with the varying rates for coverage levels, we found that these adjustments did not result in rates that accurately reflect the risk involved at each production level. In the past, agency officials cited a lack of time and resources as a barrier to revising the formulas applied to the basic rates to calculate these other rates. Currently, however, FCIC and its consultant are reviewing these factors and FCIC anticipates making adjustments in the future. Further, the FCIC noted that these differences may be offsetting in the aggregate and thus may not be as important for budget purposes as for setting individual farmers\u2019 premium rates.", "Additional modeling techniques to aid in assessing the risk of crop losses may become available in the future. For example, FCIC said it is doing some work with multistage econometric models and OMB suggested that options pricing could potentially be used to estimate the risk assumed by the government. However, these methods are only in the conceptual or early stages of development. The FCIC\u2019s senior actuary told us that the alternative models the FCIC is working on may provide useful supplemental information but are not reliable or useful enough for budget purposes. In addition, the use of these methods would require a significant upgrade in staff skills.", "In summary, the FCIC has an established rate-setting method that could serve as the basis for estimating the risk assumed by the government. However, risk assessment for crop insurance is complicated by the variation of risk associated with different combinations of crops, counties, and farming conditions and practices. Detailed information to estimate the risk assumed based on specific characteristics of the insureds is not known at the time of the budget year submission. Therefore, a higher level of aggregation\u2014perhaps similar to what is used for current budget estimates\u2014could be used for the budget year estimates. Reestimates for the risk assumed based on actual polices issued in a particular year could then be achieved by repricing the polices based on the full risk premium when necessary information becomes available.

We found that different estimation approaches produced widely disparate results due in part to heavy reliance on professional judgment in specifying critical assumptions, such as estimates of market value, and the historical period used to project expected future losses.

These include variables related to local and national economic conditions, behavior of regulators and management, and structural changes in the industries. Thus, attempting to predict the future prospects of financial institutions and estimate future losses to the insurance funds is an intrinsically uncertain proposition. In preparing loss estimates, there is no empirical formula for forecasters to follow that would enable them to know with certainty what approach or assumptions can most accurately reflect both present and future conditions and events that can play a significant role in the solvency of a financial institution.

Economic insolvency of a financial institution occurs and costs accrue to the insurance funds when the value of the institution\u2019s liabilities exceeds the market value of its assets. While the value of an institution\u2019s liabilities\u2014primarily deposits\u2014is generally known, the value of its assets\u2014primarily loans\u2014is much more uncertain. Most loss estimation methodologies rely on unaudited financial data that financial institutions are required to report\u2014in call reports\u2014to regulatory agencies. Experience has shown that these data do not always provide an accurate picture of the value of an institution\u2019s assets. For example, in 1991 we reported that asset valuations prepared by FDIC for 39 failed banks revealed $7.3 billion in additional deterioration in asset values (losses) compared to the last quarterly call reports filed by the institutions. As a result, most estimation approaches adjust call report data in an attempt to approximate the market value of an institution\u2019s assets.", "Estimating the market value of an institution\u2019s assets allows for earlier recognition of the government\u2019s deposit insurance losses than does reliance on historical book value measures reported in call reports. However, the use of market-value accounting is still controversial. Market values are not readily available for all categories of bank and thrift assets and liabilities. Analysts are divided over whether market-value accounting is precise enough for financial statements or whether it provides better estimates than book-value accounting. In addition, some models, such as OMB\u2019s, include a closure rule as a policy variable defined in terms of the asset-to-liability ratio of an institution. This variable can (1) be set based on observed behavior of regulators in a given period or (2) reflect prompt closure as mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.

A brief overview of options pricing theory is provided in figure 5.1. OMB\u2019s deposit insurance model has two distinct components.

For assets for which there are efficient, well-developed markets, such as stocks, bonds, agricultural commodities, and foreign currencies, this assumption is not problematic. However, the value of a financial institution\u2019s assets is not readily observable or measurable. Although stocks of the very largest banks are traded actively, adequate market value data are not available for the many smaller and non-publicly-traded institutions. As such, the unavailability of market value data on bank and thrift assets is a limitation of OMB\u2019s options-based approach to estimating deposit insurance costs. In order to calculate the government\u2019s cost for insuring all institutions, OMB uses call report data to estimate the market value and volatility in the rate of return of bank and thrift assets.", "OMB\u2019s use of estimated asset values and its method for calculating these estimates have been criticized. Some financial economists we spoke with questioned the practical application of options theory in the absence of observable and measurable market data that are generally available in more common uses of options theory. The use of an estimate of asset values is problematic because it may introduce measurement errors if the input data are not unbiased and efficient estimates of market value. The lack of an explicitly stated and observable exercise price of the option makes it difficult to determine when the option would be exercised. In the OMB model, the exercise price\u2014economic insolvency\u2014is expressed as a ratio of an institution\u2019s estimated assets and liabilities. The valuation of assets and liabilities is often difficult and depends on the measurement basis used, thus identifying the timing of when a firm\u2019s liabilities exceed its assets can be problematic.", "Other financial economists argue that the lack of observable and measurable market value data for many financial institutions makes the use of call report data to infer market values a reasonable approach. OMB bases its estimate of market value on an institution\u2019s current cash flowfrom call report data and a set of econometrically determined variables. This approach, however, has been criticized because cash flows are very sensitive to business cycles, which may result in overestimating or underestimating the market value of an institution. Furthermore, in estimating the cash flows for individual banks, OMB divides all banks into four groups and estimates parameters, such as cash flow volatility and loan chargeoffs, for each group. These group parameters are applied to individual bank earnings in order to project future cash flows. This introduces correlation among banks in each of the groups when none in fact may exist. The limitations of OMB\u2019s asset valuation process were evident from its initial estimates of the parameters, which implied a negative net worth for all banks. This occurred because the estimation period included a banking recession. To correct for this, OMB adjusted its estimates of market values using stock market data on the largest publicly traded bank holding companies.", "The OMB deposit insurance model has also been criticized because it does not explicitly take into account interest rate risk. The profitability of banks, thrifts, and credit unions is heavily dependent on both short- and long-term interest rates. The OMB model implicitly incorporates interest rate risk and other risks that affect an institution\u2019s profitability through assumptions made about asset value and volatility of asset earnings. However, the financial economists we consulted with suggested that because of the importance of interest rates to the financial health of a depository institution, explicit modeling of interest rates would be desirable. Some recent research in the options pricing area incorporates interest rate risk in an options pricing framework to estimate the government\u2019s deposit insurance liability.", "Another concern raised by experts is the sensitivity of the deposit insurance cost estimates generated by OMB\u2019s model to changes in key assumptions and parameters. Although the sensitivity of a model\u2019s output to changes in parameter values is not necessarily a negative attribute of a model, it heightens the need for unbiased assumptions and parameter estimates. For example, insurance cost estimates generated by OMB\u2019s model are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the future value of financial institutions\u2019 assets. Two key assumptions affecting estimates of future asset values are asset volatility and mean-reversion of earnings.Analysis of OMB\u2019s model using alternative values for these assumptions produced significant changes in the estimated cost of deposit insurance. Using an Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) estimate of mean-reversion reduced the government\u2019s estimated 5-year accrued costs by 49 percent compared to the estimated cost using OMB\u2019s assumptions. Using OTS estimated standard deviation of thrift assets increased the estimated 5-year cost by 56 percent. The differences in assumptions made by various financial institution experts and the resulting impact on the cost estimates demonstrates that additional research on the appropriate assumptions and parameter values is desirable.", "Cost estimates generated by OMB\u2019s deposit insurance model are also highly sensitive to initial period financial data on depository institutions. OMB\u2019s model uses only the most recent four quarters of data on an institution\u2019s earnings to estimate its market value. The model projects the existing financial condition of institutions into the future and does not account for wide swings in the general financial health of the industry. As a result, input data from relatively good economic times will tend to underestimate future costs, while input data from an economic downturn will overestimate future costs. For example, using financial data from 1992, a recessionary year, the OMB model estimated that in 1994 the government would assume liabilities of $51 billion from failed banks with the cost to the government being a percentage of this amount. Actual liabilities from failed banks in 1994 were approximately $1 billion.

Some banking agency officials expressed concern that the complexity of OMB\u2019s model made it difficult to replicate and analyze the reliability of the cost estimates. On the other hand, an official at another banking agency stated that the concept of accrual-based budgeting makes sense given that once the government extends the insurance it has already accrued a cost.

Estimates are thus highly sensitive to analysts\u2019 choice of the variables used and the grouping of institutions by these variables. Transition matrix models, a variation of actuarial models, implicitly incorporate more information into loss estimates by using regulatory ratings of financial institutions to estimate the probability of resolution for different categories of institutions. Regulators assign financial institutions a rating to reflect their financial and operating condition, determined through on-site examinations and examiners\u2019 assessment of risk.

These types of approaches are limited in that they are very data intensive, relying heavily on call report data and other data not readily available for all institutions. For example, some asset mark-down approaches attempt to discount the cash flows of several categories of an institution\u2019s assets and liabilities over their expected lives. In addition to detailed call report data, this process requires information, such as the maturity or duration of different types of loans, differences between loan contract and market interest rates, and expected prepayments.

In OMB\u2019s pension model, the government\u2019s guarantee is treated as giving the owners of a firm the option to transfer the pension plan liabilities to PBGC when the firm becomes insolvent. This is similar to the concept used by OMB for estimating the cost of deposit insurance. However, since the cost to the government for the pension guarantee is contingent on the financial conditions of both the pension plan and the plan\u2019s sponsoring firm, OMB\u2019s pension model specifies a probabilistic process for deriving the future value of both the pension plan\u2019s and the sponsoring firm\u2019s assets and liabilities.", "OMB\u2019s options pricing model for estimating the government\u2019s cost of pension guarantees requires certain modifications and assumptions that go beyond common applications of options theory. In most applications of options pricing, the time to expiration of the option is typically short. As such, assuming that the value of assets, liabilities, or interest rates will change at a constant rate over time is not problematic. However, for pension insurance, the duration of the option is long, making such standard assumptions unrealistic. For example, the OMB model assumes that the value of a firm\u2019s assets will vary in the future but always at the same rate. This assumption is important in determining the future value of firm and pension assets and, ultimately, the value of the option and the government\u2019s cost. Experts with whom we consulted pointed out that common applications of options pricing for long-lived options typically use probabilistic functions, which allow for large changes in asset values. Thus, the OMB model potentially could be improved by specifying a probabilistic process that would allow greater volatility in future asset values. PBGC officials also noted that OMB\u2019s model does not take into account Internal Revenue Code rules that specify minimum and maximum pension plan funding that may dampen actual volatility in the growth of pension plan assets.", "Modifications to the OMB model with regard to its treatment of interest rates could strengthen its estimation capability. The values of pension liability are dependent on prevailing and future interest rates because these liabilities are due in the future. The assumption that future interest rates are determined today, as assumed in OMB\u2019s model, will cause inaccuracies\u2014especially in a long-term estimate. The experts that we consulted also recommended that since interest rate risk has significant implications for pension liabilities, a separate recognition of interest rate risk within the OMB model should be considered. Modeling variations in future interest rates using an appropriate probabilistic process would introduce variation in a firm\u2019s future pension fund liabilities and potentially improve estimates of the government\u2019s liability.", "Sensitivity analysis performed on the OMB model demonstrated that assumptions about how much the value of firm and pension plan assets will vary over time have significant impact on the model estimates. For example, PBGC\u2019s net liability decreased 80 percent when the volatility of a firm\u2019s assets assumed by OMB was cut in half. When volatility estimates derived by other researchers were plugged into the model, the government\u2019s estimated net liability dropped by 92 percent. Such significant differences in the model estimates indicate that additional research on key model parameters and assumptions should be undertaken. Other parameter assumptions, such as the level of net worth at bankruptcy, have also been questioned and should be grounded in empirical research.", "In addition to the modifications described previously, additional research and development would be necessary before estimates from OMB\u2019s model could be used for accrual-based budgeting. In its current form, the OMB model only generates an estimate of the government\u2019s cost of pension insurance over an indefinite period. In order to use this cost estimate in an annual budget context, a methodology to amortize the cost on a yearly basis is necessary.", "In discussing OMB\u2019s model with PBGC officials, concerns about the complexity of the model were raised. Even though OMB\u2019s research has been published, and officials have been open in providing researchers access to the model, PBGC\u2019s chief economist characterized the OMB model as a black box. He noted that the model is too complex for most analysts and economists to fully understand and does not provide an intuitive understanding of the factors influencing the government\u2019s cost. In part, these concerns led PBGC to pursue a simulation-based approach to model the financial condition of its insurance program under a range of economic scenarios.

PBGC believes that its simulation approach is a better tool for policy analysis than OMB\u2019s options pricing model, but agency officials we spoke to were divided over its use for accrual budgeting. OMB has indicated that it would like insurance program agencies to have responsibility for developing accrual-based budget estimates and views PBGC\u2019s PIMS research efforts as a step in that direction.", "Opinions about the usefulness of PIMS for accrual-based budgeting purposes differ. PBGC\u2019s chief economist expressed concern about using PIMS or any model for accrual-based budgeting purposes. He said that the future expected cost of PBGC\u2019s pension insurance is very sensitive to changes in key assumptions. For example, he said using interest rate experience from the period 1926 to 1991 produces a considerable change in the expected cost compared with using the experience of the 1970 to 1991 period. Although the information provided by different simulations is very useful for policy analysis, he does not think it is stable enough for budgeting or accounting. The chief economist suggested that some of his concern could be alleviated if assumptions were set by a neutral body to minimize the potential for manipulation of the cost estimates.", "PBGC\u2019s chief actuary stated that actuaries look for the best estimate and not the \u201cright\u201d number.

Political risks are subject to many variables that are inherently difficult to predict, such as the political stability of governments, long-term macroeconomic conditions, changes in future foreign relations, or the acceptability of a given project or industry to the host country. Thus, a risk for one industry may not be relevant for another industry in the same country. Further, because there is a lack of empirical evidence, assessment of the potential implications of various events and conditions is based on primarily subjective evaluation. An OPIC official stressed that there can be considerable uncertainty surrounding the business environment and other factors that influence the risk associated with a particular project. For example, agency officials stressed that many of the countries covered by OPIC do not have an extensive history of private sector development and economic reform programs that would be necessary to develop a useful model.

The government\u2019s accrual-based subsidy cost for an insurance activity would be recorded in the program account while all other cash flows would be handled in a separate financing account.

Since most insurance programs are mandatory, this appropriation would occur automatically unless additional control mechanisms, as discussed previously, were adopted.

As a result, under this approach, the insurance program would increase the budget deficit by $4 billion rather than reducing it by $2 billion, as was the case on a cash basis.", "Without fundamentally changing the nature of most federal insurance spending, the aggregate outlay approach is the most comprehensive of the three approaches outlined and has the greatest potential to achieve many of the conceptual benefits of accrual-based budgeting. The isolation and recognition of the government\u2019s full cost when budget decisions are being made would permit more fully informed resource allocation decisions. By recognizing the government\u2019s cost in the budget deficit at the time decisions are made, the incentives for managing insurance costs may be improved. Furthermore, recognizing costs in net outlays and the deficit at the time insurance commitments are made would better reflect their fiscal effects. In some cases, such as for the deposit insurance programs, accrual-based budgeting using the aggregate outlay approach may smooth spending patterns and reduce cost distortions created by temporary or sporadic cash flows.", "Despite these potential advantages, the aggregate outlay approach has several disadvantages. A primary concern is the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of the risk assumed by the federal government for federal insurance programs. To the extent that estimates are unreliable, resource allocation may be distorted and the potential for manipulation increased. As discussed in chapter 5, risk-assumed cost estimates for most insurance programs are either currently unavailable or not fully accepted and thus the uncertainty surrounding these estimates presents a key obstacle to the successful implementation of this approach. In addition, the aggregate outlay approach adds a layer of complexity to an already complex budget process. As was the case with credit reform, the use of accrual-based budgeting for federal insurance programs will result in new complexities and implementation challenges.", "Further, unlike the majority of programs covered under credit reform, most federal insurance spending is classified as mandatory under BEA. As discussed above, under BEA for mandatory programs, only legislated changes that increase the level of the government\u2019s commitment would have to be offset by spending reductions or revenue increases. Increases in existing spending for mandatory federal insurance programs would not require action to address these costs, but the inclusion of accrued costs in the deficit calculation may provide more incentive to address them than the aggregate budget authority approach. Figure 6.7 summarizes the key advantages and disadvantages of the aggregate outlay approach. If additional budget control is desirable, a discretionary appropriation could be required to fund the government\u2019s accrued subsidy cost unless other corrective action is taken.

As noted previously, earlier cost recognition under any of the three general approaches would not necessarily mean that action would be taken to address costs. In fact, the supplemental approach may have little, if any, effect on budget decision-making. The extent to which earlier cost recognition under the other two general approaches prompts action to address accruing cost depends primarily on whether the program has permanent budget authority and is classified as mandatory spending. Since most insurance programs have permanent budget authority and are classified as mandatory, even the most comprehensive general approach\u2014the aggregate outlay approach\u2014would not necessarily require any action to be taken without the adoption of additional budget control mechanisms. It would, however, make more visible any increase in costs.", "While earlier reporting of accrual-based costs in net outlays and the budget deficit might prompt deficit reduction efforts, nothing in the current budget process would require that the cost of insurance programs specifically be addressed as long as permanent authority was available to cover these costs. The earlier recognition would, however, increase control over legislated changes that increase future costs because, under PAYGO, legislation enacted during a session of the Congress affecting mandatory programs must be at least deficit neutral in the aggregate. Under both the budget authority and outlay approach, mechanisms could be developed to increase the link between earlier cost recognition and budget control. For example, requiring the accrued cost to be funded by discretionary appropriation would increase budget control because these costs would be forced to compete for limited resources under the discretionary spending caps. Alternatively, mechanisms that link funding shortfalls to premium increases or program coverage reductions could also be adopted.", "Whether it is desirable for cost recognition automatically to trigger congressional action is a policy question. Consideration of the varied purposes and characteristics of these programs should inform the discussion on whether to adopt a trigger mechanism, and if so, how to design it. For example, requiring a discretionary appropriation would result in a fundamental change in the nature and operation of the majority of federal insurance programs that were originally classified as mandatory spending. The various approaches reflect trade-offs between changing budget incentives and other policy considerations. Table 6.2 provides an assessment of the relative potential of each approach to influence budget decision-making.", "In summary, the supplemental approach would improve and provide more consistent disclosure of estimates of risk-assumed costs in the budget documents than is currently the case and might cause discussion, but it would not directly influence the budget incentives for these programs. The aggregate budget authority approach goes a step further and begins to incorporate accrual-based costs into the budget process by requiring the provision of budget authority at the time decisions are made. However, because accrual-based costs do not affect the \u201cbottom line\u201d or the budget deficit, the impact of this approach on budget decision-making is unclear. The aggregate outlay approach goes even further by incorporating costs directly into the deficit calculation and therefore is more likely to influence budget decisions than the aggregate budget authority approach. But direct budget control is not achieved for the majority of federal insurance programs, which are classified as mandatory spending. Under either the aggregate budget authority or the aggregate outlay approach, requiring a discretionary appropriation for the government\u2019s subsidy costs would provide direct budget control.", "As shown in table 6.2, the aggregate outlay approach and the two approaches using a discretionary control option are most likely to prompt action to address accruing program costs. However, under current budget rules, the incentives provided by each differ. Requiring a discretionary appropriation under the aggregate outlay approach would have the most influence on budget decision-making by affecting both the deficit and the discretionary spending caps. Under the aggregate budget authority approach with a discretionary control option, cost would have to be included under the discretionary spending caps but would not affect the deficit.

The key argument is that since the primary focus of the budget debate is the deficit, accrual-based reporting will not significantly influence budget decisions unless these costs are part of the deficit calculation. The use of a financing account to separate costly transactions and noncostly cash flows focuses reporting on the government\u2019s subsidy cost. And, in the opinion of some budget experts, this increases the difficulty of diverting to other uses the funding accumulated as reserves.", "The aggregate budget authority approach reflects both general concerns about the use of the nonbudgetary financing mechanisms and specific concerns that the aggregate outlay approach may not be necessary for some federal insurance programs. Despite the potential benefits of accrual-based information, a key reservation surrounding the adoption of the aggregate outlay approach is its use of nonbudgetary financing accounts. As a general point, some experts believe that all cash transactions should be included in the budget totals and that cash is a superior measure for the deficit because it is understandable and relatively transparent. Specifically, concerns have been expressed that the use of nonbudgetary financing accounts introduces new risks and may increase the incentive for cost manipulation. For example, estimates could be manipulated to obscure the potential program costs or the deficit if estimation methodologies are not widely accepted and documented. The uncertainty surrounding the risk-assumed cost estimates for some insurance programs increases these concerns. Thus, until estimation techniques are developed sufficiently to allay most of these concerns, the aggregate budget authority approach may be the most appropriate way to implement accrual-based budgeting for federal insurance programs.", "In addition, some agency officials, budget experts, and analysts expressed concerns that the use of the aggregate outlay approach would increase the complexity of the budget reporting. According to some budget experts, budget authority and obligations are more appropriate than outlays for recognizing potential costs that have not yet materialized and that for some programs the costs of implementing the aggregate outlay approach would outweigh the potential benefits. Budget experts also differ on the use of discretionary spending mechanisms to increase budget control. One budget expert emphasized that requiring a discretionary appropriation for subsidy costs under the budget authority approach would increase budget control while preserving cash-based reporting of outlays and the deficit. However, other budget experts cautioned against changing the fundamental nature of mandatory federal insurance spending by requiring a discretionary appropriation under either the budget authority or outlay approach. For example, OMB has stressed that the goal of its previous proposal was not to change the nature of the spending but rather to improve the budget reporting for these programs.", "Finally, the supplemental approach reflects the view that cash is the superior measure for budget decision-making or that the shift to accrual-based budgeting for federal insurance programs is premature or unnecessary. A key argument is that supplemental information can be used to improve budget decisions without subjecting the budget to any additional uncertainty or complexity. However, with this approach, there is no guarantee that the information will be used since it is not a part of the formal budget process.", "Any choice among these approaches or variants of them is further complicated by the fact that the relative implementation difficulties\u2014and the benefits achieved\u2014vary across federal insurance programs.

However, as discussed, this earlier recognition of program cost is dependent upon reasonable, unbiased estimates of the risk assumed by the government in undertaking the insurance commitment.

Although estimates may get more accurate over time due to improvements in estimation methodologies, available data, and assumption specification, some error will always remain.

As discussed in earlier chapters, the nature of the risks covered by some federal insurance programs require that the risks be pooled over time. As a result, the expected long-term cost of the program reflected in the risk-assumed cost estimates will differ from the cash paid out in any given year. Reestimates will probably also be required over time if the program\u2019s claim experience differs significantly from the previously calculated expected long-term cost. Improved program data could also lead to reestimates.", "The uncertain nature of risk-assumed cost estimates must be weighed against potential improvements in budget reporting and cost control. A similar trade-off was made in budgeting for credit programs under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Although the accrual-based cost estimates of some loan and loan guarantee programs have significantly changed and their actual cost may not be known for 20 or more years, most budget experts believe that the budgeting for these programs has been improved. Specifically, by improving information and the recognition of program costs, accrual-based budgeting for credit programs has increased control over credit program costs, improved comparisons of the costs of credit program with that of other programs, and subjected credit programs to the competitive allocation of resources in the budget process. An accrual-based budgeting approach for insurance programs also has the potential to provide an opportunity to consider the appropriate or desired amount of government funding\u2014or subsidy\u2014provided to a particular program. Risk-assumed cost estimates would also allow policymakers, oversight agencies, and program managers to monitor the government\u2019s risk exposure and to take timely steps to control program costs.", "Uncertainty in the estimation of insurance program costs must be evaluated in terms of the direction and magnitude of the estimation errors. For budgeting purposes, decisionmakers would be better served by information that is more approximately correct on an accrual basis, than they are by cash-based numbers that are exactly correct but misleading. For example, industry analysts estimated that the accruing liabilities of insolvent thrift institutions exceeded the resources of the insurance fund in the early 1980s, years before the full magnitude of losses began to be recognized on a cash basis in the budget. Although estimates of the growing cost of the savings and loan crisis were not exact, the magnitude of the estimated losses proved to be correct. At the same time, the President\u2019s budget request for the insurance fund prior to its collapse in 1989 estimated that cash collections would exceed cash losses in all but one year in the 1980s. Despite the uncertainty in the estimates of the government\u2019s accruing cost\u2014the exact cost of the savings and loan crisis is still not known with complete certainty\u2014policymakers would have had better budgetary information and incentives for decision-making if the budget had reported such accrual-based estimates.", "A key implementation challenge in adopting accrual-based budgeting for insurance programs is the difficulty in producing risk-assumed cost estimates. Although analogous to the implementation of credit reform, the estimation challenges for some insurance programs may be greater than those faced for most credit programs. For example, the cost of the government\u2019s deposit and pension insurance commitments is dependent upon the ability to model complex interrelationships among highly uncertain variables such as interest rates, market risks, and the solvency of private companies. Estimation uncertainty will dictate continual evaluation of the risk estimation methodologies used to generate risk-assumed cost estimates for federal insurance programs.", "For two programs in our study\u2014Aviation War-Risk and Maritime War-Risk insurance\u2014the uncertainty in the risk-assumed cost estimates and other implementation complexities probably outweigh the potential benefit from an accrual-based budget treatment.

For example, an amortization process must still be developed and tested to take the total estimated cost to the government of pension insurance commitments generated by OMB\u2019s model and convert it to an annual basis for budgeting. Modifications that are likely to be necessary to adapt the flood and crop insurance premium rate-setting models for use in generating risk-assumed cost estimates for the budget will also require time and resources.

Some agency officials we spoke with expressed concern about their ability to generate such estimates given current staff resources.", "In implementing credit reform, we found that agencies experienced difficulty accurately estimating accrual-based cost estimates for three principle reasons: (1) future economic conditions are uncertain, (2) the government often is the lender of last resort, making it difficult to judge the risk, and (3) agencies\u2019 historical data were nonexistent or unreliable.These same factors will complicate estimating risk-assumed cost estimates for insurance programs. In addition, differences between insurance commitments and loan guarantees will add to the complexity of generating accrual cost estimates for insurance programs. Unlike most credit programs which are limited by discretionary appropriations, the majority of insurance programs are mandatory and thus are not limited to a specific amount of insurance. Estimation is therefore complicated by the need to forecast demand for insurance\u2014for example, the number of farmers opting for crop insurance coverage or the amount of deposits flowing into banks as opposed to other investment opportunities.", "Improvements in the estimation of the government\u2019s cost of insurance extended can be expected if accrual-based budgeting is adopted for these programs. Advocates of accrual-based budgeting point to the credit reform experience and argue that requiring estimates of the full cost of insurance programs in the budget would provide the incentive necessary to improve the quality of the estimates. For example, in response to credit reform reporting requirements, the Small Business Administration (SBA), in conjunction with OMB, recently completed an extensive analysis of its loan records dating back to fiscal year 1983. Prior to this study, SBA had been unable to validate its subsidy estimates or provide reestimates as required by credit reform. As a part of this analysis, SBA developed a model which allows it to take into account various loan and borrower characteristics in its subsidy estimates. Refined estimates of historical default and recovery rates were used to generate fiscal year 1997 budget estimates and reestimate prior year subsidy estimates.", "The accuracy and reliability of estimates will also improve as a result of refinements in methodologies and the collection of additional data on program experience. For example, OMB has made several refinements to its deposit insurance model since it first applied options pricing theory to estimate the accruing costs of the program in 1990. The availability of data necessary for estimating accrual costs for some programs should improve over time, which in turn should improve the reliability of the risk-assumed cost estimates. For example, in its model for estimating costs of thrift deposit insurance, OMB has used data from small commercial banks to estimate various parameters. Although significant differences exist between bank and thrift institutions, the data OMB needed for its model do not exist for thrifts before 1990. Data available since 1990 are biased due to the recovery of the thrift industry during this period after the savings and loan crisis. As thrift data encompassing periods of both economic growth and contraction become available, OMB will be able to incorporate them into its thrift deposit insurance model. Similarly, risk assessment for the National Vaccine Injury Compensation program has been hampered by the relatively short existence of the program. Claims from 1989, the program\u2019s first year of operation, have not all been settled.

OPIC officials stressed that the tools necessary to recognize insurance program costs already exist within the current budget process.

In general, for credit programs, the large volume of loans or guarantees issued in any single year allows for sufficient diversification of risk and permits reserves to be set aside for each annual \u201cbook of business.\u201d These reserves are reestimated annually over the life of each book of business.", "Establishment of program reserves sufficient to cover the long-term cost of the insurance extended will take time and involve significant program funds.

On the other hand, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) stated that when the flood insurance program began to accumulate reserves in the late 1980s, the Congress used the surplus to fund flood studies, flood plain management, and program salaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reestimation and Funding Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["Periodic reestimation of the expected cost of the government\u2019s insurance commitments will be necessary. Upward reestimates of the cost of the risk insured should be reflected in premium rates for new insurance commitments and/or the government\u2019s subsidy. More complicated will be the funding of increases in the estimated costs of outstanding insurance commitments. Under credit reform, agencies are given permanent, indefinite authority to cover upward reestimates of the government\u2019s costs related to credit commitments made in prior years. The architects of credit reform contend that this authority is necessary to encourage unbiased cost estimates and because some factors that affect costs\u2014such as the economy\u2014are beyond an agency\u2019s control. Agencies are required to incorporate the factors that prompted a reestimation into the estimates of future subsidy costs. Conversely, some budget experts contend that the provision of permanent authority has created the potential for bias in original estimates since funding for any additional cost is provided automatically outside the appropriation process.", "The nature of the government\u2019s insurance commitment and the sensitivity of the largest insurance programs\u2014deposit and pension insurance\u2014to fluctuations in interest rates and general business conditions may make limiting the costs of reestimates and funding shortfalls difficult. Most federal insurance programs are open-ended, providing as much insurance as demanded. Unlike most federal credit programs in which the number of loans or loan guarantees can be specified and funding provided, it is neither practical nor desirable to directly limit insurance coverage\u2014for example, by limiting the number of children vaccinated or the vesting of pension benefits. Thus, in changing the budget treatment of these programs, consideration must be given to the impact changes may have on the programs\u2019 operations.", "The Bush administration\u2019s 1992 accrual budgeting proposal would have required the Congress to provide a mandatory appropriation when an insurance program\u2019s costs exceeded its available resources on an accrual basis. The administration argued that, given the nature of the insurance commitments and their current budget treatment, this would have only explicitly authorized what was implicit under existing law. Other methods of handling shortfalls in a program\u2019s funding could be considered. For example, a funding shortfall could trigger a premium increase unless the Congress acted to implement program reforms aimed at reducing program costs. Alternatively, premium increases or program coverage reductions could be implemented if reserves fell below certain specified levels. The impact on program participants could be mitigated by spreading the premium increase over several years.", "Additional control mechanisms must be carefully designed or they could risk increasing overall costs to the government due to program interactions. For example, if a funding shortfall were to develop in the flood insurance program leading to a premium increase, this could cause participation in the program to fall. Ultimately, diminished participation could potentially lead to increased future costs to the government in the form of disaster relief."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previously Accumulated Program Deficits", "paragraphs": ["Some federal insurance programs that provide coverage for an extended or indefinite period of time, such as the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance program, currently report program deficits as measured under traditional accounting standards.

How costs incurred prior to conversion to accrual-based budgeting should be treated would have to be determined.", "Several options exist for the reporting and funding of these costs. If estimates of the accrued costs at conversion can be made, under an accrual outlay approach these costs could be reported as a separate line in the program account. If the information necessary to estimate the future cash flows resulting from the previously accrued costs is unavailable or if the population insured changes significantly from year to year, a separate liquidating account could be used. If a liquidating account is used, funding of accrued costs could remain on a cash basis and simply be paid as claims come due.

Under an accrual outlay approach, premium income would flow into the financing account and an amount would be transferred to the program account to cover administrative costs. The reported cost to the government would be zero. If a program is not self-supporting, an appropriation to the program account to cover administrative costs would be required.

As such, the budget should clearly reflect the financial consequences of decisions made and provide the information and incentives necessary to assess the future implications of these choices. The current cash-based budget, however, generally provides incomplete and misleading information on the cost and fiscal impact of federal insurance programs. The use of accrual concepts in the budget for these programs has the potential to better inform budget choices. However, technical and practical challenges exist which will require careful and deliberate consideration in the design and implementation of an accrual-based budgeting approach for insurance programs.", "Cash-based budgeting for federal insurance programs is limited for resource allocation and fiscal policy decisions because its focus on single-period cash flows does not usually reflect the government\u2019s cost at the time the decisions are made to provide insurance coverage. The cash-based budget may misstate the cost of the government\u2019s insurance commitments in any particular year because the time between receipt of program collections, the occurrence of an insured event, and the final payment of a claim can extend over several budget periods. As a result, current and future resource allocations may be distorted. Cash budgeting also is generally not an accurate gauge of the economic impact of federal insurance. While these shortcomings of cash-based budgeting exist for all insurance programs, the degree to which cash-based information is misleading varies significantly across programs.", "The use of accrual-based budgeting for federal insurance programs has the potential to overcome a number of the deficiencies of cash-based budgeting. Accrual-based reporting would recognize the cost of the insurance commitment when the decision is made to provide the insurance, regardless of when cash flows occur. This earlier recognition of the cost of the government\u2019s commitment would (1) allow for more accurate cost comparisons with other programs, (2) provide an opportunity to control costs before the government is committed to making payments, (3) build budget reserves for future claims, and (4) better capture the timing and magnitude of the impact of the government\u2019s actions on private economic behavior. The degree to which accrual-based measures would improve cost recognition in the budget for insurance programs will vary based on the size and length of the government\u2019s commitment, the nature of the insured risks, and the extent to which costs are currently captured in the budget. Further, whatever the conceptual benefits of risk-assumed cost measurement, the effective implementation of accrual-based budgeting on this basis is dependent on the ability to generate reasonable unbiased estimates of these costs.", "In the past, concerns over the limitations of cash-based budgeting and the benefits of a shift to accrual-based budgeting have been driven by the financial condition of the two largest programs\u2014deposit and pension insurance. These two programs remain central to the argument for accrual-based budgeting for insurance programs. The size of these programs in relation to total federal spending, and therefore their potential to distort resource allocation and fiscal policy, make the limitations of cash-based budgeting and the benefits of accrual-based budgeting more pronounced. The case for using accrual-based budgeting for other federal insurance programs varies in strength. Their smaller size and the degree to which cost information is currently considered by policymakers reduce to a varying degree the extent to which information and incentives would be improved under an accrual-based budgeting approach.", "The ability to generate reasonable, unbiased estimates of the risk assumed by the government is critical to the successful implementation of accrual-based budgeting for insurance programs. As described in this report, the development and acceptance of estimation methodologies varies considerably across programs. The characteristics of the risks insured by the federal government, frequent program modifications, and the absence of sufficient data on possible losses have hampered the development of risk-assumed estimates. The use of risk-assumed estimates in the budget will require the refinement and adaptation of existing models and, in some cases, the development of new methodologies. Because risk-assumed estimates for the various insurance programs have not been produced and reported on a regular basis, it should be expected that agencies will need time to develop the capacity to generate these estimates for the budget. During this time period, the information on insurance losses contained in the programs\u2019 financial statements, which are included in the budget appendix, provide policymakers with a valuable resource in monitoring these programs.", "Improvements in estimation methodologies, available data, and assumption specifications may, over time, lead to more accurate cost estimates, but because insurance program costs are dependent upon many variables, some uncertainty in the reported accrual estimates is unavoidable. The use of sophisticated estimation models, new budget presentations, and the need for periodic reestimates will add complexity to the budget process. As a result, understanding of budget data and the budget process may decline. However, this increased complexity should be assessed in relation to the adequacy of cash-based budgeting for insurance programs. Although cash-based budgeting is readily understandable to policymakers and the public, it generally provides incomplete or misleading information on insurance program costs and thus may impair resource allocation and fiscal policy decision-making.", "We believe that the potential benefits of an accrual-based budgeting approach for federal insurance programs warrant continued effort in the development of risk-assumed cost estimates. The complexity of the issues involved and the need to build agency capacity to generate risk-assumed cost estimates suggest that it is not feasible to integrate accrual-based costs directly into the budget at this time. Supplemental reporting of these estimates in the budget over a number of years could help policymakers understand the extent and nature of the estimation uncertainty and permit an evaluation of the desirability and feasibility of adopting a more comprehensive accrual-based approach. The value of reporting risk-assumed estimates was also endorsed by FASAB in accounting standards it developed, which require disclosure of risk-assumed cost estimates as supplemental information for insurance programs beginning with financial statements for fiscal year 1997. However, the Board also recognized the difficulty of preparing reliable risk-assumed estimates and, therefore, did not require their recognition on the financial statements as a liability.", "Supplemental reporting of risk-assumed cost estimates in the budget has several attractive features. It would allow time to (1) develop and refine estimation methodologies, (2) assess the reliability of risk-assumed estimates, (3) formulate cost-effective reporting procedures and requirements, (4) evaluate the feasibility of a more comprehensive accrual-based budgeting approach, and (5) gain experience and confidence in risk-assumed estimates. At the same time, the Congress and the executive branch will have had several years of experience with credit reform, which can help inform their efforts to apply accrual-based budgeting to insurance. During this period, policymakers should continue to draw on information provided in audited financial statements.", "If risk-assumed estimates develop sufficiently so that their use in the budget will not introduce an unacceptable level of uncertainty, policymakers could consider incorporating risk-assumed estimates directly into the budget. While supplemental reporting of risk-assumed estimates would improve the information on the cost of insurance commitments, the actual impact on budget decisions is uncertain since the primary budget data\u2014budget authority and outlays\u2014would be unaffected. Directly incorporating accrual-based cost estimates in both budget authority and outlays would have the greatest impact on the incentives provided to decisionmakers but would also significantly increase reporting complexity and introduce new uncertainty in reported budget data. Between these two approaches is one of incorporating accrual-based costs in budget authority alone, which has fewer of the disadvantages of the full accrual approach but also less impact on decision-making incentives. If an action-causing budget mechanism is desired, requiring a discretionary appropriation for the accrual-based cost of the government\u2019s subsidy could provide additional incentive to control the government\u2019s cost but\u2014by changing the locus of decisions to the annual appropriation process\u2014would go beyond merely changing the reporting of program costs and change the nature of federal insurance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["The Congress may wish to consider encouraging the development and subsequent reporting of annual risk-assumed cost estimates in conjunction with the cash-based estimates for all federal insurance programs in the President\u2019s budget.

GAO chose to use the term \u201ccash-based\u201d because cash is the measurement basis for the amounts shown in the budget for budget authority, obligations, outlays, and receipts. The estimates for these amounts generally are made in terms of cash payments to be made or received. Under current budget concepts, these amounts reflect the cash flows associated with the insurance program activities\u2014paying claims for events that have already occurred and collecting premiums for new commitments. GAO uses the term \u201caccrual-based\u201d to describe the use of risk-assumed cost estimates as the basis for reporting an insurance program\u2019s budget authority, obligations, and outlays. Although, as OMB noted and discussed in chapter 4 of this report, the term \u201caccrual\u201d can be applied to a range of concepts and measures, GAO uses the term in the report because it is generally understood as a basis of measuring cost rather than cash flows.", "OMB officials also suggested that the current federal budget system can be thought of as commitment-based or obligation-based budgeting and that the use of risk-assumed cost estimates is consistent with this concept. GAO agrees that this is a useful way of thinking about the potential changes in budgeting for insurance programs described in this report. As discussed in the report, using accrual-based cost information rather than cash-based information for reporting budget authority, obligations, and outlays could improve the recognition of the cost of the government\u2019s commitments at the time it makes them.

OMB agrees with GAO that for all programs what should be measured is the long-term expected cost of loss-generating events less premiums collected.
