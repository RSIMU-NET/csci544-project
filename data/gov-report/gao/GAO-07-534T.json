In 1998, four of the nation's largest tobacco companies signed a Master Settlement Agreement, agreeing to make annual payments to 46 states in perpetuity as reimbursement for past tobacco-related health care costs. Some states have arranged to receive advance proceeds based on the amounts that tobacco companies owe by issuing bonds backed by future payments. This testimony discusses (1) the amounts of tobacco settlement payments that the states received from fiscal years 2000 through 2005, the most recent year for which GAO has actual data, and (2) the states' allocations of these payments. We also include states' projected fiscal year 2006 allocations. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 required GAO to report annually, through fiscal year 2006, on how states used the payments made by tobacco companies. GAO based this testimony on five annual surveys of these 46 states' Master Settlement Agreement payments and how they allocated these payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2000 through 2005, the 46 states party to the Master Settlement Agreement received $52.6 billion in tobacco settlement payments. Of the $52.6 billion total, about $36.5 billion were payments from the tobacco companies and about $16 billion were advance payments which several states had arranged to receive by issuing bonds backed by their future payments from the tobacco companies. The Master Settlement Agreement imposed no restrictions on how states could spend their payments, and as such, the states have chosen to allocate them to a wide variety of activities. Some states told us that they viewed the settlement payments as an opportunity to fund needs that they were not able to fund previously due to the high costs of health care. States allocated the largest portion of their payments to health care--$16.8 billion or 30 percent--which includes Medicaid, health insurance, hospitals, medical technology, and research. States allocated the second largest portion to cover budget shortfalls--about $12.8 billion or about 22.9 percent. This category includes allocations to balance state budgets or reduce deficits that resulted from lower than anticipated revenues, increased mandatory spending, or essential expenditures. Included among the next largest categories are allocations for infrastructure projects, education, debt service on securitized proceeds, and tobacco control."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to contribute to your deliberation on the  need for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.  Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.  Most adults who use tobacco started using it between the ages of 10 and  18. A Surgeon General\u2019s report to the Congress concluded that preventing  youth from starting to use tobacco is key to reducing tobacco-related  deaths and disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  reported a few years ago that, on average, more than 440,000 deaths and  $76 billion in medical expenditures are attributable to cigarette smoking  annually. Reducing tobacco-related deaths and the incidence of disease,  along with their associated costs, is a significant public health challenge.", "Beginning in the mid-1990s, states sued the major tobacco companies for  reimbursement of the cost of health impairments caused by the public\u2019s  use of tobacco. The states alleged that the industry had violated antitrust  and consumer protection laws, withheld information about the adverse  health effects of tobacco, manipulated nicotine levels to keep smokers  addicted, and conspired to keep less risky and less addictive tobacco  products out of the market. Forty six states, along with the District of  Columbia and the five U.S. territories, negotiated and signed a settlement  agreement, called the Master Settlement Agreement, with four of the  largest tobacco companies\u2014Phillip Morris, USA; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco  Company; Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation; and Lorillard  Tobacco company. The settlement was the largest civil settlement in U.S.  history. It committed the tobacco companies to pay the 46 states an  estimated $200 billion over the first 25 years of the agreement, with  payments to continue in perpetuity. In addition, it restricted the tobacco  companies\u2019 marketing and advertising practices, among other things.", "Today, I will focus on how the 46 states party to the Master Settlement  Agreement have allocated their settlement payments. Specifically, I will  discuss (1) the amounts of Master Settlement Agreement payments that  the states received from fiscal years 2000 through 2005, the most recent  year for which we have actual data, and (2) the states\u2019 allocations of these  payments. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002  Farm Bill) required GAO to report annually, from fiscal years 2002 through  2006, on how these 46 states used their Master Settlement Agreement  payments. My testimony is based primarily on these annual reports.", "Our reports were based on our yearly surveys of the 46 states. Each year  we asked the states to report (1) the amount of payments they received for  the current state fiscal year, (2) the amount of payments they expected to  receive for the next state fiscal year, and (3) their allocations of these  payments among 13 spending categories. We independently corroborated  the states\u2019 data to the extent possible by analyzing budget-related and  legislative documents, and interviewing state budget officials, staff from  state attorneys generals\u2019 offices and governors\u2019 offices and others as  needed to clarify information. We performed our work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, the states  received $52.6 billion in Master Settlement Agreement payments from the  tobacco companies in amounts that varied from state to state and from  year to year. Of the $52.6 billion, about $36.5 billion were payments from  the tobacco companies and about $16 billion were advance payments  (securitized proceeds) that 15 states arranged to receive by issuing bonds  backed by their future payments from the tobacco companies. The annual  payments from the tobacco companies\u2019 are adjusted based on several  factors that include fluctuations in the volume of cigarettes sales, inflation,  and other variables, such as the participating companies\u2019 shares of the  tobacco market. Also, each state\u2019s share of the tobacco companies\u2019 annual  payments is a fixed percentage based on smoking-related health care  costs, which reflect population and smoking prevalence.", "The Master Settlement Agreement imposed no restrictions on how states  could spend these settlement payments and, as such, the states have  allocated their payments to a wide variety of activities. Some states told us  that they viewed the settlement payments as an opportunity to fund needs  that they were not able to fund previously due to the high costs of health  care. States allocated the largest portion of their payments\u201430 percent or  $16.8 billion\u2014toward health care activities such as Medicaid, health  insurance, hospitals, medical technology, and research. States allocated  the second largest portion of their payments\u2014about 23 percent or $12.8  billion\u2014to help balance state budgets or reduce deficits that resulted from  lower than anticipated revenues, increased mandatory spending, or  essential expenditures.", "In descending order, the next largest categories where states used their  tobacco settlement payments were general purposes, infrastructure  projects, education, debt service on securitized funds, and tobacco  control."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States\u2019 Annual Tobacco Settlement Payments Have Varied", "paragraphs": ["The 46 states reported receiving a total of nearly $52.6 billion in payments  in varying annual amounts from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005.  Of the nearly $52.6 billion, about $36.5 billion were payments from the  tobacco companies and about $16 billion were securitized proceeds that  15 states arranged to receive, as shown in table 1.", "The tobacco companies\u2019 annual payments are adjusted based on several  factors contained in the Master Settlement Agreement that include  fluctuations in the volume of cigarette sales, inflation, and other variables,  such as the participating companies\u2019 share of the tobacco market.  Declining tobacco consumption alone would result in lower Master  Settlement Agreement payments than originally expected. Tobacco  consumption has declined since the Master Settlement Agreement was  signed in 1998\u2014by about 6.5 percent in 1999 alone\u2014mostly due to one- time increases in cigarette prices by the tobacco companies after the  agreement took effect. Analysts project that, in the future, tobacco  consumption will decline by an average of nearly 2 percent per year. As a  result, tobacco consumption is estimated to decline by 33 percent between  1999 and 2020.", "However, the Master Settlement Agreement also includes an inflation  adjustment factor that some analysts have estimated increases payments  more than any decreases caused by reduced consumption. The inflation  adjustment equals the actual percentage increase in the Consumer Price  Index for the preceding year or 3 percent, whichever is greater. The effect  of these compounding increases is potentially significant, especially given  that the payments are made in perpetuity. Assuming a 3-percent inflation  adjustment and no decline in base payments, settlement amounts received  by states would double every 24 years.", "Also, several tobacco companies\u2019 interpretation of the provision that  addresses participants\u2019 market share led them to lower their payments in  2006. Under this provision, an independent auditor determined that  participating tobacco companies lost a portion of their market share to  non-participating companies. An economic research firm determined that  the Master Settlement Agreement was a significant factor in these market  share losses. Based on these findings, several participating companies  reduced their fiscal year 2006 payments by about a total of about $800  million. Many states have filed suit to recover these funds.", "Each state\u2019s share of the tobacco companies\u2019 total annual payments is a  fixed percentage that was negotiated during the settlement. These  percentages are based on two variables related to each state\u2019s smoking- related health care costs, which reflect each state\u2019s population and  smoking prevalence. In general, the most populous states receive a larger  share of the tobacco companies\u2019 total annual payments than the less  populous states. For example, California and New York each receive about  13 percent, while Alaska and Wyoming each receive less than 1 percent.  However, these percentages are not strictly proportional to population.", "In addition to the annual payments states receive, the Master Settlement  Agreement requires that a Strategic Contribution Fund payment begin in  2008 and continue through 2017. The base amount of each year\u2019s Strategic  Contribution Fund payment is $861 million, which will be adjusted for  volume and inflation and shared among the states. Strategic Contribution  Fund payments are intended to reflect the level of the contribution each  state made toward final resolution of their lawsuit against the tobacco  companies. They will be allocated to the states based on a separate  formula developed by a panel of former state attorneys general."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Are Exercising Their Flexibility to Use Tobacco Settlement Payments for a Wide Variety of Activities", "paragraphs": ["The Master Settlement Agreement imposed no restrictions on how states  could spend their settlement payments and, as such, the states have  allocated their payments to a wide variety of activities, with health-related  activities the largest among them. As part of their decision making on how  to spend their payments, some states established planning commissions  and working groups to develop recommendations and strategic plans for  allocating their states\u2019 payments. In six states, voter-approved initiatives  restricted use of the funds and, in 30 states, the legislatures enacted laws  restricting their use.", "Overall, we identified 13 general categories to which states have allocated  their Master Settlement Agreement payments, as shown in table 2.  Appendix I provides more details on the categories to which states  allocated their payments.", "States allocated the largest portion of their payments\u2014about $16.8 billion,  or 30 percent of the total payments\u2014to health-related activities. To a  closely related category\u2014tobacco control\u2014states allocated $1.9 billion, or  3.5 percent of their total payments. States allocated the second largest  portion of their payments\u2014about $12.8 billion or 22.9 percent\u2014to cover  budget shortfalls. Some states told us that they viewed the settlement  payments as an opportunity to fund needs that they were not able to fund  previously due to the high cost of health care. Figure 1 illustrates the  relative magnitude of the categories receiving allocations.", "The seven largest categories of allocations, in descending order, are  health, budget shortfalls, general purposes, infrastructure, education, debt  service on securitized funds, and tobacco control. States\u2019 allocations to  these categories have varied considerably from year to year\u2014with some  categories showing wide fluctuations. For example, for budget shortfalls,  the states allocated from 2 to 44 percent of the total payments. On the  other hand, for health care, the states allocated from 20 to 38 percent of  the total payments. Figure 2 shows these annual changes for these seven  categories.", "Information about how states have allocated their Master Settlement  Agreement payments follows.", "Health. From fiscal years 2000 through 2005, states allocated about $16.8  billion of their Master Settlement Agreement payments to a variety of  health care programs, including Medicaid; health insurance; cancer  prevention, screening, and treatment; heart and lung disease; and drug  addiction.

Of the 36 states, 5 states allocated  two-thirds or more of their payments to health care; 19 states allocated  one-third to two-thirds; and 12 states allocated less than one-third. Ten  states did not allocate any of their payments to health care activities. In  fiscal year 2005, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, and Maryland allocated  larger amounts to health care than the other states. Pennsylvania allocated  over $326 million of its payments to health care programs for adult health  insurance, uncompensated care, medical assistance for workers with  disabilities, and community medical assistance. Illinois allocated nearly  $204 million of its payments to health care, citing Medicaid drugs as a key  program that would receive funds. Michigan allocated over $185 million of  its payments to areas such as elder pharmaceutical assistance and  Medicaid support programs. Maryland allocated nearly $100 million of its  payments to areas such as Medicaid; cancer prevention, screening, and  treatment; heart and lung disease; and drug addiction.", "Budget Shortfalls. From fiscal years 2000 through 2005, states allocated  about $12.8 billion of their Master Settlement Agreement payments to  budget shortfalls. Over this period, the amounts the states allocated to  budget shortfalls ranged from a high of about $5.1 billion, or 44 percent of  the total payments in fiscal year 2004, to $261 million, or 4 percent in fiscal  year 2005.

Of these 5 states, North  Dakota was the only state that allocated more than one-third of its total  payments to infrastructure. North Dakota, Hawaii, and Kentucky allocated  the largest amounts to infrastructure in fiscal year 2005. North Dakota  allocated about $10.5 million of its payments to infrastructure for work on  water projects. Hawaii allocated approximately $10 million of its payments  to infrastructure, citing debt service on University of Hawaii revenue  bonds issued for the new Health and Wellness Center as a primary  program that would receive funds. Kentucky allocated $6.1 million of its  payments to service debt on such things as water resource development  and a Rural Development Bond Fund.", "Education. From fiscal years 2000 through 2005, states allocated about $3  billion of their Master Settlement Agreement payments to education  programs, including early childhood development; special education;  scholarships; after-school services; and reading programs.

Colorado  allocated over $16 million of its payments to education, including its Read  to Achieve program.", "Debt Service on Securitized Funds. From fiscal years 2000 through 2005,  states allocated about $3 billion of their Master Settlement Agreement  payments to servicing debt on securitized funds. This category consists of  amounts allocated to servicing the debt issued when a state securitizes all  or a portion of its Master Settlement Agreement payments.
