The  management decisions should describe the corrective actions agencies  consider necessary based on their evaluation of the audit findings and  corrective action plans contained in the single audit reporting package.   Since federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that the recipients  implement adequate corrective action, it is important for management to  clearly communicate the agency\u2019s expectations and time frames for action  through management decisions.", "The issuance of a management decision is also critical because, based on  OMB Circular A-133, award recipients may consider an audit finding invalid  and not warranting further action if all the following have occurred:   a management decision was not issued,  2 years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred  was submitted to the FAC, and  the federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up  with the recipient on the audit finding.", "As shown in table 1, the audit files reviewed contained documentation  evidencing management decisions for 75 of the 246 audit findings  contained in our sample audit reports.", "Agency officials noted several possible reasons that management decisions  were not prepared and available for our review including   the findings were insignificant and did not require further action,    follow up with recipients was performed but not documented,   the audit report that identified the finding also indicated that the  recipient had corrected the audit finding as of the report issuance date,  and   subsequent audit reports were reviewed to determine if the finding had  been corrected.", "The audit files generally did not contain an indication that agency officials  considered any of these four factors or used them as a justification for not  preparing the required management decisions.

In our view, none of the  reasons cited justify the nonissuance of a management decision.  For  example, by including a finding in a single audit report, auditors are  indicating that the finding is significant since government auditing  standards require auditors to report all significant findings in the report.   The standards identify other means of communicating insignificant  findings.  Regarding the use of subsequent-year single audit reports to  justify the nonissuance of a management decision, it should be noted that  single audit reports must be issued no later than 9 months after the  recipient\u2019s year-end.  By waiting for the subsequent year\u2019s audit report, as  many as 21 months could have expired from the end of the audit period for  which the finding was initially reported to the receipt of the subsequent  year\u2019s audit report.

The teams evaluate the audit findings based on  criteria established in the draft guidance, which states that audit findings  may be addressed using three approaches -- full resolution, abbreviated  resolution, or technical assistance.  The principle criteria used in evaluating  each finding and determining the resolution approach is the seriousness of  the finding, that is, the monetary or program compliance issues identified  or the recurring nature of the finding.  Full and abbreviated resolution  approaches require written notification to the recipient.  The guidance  states that resolution by technical assistance does not require a written  management decision.  However, it does require that all communication  with the auditee in the resolution of an audit finding using the technical  assistance approach be documented and available in the audit file.", "Education has also developed a process to facilitate management decisions  on complex audit issues affecting multiple programs.  This process, CAROI,  uses a collaborative approach to resolve audit findings and their underlying  causes.  During the CAROI process, representatives from Education\u2019s  program and OIG offices work collaboratively with state and local program  managers to address complex audit findings affecting multiple programs.   An agency official noted that the process may not be completed in the 6- month management decision time frame set forth in OMB Circular A-133.   For those findings in our sample being addressed using the CAROI process,  the 6-month requirement was not met.

Further, the Circular requires  that, if the recipient has not completed corrective action as of the  management decision date, the decision should give a timetable for this  action.  For the 66 findings with written management decisions, our review  showed that the management decisions often did not contain all of the  elements required by OMB Circular A-133.

Our review of the calendar year 2000 audit reports indicated  that 27 (13 CDBG and 14 Section 8) of the 85 findings in our sample had  been corrected.  Therefore, this possibility did not account for most of the  instances of missing management decisions.

However, the report does not include information on all single audit  findings, since the OIG only tracks findings for which it issues \u201caction\u201d  memoranda, and the report contains only general information and no  specific details on the nature and extent of single audit findings.", "Information for such management reporting can come from many sources  including agency analyses of single audit findings and agency databases,  such as HUD\u2019s REAC database.  Another valuable source of information is  the FAC single audit database.  This database consists of information  obtained from a data collection form that recipients send to the FAC as part  of their single audit reporting package.  It contains summary information  on the auditor, the recipient and its federal programs, and audit results.   The database contains about 4 years of information on over 30,000 annual  single audit reports.  The various data query options available provide  potential users, including program managers, auditors, and other interested  parties, with significant amounts of readily available information on grant  recipient financial management and internal control systems and on  compliance with federal laws and regulations.", "To determine the types and frequency of audit findings at the six programs  in the three agencies included in our review, we queried the FAC single  audit database and reviewed the sample single audit reports to determine if  the grantees in our selection had similar types of audit findings.  Our query  showed that similar audit findings were reported for grantees in each of the  programs.  For example, 33 of the 66 audit findings we reviewed for the Pell  Grant program were attributable to grantees\u2019 noncompliance with special  tests and provisions applicable to the program.  These findings typically  involved situations where colleges or universities were unable to provide  documentation to show that students receiving federal aid attended class.   For Title I programs, 11 of the 47 audit findings reviewed were attributable  to grantees\u2019 noncompliance with allowable costs provisions specified in the  grant.  Further, our query showed 16 of the 37 audit findings for recipients  of HUD\u2019s CDBG program were attributable to noncompliance with the  grants reporting requirements, and 18 of the 48 HUD Section 8 program  audit findings were attributable to grantees\u2019 noncompliance with the  special test and provisions requirements of the Section 8 grants.", "We also queried the FAC single audit database to determine if any of the  programs selected for review had recurring types of audit findings.  We  found several instances in which single audit reports contained types of  audit findings that were repeated in 3 or more consecutive years.  For  example, 4 of the 10 Education Pell Grant recipient reports identified  eligibility findings that repeated in 3 or more consecutive years.  For the  Title I program, 4 grantees had subrecipient monitoring findings that  repeated in 3 or more consecutive years.  At HUD, a review of the database  and single audit reports showed that 15 of the 37 CDBG audit findings were  not corrected over a period of 3 successive years.  Twelve of these 15  recurring audit findings occurred at one recipient.  The remaining 3  recurring audit findings occurred at three other recipients.  In addition,  CDBG and Section 8 grants also had recipients with audit findings  attributable to reporting, allowable costs, and eligibility that were repeated  in 3 or more subsequent years.  Transportation recipients selected for  review had cash management, subrecipient monitoring, allowable costs,  and equipment and real property management findings that were repeated  in 3 or more years at individual recipients.", "This type of information could be a valuable tool in improving grants  management by helping management evaluate agency oversight and  monitoring activities and identify problem areas.  It could also assist in  setting priorities for actions needed to correct program problems.  In  addition, it can provide agencies with information needed to help them  accomplish their responsibilities as established by The President\u2019s  Management Agenda, Fiscal Year 2002, initiative to reduce improper  payments in federal programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The first step in an agency\u2019s efforts to address single audit findings is  obtaining single audit reports and distributing them to agency officials  responsible for reviewing the report findings and taking actions on those  findings.  Each of the three agencies in our review had procedures for  communicating audit reports and/or audit finding information to program  or field offices for action.", "OMB Circular A-133 requires agencies to prepare written management  decisions on audit findings contained in single audit reports.  Our review of  the audit files at the three agencies found that they issued written  management decisions for only 75 of the 246 audit findings contained in the  single audit reports included in our review.  The agencies noted several  reasons for not preparing written management decisions, including (1) the  audit findings were considered insignificant or not serious, (2) follow up  with recipients was performed but not documented, (3) the single audit  report stated that the recipient had corrected the finding prior to the  report\u2019s issuance, and (4) the subsequent year\u2019s single audit report  indicated that the recipient had corrected the finding.  In our view, none of  these reasons justify the nonissuance of a management decision.  Further,  the audit files generally did not contain any evidence that agency officials  considered these factors or otherwise considered the preparation of  management decisions.", "Education, HUD, and Transportation do not adequately document their  evaluations of and conclusions on the corrective actions taken by  recipients to correct single audit findings.  While the audit files contained  copies of recipient documents and other records, they generally did not  contain agency evaluations of or conclusions on the adequacy of the  recipient actions cited in those records.  This documentation is critical  because each agency relies heavily on program, regional, or field offices to  ensure that corrective actions occur and none requires reporting on the  corrective action status on all findings contained in single audit reports.   Therefore, requiring documentation can help ensure that these offices  perform their responsibilities in ensuring that recipients take all necessary  corrective actions.", "Through discussions with agency officials, we determined that none of the  agencies report single audit results or the status of single audit findings and  implementation of action to correct deficiencies to agency management.   This reporting can strengthen accountability and oversight by providing  management with information useful in the analyses of both programwide  problems and recurring problems at specific recipients.  Further, because  many federal programs that are subject to single audits also experience  improper payments, this reporting can be useful to agency management in  addressing the requirements established in The President\u2019s Management  Agenda, Fiscal Year 2002, for reducing such payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that recipients correct the weaknesses identified in single audit  reports, we recommend that the Secretary for the departments of  Education, HUD, and Transportation ensure that each has established and  follows guidance that addresses the OMB Circular A-133 requirements for  all agency programs whose awards are subject to the Single Audit Act.  This  guidance should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each agency  unit in ensuring appropriate and timely actions on single audit findings  including:  preparing and issuing management decisions that clearly communicate  the results of agency analyses of single audit findings and the adequacy  of corrective actions implemented or planned by the recipient,  performing follow up procedures to ensure that the recipient  implemented adequate corrective action, and  documenting results of evaluations of and conclusions on recipients\u2019  actions to correct audit findings.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of each of the three agencies  implement policies and procedures for reporting information to agency  management on (1) the types and causes of findings identified in single  audit reports and (2) the status of corrective actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Education agreed with the thrust of the report\u2019s findings and  recommendations.

Its  comments (reprinted in appendix II) described actions that HUD is taking  to improve its oversight and use of single audits to strengthen its program  compliance and performance.  They also contained several minor technical  or editorial revisions that we considered and included in the report, as  appropriate.", "The Department of Transportation\u2019s comments (reprinted in appendix III)  raised several issues about the scope of our audit work, the conclusions  reached, and the recommendations made.", "Transportation questioned our audit scope and suggested that we  should have conducted independent field testing to determine the  extent and effectiveness of recipient actions taken.  Our objective was  to determine what agencies do to ensure that recipients take timely and  appropriate action; not to independently reperform the steps that  program and other offices, as applicable, would need to do to evaluate  recipient corrective actions.  To accomplish our objective, we examined  agency audit files to determine the extent to which those files contained  evidence of agency actions to ensure that recipients had taken  appropriate and timely corrective actions on all audit findings.  As we  noted in the report, the audit files generally did not contain evidence of  these actions either through written management decisions or through  documentary evidence of agency evaluations of or conclusions on  recipient corrective actions.", "Transportation noted that not all single audit findings are useful or  meaningful and that our report did not recognize this point.  Two points  are relevant here.  First, the Comptroller General\u2019s Government  Auditing Standards, which auditors performing single audits are  required to follow, requires auditors to \u201creport the significant audit  findings developed in response to each audit objective.\u201d  The standards  also note that audit findings not reported, because of their  insignificance, should be separately communicated to the auditee.  The  auditors included all of the findings discussed in our report in their  single audit reports.  Our objective was not to evaluate the usefulness of  audit findings or whether auditors made the right determination as to  significance in including the 48 findings in the reports covered by our  review.  Regarding the second point, the \u201cManagement Decisions \u2013  Transportation\u201d section of the report that we provided for comment  identified management decision information for findings addressed by  both \u201caction\u201d and \u201cinformational\u201d memoranda.  In using these different  memoranda, Transportation distinguished between serious or  significant and other types of findings.  We did not separately judge or  evaluate the decision to use one or the other type of memoranda.   However, OMB Circular A-133 does not distinguish between the serious  or other types of audit findings.  It clearly states that actions are  required on all audit findings.", "Transportation\u2019s comments also discussed the agency\u2019s process for  reviewing and tracking audit findings.  They noted that the agency  tracks significant findings in the joint OIG/management tracking system  until documentation is provided that action has been completed and  stated that less significant actions are tracked locally.  The draft report  we provided for comment generally contained this same information  and discussed the types of memoranda the agency used to communicate  single audit findings to appropriate agency offices.  We do not take issue  with the agency\u2019s process.  However, as our report states, our review of  audit files, irregardless of whether the agency handled the audit findings  with \u201caction\u201d or \u201cinformational\u201d memoranda, found that the files  generally did not contain documentation identifying agency evaluations  of and conclusions on the adequacy of the corrective actions taken by  recipients.", "Transportation stated that our report recommends that each department  create a new system or systems for communicating audit findings to top  management.  While our report recommends reporting to top  management, it also notes that information for such reporting can come  from such sources as agency analyses of single audit findings, agency  databases, and the FAC single audit database.  We do not recommend or  suggest that agencies develop new systems.  Agencies such as  Transportation, that uses a joint OIG/management tracking system for  significant findings, should use information obtained from that or other  existing systems to summarize single audit results and the status of  recipient corrective actions and communicate that information to top  management.", "The final agency comment notes that documentation concerns alone are  insufficient to demonstrate that agencies are ineffective at ensuring that  grantees achieve the changes recommended by single audits to safeguard  federal funds.  Our report does not make the point that agencies are  ineffective if they do not maintain appropriate documentation.  Clearly,  recipients can take timely and appropriate action to correct audit findings  without regard to federal agency documentation that such action occurred.   However, absent documentation that timely and appropriate actions  occurred, agency management would have no basis for concluding that  agency follow-up with recipients occurred or that recipient corrective  actions, if any, were timely and appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member,  Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management and  Intergovernmental Relations, House Committee on Government Reform;  the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on  Appropriations; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, House  Committee on Appropriations; the Chairman and Ranking Minority  Member, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; the Chairman and  Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Government Reform; the  Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Budget Committee; and  the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, House Budget Committee.
