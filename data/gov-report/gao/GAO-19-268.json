However, these checklists do not instruct supervisors to monitor for indications of profiling. TSA officials stated that the training screeners receive, adherence to operating procedures, and general supervisory oversight are sufficient to alert supervisors to situations when unlawful profiling may occur. However, developing a specific mechanism to monitor behavior detection activities for compliance with policies prohibiting unlawful profiling would provide TSA with greater assurance that screeners are adhering to such policies.", "From October 2015 through February 2018, TSA received about 3,700 complaints alleging civil rights and civil liberties violations related to passenger screening. These complaints are not specific to behavior detection activities. The TSA Contact Center (TCC), the office that initially receives these complaints, reported that about half of the complaints did not have complete information from passengers necessary for further review, such as the airport and date of the incident. According to TCC officials, they attempt to obtain the additional information from passengers, but often the complaint does not include the correct contact information or the passenger does not respond to the TCC's request for additional information. The TCC complaint data show that the remaining 51 percent (about 1,900) of complaints were referred to the TSA Multicultural Branch, the office responsible for reviewing complaints alleging civil rights and civil liberties violations. The Multicultural Branch reported reviewing 2,059 complaints, including approximately 1,900 complaints from TCC, as well as complaints referred from other TSA offices.

TSA\u2019s policies and procedures require screeners to apply  behavior detection without regard to race, ethnicity, nationality, and  religion, among other factors. Over the years, allegations of racial profiling  have raised questions about whether behavior detection officers  inappropriately consider these factors when referring passengers for  additional screening or to law enforcement. As we previously reported,  TSA and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Office of  Inspector General investigated allegations of behavior detection officers  unlawfully profiling passengers because of their race, ethnicity, or  nationality at Newark Liberty International Airport in 2010, at Honolulu  International Airport in 2011, and at Boston Logan International Airport in  2012.", "In 2013, we found that TSA was unable to demonstrate that the agency\u2019s  behavior detection activities could reliably and effectively identify high-risk  passengers who may pose a threat to the U.S. aviation system. We  recommended that TSA limit future funding support for the agency\u2019s  behavior detection activities until TSA could provide scientifically  validated evidence that demonstrates that behavioral indicators can be  used to identify passengers who may pose a threat to aviation security.  In 2016, TSA began using behavior detection in a more limited way and in  2017, we reported that TSA had reduced funding for behavior detection  and revised its behavioral indicators. We stated that TSA should continue  to limit funding for such activities until it can provide valid evidence  demonstrating that behavioral indicators can be used to identify  passengers who may pose a threat to aviation security. In early fiscal  year 2018, TSA ended the stand-alone behavior detection program and  eliminated the behavior detection officer position. TSA also began  integrating the former behavior detection officers into the screener  workforce to support increased passenger volume at TSA\u2019s checkpoints,  according to TSA officials. Screeners trained in behavior detection  continue to use it, largely in support of canine units.", "In light of these efforts, you asked us to review the mechanisms TSA  uses to prevent unlawful profiling while screening passengers using  behavior detection.

We selected this time frame because  TSA\u2019s most current behavior detection procedures\u2014Optimized Behavior  Detection\u2014were approved as the new standard for behavior detection  training and operations starting in fiscal year 2017. To determine TSA\u2019s  policies for prohibiting unlawful profiling, we reviewed various documents  pertaining to behavior detection including standard operating procedures,  the behavior detection handbook, and the behavior detection strategic  plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. To determine what training  screeners using behavior detection receive on the policies and  procedures that prohibit profiling in carrying out behavior detection  activities, we reviewed TSA\u2019s 2018 National Training Plan, which lays out  annual training requirements for screeners, and TSA\u2019s management  directive on training standards to determine how TSA developed and  selected training requirements. We also reviewed behavior detection\u2013 related National Shift Briefings, a presentation on racial profiling  developed by the Multicultural Branch in collaboration with a member of  TSA\u2019s Multicultural Coalition, handouts, and other relevant materials  provided to screeners.

We interviewed Security Operations officials who oversee the  use of behavior detection to discuss the oversight process for monitoring  compliance with standard operating procedures. To learn about how  these practices are implemented at airports, we met with TSA officials at  each of the three airports we visited and observed how screeners trained  in behavior detection use behavioral indicators while conducting canine  and airport and airline employee screening operations. Additionally, we  reviewed TSA\u2019s efforts in response to the Secretary of Homeland  Security\u2019s 2012 directive to enhance data collection systems to facilitate  appropriate supervision and monitor the use of behavior detection in  response to allegations of profiling by behavior detection officers.

During this period, behavior  detection officers had brief interactions with passengers in the queue  leading up to the screening checkpoint. If the behavior detection officers  determined during this interaction that a passenger exhibited a certain  number of behavioral indicators, the behavior detection officer was to  refer the passenger for additional screening or, if circumstances  warranted, contact a law enforcement officer. According to TSA  procedures, if a passenger was referred for additional screening, one  behavior detection officer conducted a pat-down of the passenger and  search of his or her personal property while another checked documents  and conversed with the passenger, attempting to understand why the  behavioral indicators were being displayed and continuing to look for  additional behavioral indicators. If a passenger did not exhibit a certain  number of additional indicators, he or she was allowed to proceed to the  boarding gate. If the passenger did exhibit a certain number of additional  indicators, or other events occurred, such as the discovery of a fraudulent  document, the behavior detection officer was to call a law enforcement  officer. The law enforcement officer then would determine next steps,  which could include questioning the passenger or conducting a criminal  background check.

For example, the TCC received  complaints alleging discrimination that involved assertions by passengers  that they had been selected for pat-downs based on race and ethnicity,  among other reasons, when the passengers believed they did not trigger  an alarm prompting the pat-downs. The TCC also received complaints  related to passengers\u2019 transgender identity alleging selection for  additional screening because of their transgender status. Additionally, the  TCC received passenger complaints alleging that screening procedures  were aggressive or inappropriate for senior citizens. Table 3 provides a  list of complaint types based on our analysis. In addition, appendix II  provides additional detail about our content analysis of complaints  alleging civil rights and civil liberties violations, and appendix III provides  a list of 10 airports most often identified in the complaints.", "As TSA\u2019s primary point of contact for passenger complaints, the TCC is  responsible for the initial review and referral of all complaints that involve  allegations of civil rights and civil liberties violations to the Multicultural  Branch. According to the TCC standard operating procedures, TCC  analysts review the complaints to ensure that they contain the necessary  information to be considered complete, including the airport, passenger\u2019s  name, date of the incident, and description of the alleged civil rights and  civil liberties violation. In addition, complaints reported over the phone or  made on behalf of another person without the person\u2019s consent are  initially considered incomplete. For complaints that are not complete,  the TCC sends the passenger a document request for information when  the passenger has provided correct contact information. According to  TCC officials, passengers often do not provide the correct contact  information or do not respond with the necessary information to complete  the complaint. TCC officials said that incomplete complaints are typically  sent to the Multicultural Branch for informational purposes. Multicultural  Branch officials told us that they consider information from incomplete  complaints to inform its policy and training initiatives, and to improve how  TSA engages with the public.", "From October 2015 through February 2018, the TCC referred 51 percent  (1,865) of the 3,663 complaints it received to the Multicultural Branch for  review. The TCC reported that 48 percent (1,764) of the 3,663 complaints  did not have complete information necessary for further review, such as  the airport and date of the incident. According to TSA officials, these  complaints were sent to the Multicultural Branch for informational  purposes.

From  October 2015 through February 2018, the Multicultural Branch received  2,059 complaints alleging violations of civil rights and civil liberties, as  shown in figure 2. Multicultural Branch officials stated that the majority of  these complaints were referred from the TCC.", "As shown in figure 2, for 1,066 (52 percent) of the complaints,  Multicultural Branch staff found indications of potential discrimination,  such as instances of rude or unprofessional conduct that included the use  of race or other protected characteristics. According to Multicultural  Branch staff, to resolve the 1,066 complaints, they recommended a range  of refresher training. Multicultural Branch staff explained that when issues  are identified, their policy is to address the issues through screener  training. Multicultural Branch officials reported that these trainings were  provided through National Shift Briefings, which were circulated across  TSA, or through training provided at a particular airport. For example:  In one of the complaint cases we reviewed, a passenger alleged  profiling based on headwear. Multicultural Branch officials used  camera recordings and statements from officers involved in the  encounter to substantiate that screening procedure violations had  occurred. As a result, Multicultural Branch officials recommended  refresher training to the airport on headwear screening protocols for  all screeners at the airport to review.", "In another complaint case we reviewed, a passenger alleged profiling  based on the use of a tribal-issued photo identification card. In  response, Multicultural Branch officials sent refresher training on  verifying tribal identification and the screening of Native American  passengers to the TSA designated point of contact at the airport  involved for distribution to TSA personnel identified in the complaint.", "In a third complaint reviewed, a passenger alleged being profiled at  the screening checkpoint, without including any additional details.  According to TSA officials, based on the particular allegations of the  complaint and the lack of details, TSA was unable to substantiate the  allegations made in the complaint. As a result, Multicultural Branch  sent National Shift Briefings on TSA\u2019s policies and procedures that  prohibit unlawful profiling and inappropriate comments to the TSA  designated point of contact at the airport involved for distribution to  TSA personnel identified in the complaint.", "As shown in figure 2, there were 993 complaints that the Multicultural  Branch reviewed but did not address through training. The Multicultural  Branch closed 121 of these complaints because it determined that the  complainant did not provide sufficient information about the alleged civil  rights and civil liberties violation for Multicultural Branch review and the  complainant did not respond with additional information requested by the  Multicultural Branch within 10 days. The Multicultural Branch determined  that the remaining 872 complaints were not substantiated based on its  review of the camera recording of the alleged incident, or were not within  its jurisdiction. For the complaints not within its jurisdiction, the  Multicultural Branch referred them to other TSA offices, to TSA officials at  the airport or airports identified in the complaints for review, or to other  federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department  of Transportation, or the Federal Aviation Administration) as appropriate.  These complaints involved allegations of unprofessional conduct and  other issues that did not involve allegations of civil rights and civil liberties  violations.", "According to Multicultural Branch guidance, the designated TSA point of  contact at the airport along with the Multicultural Branch analyst are to  determine appropriate next steps for resolving complaints, such as  preparing a briefing for screeners that is tailored to address the concerns  raised by the complainant. TSA officials stated that resolutions to the  complainant are tailored to reflect the allegation, type of inquiry  conducted, and investigation of the facts and evidence underlying the  complaint. TSA\u2019s responses to the complainant include, but are not  limited to, apologizing for the screening experience or informing the  complainant about the next steps such as the agency\u2019s plans to address  the complaint or underlying conduct that gave rise to the complaint. For  example, in a letter we reviewed, TSA apologized for the \u201cunprofessional  and inappropriate personal questions\u201d the passenger experienced during  screening, and stated that refresher training would be distributed to  screeners at the airport involved. According to documentation we  reviewed related to this complaint, the Multicultural Branch sent refresher  training materials on avoiding inappropriate comments to the designated  TSA point of contact at the airport involved. In addition, TSA\u2019s office of  Human Capital Employee Relations reported that it took a range of  disciplinary actions\u2014from letters of reprimand to termination\u2014for 100  screeners from October 2015 through February 2018, in part in response  to passenger complaints alleging civil rights and civil liberties violations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA\u2019s Multicultural Branch Analyzes and Shares Passenger Complaint Data to Inform Screener Training", "paragraphs": ["TSA\u2019s Multicultural Branch regularly collects and analyzes data on  passenger civil rights and civil liberties and discrimination complaints and  their resolution status, and shares this information with TSA executive  leadership, TSA airport customer service managers, and screeners in the  field, among others.

Staff members meet weekly to discuss trends in  complaints for their geographic regions, and they review weekly,  quarterly, and annual reports on the number and category of complaints  referred to their office by the TCC. In addition, Multicultural Branch  officials track the resolution of the cases for which they have jurisdiction  and submit this information to their senior leadership each week.  Specifically, the Multicultural Branch uses a database to track complaints  by type, airport, submission date, and resolution status, such as how  many cases are open, closed, or whether they have been resolved.", "Multicultural Branch officials share trends in complaints throughout TSA in  several ways, including conference calls, monthly briefings, reporting  metrics to TSA executive leadership, and on-site training events at  airports each year. For example, Multicultural Branch officials hold  monthly conference calls with customer service managers at airports to  review complaint trends, upcoming on-site airport trainings, and job aids  they have developed to help screeners understand issues, such as  screening passengers wearing religious headwear. Multicultural Branch  officials stated they also share information with screeners and supervisors  through National Shift Briefings that are distributed at all airports, and  focus on bringing awareness to screeners on events they need to be  aware of when screening passengers, such as religious observances  occurring that month.", "According to TSA officials, the Multicultural Branch uses its analysis of  passenger complaints and the results of complaint investigations to  develop training aids and materials on areas where they determine  screeners need more training, such as multicultural awareness or  screening of transgender passengers. For example, the Multicultural  Branch has developed briefings focusing on unlawful profiling and  unconscious bias which reiterated that unlawful profiling is against TSA  policy, defined unconscious bias, and provided scenario-based examples.  Additionally, members from the Multicultural Branch hold on-site training  for screeners at selected airports each year based on complaint data  analysis and other factors.
