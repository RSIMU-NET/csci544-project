Faced with the uncertainty as to the full extent of rebuilding Iraq, the government authorized contractors to begin work before key terms and conditions were defined. This approach allows the government to initiate needed work quickly, but can result in additional costs and risks being imposed on the government. Helping to oversee their work is the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), which examined many Iraq contracts and identified costs they consider to be questioned or unsupported. The Conference Report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 directed GAO to report on audit findings regarding contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As agreed with the congressional defense committees, GAO focused on Iraq contract audit findings and determined (1) the costs identified by DCAA as questioned or unsupported; and (2) what actions DOD has taken to address DCAA audit findings, including the extent funds were withheld from contractors. To identify DOD actions in response to the audit findings, GAO selected 18 audit reports representing about 50 percent of DCAA's questioned and unsupported costs on Iraq contracts. GAO requested comments from DOD on a draft of this report, but none were provided."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Defense Contract Audit Agency audit reports issued between February 2003 and February 2006 identified $2.1 billion in questioned costs and $1.4 billion in unsupported costs on Iraq contracts. DCAA defines questioned costs as costs that are unacceptable for negotiating reasonable contract prices, and unsupported costs as costs for which the contractor has not provided sufficient documentation. This information is provided to DOD for its negotiations with contractors. Based on information provided by DCAA, DOD contracting officials have taken actions to address $1.4 billion in questioned costs. As a result, DOD contracting officials negotiated contract cost reductions of $386 million according to DCAA. Based on the information provided by DCAA, as of July 2006, the remaining $700 million in questioned costs is still in process. Because unsupported costs indicate a lack of contractor information that is needed to assess costs, DCAA cannot and does not render an opinion on those costs. Therefore, DCAA does not track the resolution of unsupported costs. For the 18 audit reports selected for this review, GAO found that DOD contracting officials took a variety of actions to address DCAA's audit findings, including not allowing some contractor costs. In the contract documentation GAO reviewed, DOD contracting officials generally considered DCAA's questioned and unsupported cost findings when negotiating with the contractor. GAO found DOD contracting officials were more likely to use DCAA's advice when negotiations were timely and occurred before contractors had incurred substantial costs. For example, in three audit reports related to a logistics support task order negotiated prior to the onset of work, DCAA questioned $204 million. According to DCAA's calculations, $120 million of these questioned costs was removed from the contractor's proposal as a result of its audit findings. In contrast, DOD officials were less likely to remove questioned costs from a contract proposal when the contractor had already incurred these costs. For example, in five audit reports comprising about $600 million of questioned costs reviewed, GAO found that the DOD contracting officials determined that the contractor should be paid for all but $38 million of the questioned costs, but reduced the base used to calculate the contractor's fee by $205 million. By reducing the base, the DOD contracting official reduced the contractor's fee by approximately $6 million. In addition to identifying questioned and unsupported costs, DCAA has the option of withholding funds from the contractor and chose to withhold a total of $236 million for eight cases included in this review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States is spending billions of dollars to achieve U.S. political,  The United States is spending billions of dollars to achieve U.S. political,  security, and economic goals in Iraq.

DCAA performs many types of audits  for DOD, including audits of contractor proposals, audits of estimating and  accounting systems, and incurred cost audits. Generally, the results of a  DCAA audit are intended to assist contracting officials in negotiating  reasonable contract prices. Normally, DCAA audits contractors\u2019 proposals  and provides contracting officials advice on the reasonableness of  contractor costs prior to negotiations. DCAA also conducts audits of cost- type contracts after they are negotiated to ensure costs incurred on these  contracts are acceptable. Relying on cost information provided by the  contractor and assessing whether the costs comply with government  regulations, DCAA may identify certain costs as questioned or  unsupported. DCAA defines questioned costs as costs considered to be not  acceptable for negotiating a reasonable contract price, and unsupported  costs as costs that lack sufficient supporting documentation. DCAA  reports its findings to contracting officers for consideration in negotiating  reasonable contract prices.", "DCAA audit reports represent one way DCAA can assist contracting  officials as they negotiate government contracts. Also, contracting officials  may invite DCAA to participate in contract negotiations to explain audit  findings and recommendations, and may factor DCAA audit findings into  evaluations of contract proposals.

However, the  FAR enables the government to authorize the contractor to begin work  before doing so in certain cases, such as when the government demands  the work start immediately and it is not possible to negotiate a fully  defined contract in sufficient time to meet the requirement. Our past work  has shown that the use of undefinitized contract actions can pose risks to  the government, such as potentially significant additional costs.  Acquisition regulations generally require that the contracting official  define the scope and costs of such contracts within 180 days of the  contract\u2019s start date. According to contract officials, urgent conditions in  Iraq led the government to initiate such contract actions without first  specifying their scope of work and agreeing to the contract price.", "In many cases we reviewed, contractors completed some work and  incurred substantial costs well before the government negotiated the  contract price. Of the 18 audits covered in our review, 11 audit reports  corresponded to contract actions where more than 180 days had elapsed  from the beginning of the period of performance to final negotiations. For  nine of these audits, the period of performance DOD initially authorized  for each contract action concluded before final negotiations took place.", "For example, DCAA questioned $84 million in its audit of a task order  proposal for an oil mission. In this case, the contractor did not submit a  proposal until a year after the work was authorized, and DOD and the  contractor did not negotiate the final terms of the task order until more  than a year after the contractor had completed work (see fig. 1). The DOD  contracting officer paid the contractor for all questioned costs but reduced  the base used to calculate contractor profit by $45 million. As a result, the  contractor was paid about $3 million less in fees. In the final negotiation  documentation, the DOD contracting official stated that payment of  incurred costs is required for cost-type contracts, absent unusual  circumstances. This same rationale was used in negotiations on several  other task orders.", "In contrast, in the few audit reports we reviewed where the government  negotiated prior to starting work, we found that the portion of questioned  costs removed from the proposal was substantial. For example, in 3 audit  reports related to a logistics support task order, DCAA questioned   $204 million. Since the government and the contractor negotiated the  terms of this task order prior to the onset of work, the contractor had not  incurred any costs at the time of negotiation (see fig. 2 for timeline).

Subsequently, as a result of either additional  documentation provided by the contractor or the DOD administrative  contracting officer determination, $148 million of the withheld funds was  released to the contractor and the government did not pay $36 million to  the contractor.

The contractor was directed by the  Army to build, equip, and operate the dining facilities located at U.S. troop  base camps in Iraq and to provide four meals a day to the camp  populations. The population at each camp was specified in the Army\u2019s  description of the work to be performed by the contractor. In addition,  contractor and government representatives counted the number of troops  served at each mealtime. However, the Army\u2019s description of the work did  not specify whether the contractor should bill the government for the  camp population identified in the work description or the actual head  count for each meal. Generally, the government was billed based on the  estimated base camp population, but DCAA stated that the billings should  be based on the actual head count, which was lower than the estimated  base camp population included in the work description. As a result, DCAA  withheld funds by reducing payment for dining facilities costs on  contractor billings by 19.35 percent. Ultimately, the DOD and the  contractor negotiated a settlement where it was agreed that $36 million  would not be paid to the contractor.", "In another example, DCAA withheld a payment to the contractor for its  subcontractor\u2019s costs of $12 million related to electrical repair services.  DCAA determined the cost to be unreasonable based on a comparison of  price quotes from other subcontractors for similar electrical repair  services. As a result of the action taken by DCAA to withhold payment, an  Army Corps of Engineers contracting official reviewed contractor data.  The contracting official determined the subcontractor\u2019s price was  reasonable given the short contract time frames. A memo outlining the  Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 rationale for paying the contractor for the  subcontractor costs states, \u201cCorps of Engineers representatives in  Baghdad directed all of the contractors there to do whatever was  necessary, regardless of cost, to meet schedule commitments.\u201d The   $12 million withheld was released to the contractor.

For example,    To address the questioned costs identified in the task orders for the oil  mission, the DOD contracting official convened a meeting to include  the contractor representatives, DCAA officials, and Army Corps of  Engineers officials. As a result of discussions in this meeting, a DCAA  official told us that DCAA stopped questioning some costs such as the  percentage paid to contractor employees for working in a dangerous  area and price adjustments the contractor paid to its subcontractors for  fuel from Turkey. In addition, the DOD contracting official asked DCAA  to provide alternative negotiation positions, and in response DCAA  developed memorandums outlining several options for each task order.  Ultimately the DOD contracting official used a negotiation position  presented in each memorandum to establish the government\u2019s  negotiation position with the contractor. When asked if he was  satisfied with the resolution of the questioned costs, a DCAA official  involved in the process told us he thought the DOD contracting official  did the best job he could.", "In another example, DCAA attended negotiations between the  contractor and the government for an electricity contract. DCAA\u2019s role  at this meeting was to answer questions and to reiterate its opinion.  Subsequent to negotiations, DCAA participated in additional meetings  with the contractor and the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that its  concerns with the contractor purchasing system were addressed.  DCAA officials told us that problems with the contractor purchasing  system were related to the unsupported costs identified in the audit.  DCAA officials involved in this process told us that they were generally  satisfied with the actions taken by DOD and the contractor to resolve  their audit findings.", "In some cases, DOD officials conducted additional analyses in response to  DCAA\u2019s audit findings. For example, for the audit reports we reviewed  related to the oil mission, DCAA questioned the cost of fuel and  transportation based on a comparison between the price paid by the  contractor and the price paid by the Defense Energy Support Center  (DESC) when it took over the mission from the contractor in April 2004.   In response, DOD collected additional information to update the fuel and  transportation cost comparison. For example, although DESC negotiated  prices based on trucks shipping fuel to Iraq three times per month, in  practice the trucks were only able to make two trips per month, a fact that  increased the cost of the mission to DESC.
