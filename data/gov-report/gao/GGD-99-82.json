We, and others, have chronicled IRS\u2019 struggle to modernize and have made scores of recommendations to improve IRS\u2019 operations and its service to taxpayers. Congressional concerns led to a June 1997 report by the National Commission on Restructuring IRS and a series of hearings in 1997 and 1998 that focused on problems at IRS.", "In April 1998, the Senate Committee on Finance held hearings on alleged misconduct by IRS employees in their treatment of other IRS employees and taxpayers. Witnesses testifying at the hearings alleged that (1) senior IRS managers did not receive the same level of disciplinary action as line staff; (2) the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue delayed action on substantiated cases of employee misconduct until senior managers were eligible to retire; (3) IRS retaliated against whistleblowers and against taxpayers and their representatives who were perceived to be noncooperative; (4) IRS employees zeroed out or reduced proposed tax assessments for reasons not related to the merits of the cases; and (5) IRS discriminated against employees in the evaluation process on the basis of race or national origin in its Midwest District Office, which is headquartered in Milwaukee, WI.", "You asked us to review these allegations and, in particular, to evaluate both the specific allegations made at the hearings and any underlying systemic or programmatic problems that needed to be resolved to protect the rights of taxpayers and IRS employees in these areas. This report provides information related to specific allegations regarding IRS senior managers and the Midwest District Office. It also brings together information bearing on the other allegations from our current and past work on systemic problems at IRS.

In addition, a 1997 IRS internal study found that actions taken against lower-level employees more closely conformed to the IRS table of penalties than actions taken against higher-graded employees. However, because of dissimilarities in the types of offenses and incomplete case files, these data do not necessarily prove disparate treatment. Agencies must consider many factors, such as the nature and seriousness of the offense; the employee\u2019s job level and type of employment; whether the offense was intentional, technical, or inadvertent; the employee\u2019s past disciplinary record; and the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency, in deciding what penalty, if any, should be imposed in any given case. IRS recognized that problems have hindered the processing and resolution of employee misconduct cases and has begun revamping its disciplinary systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["For the period we studied, IRS tracked disciplinary cases for GS and SES employees in different systems. The Office of Labor Relations (OLR), which is the personnel office for non-SES staff, handled GS cases. It tracked these cases in the Automated Labor and Employee Relations Tracking System (ALERTS), although IRS officials told us that ALERTS data were often missing or incomplete. The Office of Executive Support (OES), which is the personnel office for IRS executives, handled SES cases. Although ALERTS was supposed to also track SES cases, OES tracked SES cases by using a log and monthly briefing reports. The monthly briefing reports were used to inform the Deputy Commissioner about the status of cases.", "We selected the cases for our study of disciplinary actions for SES and lower-level staff as follows: For GS cases, we used ALERTS data for 22,025 cases received in, or closed by, OLR between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 1998. For SES cases, our information came from two sources: (1) a 70-case random sample of SES nontax misconduct case files that were active between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 1998; and (2) for the same time period, 43 other SES nontax cases reported either in the logs or as \u201coveraged\u201d SES cases in the monthly briefing reports. In total, we looked at 113 cases involving 83 SESers. Unless otherwise noted, all SES statistics presented in this section are based on the random sample. See appendix I for more information on how we selected the cases for our study.", "We were unable to make many meaningful statistical comparisons between SES and GS employee misconduct cases for three reasons. First, we were able to collect more detailed data through our SES file review than from the ALERTS database used for GS cases. This was particularly true regarding dates on which important events occurred. As a result, we could not compare average processing time at each phase of the disciplinary process, although we were able to compare processing times from case receipt through case closure.", "Second, the level of detail and accuracy of ALERTS data varied widely. Some IRS regions historically took ALERTS data entry more seriously than others did, according to an IRS memorandum, and cases contained varying levels of detail about case histories, issues, facts, and analyses. ALERTS had few built-in system controls to ensure data integrity. Instead, IRS relied on managers to ensure the accuracy of their subordinates\u2019 work.", "Third, some data were missing for the majority of the cases tracked in ALERTS. For example, we could not analyze the frequency with which final dispositions were less severe than proposed dispositions because both pieces of information were available for only about 13 percent of the ALERTS cases. Because officials said that ALERTS was OLR\u2019s means of recording information on lower-level disciplinary cases, we used it to the extent that it had information comparable to what we collected on SES cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparisons Between SES and Lower-Level Misconduct Cases", "paragraphs": ["Available data showed that processing time and frequency and type of case dispositions differed for SES and lower-level staff. On average, from OES\u2019 or OLR\u2019s receipt of a case until case closure, SES cases, on the basis of our 70-case random sample, lasted almost a year (352 days) and lower-level cases lasted less than 3 months (80 days).", "We estimated that the largest difference between SES and GS case dispositions occurred in the closed without action (CWA) and clearance categories. As shown in table 1, the dispositions in 73 percent of SES cases were CWA or clearance, versus 26 percent for GS cases. CWA is to be used to close a case when the evidence neither proves nor disproves the allegation(s). A disposition of clearance is to be used when the evidence clearly establishes that the allegations are false. In practice, neither disposition results in a penalty. The actual breakdown between the two dispositions is as follows: for SES cases, 61 percent were CWA and 12 percent were clearance; for GS cases, 24 percent were CWA and 2 percent were clearance.", "Table 1 outlines in order of severity the frequency with which available data indicate that various dispositions were imposed for SES and lower- level staff. SES data are based on the 56 closed cases in our 70-case sample. GS data are based on 15,656 closed cases in ALERTS. Ninety-five- percent confidence intervals for the SES data are presented to more accurately portray our findings. Using these confidence intervals, the rates of occurrence differed between SES and GS cases for dispositions of clearance and CWA, reprimand, suspension, and other. However, using 95- percent confidence intervals and eliminating the CWA or clearance category from the analysis, the rates of occurrence between SES and GS cases were similar for all dispositions, except oral or written counseling and retired/resigned. In any case, we will discuss later in this report that differences in dispositions of SES and GS cases do not necessarily mean that the dispositions were inappropriate or that disparate treatment occurred.", "We also analyzed disciplinary actions for an additional 43 SES cases. Because these cases were not randomly selected, the results may not be representative. Of the 43 cases, we found 9 in the more serious categories\u20146 instances of counseling, 1 reprimand, 1 suspension, and 1 removal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Case- Processing Time and Dispositions", "paragraphs": ["As further detailed in the upcoming section of this report on alleged case- processing delays by the Deputy Commissioner, SES cases took a long time to close for many reasons. These reasons included poor case-tracking procedures, inadequate file management, and poor communication among agency officials involved in the disciplinary process. We do not know to what extent, if any, these difficulties contributed to differences in processing times between SES and GS cases.", "Many factors can affect the discipline imposed in a particular case. These factors include the nature and seriousness of the offense; the employee\u2019s job level and type of employment; whether the offense was intentional, technical, or inadvertent; the employee\u2019s past disciplinary record; and the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency. Collectively, these factors are components of what is known as the Douglas Factors, and they must be considered in determining the appropriate penalty in a case. See appendix II for a listing of the Douglas Factors.", "Not all of the Douglas Factors will be pertinent in every case, and, while some factors will weigh in the employee\u2019s favor (mitigating factors), others may weigh against the employee (aggravating factors). IRS officials told us that lower-level actions tend to be more straightforward than SES actions, with fewer mitigating factors. Since mitigating factors tend to reduce the level of discipline imposed, this could partially explain why penalties might be imposed differently in lower-level cases than in SES cases.", "We found that allegations against SES employees were usually reported to a hotline, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), or the IRS Inspection Service. Because complaints against SES employees can be anonymous, this anonymity can affect IRS\u2019 ability to follow up on a complaint or investigate it thoroughly. In contrast, IRS officials told us that GS cases were generally filed by managers about their subordinates. In these cases, the complainant was known and generally provided concrete evidence to support the allegation.", "Further, typical issues surrounding lower-level cases may be less complicated or easier to successfully investigate than those involving SES employees. Table 2 outlines in more detail the most common issues in SES and lower-level staff cases. SES data are based on our 70-case sample. GS data are based on 22,025 cases in ALERTS. We subjectively classified the issues in SES cases, and our classifications may not be precise. Overall, we found that the most common issue in SES cases was prohibited personnel practices, while time and attendance was the most common issue in GS cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Study of Penalty Guide Effects", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, in response to an internal IRS study reporting a perception that managers received preferential treatment in disciplinary matters, IRS created a table of penalties, the Guide for Penalty Determinations. The purpose of the guide was to ensure that decisions on substantiated cases of misconduct were appropriate and consistent throughout IRS. In 1997 and 1998, IRS studied the effect of the guide on GS and SES employees and found that actions taken against lower-graded employees more closely conformed to the guide than those taken against higher-graded employees (see table 3); for GS employees overall, 91 percent of disciplinary actions conformed to the guide, versus 74 percent for SES employees; when disciplinary actions did not conform to the guide, the actions were below the guide\u2019s prescribed range 93 percent of the time for GS employees overall, versus 100 percent of the time for GS-13 through GS-15 and SES employees; and if admonishments were included as part of reprimands, conformance with the guide approached 100 percent for GS-13 through GS-15 employees.", "The IRS study and IRS officials agreed that the guide had limitations and no longer met IRS needs. Specifically, the guide covered all employees but did not address statutory and regulatory limitations that restricted management\u2019s ability to impose disciplinary suspensions on SES employees. IRS officials said that governmentwide, there was no level of discipline available for SES employees that was more severe than a reprimand but less severe than a suspension of at least 15 days. In contrast, GS employees could have received suspensions of 14 days or less. While the guide prescribed a penalty range of \u201creprimand to suspension,\u201d the only option for SES employees, because of the statutory limitations against suspensions of less than 15 days, was a reprimand if management wished to impose a penalty, but not the harshest available penalty. IRS officials also told us that in certain cases, they might have imposed discipline in between a reprimand and a 15-day suspension had they had the option to do so. According to IRS officials, IRS\u2019 1995 attempt to have the Office of Personnel Management deal with this issue was unsuccessful. Statutory and regulatory requirements could partially explain why reprimands might have been imposed when a harsher disciplinary action might have seemed more appropriate.", "Applying to employees at different levels, the IRS penalty guide was constructed with very broad recommended discipline ranges to provide for management discretion. However, one IRS study pointed out that, in some instances, this rendered the guide useless (e.g., when the penalty range was \u201creprimand to removal\u201d)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Is Making Changes to Its Complaint System", "paragraphs": ["IRS created a disciplinary review team in September 1998.

Its intent was to overcome problems with complaint processing systems\u2019 not (1) communicating or coordinating with each other, (2) capturing the universe of complaints, (3) specifically tracking or accurately measuring complaints, and (4) following up on complaints to ensure that appropriate corrective action had been taken. The team was proposing a 26-person Commissioner\u2019s Review Group to, among other things, manage and analyze complaints sent to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, monitor other IRS complaint systems, and coordinate with the systems\u2019 representatives.

Although OES\u2019 goal for closing an SES case was 90 days, on the basis of our random sample, cases averaged almost 1 year for OES to close.

Once OES received a case, it was to enter it into ALERTS, although it did not always do this, and prepare a case analysis. The case analysis and supporting documents were then to be forwarded to the appropriate Regional Commissioner, Chief, or Executive Officer for Service Center Operations, who was to act as the \u201crecommending official.\u201d Within 30 days, the recommending official was to review the case with the help of local labor relations experts, develop any additional facts deemed appropriate, and return a case report to OES, including a recommendation for disposition.", "If OES disagreed with the report for any reason, it was to include a \u201cstatement of differences\u201d in its case analysis.

At the time of retirement, cases for 2 of the 13 people were pending in the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office, but both of these individuals had been eligible to retire at the time the complaints against them were originally filed. Cases for the remaining 11 of the 13 people either were still being investigated or were pending in OES, that is, they had not yet reached the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s office.

In mid-1998, the Director moved to Labor Relations, and the employee retired, leaving OES with no resident expertise. Previously, four or five case experts handled executive cases. In total, according to an IRS official, the office was understaffed for about 18 months, which caused a case backlog. However, the new Chief of OES was able to bring the staffing level up to eight, including two individuals with employee relations backgrounds to act as team leaders. She also used detailees and a technical contractor to reduce the case backlog.", "The understaffing issue also extended to the labor relations functions in the regions.

The OIG report concluded that Executive C made personal use of some travel benefits earned on government travel.", "The offices considering the case disagreed among themselves over the facts, the adequacy of the investigation, and the steps to be taken next. The Director of IRS\u2019 Human Resources Division, which was involved in executive misconduct cases earlier in the 1990s, advocated a reprimand, but the recommending official thought that significant circumstances mitigated any disciplinary action. OES prepared a statement of differences and recommended a reprimand. A few months later, the recommending official, finding no abuse and unclear IRS guidance in the area, recommended closing the case without action but cautioning the executive. The next month, the OES official who previously recommended a reprimand sent the case to the Deputy Commissioner, this time agreeing with the recommending official\u2019s position. A few months after that, the OIG reminded the Deputy Commissioner of the previous year\u2019s report and requested appropriate action. Later, OIG officials told OES that they disagreed with OES\u2019 recommendation to close the case without action. Finally, OES wrote the Deputy Commissioner reaffirming the recommendation for closure without action but with cautioning.", "The Deputy Commissioner counseled the executive 5-\u00bd years after the case began and 18 months after receiving the case.

OES concluded that a 15-day suspension was warranted for the refusal to answer a question even though IRS counsel was not sure a violation really occurred. OES also raised the possibility of reassigning Executive D. The recommending official believed that, in this case, refusal to answer a question did not violate ethics rules, but that counseling was warranted.", "About 39 months after OES prepared a statement of differences, an Inspection Service case-tracking entry indicated that IRS management planned no action on the case. The next year, OES closed the case \u201cadministratively\u201d due to the employee\u2019s retirement.", "The Deputy Commissioner told us that, several years before its administrative close, the case was \u201cde facto closed\u201d with Executive D\u2019s transfer. He stated that the transfer was the appropriate disciplinary action because Executive D was too familiar with local employees.", "OES did not close the case until the individual retired several years after the transfer.
