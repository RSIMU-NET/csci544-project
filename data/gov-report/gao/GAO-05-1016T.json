Despite its narrowly intended purpose, the SSN is now used for a myriad of non-Social Security purposes. Today, SSNs are used, in part, as identity verification tools for services such as child support collections, law enforcement enhancements, and issuing credit to individuals. Although these uses can be beneficial to the public, the SSN is now a key piece of information in creating false identities. The aggregation of personal information, such as SSNs, in large corporate databases and the increased availability of information via the Internet may provide criminals the opportunities to commit identity theft. Although Congress and the states have enacted a number of laws to protect consumers' privacy, the public and private sectors' continued use of and reliance on SSNs, and the potential for misuse, underscore the importance of strengthening protections where possible. Accordingly, this testimony focuses on describing (1) the public use of SSNs, (2) the use of SSNs by certain private sector entities, and (3) certain federal and state laws regulating the use of SSNs and identity theft."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The public and private sector use of SSNs is widespread. Agencies at all levels of government frequently collect and use SSNs to administer their programs, verify applicants' eligibility for services and benefits, and conduct research and evaluations of their programs. Although some government agencies are taking steps to limit the use and display of SSNs, these numbers are still widely available in a variety of public records held by states, local jurisdictions, and courts. In addition, certain private sector entities that we have reviewed, such as information resellers, credit reporting agencies (CRAs), and health care organizations, also routinely obtain and use SSNs. These entities often obtain SSNs from various public sources or their clients and use SSNs for various purposes, such as building tools that aid in verifying an individual's identity or matching records from various sources. Given the extent to which government and private sector entities use SSNs, Congress has enacted federal laws to restrict the use and disclosure of consumers' personal information, including SSNs. Many states have also enacted their own legislation to restrict the use and display of SSNs, focusing on public display restrictions, SSN solicitation, and customer notifications when SSNs are compromised. Furthermore, Congress has recently introduced consumer privacy legislation similar to enacted state legislation, which in some cases includes SSN restrictions. Although there is some consistency in the various proposed and enacted federal and state laws, gaps remain in protecting individuals' personal information from fraud and identity theft. Some federal agencies are beginning to collect statistics on identity theft crime, which appears to be growing. For example, recent statistics show that identity theft is increasing in New York.

Although the SSN was created as a means to track  workers\u2019 earnings and eligibility for Social Security benefits, it is now also  a vital piece of information needed to function in American society.  Because of its unique nature and broad applicability, the SSN has become  the identifier of choice for public and private sector entities, and it is used  for numerous non-Social Security purposes. Today, U.S. citizens need an  SSN to pay taxes, obtain a driver\u2019s license, or open a bank account, among  other things. For these reasons, the SSN is highly sought by individuals  seeking to create false identities for purposes such as fraudulently  obtaining credit, violating immigration laws, or fleeing the criminal justice  system.", "Recent statistics suggest that the incidence of identity theft is rapidly  growing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimated that over a one- year period nearly 10 million people\u2014or 4.6 percent of the U.S. adult  population\u2014discovered that they were victims of some form of identity  theft, translating into reported losses exceeding $50 billion. Identity theft  also appears to be a serious and growing crime in New York. In 2004, FTC  statistics indicated that over 17,600 New Yorkers reported being victims of  identity theft, up from roughly 7,000 in 2001. However, an FTC survey  found that most victims of identity theft do not report the crime.  Therefore, the total of number of identity thefts is unknown.", "Although there are enacted laws to protect the security of personal  information, the continued use of and reliance on SSNs by public and  private sector entities and the potential for misuse underscore the  importance of identifying areas that can be further strengthened.

My remarks today will focus on  describing the (1) public use of SSNs, (2) the use of SSNs by certain  private sector entities, and (3) federal and state laws regulating the use of  SSNs and identity theft.

In the last year, Congress also has introduced consumer  privacy legislation similar to enacted state legislation, which in some cases  includes SSN restrictions. To date, enacted federal and state laws provide  various ways to protect individual\u2019s personal information and prevent  identity theft.

Today, SSA issues  SSNs to most U.S. citizens, but they are also available to noncitizens  lawfully admitted to the United States with permission to work. Lawfully  admitted noncitizens may also qualify for a SSN for nonwork purposes  when a federal, state, or local law requires that they have a SSN to obtain a  particular welfare benefit or service. SSA staff collect and verify  information from such applicants regarding their age, identity, citizenship,  and immigration status.", "Since its creation, the SSN has evolved beyond its original intended  purpose. This is significant, because these numbers, along with a name  and birth date, are the three pieces of information most often sought by  identity thieves. Once a SSN is obtained fraudulently, it can then be used  as \u201cbreeder\u201d information to create additional false identification  documents, such as driver\u2019s licenses. As shown in figure 1, reported cases  of identity theft are on the rise. In addition, the reported incidents of  identity theft in New York have also risen, in an increase similar to the  overall rise reported in the United States.", "In 1998, Congress made identity theft a federal crime when it enacted the  Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act (Identity Theft Act). The  act made it a criminal offense for a person to \u201cknowingly transfer, possess,  or use without lawful authority,\u201d another person\u2019s means of identification  \u201cwith the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, any  unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of federal law, or that  constitutes a felony under any applicable state or local law.\u201d Under the  act, a name or SSN is considered a \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d and a number  of cases have been prosecuted under this law.", "The Identity Theft Act mandated a specific role for FTC in combating  identity theft. To fulfill the mandate, FTC is collecting identity theft  complaints and assisting victims through a telephone hotline and a  dedicated Web site; maintaining and promoting the Identity Theft Data  Clearinghouse, a centralized database of victim complaints that serves as  an investigative tool for law enforcement; and providing outreach and  education to consumers, law enforcement, and industry. According to  FTC, it receives roughly 15,000 to 20,000 contacts per week on the hotline,  via its Web site, or through the mail from victims and consumers who want  to avoid becoming victims. FTC has said that the callers to its hotline  receive counseling from trained personnel who provide information on  prevention of identity theft and also inform victims of the steps to take to  resolve the problems resulting from the misuse of their identities.", "The increased availability and aggregation of personal information,  including SSNs, has exposed SSNs to potential misuse, and in some cases,  identity theft. Over the last year, several large companies\u2019 databases  containing personal information were compromised, but the extent to  which identity theft resulted from these reported security breaches is  unknown. However, the identity theft crimes that have occurred illustrate  how aggregated personal information can be vulnerable. For example, a  help desk employee at a New York-based software company, which  provided software to its clients to access consumer credit reports, stole  the identities of up to 30,000 individuals by using confidential passwords  and subscriber codes of the company\u2019s customers. The former employee  reportedly sold these identities for $60 each. Furthermore, given the  explosion of Internet use and the ease with which personally identifiable  information is accessible, individuals looking to steal someone\u2019s identity  are increasingly able to do so. In our work, we identified a case where an  individual obtained the names and SSNs of high-ranking U.S. military  officers from a public Web site, and used those identities to apply online  for credit cards and bank credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Sector Entities Use SSNs, and Some Agencies Limit Their Display", "paragraphs": ["As required by a number of federal laws and regulations, agencies at all  levels of government frequently collect and use SSNs to administer their  programs, to link data for verifying applicants\u2019 eligibility for services and  benefits, and to conduct program evaluations.

Such laws and regulations have  contributed to the widespread use of SSNs by government agencies,  because these numbers serve as a unique identifier for such government- related activities like paying taxes.", "Government agencies use SSNs for a variety of reasons. We have found  that agencies typically used the SSN to manage their records and to  facilitate data sharing to verify an applicant\u2019s eligibility for services and  benefits. For example, agency officials at all levels of government we  surveyed reported using SSNs for internal administrative purposes, which  included activities such as identifying, retrieving, and updating records.

For  example, agencies may use SSNs to match records with state and local  correctional facilities to identify individuals for whom the agency should  terminate benefit payments. In addition, SSNs are sometimes used for  statistics, research, and evaluation. For example, the Bureau of the Census  prepares annual population estimates for states and counties using  individual income tax return data linked over time by SSNs to determine  immigration rates between localities.

While some states, such as Arizona, have enacted virtually  identical SSN use and display restrictions, other states have modified the  restrictions in various ways. For example, unlike the California law, which  prohibits the use of the full SSN, the Michigan statute prohibits the use of  more than four sequential digits of the SSN.  The Michigan law also  contains a prohibition against the use of SSNs on identification and  membership cards, permits, and licenses. Missouri\u2019s law includes a  prohibition against requiring an individual to use his or her SSN as an  employee number.  Oklahoma\u2019s law is unique in that it only limits the ways  in which employers may use their employees\u2019 SSNs, and does not apply  more generally to other types of transactions and activities.", "Some states have recently enacted other types of restrictions on the uses  of SSNs as well. Both Arkansas and Colorado prohibit the use of a  student\u2019s SSN as a student identification number. New Mexico requires  businesses that have acquired consumer SSNs to adopt internal policies to  limit access to authorized employees. Texas recently enacted a law  requiring businesses to properly dispose of business records that contain a  customer\u2019s personal identifying information, which is defined to include  SSNs.", "Other recent state legislation includes new restrictions on state and local  government agencies. For example, South Dakota law prohibits the  display of SSNs on all driver\u2019s licenses and nondriver\u2019s identification  cards, while Indiana law prohibits a state agency from releasing a SSN  unless otherwise required by law. In addition, a Nevada law requires  governmental agencies, except in certain circumstances, to ensure that the  SSNs recorded in their books and on their records are maintained in a  confidential manner.", "We also identified three states that have passed legislation containing  notification requirements in the event of a security breach, similar to the  recently enacted New York law requiring such notifications. California  requires a business or a California state agency to notify any California  resident whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably  believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. In the last  year, this law forced several large companies to notify individuals that  their information was compromised because of certain circumstances.  Under a Nevada law, government agencies and certain persons who do  business in the state must notify individuals if their personal information is  reasonably believed to have been compromised. Similarly, Georgia  requires certain private sector entities to notify their customers if a  security breach occurred that compromised their customers\u2019 personal  information, such as their SSNs.", "At the time of this writing, Congress is also considering consumer privacy  legislation, which in some cases includes SSN restrictions. As of August  18, 2005, there were approximately 22 proposed bills pending before the  U.S. House and Senate. In many cases, the provisions being considered  mirrored provisions in enacted state laws. For example, some of the  proposed legislation included prohibitions on the display of SSNs, similar  to the concept of Colorado\u2019s law prohibiting the display of a person\u2019s SSN  on a license, pass, or certificate, issued by a public entity, except under  certain circumstances. Several other pieces of proposed federal  legislation address the solicitation of SSNs by public and private sector  entities.

For example, New York law makes identity theft a crime. In  other states, identity theft statutes also address specific crimes committed  under a false identity. For example, Arizona law prohibits any person from  using deceptive means to alter certain computer functions or use software  to collect bank information, take control of another person\u2019s computer, or  prevent the operator from blocking the installation of specific software.  In addition, Idaho law makes it unlawful to impersonate any state official  to seek, demand, or obtain personally identifiable information of another  person.

For  example, with the theft of identity information, a perpetrator may commit  computer fraud when using a stolen identity to fraudulently obtain credit  on the Internet. Computer fraud may also be the primary vehicle used to  obtain identity information when the offender obtains unauthorized access  to another computer or Web site to obtain such information. As a result,  the offender may be charged with both identity theft and computer fraud.", "According to a Department of Justice official, the investigation of identity  theft is labor intensive and individual cases are usually considered to be  too small for federal prosecution. Moreover, perpetrators usually prey on  multiple victims in multiple jurisdictions. Consequently, a number of  federal law enforcement agencies can have a role in investigating identity  theft crimes. How the thief uses an individual\u2019s identity usually dictates  which federal agency has jurisdiction in the case. For example, if an  individual finds that an identity thief has stolen the individual\u2019s mail to  obtain credit cards, bank statements, or tax information, the victim should  report the crime to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement  arm of the U.S. Postal Service.

Given the significance of the SSN in  committing fraud or stealing a person\u2019s identity, it is imperative that steps  be taken to protect this number. This is especially true as information  technology makes it easier to access individuals\u2019 personal information.  The increased availability and aggregation of personal information in  public and private sector databases and via the Internet has provided new  opportunities for individuals to engage in fraudulent activities. Without  proper regulations or safeguards in place, SSNs will remain vulnerable to  misuse, thus adding to the growing number of identity theft victims.", "Current federal restrictions on SSNs and other personal information are  industry specific and do not apply broadly.  Certain industries, such as the  financial services industry, are required to protect individuals' personal  information while others are not. In addition, given the industry specific  nature of federal laws, no single federal agency has responsibility for  ensuring the protection of individuals' personal information.   Consequently, gaps remain at the federal level in protecting individuals'  personal information.", "State legislatures have also placed restrictions on SSNs by enacting laws  that restrict the use and display of SSNs and prohibit the theft of  individuals' personal information.  However, gaps also remain at the state  level because not all states have enacted laws to protect individuals'  personal information. In addition, while there is some consistency among  enacted state laws, privacy protections and identity theft prevention varies  with the focus of each state's legislature.", "As legislatures at both the federal and state level continue to enact laws to  protect individuals' personal information, gaps in protections will need to  be determined and addressed in order to prevent SSNs and other personal  information from being misused.  We are pleased that the Assembly is  concentrating on this important policy issue, and we hope our work will  be helpful to you.  That concludes my testimony, and I would be pleased to  respond to any questions.", "For further information regarding this testimony, please contact Barbara  D.
