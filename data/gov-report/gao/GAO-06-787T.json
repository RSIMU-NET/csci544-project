While there was some overlap, states reported using Title IV-B subpart 1 funds primarily to operate child welfare programs and serve families in the foster care system, while states reported using subpart 2 funds primarily for family services targeted to families at risk of child removal due to abuse or neglect. For example, nearly half of subpart 1 staff costs paid salaries for social worker positions in child protective services. Family services under subpart 2 included those to support, preserve, and reunify families by providing mentoring programs, financial assistance to help with rent and utilities, parenting classes, child care, and support groups. HHS provided relatively little oversight specific to state spending under subpart 1. HHS did not collect data on subpart 1 expenditures and regional officials paid little attention to statutory limits in states' planned use of funds. In response to GAO's survey, 10 states reported actual 2002 subpart 1 expenditures that exceeded the sending limits by over $15 million in total. Research is limited assessing the effectiveness of services provided under Title IV-B. In GAO's survey, 22 states reported providing services other than foster care and adoption assistance payments, staff salaries, or administration under subpart 1; however, none of these states had sufficiently evaluated the outcomes of these services. Similarly, GAO's literature review showed that few evaluations had been conducted, and evaluations that had been conducted showed mixed results. HHS evaluations of subpart 2 services also have shown no or little effect in reducing out-of-home placement, maltreatment recurrence, or improved family functioning beyond what normal casework services achieved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to present information from our 2003 report  on how states used funds authorized under Title IV-B of the Social  Security Act to help families address problems that lead to child abuse and  neglect and subsequent separation of children from their families. For  federal fiscal year 2004, child protective services (CPS) staff in state and  local child welfare agencies reported investigating or assessing an  estimated 3 million allegations of child maltreatment and determined that  approximately 872,000 children had been the victims of child abuse or  neglect by their parents or other caregivers. Established in 1935, Title IV-B  first authorized funds to states that could be used to provide a wide array  of child welfare services including those necessary to investigate reports  of child maltreatment, remove children from their home and place them  with a temporary foster family, help preserve or reunify families, and place  children who cannot be safely reunified with their families in an adoptive  home.", "The Congress has passed various laws over the years emphasizing the  need for states to use Title IV-B funding to provide supportive services to  preserve and reunify families. In 1980, for example, the Adoption  Assistance and Child Welfare Act established a dollar cap on the amount  of child welfare funds that states could use under Title IV-B for foster care  and certain other activities to encourage states to use additional funding  for services to families. In 1993, the Congress established the family  preservation and family support services program under Title IV-B subpart  2, authorizing funding to states for family preservation and community- based family support services. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997  further encouraged spending on family support services by reauthorizing  subpart 2, renaming it Promoting Safe and Stable Families, and expanding  the types of programs on which states were authorized to spend Title IV-B  funds to include adoption promotion and support services and time- limited family reunification services. In fiscal year 2006, the Congress  appropriated $287 million for child welfare services under subpart 1 and  $394 million for family support services under subpart 2. These funds are  administered to states by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF).", "My testimony today is primarily based on information included in our 2003  report. Specifically, I will be discussing: (1) how states used Title IV-B  dollars to serve families under subparts 1 and 2; (2) the extent that federal  oversight ensured state compliance with spending requirements under  subpart 1; and (3) what the research said about the effectiveness of  services states have provided to families using Title IV-B funds.", "In summary, while overlap exists, states reported using Title IV-B subpart  1 funds primarily to staff and administer child welfare programs and serve  families in the foster care system, while states reported using subpart   2 funds primarily for prevention and support services for families at risk of  child abuse and neglect. It is difficult, however, to clearly differentiate  among the various service categories and populations served. HHS  provided relatively little oversight in how states spent federal funds under  subpart 1, and at least 10 states spent a total of over $15 million over the  legislated cap for foster care and adoption assistance payments. Although  the predominance of federal funding spent for foster care and adoption  assistance has long been cited as providing a disincentive to preserve and  reunify families, little research is available on the effectiveness of the  services subpart 1 funds provide and HHS evaluations of services funded  under subpart 2 have generally shown no or little effect.  Similarly, the  extent that differences in how states spent funds to support children and  families resulted in better or worse outcomes for children is unknown.", "To help address this information gap, our 2003 report recommended that  the Secretary of HHS consider the feasibility of collecting and using data  on states\u2019 use of Title IV-B subpart 1 funds. We made this recommendation  not only to facilitate federal oversight and analysis of how states\u2019 spending  patterns correlate to child outcomes, but also so that HHS could use this  data to inform the design of alternative funding proposals that would give  states more flexibility in spending federal child welfare funds. We also  recommended that the Secretary provide the necessary guidance to ensure  compliance with statutory restrictions on the use of Title IV-B subpart  1funds.  ACF agreed with our findings and implemented guidance to states  reminding them of the statutory requirements for subpart 1 spending.   However, ACF disagreed with our recommendation to consider collecting  data on subpart 1 expenditures. ACF believed that its level of oversight  was commensurate with the scope and intent of subpart 1, noting that its  oversight efforts were more appropriately focused on reviews of the  states\u2019 overall child welfare systems. ACF did not comment on our  recommendation to use such data to inform the design of an alternative  financing option.", "Our review was based on two surveys to child welfare directors to obtain  information on how they use Title IV-B funds. We also visited four states\u2014 California, New Jersey, Ohio, and Washington\u2014where we interviewed  state and local officials and service providers. We also held discussions  with HHS headquarters and regional office officials and child welfare  experts. We reviewed results from HHS\u2019s assessments of state child  welfare agencies as well as the literature assessing the effectiveness of  various child welfare services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Title IV-B of the Social Security Act authorizes funds to states to provide  an array of child welfare services to prevent the occurrence of abuse,  neglect, and need to place children in foster care. The Administration for  Children and Families within HHS is responsible for the administration  and oversight of federal funding to states for child welfare services under  Title IV-B. HHS headquarters staff are responsible for developing  appropriate policies and procedures for states to follow in obtaining and  using federal child welfare funds, while staff in HHS\u2019s 10 regional offices  are responsible for providing direct oversight of state child welfare  systems. No federal eligibility criteria apply to the children and families  receiving services funded under Title IV-B. The amount of subpart 1 funds  a state receives is based on its population under the age of 21 and the state  per capita income, while subpart 2 funding is determined by the  percentage of children in a state whose families receive food stamps.", "Subpart 1 provides grants to states for child welfare services, that are  broadly defined. Subpart 1 funds are intended for services that are  directed toward the accomplishment of the following purposes:    protect and promote the welfare of all children;    prevent or remedy problems that may result in the abuse or neglect    prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families  by helping families address problems that can lead to out-of-home  placements;  reunite children with their families;    place children in appropriate adoptive homes when reunification is  not possible; and    ensure adequate care to children away from their homes in cases in  which the child cannot be returned home or cannot be placed for  adoption.", "Subpart 2 services are similar to those allowed under subpart 1, although  the range of services allowed under subpart 2 is more limited in some  cases. For example, time-limited family reunification services can only be  provided during a child\u2019s first 15 months in foster care, while no such  restriction is placed on the use of subpart 1 funds. In addition, states must  spend a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of their subpart 2 funds on each of four  service categories:    Family preservation service. Services designed to help families at  risk or in crisis, including services to (1) help reunify children with  their families when safe and appropriate; (2) place children in  permanent homes through adoption, guardianship, or some other  permanent living arrangement; (3) help children at risk of foster  care placement remain safely with their families; (4) provide follow- up assistance to families when a child has been returned after a  foster care placement; (5) provide temporary respite care; and   (6) improve parenting skills.", "Family support services. Community-based services to promote  the safety and well-being of children and families designed to  increase the strength and stability of families, to increase parental  competence, to provide children a safe and supportive family  environment, to strengthen parental relationships, and to enhance  child development. Examples of such services include parenting  skills training and home visiting programs for first time parents of  newborns.", "Time-limited family reunification services. Services provided to a  child placed in foster care and to the parents of the child in order to  facilitate the safe reunification of the child within 15 months of  placement. These services include counseling, substance abuse  treatment services, mental health services, and assistance to  address domestic violence.", "Adoption promotion and support services: Services designed to  encourage more adoptions of children in foster care when adoption  is in the best interest of the child, including services to expedite the  adoption process and support adoptive families.", "Federal child welfare funding has long been criticized for entitling states  to reimbursement for foster care placements, while providing little funding  for services to prevent such placements. When the Congress enacted the  Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, it created a new  funding source for foster care and adoption assistance under Title IV-E of  the Social Security Act. Title IV-E provides an open-ended entitlement for  foster care maintenance payments to cover a portion of the food, housing,  and incidental expenses for all foster children whose parents meet certain  federal eligibility criteria. Title IV-E also provides payments to adoptive  parents of eligible foster children with special needs. While states could  still use Title IV-B funding for foster care and adoption assistance for  children ineligible under Title IV-E, the law established a dollar cap on the  amount of Title IV-B funds that states could use for three categories of  service: foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance payments,  and child care related to a parent\u2019s employment or training. The law  requires that the total of subpart 1 funds used for these categories cannot  exceed a state\u2019s total 1979 subpart 1 expenditures for all types of services.  The intent of this restriction, according to a congressional document, was  to encourage states to devote increases in subpart 1 funding as much as  possible to supportive services that could prevent the need for out-of- home placements. However, this restriction applies only to the federal  portion of subpart 1 expenditures, as the law provides that states may use  any or all of their state matching funds for foster care maintenance  payments.", "For the fourth consecutive year, the President\u2019s budget proposes a Child  Welfare Program Option. HHS developed the proposal to give states more  flexibility in using Title IV-E foster care funds for preventive services such  as those under Title IV-B. Under this proposal, states could voluntarily  choose to receive a fixed IV-E foster care allocation (based on historic  expenditure rates) over a 5-year period, rather than receiving a per child  allocation. States could use this allocation for any services provided under  Titles IV-B and IV-E, but would also have to fund any foster care  maintenance payments and associated administrative costs from this fixed  grant or use state funds. No legislation to enact this option has been  introduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Used Subparts 1 and 2 to Support Similar Services and Populations, but Funding Emphasis Differed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Emphasized Different Services under Subparts 1 and 2", "paragraphs": ["While states funded similar services under subparts 1 and 2, most states  reported using subpart 1 funds primarily to pay for costs associated with  operating child welfare programs, while most states reported using  subpart 2 funds for family services as shown in table 1.

HHS officials explained that states\u2019 actual  expenditures may vary from planned expenditures as states address  unforeseen circumstances.

HHS required  states to submit their initial spending plans for the upcoming year by June  30, prior to states receiving information on program appropriations for the  upcoming year. While we did not conduct a review comparing state  submitted planned expenditures to actual expenditures for previous years,  we did identify instances that suggested differences in planned and actual  expenditures as well as data on actual expenditures that were not always  accurate.
