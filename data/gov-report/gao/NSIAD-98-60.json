A primary intent of the certification process is to strengthen the political will of a country to combat illegal drug-trafficking activities. Section 490 requires the President to certify by March 1 of each year which major drug-producing and transit countries cooperated fully with the United States or took adequate steps on their own to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives established by the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances during the previous year. If a country has not met the statutory objectives, the President can either deny certification and impose sanctions or grant a vital national interests certification, which recognizes that the requirement to use sanctions against a noncooperating country would threaten the vital national interests of the United States.", "Since the certification process was first established in 1986, the number of nations subject to the certification process has ranged from 24 to 31. The number of nations denied certification has ranged from 3 to 6 annually, and the number of nations granted a vital national interest certification has ranged from 1 to 6. In every year prior to 1995, Colombia received full certification. However, Colombia was granted a vital national interests certification in 1995 and was denied certification in 1996 and 1997.

In March 1997, the State Department reported that Colombian coca cultivation had increased by about 50 percent since 1994. U.S. officials attributed this increase to the successful reduction of about 50 percent of the known air-related drug-trafficking activities between Colombia and Peru between 1992 and 1996. According to U.S. reports, this reduction led to a glut of cocaine base in Peru, which in turn led to a plunge in the price of cocaine base and a subsequent reduction in coca cultivation. In March 1997, the State Department reported that coca cultivation in Peru declined by 18 percent between 1995 and 1996. According to U.S. officials, drug-trafficking organizations thus began to increase coca cultivation in Colombia to ensure a constant supply of coca leaf.", "The Colombian government has disrupted the activities of two major drug-trafficking organizations, the Medellin and Cali cartels, by either capturing or killing their key leaders. However, this disruption has not reduced drug-trafficking activities.

These two groups, with an estimated strength of about 10,000 to 15,000 personnel, have increasingly hindered the Colombian government\u2019s counternarcotics efforts.", "In 1993, we reported that both these groups were involved in drug-related activities and that they controlled or influenced large sections of Colombia, particularly in the sparsely populated south.

In February 1997, a U.S. interagency assessment of the role of the insurgents in drug-related activities concluded that the insurgents, primarily the FARC, were diversifying their involvement in several ways. For example, insurgents provide security to assist traffickers in processing and transporting narcotics in exchange for money and weapons. Furthermore, a few insurgent groups are involved in localized, small-scale drug cultivation and processing. In March 1997, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Southern Command testified before the Senate Armed Forces Committee that the FARC\u2019s narcotics-related income for 1995 reportedly totaled $647 million.", "According to U.S. officials, the task of conducting counternarcotics operations is made more difficult for the Colombian police and military because of the increasing strength of the insurgent groups. These officials stated that the insurgents are strengthening their control in certain sections of Colombia. An October 1997 Defense Department analysis concluded that the groups are becoming more sophisticated and pose a greater threat to the Colombian military. In addition, narcotics-related violence in Colombia has traditionally been extensive. For example, in February 1997, the Director of the Colombian National Police and the General Commander of the Military Forces of Colombia testified before the House of Representatives that 366 Colombian police and military personnel were killed in 1996 and that since 1980 more than 3,000 Colombian policemen have died."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The narcotics threat from Colombia continues and may be expanding.

State also reported that a 1996 survey by the Council of American Enterprises, an American business consortium in Colombia, concluded that because its U.S. member companies could not receive financing from the Export-Import Bank under decertification, they lost $875 million in potential sales, mostly to Asian and European competitors. According to a State Department official, State did not validate the information in the Council\u2019s survey.

Our review of U.S. and Colombian records and discussions with various U.S. and Colombian officials indicated that most counternarcotics operations were maintained despite the aid cutoff.

The canceled training for Colombian police and military officials in U.S. schools was in a variety of areas, including human rights.

They also indicated that the delay in other assistance had some impact on the ability of the Colombian police and military units to expand counternarcotics operations. For example, Colombia\u2019s Chief of the Counternarcotics Police stated that because of the cutoff of U.S. assistance, certain types of explosives could not be provided. As a result, he stated, the police could destroy only 80 of the 210 airstrips they had planned to destroy in 1996.", "The impacts from assistance delays were minimized because the Departments of State and Defense and the Colombian Ministry of Defense used other funding and procurement sources to continue to provide critical logistics, spare parts, and training to Colombia\u2019s counternarcotics forces to sustain operations. Both the Colombian police and military purchased spare parts directly from various commercial sources and used their existing inventories to maintain their operational readiness rates. These parts, however, were substantially more expensive than they would have been had U.S. grant assistance been available. For example, the Colombian police reported that certain helicopter parts bought commercially cost 150 percent more than parts purchased through U.S. military assistance channels. In addition, the U.S. Embassy used some State INC funds and some Defense Department funds to support Colombian police and military eradication and interdiction efforts.", "As a result of these actions, the Colombian police reported improvements in operational rates for their helicopters. Police reports showed that helicopter operational rates for counternarcotics operations were about 60 percent for the 2 months prior to the March 1, 1996, decertification decision. However, from March 1996 to June 1997, the police helicopter operational rates were consistently in the 70-percent range. In addition, according to an Embassy report, the Colombian air force increased the number of flying hours dedicated to counternarcotics activities from 10,182 in 1995 to 10,605 in 1996.", "State Department data also indicates that Colombian police units were able to continue conducting counternarcotics operations. For example, in March 1997, the State Department reported that the number of cocaine laboratories destroyed by the Colombian law enforcement agencies more than doubled, from 396 in 1995 to 861 in 1996. During this same period, the amount of cocaine seized increased from about 22 metric tons to 24 metric tons. The U.S. Embassy reported that during 1997 the Colombian national police seized about 31 metric tons of cocaine.", "U.S. and Colombian officials stated that they were forced to rely much more heavily on available equipment. For example, one of two DC-3 aircraft, cargo aircraft essential for supporting eradication and interdiction operations of the Colombian police, was grounded by a serious accident in August 1995. About 4 months after the accident occurred, the Colombian police forwarded a request to the Narcotics Affairs Section to repair it. The U.S. Embassy approved the request 2 days later. As a result of the March 1996 decertification decision, the State Department could not decide if it could provide funds to repair the aircraft. In July 1996, the U.S. Embassy made the decision to repair the aircraft commercially, and repairs were completed by the contractor in December 1996. A primary reason for the delay in repairing the aircraft was that State Department officials were unable to determine whether the repairs were allowed under decertification. Because this aircraft was not available during this time, the U.S. Embassy reported that the police had to double the use of the remaining DC-3 to conduct operations. Even so, it was impossible for the Colombian counternarcotics police to make up for the lost time, according to Narcotics Affairs Section officials. Furthermore, according to the Section, the counternarcotics police could not conduct additional activities because of the inoperative DC-3."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Over Sustainment of Counternarcotics Activities", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our visit in May 1997, U.S. Embassy officials said that while the use of commercial and other sources had enabled the Colombian police and military to continue counternarcotics operations after the interruption in U.S. assistance, the higher expenditures for items and the effectiveness of operations could not be sustained over a long period. In May 1997, the U.S. Embassy reported that the government of Colombia, as part of an overall budget reduction decision, had reduced the 1997 budget for the Ministry of Defense by 30 percent less than the 1996 budget. U.S. and Colombian officials stated that operations could not continue at their current rate unless the United States provides additional assistance in the future.", "Part of the sustainment concerns may have been addressed when the President issued a national security waiver in August 1997 that allowed the release of counternarcotics assistance.

State and the U.S. Embassy could not fully support planned counternarcotics activities because they were not well prepared for the consequences of expanding the coca aerial eradication program. Funding used to support the aerial eradication effort came at the expense of other counternarcotics activities. Moreover, State did not take steps to ensure that equipment included in a $40 million assistance package from Defense Department inventories was consistent with the priority needs of the counternarcotics forces of the Colombian police and military or with the Embassy\u2019s counternarcotics plan. As a result, the assistance package included equipment that may be of limited benefit to the Colombian police and military and will require additional funding not budgeted for in Embassy plans.

According to State officials, the decision was made primarily to improve upon the results achieved in 1995 and 1996 in eradicating coca and opium poppy. However, State had not developed an operational plan and had not fully coordinated with the Narcotics Affairs Section in the Embassy to implement the program increase. As a result, the Section was unprepared for the escalation in costs to support this effort and was unable to fully support other programs meant to achieve the Embassy\u2019s counternarcotics objectives. In addition, other components at the Embassy, including DEA and Defense representatives, complained that the State Department was not adequately supporting their activities to help meet the Embassy\u2019s counternarcotics objectives.", "During fiscal year 1997, State increased the number of aircraft and U.S. contractor personnel involved in the aerial eradication program.

The contractor personnel\u2019s role also changed from being primarily responsible for training Colombian pilots and mechanics to directly maintaining aircraft and actively participating in planning and conducting eradication operations.

According to various Embassy reports, these changes were caused by unforeseen costs incurred as the result of the State Department\u2019s decision to increase support for aerial eradication. For example, in April 1997, the Narcotics Affairs Section reported that it would require an additional $1.4 million for unanticipated costs associated with providing adequate security for contractor personnel at several remote eradication locations and that this estimate did not include costs associated with other major sites used to conduct eradication missions. According to the Section Director, an additional $3 million to $4 million to upgrade security at these locations was not included in the Embassy\u2019s program budget. Furthermore, the Section reported that it had to reallocate $11 million from other projects to support various aspects of the increased eradication efforts. As a result, by July 1997, the Section reported to State that it could not fully support activities such as interdiction efforts, demand reduction, and other efforts designed to strengthen the law enforcement institutions of Colombia. The Section also reported its concerns about adequate funding for these activities in fiscal years 1998 and 1999.", "Various components at the U.S. Embassy also raised concerns about State\u2019s emphasis on eradication at the expense of their programs.

DEA officials indicated that State\u2019s focus on coca eradication displaced support for opium poppy eradication and other drug-related law enforcement activities. DEA officials also stated that the proposed coca eradication program failed to respond to key elements of the U.S. counternarcotics objectives for Colombia.", "State officials agreed that the Embassy was not well prepared to manage the escalation of costs associated with the increase in support for aerial eradication. However, they pointed out that the spray program has been successful, with about 42,000 hectares of coca sprayed by the end of December 1997.
