Each facility includes storage areas, referred to as bays.", "Agency records centers : Agencies also establish and operate records centers for storing their own records. As of May 2013, NARA had identified 18 agency records centers that were operated by 6 agencies or offices.", "Commercial records storage facilities : Agencies also use private sector commercial facilities. As of May 2013, agencies reported that 12 vendors provided 22 facilities, which were used by 11 agencies.", "These facilities notwithstanding, NARA does not know where all agencies are storing records. NARA has solicited data from agencies about their use of agency records centers and commercial records storage facilities, but not all agencies have submitted data. Further, the data agencies submitted--mostly from 2008 and 2009--are now outdated. As a result, NARA cannot be assured that all agencies are using one of the three types of authorized facilities.", "NARA determined that 20 of its 24 federal records center facilities were fully compliant with 36 C.F.R. Part 1234 because all of their bays satisfied the regulation; of the remaining 4, 2 facilities with inadequate shelving were partially compliant, 1 facility with insufficient protections against pipe leaks was not compliant, and the remaining facility was to be replaced. As of July 2013, NARA had plans to bring these 4 facilities into full compliance, but did not have a schedule for completing the plans at 2 of the facilities. As a result, NARA does not have a basis for determining progress toward correcting deficiencies in those facilities that do not yet fully meet the standards. Also, while NARA had approved 10 agency records centers and 22 commercial records storage facilities, it has inspected 1 of 18 agency records centers and 13 commercial records storage facilities. Until NARA completes planned inspections of all remaining facilities, it cannot be reasonably assured that agencies are storing records in facilities that meet standards.", "To facilitate the protection of federal records from permanent damage, NARA had generally taken steps consistent with a checklist it requires federal records centers to follow when incidents (e.g., roof or sprinkler leaks) occur. However, it did not always document the results of its efforts to minimize damage because the checklist does not include a step for doing so. Specifically, of the 55 incidents that occurred from January 2009 through March 2013, NARA provided documentation about the final outcome for 46 incidents. For the remaining 9 incidents, it could not provide documentation that included the final results of its efforts. Without a process that includes documenting the results of its efforts, NARA is not positioned to fully report on the effectiveness of its actions to minimize damage to federal records and to provide a third party with information to validate the results of its efforts.", "Storage fees are determined by NARA's Federal Records Centers Program and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer using the existing fee schedule, expense projections, and workload projections. The storage fees charged by NARA in fiscal year 2013 were comparable to fees charged by commercial vendors in that same time frame.

These fees are to be developed for the upcoming fiscal year  using the current fiscal year fee schedule, expense projections, and  workload projections for NARA\u2019s records centers. In determining the fees,  it is to consider costs associated with full operation of the records storage  facilities, taking into consideration expenses, such as reserves for  accrued annual leave, worker\u2019s compensation, depreciation of capitalized  equipment and shelving, and amortization of IT software and systems.  Annually, all federal records centers are required to submit expense and  workload projections to the Federal Records Centers Program  headquarters operation. The expense and workload projections are used  to develop budget and revenue projections, which are then used as the  basis to develop rates for the upcoming fiscal year. Factors such as  inflation, customer impact, the frequency of rate change, and  competitiveness with the private sector are then considered when  developing new rates.", "The fees developed for the upcoming fiscal year are approved by the  Director of the Federal Records Centers Program, Executive for Agency  Services, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer before  receiving final approval from the Archivist.

Table 6 provides  a comparison of storage fees for NARA and these 5 commercial vendors  for fiscal year 2013.", "As shown in the table, NARA\u2019s fee of $0.23 per cubic foot was consistent  regardless of the storage quantity. Specifically, NARA\u2019s fee was higher  than fees charged by vendors 1 and 2, although its fees were lower than  those of vendors 3 and 5. In addition, NARA\u2019s fees were lower than those  of vendor 4 if storing less than 100,000 cubic feet and higher if storing  100,000 or more cubic feet. NARA also did not charge additional fees that  certain vendors charged. Specifically, vendors 1, 3, and 4 applied a $65,  $25, and $100 fee, respectively, to a customer\u2019s account when the  storage charges did not meet the customer\u2019s contractual minimum  storage requirement.

Although it has  plans for bringing these four facilities into full compliance with the  regulations, NARA has not established dates for completing its plans at  two of the facilities. As a result, NARA does not have a basis for  determining progress toward correcting deficiencies in those facilities that  do not fully meet the standards  Additionally, although NARA has taken steps to prevent permanent  damage to records in their facilities on a total of 55 occasions over a  recent 4-year time period, the federal records centers did not always keep  track of the results of their efforts and were unable to provide  documentation confirming they were successful in 9 cases.

Part 1234, (3) determine what actions NARA has  taken to minimize damage to records in federal records centers and the  extent to which it documents such efforts, and (4) determine how NARA  determines storage fees and whether fees differ among facilities.", "To accomplish the first objective, we reviewed 36 C.F.R. Part 1234 and  developed a thorough understanding of the regulation through  discussions with NARA officials who are responsible for administering it.  We then obtained lists of NARA, agency, and commercial records storage  facilities from NARA. These lists included NARA\u2019s central registry of  approved facilities. We corroborated the lists by comparing them with  other documentation such as facility approval memoranda and inspection  schedules, as well as through interviews with agency officials.  Additionally, we obtained NARA\u2019s database of agencies\u2019 records storage  facilities and discussed NARA\u2019s methods for populating the database with  responsible NARA officials. We determined the database to be unreliable  because it was incomplete, outdated, and largely reliant on self-reported  data from agencies.", "For the second objective, we obtained and reviewed memoranda from  NARA that indicated approval of NARA, agency, and commercial records  storage facilities and the facilities\u2019 compliance with 36 C.F.R. Part 1234.  We then used additional documentation, including detailed facility  inspection checklists, fire inspection reports, and structural engineering  reports to determine the existence of support for NARA\u2019s approval  determinations. We also discussed NARA\u2019s method for approving and  inspecting facilities, in addition to plans for conducting future facility  inspections with the officials who are responsible for performing the  inspections.", "To accomplish the third objective, we reviewed NARA policies and  procedures for the storage and management of federal records and  compared them with applicable internal control standards. We also  reviewed procedures for handling records damage in NARA records  centers and documentation relative to records emergency planning and  training. We collected and analyzed documentation on 55 incidents that  occurred at NARA records centers from January 2009 through March  2013, including reports that described NARA\u2019s actions to mitigate or  reduce records damage. We also compared requirements in NARA\u2019s  1561 checklist to the documentation described above. Further, we  interviewed NARA officials to determine the actions taken to minimize  records damage in federal records centers and corroborated the officials\u2019  statements with aforementioned documentation.", "To accomplish the fourth objective, we obtained and analyzed  documentation from the NARA Federal Records Centers Program and  General Services Administration (GSA) schedules that identified and  discussed records storage fees and then compared fees among records  storage facilities. To determine the reliability of the data provided from  NARA, we performed basic steps to ensure the data provided were valid,  and reviewed relevant information describing the data. We reviewed  documentation related to the data sources, including NARA\u2019s fiscal year  2013 fee schedule, fee determination process description documents,  and workload and expense projections. Although we could not  independently verify the reliability of all this information, we compared the  data with other available supporting documents to determine data  consistency and reasonableness. We also obtained price lists from GSA\u2019s  website for commercial vendors that listed facilities that are compliant  with 36 C.F.R. Part 1234. We did not determine whether individual  agencies had negotiated lower prices than those listed in the price lists.  We compared storage fees for NARA and commercial vendors by  extracting fee data from NARA\u2019s fee schedule and commercial vendor  price lists. For our comparison, we reviewed the publicly available price  lists for five commercial vendors (referred to as vendors 1-5 in our  analysis). Four of the five vendors\u2019 price lists charged storage fees based  on cubic feet of storage per month and the fifth vendor charged based on  the number of boxes stored. In order to directly compare fees  established by NARA and the five vendors, we converted boxes to cubic  feet for vendor 5. Storage fees were then arranged in order from lowest to  highest.", "We supplemented our analyses with interviews of NARA officials who are  knowledgeable about the Federal Records Centers Program, including  NARA\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, the program director, and assistant  director.
