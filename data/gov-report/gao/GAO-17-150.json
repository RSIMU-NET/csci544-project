In comparison, the number of U.S. fatalities  (approximately 650,000) from the 1918-1919 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic is  equivalent to about 64 percent of those battlefield fatalities. Extrapolating  from data on influenza fatalities from 1918 to 2011\u2014the most recent  analysis available\u2014the U.S. Army projects that fatalities in the United  States alone from a severe infectious disease pandemic would be over   2 million. Moreover, influenza viruses\u2014especially highly pathogenic  influenza strains like H5N1\u2014remain an urgent global infectious disease  threat. As of January 2017, the World Health Organization had confirmed  856 human cases of H5N1 infection worldwide between 2003 and 2017,  and almost 53 percent of those infections were fatal.", "A severe infectious disease pandemic is a unique type of disaster and  differs from other disasters because of the transmissibility of influenza  viruses, the universal susceptibility of the world\u2019s population to viruses  that have not previously circulated, and the mobility of human  populations. A pandemic occurs when an infectious agent emerges\u2014 such as a novel influenza virus\u2014that can be efficiently transmitted  between humans and has spread across international borders. It could be  natural, accidental, or deliberate in origin, occurring over a wide  geographic area. A pandemic has the potential to affect the Department  of Defense\u2019s (DOD) ability to accomplish its mission and may result in  significant increases in requests for DOD assistance from civil authorities  if they become overwhelmed in responding to it. A pandemic could  significantly impair the military\u2019s readiness, jeopardize ongoing military  operations abroad, and threaten the day-to-day functioning of the  department if a large percentage of its personnel are sick or absent. A  pandemic outbreak would be not only a medical problem, but also a  personnel and national security problem. Federal officials anticipate that a  pandemic would occur in multiple waves over a period of time, rather than  as a discrete event. In 2006, the then Homeland Security Council, which  was subsequently merged with the National Security Council, estimated  that during the peak weeks of a severe influenza pandemic, 40 percent of  the U.S. workforce might not be at work because of illness, the need to  care for family members who are ill, or fear of becoming infected. DOD  personnel would not be immune, and if the department were to face a  similar absentee rate, then DOD\u2019s ability to support requests for  assistance from civil authorities responding to a pandemic might be  limited. In fact, DOD itself might require support from another federal  agency, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  for vaccine procurement and distribution and delivery of antiviral drugs.", "The federal government\u2019s response to major domestic disasters and  emergencies is guided by the National Response Framework, a national- level guide on how local, state, and federal governments are to respond  to such incidents. The framework describes specific authorities, key roles and responsibilities, and best practices for managing incidents that range  from the serious but purely local to large-scale terrorist attacks or natural  disasters. According to the National Response Framework, HHS serves  as the federal government\u2019s primary agency responsible for public health  and medical preparation and planning for and response to a biological  terrorism attack or a naturally occurring outbreak that results from either a  known or a novel pathogen, including an emerging infectious disease.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the federal agency  responsible for domestic incident management. DOD may be asked to  serve in a supporting role to HHS and provide support functions to  supplement civil authorities\u2019 resources in response to public health and  medical disasters.

DOD agreed with and took actions on the recommendations  we made in these reports. For example, DOD clarified roles and  responsibilities and provided guidance on how DOD combatant  commands were to plan for pandemics.

We also obtained and analyzed  policy and guidance from DOD, HHS, and DHS to identify their roles and  responsibilities for coordinating with governmental and private sector  entities. To determine how DOD, HHS, and DHS coordinate and  participate in training exercises in preparation for a domestic outbreak of  a pandemic disease, we obtained and analyzed DOD\u2019s and DHS\u2019s  training exercise guidance to identify joint training exercises,  documentation, and sharing requirements in preparation for a pandemic  disease response. We conducted interviews with DOD, HHS, and DHS  officials to identify the pandemic-related training exercises they conducted  from fiscal year 2011 through 2015. We selected this time period because  these were the most recent fiscal years for which there is complete  information available. From DOD and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), we also obtained after-action reports and  lessons learned to identify the participants and the type of training  exercises conducted.

Support provided in response to such RFAs  may help these civil authorities to prepare for, prevent, protect against,  respond to, and recover from domestic incidents, including terrorist  attacks and major disasters. DOD assets are usually requested if other  federal, state, local, and tribal assets are not available. However, DOD  resources are not typically required to respond every domestic incident.  DOD resources can be made available to support disaster response  through a presidential declaration. For example, according to the Robert  T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (commonly  referred to as the Stafford Act), when a state\u2019s capabilities and resources  are overwhelmed and the President declares an emergency or disaster,  the state Governor can request assistance from the federal government.  The Stafford Act gives the President the authority to establish a program  of disaster preparedness and response support. Homeland Security  Presidential Directive-5 designates the Secretary of Homeland Security  as the principal federal official for domestic incident management.  Defense resources are committed only after the primary agency submits  a request for assistance, through proper channels, and the President or  Secretary of Defense authorizes DOD to provide support. Such support  may help civil authorities prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to,  or recover from domestic incidents\u2014including pandemics and major  disasters.

This can be invoked when DOD is  requested to respond to an incident under imminently serious conditions  when time does not permit approval from a higher authority. Upon request  from a civil authority, DOD officials may employ resources under their  control for up to 72 hours, subject to any supplemental direction provided  by higher headquarters, to save lives, prevent human suffering, or  mitigate great property damage within the United States. Immediate  response authority does not permit actions that would subject civilians to  the use of military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or  compulsory. In addition, the Economy Act permits one federal agency to  request the support of another federal agency, provided that the  requested services cannot be obtained more cheaply or conveniently by  contract. Under this Act, a federal agency with lead (primary)  responsibility may request the support of DOD without the presidential  declaration of emergency required by the Stafford Act. Finally, DOD may  provide health services\u2014as a supporting agency to HHS\u2014in accordance  with the National Disaster Medical System, following HHS\u2019s declaration of  a public health emergency.

The Department of Defense  Global Campaign Plan for Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Diseases  3551-13, issued in 2013, provides overarching guidance to DOD and  the military services on how to plan and prepare for a pandemic outbreak.  According to a DOD official, other DOD guidance\u2014such as the Guidance  for the Employment of the Force\u2014directs U.S. Northern Command and  U.S. Pacific Command to be prepared to provide defense support of civil  authorities and the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan specifies how this  should be accomplished.", "According to the Global Campaign Plan, U.S. Northern Command is  designated by DOD as the global synchronizer for influenza pandemic  and infectious disease plans. In this role, U.S. Northern Command is  responsible for providing strategic planning guidance for the department\u2019s  efforts to prepare for and respond to pandemic diseases. This guidance  directs the geographic combatant commands and the military services to  develop influenza pandemic and infectious disease plans and to  coordinate and synchronize those plans with the Global Campaign Plan.  As the lead synchronizer, U.S. Northern Command is responsible for  ensuring that plans developed by the combatant commands and military  services are aligned with the Global Campaign Plan in areas such as  biosurveillance and disease monitoring and sharing best practices;  among other responsibilities. U.S. Northern Command\u2019s CONPLAN   3591-09 Response to Pandemic Influenza provides guidance to U.S.  Northern Command decision makers on identifying the capabilities and  forces needed to maintain the defense of the homeland while limiting the  long-term effect of a pandemic on the security, health, and safety of the  nation. This plan explains how U.S. Northern Command would respond to  a pandemic outbreak by identifying capabilities\u2014such as personal protective equipment and medical countermeasures\u2014to prevent human- to-human transmission. The plan also includes key assumptions about  how a pandemic could affect DOD\u2019s ability to provide homeland defense.  For example, the plan states that an absentee rate of 40 percent among  DOD personnel, occurring at the height of a severe pandemic wave,  could affect U.S. Northern Command\u2019s ability to protect the homeland and  result in fewer resources being available to support requests for support  from civil authorities. The Homeland Defense mission can be performed  only by DOD and thus is its first priority. The pandemic response  ultimately is the responsibility of state, local, and tribal and territorial  authorities, and with the support of other federal agencies. The plan  states that an influenza pandemic would cause unprecedented illness,  death, and disruption to normal patterns of life, resulting in emotional,  psychological, spiritual, and physical pressures on U.S. Northern  Command\u2019s forces. The plan states that the combatant command will  mitigate the risk of a pandemic by synchronizing planning within the  department and with other elements of national power (i.e., diplomatic,  informational, military, and economic) to support U.S. government  strategies and objectives embodied in the National Strategy for Pandemic  Influenza. In addition, the plan states that the combatant command will  coordinate resources with federal departments and agencies to ensure  that preparedness and response efforts are prioritized and resourced to  respond to a pandemic.", "Other combatant commands also have developed plans for providing  support in the event of a pandemic. According to an official from U.S.  Northern Command, currently all six of the geographical combatant  commands have pandemic influenza and infectious disease plans for  their assigned areas of responsibility. The remaining three \u2018functional\u201d  combatant commands, which include the U.S. Special Operations  Command, have not developed pandemic influenza and infectious  disease plans because they operate in support of and within the  supported geographical combatant command\u2019s area of responsibility.", "For example, U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s CONPLAN 5003-13, Commander  United States Pacific Command Concept Plan for Pandemic and  Emerging Infectious Diseases, fulfils strategic guidance to prepare for and  maintain response plans for pandemic and emerging infectious diseases  for regional execution in support of U.S. Northern Command\u2019s Global  Campaign Plan. According to U.S. Pacific Command officials, CONPLAN  5003-13 serves as an operational framework for interagency and  international collaboration, DOD coordination, and synchronization of a  whole-of-government response to pandemics and infectious diseases.  Specifically, U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s CONPLAN 5003-13 states that the  combatant command will adopt an active, layered defense with respect to  a disease of operational significance. The plan for such a defense  consists of the following six phases:", "Phase 0 (Prepare): security cooperation and partner activities aimed  at building the capacity of partner nations and partner nation militaries  in coordination with the host nation, the international health  community, and federal agencies.", "Phase 1 (Protect): identification and characterization of a disease of  operational significance.", "Phase 2 (Mitigate): more significant DOD actions to further protect  the force and maintain mission assurance.", "Phase 3 (Respond): requests for defense support of civil authorities  related to pandemics or emerging infectious diseases, or for foreign  humanitarian assistance, have been received and authorized through  the request for assistance process.", "Phase 4 (Stabilize): maintaining appropriate force protection and  force health protection measures and finalizing defense support of  civil authorities and force health protection requests related to  pandemic emerging and infectious diseases.", "Phase 5 (Transition and Recovery): redeploying forces while  maintaining vigilance for a potential second wave outbreak of a  pandemic or emerging infectious disease.", "In addition, the plan assumes that certain challenges could affect military  personnel\u2019s ability to support civil authorities in responding to a pandemic.  For example, the plan states that a disease of operational significance  could, among other things, create a global pandemic with the potential of  incapacitating upwards of 40 percent of the workforce worldwide. Beyond  its primary negative effects, a disease of operational significance could  have secondary and tertiary effects, which could significantly threaten the  economic, political, and social stability of nations and regions.", "The military services have developed plans to contain and mitigate the  effects of pandemic influenza and infectious diseases. For example, the  Army\u2019s Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Disease Plan states that the  Army will support geographic combatant commands to contain or mitigate  the effects of an influenza pandemic or infectious disease of operational  significance. The plan also states that the Army will conduct theater and  functional planning to protect the personnel and resources necessary to  maintain readiness to sustain mission assurance and support, as  directed, other U.S. government efforts to protect the nation\u2019s welfare, to  include assisting partner countries. According to an official in the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense Integration and  Defense Support of Civil Authorities, the Army, the Navy, and the Air  Force have provided installations with guidance necessary to develop  installation-level disease containment plans to ensure force health  protection and continuity of operations in response to pandemics, and  direct coordination with state and local authorities.", "According to the Strategy for Homeland Defense and Support to Civil  Authorities, DOD often is expected to play a prominent supporting role to  primary federal agencies in their response efforts. According to officials in  the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland  Defense Integration and Defense Support of Civil Authorities, in the event  of a pandemic, DOD\u2019s support would be most useful in providing unique  military capabilities, such as logistics and transportation, to distribute  medical supplies and other assets to an affected site. Moreover, in  anticipation of requests for this type of assistance, these officials said that  because DOD has this role, it is critical that those primary agencies be  aware of DOD\u2019s capabilities in a given scenario. Furthermore, the  strategy states that DOD historically has supported civil authorities in a  wide variety of domestic contingencies, often in response to natural  disasters. However, the 21st century security environment, the  concentration of population in major urban areas, and the interconnected  nature of critical infrastructures have all combined to fundamentally alter  the scope and scale of \u201cworst case\u201d incidents for which DOD might be  called upon to provide support. This environment creates the potential for  complex catastrophes, with effects that would qualitatively and  quantitatively exceed those experienced to date. In such events, the  demand for defense support of civil authorities would be unprecedented.", "Meeting this demand would be especially challenging if, for example, a  cyber attack, or other electrical power grid disruption creating cascading  failures of critical infrastructure, or DOD\u2019s capabilities being limited if a  pandemic were to threaten lives and greatly complicate DOD response  operations. According to Joint Publication 5-0, Joint Operation Planning,  an important consideration in effective planning is to anticipate certain  events. This publication also states that the body of knowledge and  understanding created during DOD\u2019s planning allows commanders to  monitor, assess, and adapt to uncertain and changing environments and  to anticipate and act proactively in crisis situations.", "According to officials in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense Integration and Defense Support of Civil  Authorities, there may be expectation gaps between DOD and primary  agencies regarding DOD\u2019s capabilities to provide support. Primary  agencies coordinate with support agencies\u2014such as DOD\u2014when an  incident requires more capabilities than those primary agencies can  provide, such as materiel movement during a pandemic. These officials  said that while HHS and FEMA can usually rely on DOD during natural  disasters, including a pandemic, should support capabilities from primary  sources (e.g., other local, regional, state, and federal agencies, non- governmental organizations, and the private sector) become  overwhelmed, DOD might not always be in a position to provide  requested assistance because its capabilities may be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS and DHS Have Plans to Respond to a Pandemic, but Their Plans Do Not Explain How They Would Respond If DOD\u2019s Capabilities Are Limited, and Coordination Mechanisms Among the Three Agencies Exist That Could Enhance Their Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["HHS and DHS have plans to guide their responses to a pandemic, but  their plans do not explain how they would respond in a resource- constrained environment where state and local capabilities are  overwhelmed or unavailable, and other federal capabilities, like DOD\u2019s,  are limited.

According to DHS\u2019s Response Federal Interagency  Operational Plan, primary and support agencies involved in implementing  federal emergency support functions conduct contingency and  operational planning in conjunction with federal, state, local, tribal, and  territorial authorities and the private sector.", "According to officials with HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Preparedness and Response, mechanisms such as interagency dialogue  and coordination among federal, state, and local entities are often used to  determine what resources would be needed during a pandemic. For  example, HHS officials said that surge capabilities, such as capabilities  developed through the local Hospital Preparedness Program, could be  used to support the local response effort prior to requesting state or  federal assistance. HHS officials stated that there are other existing  mechanisms, such as the Public Health Emergency Medical  Countermeasures Enterprise and Enterprise Executive Committee, which  consists of senior program managers across the partner agencies who  address issues such as influenza pandemic preparedness and response  capabilities, among other issues. Influenza Risk Management Meetings  are another existing mechanism that provides partner agencies with a  venue to discuss their influenza pandemic response.", "HHS and DHS plans also do not specifically address what resources  would be needed to support a response to a pandemic in an environment  where federal resources, including DOD, are exceeded by demands.  HHS officials stated that there would be no way of knowing in advance  what unique facts, circumstances, or conditions might occur to determine  what resources would be needed. The National Response Framework  notes the importance of planning as a core capability to manage the life  cycle of a potential crisis, determine capability requirements, and help  stakeholders learn their roles. Planning includes the analysis and  dissemination of risk assessment data, and the development of plans,  procedures, mutual aid and assistance agreements, strategies, and other  arrangements to perform specific missions and tasks to improve incident  preparedness and response. When planning for an incident, such as a  pandemic, governments at all levels have a responsibility to develop  continuity plans that identify essential functions, succession and  delegation of authority, continuity facilities, communication capabilities,  and human resource issues. HHS and DHS are in the process of  updating their pandemic plans, which presents an opportunity for them to  coordinate with each other and with DOD to determine the appropriate  actions to take\u2014training exercises, pre-scripted mission assignments, or  other coordination activities\u2014should DOD\u2019s support be limited during a  pandemic.", "Finally, according to the Global Campaign Plan, large-scale, sustained  military conflicts in multiple theaters of operation could severely degrade  DOD\u2019s capabilities and capacities to support civil authorities in responding  to a pandemic. Although DOD may have personnel and equipment  available to some degree to support civil authorities, it may not have the  appropriate number or type of personnel, equipment, or training available  to provide adequate support. According to an official in the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense Integration  and Defense Support of Civil Authorities, DOD is not funded for defense  support of civil authority missions and must adapt funded military  capabilities to conduct such missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Coordinates Internally, with HHS, and with DHS through FEMA to Prepare Its Pandemic Response", "paragraphs": ["DOD uses various mechanisms, including planning activities, interagency  work groups, liaison officers, and training exercises both to coordinate  within the department and its support with HHS and with DHS through  FEMA. For example, according to DOD officials, DOD coordinates among  its own organizations, such as the combatant commands and military  services, to develop pandemic response plans. Specifically, Joint Staff  officials stated they collaborate with the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, the combatant commands, and the military services to establish  guidance for providing support to civil authorities. We previously reported  that U.S. Northern Command faced challenges involving coordination with  interagency partners and the states in planning, conducting, and  assessing exercises. We recommended that DOD coordinate with DHS  and FEMA to develop guidance and consistently involve state officials in  planning, executing, and assessing exercises that incorporate relevant  state-specific information. In response, DOD stated that it continues to  expand its efforts to ensure that states are able to benefit from  participation in DOD-sponsored exercises.", "According to officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Homeland Defense Integration and Defense Support of Civil  Authorities, the Joint Staff and the U.S. Pacific Command, DOD  coordinates formally and informally with HHS and DHS to identify  capability requirements for supporting civil authorities in the event of a  pandemic outbreak. For example, officials from the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense Integration and Defense  Support of Civil Authorities and FEMA stated DOD actively is participating  in interagency planning efforts to develop FEMA\u2019s Biological Incident  Annex. FEMA currently is updating the Biological Incident Annex that,  according to FEMA officials, will include for the first time information on  influenza pandemic and infectious disease guidance. As a member of the  Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise, DOD  coordinates with HHS through formal working groups and interagency  agreements to develop medical countermeasures for pandemic  outbreaks. According to HHS officials, this interagency collaboration  helped to develop and distribute diagnostics and vaccines for the 2009  H1N1 influenza pandemic and the antibody therapeutics for the 2014-15  Ebola epidemic (see figure 2). In addition, officials in the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs stated the DOD officials  sit on the National Security Council\u2019s Sub-Integrated Policy Committee on  Pandemic Preparedness, which oversaw interagency implementation of  the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza.", "According to DOD, HHS, and DHS officials, the three agencies each have  liaison officers located in the others to collaborate on federal response  plans and facilitate and coordinate requests for DOD assistance. FEMA  officials stated that DOD\u2019s primary mechanism for coordination with state  and local entities is through the Defense Coordinating Officer and FEMA  staff. According to officials with U.S. Northern Command, Defense  Coordinating Officers assist in regional integrated disaster planning and  coordination activities and help identify specific capabilities that DOD is  likely to be asked to provide in support of specific civil authorities\u2019 disaster  responses. During an incident response, the Defense Coordinating  Officer would integrate with the federal coordinating officer and, upon  receiving a request for DOD assistance, would help tailor the request to  leverage key DOD capabilities and then submit the request to U.S.  Northern Command to begin the Secretary of Defense approval process.  FEMA officials stated that Defense Coordinating Officers are integrated  with their assigned FEMA regions, and therefore they know what  capabilities are being requested and what capabilities DOD has available  to respond to these requests. Further, officials from DOD, HHS, and  FEMA stated that DOD has conducted or participated in training  exercises with HHS and DHS to assess its capabilities for responding to a  pandemic outbreak."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD, HHS, and FEMA Have Conducted Joint Pandemic-Related Training Exercises and Disseminated After-Action Reports and Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["To prepare for a pandemic outbreak, DOD, HHS, and FEMA conducted  joint training exercises from 2011 through 2015, the most recent fiscal  years for which there is complete information available on training  exercises. Exercises play an instrumental role in preparing these  agencies to respond to an incident by providing opportunities to test  plans, improve proficiency, and assess capabilities and readiness. Short  of performance in actual operations, exercises provide the best means to  assess the effectiveness of organizations in achieving mission  preparedness. Exercises also provide an ideal opportunity to enhance  preparedness by collecting, developing, implementing, and disseminating  lessons learned and verifying that corrective action has been taken to  resolve previously identified issues.", "These exercises have included state and local agencies and private  sector organizations. For example, according to documentation obtained  from U.S. Northern Command, in July 2015, U.S. Northern Command  conducted Vista Express, an infectious disease training exercise that  included a weaponized anthrax scenario. Over 80 individuals from 29  organizations participated, including individuals from DHS, FEMA, other  federal agencies, and private organizations. According to HHS officials, in  2011 HHS hosted exercises to test public health plans, processes, and  procedures to respond to an anthrax outbreak. Participants included  representatives from state, local, tribal, territorial and federal agencies. In  September 2013, the National Security Staff sponsored an exercise for  senior-level federal government executives to discuss interagency plans  for response to pandemics, including agency roles and responsibilities.  While HHS and DHS have conducted joint training exercises with DOD,  they have not exercised a pandemic outbreak scenario in which DOD  capabilities are limited. In addition, DOD has not exercised a pandemic  outbreak scenario with HHS and DHS. DOD officials believe that an  exercise in which DOD participates\u2014but for which it provides limited  capabilities or none at all\u2014would be useful in preparing for a pandemic  response. However, U.S. Northern Command has not participated in such  an exercise.", "DOD, HHS, and DHS have issued after-action reports and have  documented lessons learned information from the training exercises they  have conducted, and they have shared these documents with each other.  Specifically, U.S. Northern Command provides external partners with  access to its website to provide lessons-learned information. In addition,  our analysis of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Pacific Command after- action reports and other exercise information related to pandemic  response for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 indicated that lessons  resulting from training exercises, or from a real-world event such as the  Ebola outbreak, are summarized in after-action reports or other  documentation. According to U.S. Pacific Command officials, federal,  state, and local entities can access DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned  Information System, through a registered account, to retrieve after-action  reports and other information, consistent with DOD\u2019s security  requirements. Otherwise, these entities would need to request after- action reports and other information either from the organization that  conducted the training exercise or from the Joint Staff.", "According to HHS officials, HHS prepares an after-action report or a  summary of conclusions for each pandemic-related training exercise.  They stated that after-action reports or other documentation are  disseminated through electronic mail to all participants in a training  exercise. Agencies that do not participate in the training exercises but are  involved in pandemic response efforts also are provided this  documentation. While this documentation is not shared with a broad  audience, HHS officials said that it is available to DOD stakeholders upon  request, and as soon as it is approved for broad release, it is shared with  all participants. Further, HHS has access to DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons  Learned Information System, and thus can access the reports posted   on it.", "Similarly, our analysis of FEMA documentation from fiscal years 2013  through 2015 indicated that FEMA also documented lessons learned  resulting from pandemic-related training exercises. FEMA managed its  Lessons Learned Information System as an independent system through  2015; however, FEMA has since consolidated this system with the Naval  Postgraduate School\u2019s Homeland Security Digital Library. According to  FEMA officials, federal agencies can access FEMA\u2019s published lessons- learned information through DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned Information  System or by requesting such information from FEMA. Federal agencies  without access to DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned Information System can  obtain historical lessons-learned information through the Homeland  Security Digital Library or directly from FEMA. According to a FEMA  official, FEMA also encourages exercise sponsors to publish their reports  on the Homeland Security Information Network.

Human-to-human transmission is also possible through  sexual contact, blood transfusions, and from mother to child. Recently,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that Zika virus  infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other severe  fetal brain defects;  thus, pregnant women are at particular risk.
