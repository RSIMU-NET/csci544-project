Specifically, OMB staff stated that they chose the top 10 programs from a longer list of agency programs requiring additional oversight (referred to as high impact programs). E-Gov staff reported that the high priority programs were already receiving greater oversight than what was provided to the other major programs due to their high impact designation. This additional oversight included frequent meetings with agency Chief Information Officer (CIO) leadership and quarterly meetings with OMB staff. However, the Federal CIO was not directly involved in this oversight. According to E-Gov staff, the Federal CIO does not typically get involved in individual programs due to the large number of programs. However, past experience has shown that Federal CIO involvement has had a significant impact. For example, Federal CIO-led reviews of troubled projects, known as TechStat reviews, resulted in $3 billion in savings in 2010. Until OMB ensures that the Federal CIO is more directly involved in the oversight of these high priority programs, it may be missing a key opportunity to improve accountability and achieve positive results.", "OMB's 2015 and 2016 reports to Congress on the top 10 high priority programs identified the status of the programs and major milestones. However, the reports were not issued on a quarterly basis, as directed. E-Gov staff stated that they were unable to do so because of other competing reporting requirements and the limited resources available to draft and fully review the report on a quarterly basis. In addition, OMB stopped issuing the reports on the top 10 high priority IT programs after June 2016. OMB stated that Congress' 2016 direction to the U.S. Digital Service (USDS)\u2014an OMB component\u2014to provide a quarterly report that described the status of USDS teams and projects, including the top 10 high priority programs, meant that OMB should only report on USDS projects considered to be high priority. However, continued identification and reporting on the top 10 high priority programs, and not just USDS projects, would further enhance congressional oversight by providing congressional stakeholders information that is not readily available on those programs in the greatest need of attention.", "USDS issued reports to Congress on the status of its key projects in December 2016 and July 2017; however, the reports did not address the top 10 high priority programs as directed by Congress, according to OMB staff, because of OMB's interpretation of Congress's direction. In addition, the reports were not issued quarterly, as directed. USDS staff attributed this to the time and effort needed to review and prepare the report. However, continuing to identify and report on the top 10 high priority programs while also reporting on USDS's projects would help to enhance congressional oversight and current administration IT governance entities' efforts by providing stakeholders with information that is not readily available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to OMB for enhancing the oversight of high priority programs and continuing to report on both these programs and USDS projects.

In our report of the  departments\u2019 efforts in 2015, we reported that the departments had  not identified outcome-oriented goals and metrics to clearly define  what they aimed to achieve from their interoperability efforts, resulting  in numerous failures. During most of the last 20 years, VA has also  been planning to modernize its system separately from DOD.  Recently, the Secretary of VA announced that the department plans to  use the same electronic health record system that DOD is in the  process of acquiring.

According to OMB,  this oversight responsibility covers about 800 major and nearly 5,700  non-major IT investments across the federal government. As a part of  the oversight, the E-Gov office develops policy and reviews federal  agencies\u2019 IT strategic plans. In addition, OMB establishes processes to  analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and results of IT investments made  by executive agencies, and issues guidance on processes for selecting  and overseeing agency privacy and security protections for information  and information systems.", "OMB has also implemented a series of initiatives to improve the oversight  of underperforming investments and more effectively manage IT.

In June 2009, to further improve the  transparency into and oversight of federal agencies\u2019 IT investments,  OMB deployed the Federal IT Dashboard, a public website with  information on the performance of these investments. OMB provided  guidance to the agencies on the information they should maintain and  update on the dashboard. Currently, the dashboard displays  information on the cost, schedule, and performance of close to 800  major IT investments at 26 federal agencies. In addition, agencies are  to submit ratings from their CIOs to the dashboard, which, according  to OMB\u2019s instructions, should reflect the level of risk facing an  investment relative to that investment\u2019s ability to accomplish its goals.  The public display of these data is intended to allow OMB, other  oversight bodies, and the general public to hold agencies accountable  for mission-related outcomes.

These meetings involved OMB and agency  leadership and were intended to increase accountability and improve  performance. OMB reported that federal agencies achieved over $3  billion in cost savings or avoidances as a result of these reviews in  2010. Subsequently, it empowered agency CIOs to begin holding  their own TechStat reviews by June 2012.

These reviews were to be held between the Federal CIO  and agency leadership. In 2014 and 2015, OMB\u2019s PortfolioStat  guidance also called for it and agencies to identify high impact IT  programs that merited additional support and oversight by OMB  and/or agency leadership, and for these programs to be discussed  during a PortfolioStat session.

Further, OMB\u2019s December  2016 and July 2017 reports on USDS\u2019s projects did not address the top  10 high priority programs across the government. However, continued  reporting on the top 10 high priority programs would further enhance  congressional oversight by providing congressional stakeholders with  information that is not readily available on those programs in the greatest  need of attention. Reporting on the top 10 high priority programs could  also be useful for IT governance entities such as the Office of American  Innovation and the American Technology Council, to assist them with  prioritizing their efforts to modernize federal agency IT.", "Moreover, OMB did not issue the high priority programs and USDS  reports on a quarterly basis as requested. Without OMB\u2019s quarterly  reporting on the progress of both the top 10 high priority programs and  the status of the USDS projects, congressional stakeholders and others  may lack the timely information they need to support their oversight and  other responsibilities.", "Finally, while additional OMB oversight of the high impact programs (and,  accordingly, the identified high priority programs) is a positive step, the  Federal CIO was not directly involved in the oversight of these programs.  Based on the positive impact of direct Federal CIO involvement in leading  investment reviews in the past, such involvement could significantly  improve program outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to OMB:", "The Director of OMB should continue to identify and report to  Congress on the status of the top 10 high priority IT programs and the  extent to which USDS is involved in the programs, as was done in  June 2015 and June 2016. In doing so, the Director should ensure  that these reports are issued quarterly. (Recommendation 1)", "The Director of OMB should ensure that the Federal CIO is directly  involved in the oversight of high priority programs.

(Recommendation 3)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received comments on our draft report via e-mail from the OMB  liaison to GAO. In the comments, OMB did not specifically state whether it  agreed or disagreed with our recommendations. Rather, OMB stated that  it has concerns with GAO\u2019s alternative interpretations of law and that  GAO\u2019s findings and conclusions are rooted in an incorrect legal  interpretation of OMB\u2019s annual appropriation. Specifically, it stated that  GAO considers reporting requirements specific to an annual appropriation  to apply for all future annual appropriations.", "However, OMB\u2019s characterization is incorrect, as we did not assert this  legal conclusion. As stated in our report, in the explanatory statement  accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations  Act, 2015, Congress directed OMB to identify the 10 highest priority IT  investment programs (referred to in our report as the top 10 high priority  programs) that are under development across federal agencies and  report on their status each quarter. Subsequently, the explanatory  statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016,  directed USDS to provide a quarterly status report on, among other  things, current USDS projects, including the top 10 high priority programs.  Our report does not conclude that the language of either explanatory  statement establishes a legally binding requirement, whether applicable  only to the subject fiscal year or beyond.", "GAO\u2019s conclusions are based on the view that continued identification  and reporting on the top 10 high priority programs, and not just USDS  projects, would help to enhance congressional oversight. Identifying and  reporting on the top 10 high priority programs is important because such  information is not readily available. We have revised relevant statements  in the report to clarify our message in this regard. Further, while GAO did  not assert a legal conclusion, we have, nonetheless, removed all  references to our \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the explanatory statement so as to  avoid the inference that we are making legal conclusions.", "OMB also said our conclusion that it has stopped reporting altogether is  incorrect. However, our report does not state that OMB has stopped  reporting altogether. Rather, our report states that OMB stopped issuing  reports on the top 10 high priority IT programs due to its interpretation of  the 2016 explanatory statement and, instead, switched to reporting on the  status of USDS\u2019s projects.", "In addition, OMB stated that, while it agreed that the reports have not  been submitted on a quarterly basis, it provided Congress with the  requested information for the four quarters of the relevant fiscal years. In  addition, OMB stated that USDS is currently discussing with  congressional stakeholders whether providing quarterly briefings, instead  of reports, would address the quarterly reporting requirement. As noted in  our report, timely (i.e., quarterly) information would enhance  congressional and other stakeholders\u2019 oversight responsibilities.  Therefore, we maintain that our recommendation for reporting quarterly is  appropriate.", "Finally, OMB stated that it disagreed with our conclusion that the lack of  personal Federal CIO involvement in high priority IT programs had  resulted in inadequate oversight. While we state that the Federal CIO was  not directly involved in overseeing the high priority programs, we did not  conclude that this resulted in inadequate oversight. Rather, we stated that  the results of past CIO-led TechStat reviews suggest that more direct and  regular involvement of the Federal CIO would improve accountability and  achieve positive results for the federal government\u2019s investments. Thus,  we continue to believe that our recommendation to ensure that the  Federal CIO is directly involved in overseeing high priority programs is  appropriate.", "OMB also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated into  the report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and  other interested parties.
