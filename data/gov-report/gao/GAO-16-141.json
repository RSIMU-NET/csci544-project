The SIG program, with an average 3-year grant of $2.6 million, is the only Education program that provides funds specifically to establish extended learning time in schools, according to Education. Nearly 1,800 schools that received SIG funds (about 94 percent of SIG schools) were required to extend learning time under the SIG program for school years 2010-2011 through 2014-2015. In addition, under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st Century) grant program a small number of grantee schools\u2014about 69 of the 10,000\u2014have used program funds to support extended learning time. However, to do so, states need to obtain a waiver from Education to permit schools to use funds to conduct authorized program activities during an extended school day, week, or year. Education officials said that the average annual 21st Century grant was about $113,000. Although Education supports extended learning time with the SIG and, in rare cases, the 21st Century program, Education officials also pointed out that most of its K-12 programs are designed to be used during the school day, regardless of the length of the day.", "Regarding learning time, GAO estimates that the average length of the school day for K-12 public schools nationwide is just under 7 hours and the average school year is almost 180 days, according to GAO's analysis of Education's 2011-2012 data, the most recent available. In terms of hours per year, schools with the most time average almost 1,350 hours compared to about 1,200 hours, nationally. In addition, among all public schools, charter schools represent a larger proportion of schools with more time (about one-third of all charter schools) compared to approximately 9 percent of traditional public schools. Charter schools also represented a larger proportion of students who are low income, African American, or Hispanic. Regarding how schools use extended learning time, we found that schools with the most hours in a school year use it for different purposes. For example, GAO estimates that eighth-grade students in these schools spend, on average, one more hour per week on academic subjects such as English, math, and science, while third-graders spent more time in music, art, and physical education classes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, there has been an increased focus on extending learning  time as a key strategy for turning around the nation\u2019s low-performing  schools.

All states require a minimum amount of instructional time in a  school year, according to a 2015 Education Commission of the States  study. However, the study found that states vary in how they define that  time in terms of days and hours and the requirements school districts  must meet.

SASS contains data from a generalizable  sample of K-12 public elementary and secondary schools nationwide.  We used SASS data to estimate the distribution of instructional time by  hours per day and days per year. To identify schools with the most  learning time, we created a measure of the number of hours each school  provides annually. This measure of annual school time was calculated by  multiplying the number of hours of instruction that students receive per  day by the number of days the school operates during the school year. To  describe the characteristics of schools with the most learning time, we  analyzed schools with the most school hours annually, which we defined  as the top 10 percent of schools, and compared them with the remaining  90 percent of schools. For this analysis we looked at selected school  characteristics from the SASS dataset, including the length of the school  day; number of days in the school year; school level and type (e.g.,  traditional public and charter schools); location (e.g., Census region and  urban vs. rural locations); and student demographics, such as race,  ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
