GPRAMA directed GAO to report on the act's implementation. This report, one of a series under that mandate, (1) examines the status of federal agencies' implementation of the performance management leadership roles under GPRAMA and (2) evaluates the role of the PIC in facilitating the exchange of best practices and improving agency program management and performance.", "To address both objectives, GAO conducted a survey of PIOs at all 24 CFO Act federal agencies, as well as in-depth case studies of HHS and NSF, which were selected because they have differing characteristics such as size.

The 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies have all assigned officials to the key management roles--chief operating officer, performance improvement officer (PIO), and goal leader--required under GPRAMA, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the results of GAO's PIO survey. PIOs GAO surveyed reported that most key officials were greatly involved in central aspects of performance management, such as agency quarterly performance reviews. PIOs GAO surveyed, and priority goal leaders GAO interviewed at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), reported they were supported in their responsibilities by their deputies and other staff. PIOs generally reported that their staff had competencies identified as relevant by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), such as reasoning, to a large extent, although PIOs reported that the competencies were not as widespread among their staff as the other competencies.", "OPM has taken steps to work with agencies to incorporate performance management staff competencies into training. For example, OPM is working with the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) to develop a website that will include such training. However, at this time, it does not plan to assess competency gaps among agency performance management staff to inform its work. Without this information, it will be difficult for OPM, working with the PIC, to focus on the most-needed resources and facilitate their use by other agencies.", "PIOs generally found that sharing of best practices and development of tips and tools are the most helpful aspects of the PIC, and reported strong agency attendance at meetings and participation in working groups. However, the PIC has not regularly collected member feedback about its performance. Additionally, although the PIC has a strategic plan in place, it has not updated it since GPRAMA was enacted. Routine member feedback and an updated strategic plan that reflects changes required by GPRAMA could help increase the PIC's effectiveness. Without these assessment tools, the PIC lacks an important basis and means for directing and evaluating its performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of OPM work with the PIC to identify competency gaps for agency performance management staff and use this information to identify and share relevant agency training.

GPRAMA, along with related  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, established and  defined performance management responsibilities for agency officials in  key management roles: the agency head, chief operating officer (COO),  performance improvement officer (PIO), deputy PIO, goal leader, and  deputy goal leader. The officials in these roles constitute an agency\u2019s  performance management leadership team. GPRAMA also established in  law the Performance Improvement Council (PIC), chaired by OMB\u2019s  Deputy Director for Management and composed of PIOs from various  federal agencies.

Selected results from our survey were also reported in our  February 2013 report focusing on quarterly performance reviews under  GPRAMA. In order to understand GPRAMA implementation in more  detail and put survey results in context for both objectives, we conducted  case studies of two CFO Act agencies\u2014the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF)\u2014 focusing on their implementation of performance management leadership  roles and participation in the PIC. We selected these agencies because  they have differing characteristics that may affect implementation, such  as agency size and the career status of the official in the PIO role. We  obtained documentation and conducted interviews with both agencies\u2019  COOs, PIOs, and deputy PIOs. In addition, in order to understand the  priority goal leader role and its contributions to performance  management, we selected three of HHS\u2019s six agency priority goals and  two of NSF\u2019s three agency priority goals and interviewed the responsible  goal leaders. For goals that had two goal leaders assigned, we  interviewed one of the responsible goal leaders. We also interviewed  OMB staff and officials at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  about their work under GPRAMA, including their work with agencies and  the PIC in implementing GPRAMA.", "To further address both objectives, we reviewed GPRAMA and related  OMB guidance about the key management roles and the PIC.

Later OMB guidance  established additional performance management roles related to  implementation of GPRAMA. The primary roles with responsibilities  under GPRAMA and in OMB guidance are:", "Agency head: GPRAMA gave each agency\u2019s head broad  responsibility for performance management. Among other things, the  agency head is responsible for identifying agency priority goals and,  along with the COO discussed in the next paragraph, conducting  quarterly priority goal progress reviews.", "Chief operating officer: The COO role existed at agencies prior to  GPRAMA\u2019s enactment, with responsibilities such as improving agency  management and performance outlined in two presidential  memoranda. GPRAMA maintained these previously established  responsibilities, and added others to bring them in line with other  GPRAMA requirements.

Leaders for agency priority  goals are identified, with their photos, on the performance.gov  website. A similar position existed at some agencies prior to  GPRAMA, as earlier OMB guidance had encouraged agencies to  identify officials who were responsible for High Priority Performance  Goals (these goals have since been renamed as agency priority  goals).", "Deputy goal leader: The deputy goal leader role was not included in  GPRAMA, but later OMB guidance directed agencies to identify a  deputy goal leader to support the goal leader. In cases where the  goal leader was a political appointee, OMB encouraged agencies to  assign a career senior executive as the deputy.", "GPRAMA also assigned responsibilities to OPM related to agency  performance management. By January 2012, the agency was to identify  skills and competencies needed by government personnel for setting  goals, evaluating programs, and analyzing and using performance  information for improving government efficiency and effectiveness.  GPRAMA also directed OPM, by January 2013, to incorporate these  competencies into relevant position classifications and to work with each  agency to incorporate the skills and competencies into employee training.", "OMB has a leadership and coordinating role in agency implementation of  GPRAMA.

For example, the  U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health was one of two goal leaders for HHS\u2019s  priority goal on reducing tobacco consumption. He previously worked on  tobacco cessation at the state level, was a public health professor, and  published journal articles on tobacco control and health promotion. The  goal\u2019s other leader told us that because the Assistant Secretary was  widely known within the public health community, his involvement brought  respect and attention to the goal.", "As discussed previously, the PIO and goal leader positions were filled by  senior-level agency officials. Most of these officials had other  responsibilities, such as serving as a CFO.

He told us that the PIC identified the working group topics  based on informal input from PIC members, though the council might in  the future solicit more formal input through a survey. Agencies could also  participate in separate OMB working groups that focused on informing  policy and guidance. For example, at the time of our review, an OMB  working group was focusing on informing guidance for strategic planning  required under GPRAMA.", "In addition to the three working groups described in table 1, there were  two PIC working groups\u2014the Goal Setting and the Benefits Processing  working groups\u2014that no longer regularly met, according to OMB staff.  OMB and PIC staff said that these groups could restart again in the  future, if agency needs arise. The Goal Setting working group focused on  helping agencies set priority goals for fiscal year 2013, and produced a  draft guide to goal setting. OMB staff said that the group may start  meeting again to focus on strategic goals and objectives or on the next  round of priority goal setting. In addition, the Benefits Processing working  group, which focused on promoting consistency in agencies\u2019 benefits  processing, was no longer regularly meeting because it had completed its  tasks.", "Most (18) PIOs we surveyed reported that they or other staff members  from their agencies participated in at least one working group, with some  agencies participating in multiple groups and one agency participating in  all five. These 18 agencies participated in an average of three working  groups each, according to PIOs. PIOs reported that they generally did not  participate personally in working groups. At HHS, the Deputy PIO said  that both he and members of his team participate in working groups. PIOs  we surveyed and agency officials we interviewed reported using working  group products or information. For example, a PIO reported on the survey  that she used the Goal Setting group\u2019s guide on developing priority goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The PIC Coordinated with Small Agencies and Interagency Management Councils", "paragraphs": ["According to representatives of small agencies, PIC and OMB staff  effectively coordinated with them and were receptive to their feedback.  GPRAMA directed the PIC to coordinate with nonmember agencies,  which include most small agencies. According to a representative of the  Small Agency Council (SAC), a management association of small  agencies, PIC meetings generally addressed issues affecting the CFO  Act agencies. She said that she understood the PIC\u2019s focus, as larger  agencies generally have more consistency in their implementation of  GPRAMA requirements. However, she further stated that smaller  agencies may require more assistance due to their more diverse missions  and fewer resources. Although the broader PIC meetings were open to all  agencies, the SAC representative told us that few small agencies found  that the PIC met their needs. Instead, PIC and OMB staff communicated  with small agencies through the SAC\u2019s Performance Improvement  Committee, which was established in March 2011. This committee is  similar to the PIC in its attention to implementation of GPRAMA, but  meeting objectives focus on issues facing small agencies. According to  SAC representatives, the committee functions as a way for small  agencies to give voice to their concerns, as well as a forum for OMB and  the PIC to focus on the needs of small agencies, which may have unique  issues in implementing GPRAMA and other requirements. SAC  representatives told us that they have been satisfied with the support  provided by OMB and the PIC in both of these areas. SAC Performance  Improvement Committee meeting agendas from recent months included  presentations from PIC and OMB staff. For example, a recent meeting  included presentations from OMB staff on updated guidance contained in  OMB\u2019s Circular A-11 and on small agencies\u2019 use of the performance.gov  website.", "In addition to coordinating with non-member agencies, GPRAMA directed  the PIC to coordinate with other interagency management councils.

GPRAMA directed the PIC to perform several functions, such as  helping agencies share practices that have led to performance  improvements. According to the PIC\u2019s Executive Director, the PIC  conducted a survey of PIOs prior to the enactment of GPRAMA. It also  surveyed attendees of a January 16, 2013, PIC meeting, one of the  broader meetings that is open to PIOs as well as other agency staff. The  survey covered topics such as participants\u2019 expectations for the meeting  and assessments of the usefulness of the agenda items covered.  However, the PIC has not done this on a regular basis, or gathered  member feedback about its overall performance. As we have previously  reported, practices that help to sustain collaboration include having  federal agencies create the means to monitor and evaluate their  collaborative efforts to enable them to identify areas for improvement.  Although our survey indicated that PIOs generally found the PIC\u2019s work  helpful in selected areas, without more comprehensive and regular  assessment of member opinions, it will be difficult for the PIC to ensure  that, going forward, it is meeting its members\u2019 current and emerging  needs. The PIC\u2019s Executive Director, who started in this position in  November 2012, told us that he was considering conducting a survey of  PIC members as well as administering evaluation forms at the end of  every meeting. Regularly soliciting feedback allows organizations to  monitor member input on an ongoing basis. For example, the SAC  Performance Improvement Committee administers an evaluation form at  each of its meetings. These forms allow members to rate the usefulness  of the meeting and their satisfaction with particular aspects of it and to  suggest topics for upcoming meetings.", "Without formal and regular member feedback, the PIC is missing  opportunities to tap a resource for identifying topics for future working  groups and PIC meetings. PIC staff told us that identification of working  group topics and meeting agenda items was generally based on informal  input. Our review of PIC meeting agendas from February 2009 through  September 2012 showed that since the enactment of GPRAMA in  January 2011, both the \u201cprincipals only\u201d and broader PIC meetings  focused on issues related to GPRAMA implementation. Going forward,  PIC members\u2019 needs will naturally evolve as GPRAMA implementation  deepens within agencies and new questions and issues arise. The PIC\u2019s  Executive Director told us that the topic areas covered by the PIC in the  future will most likely include new issues related to GPRAMA  implementation, and an increased emphasis on cross-agency  connections.", "Additionally, the PIC has not updated its strategic plan since GPRAMA  was enacted in January 2011. OMB staff provided us with a copy of the  PIC\u2019s Strategic Action Plan, which was implemented in January 2009 and  covered fiscal years 2009 through 2013. This plan included four strategic  goals, along with objectives and implementing strategies for each. OMB  staff also provided us with information from a 2010 update of the strategic  plan that focused on two new PIC goals. As we have previously  reported, practices that help ensure effective collaboration include the use  of strategic plans as tools to drive collaboration and establish goals and  strategies for achieving results. Our prior work also identified several  leading practices in federal strategic planning, among them that  organizations involve stakeholders in strategic planning. Although the  PIC has a strategic plan in place, the PIC last updated the plan prior to  the enactment of GPRAMA. An up-to-date strategic plan that incorporates  the input of its members and reflects the changes in federal performance  management required by GPRAMA could help the PIC be reasonably  assured that it has established a framework to effectively guide and  assess its work.

Through our PIO  survey, we found that officials with responsibilities under GPRAMA were  greatly involved in central, key aspects of performance management.  These officials were supported by performance management staff, and  PIOs reported that they were generally satisfied with their staff skills.  However, our survey results showed that PIOs believed that certain  competencies could be strengthened. OPM planned to directly assess  performance management competency gaps at agencies, but has not yet  done so. An assessment directly focused on performance management  competencies could provide information on any gaps and inform  agencies\u2019 efforts to address them. OPM could also use this information to  ensure that its work with agencies to incorporate competencies into  training for agency staff, as required by GPRAMA, is effective. In  particular, this information could inform OPM\u2019s coordination of the sharing  of training resources among agencies, both through its Training and  Development Policy Wiki website and the website planned for  performance management professionals. Through these websites, OPM  could target resources to areas in which it has identified competency  gaps. Such sharing of agency training resources offers the opportunity to  maximize efficiency, and OPM is well positioned to play a coordinating  role in this area through its expertise and relationships with the PIC and  CLO Council. OPM has worked with these councils related to training  under GPRAMA in the past. Additionally, the councils include  representatives from across government with expertise in performance  management and training, so they provide OPM with the ability to  efficiently obtain input and share resources on performance management  training.", "The PIC plays a significant role in agency implementation of GPRAMA,  and our survey results indicate that PIOs generally found the PIC helpful  to their agencies. Both GPRAMA and related OMB guidance described  the PIC\u2019s functions, but the PIC has not regularly collected member  feedback on its own performance, and has not updated its strategic plan  since GPRAMA was enacted in January 2011. Functions such as creating  working groups and developing meeting agendas have been based on  informal feedback. Regularly collecting formal feedback from members,  such as through a survey, would help the PIC identify areas in which it  could ensure it maintains its usefulness, as well as new areas on which  member agencies would like for it to focus its meetings and working  groups. Obtaining such feedback would allow the PIC to monitor its  performance and identify issues as they arise. This will be particularly  important as agencies become more accustomed to GPRAMA processes  and their needs change. In addition, the PIC lacks an up-to-date strategic  plan. Its most recent update was in 2010, so it does not reflect any  changes in goals or priorities that may have resulted from GPRAMA. An  up-to-date plan could provide the PIC with a basis for directing and  evaluating its performance in implementing GPRAMA.

Several  provisions of GPRAMA apply specifically to these agencies, including that  the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) include them as members.  We focused our examination of performance management leadership on  the management roles that have specific responsibilities under GPRAMA  and related OMB guidance, with the exception of agency head. These are  the chief operating officer (COO), performance improvement officer (PIO),  deputy PIO, priority goal leader, and deputy goal leader. In looking at the  PIC, we evaluated its role in facilitating the exchange of best practices  and improving agency program management and performance.

Through our survey, we collected information  regarding PIOs\u2019 and other key officials\u2019 characteristics, their involvement  in performance management under GPRAMA, and PIO and agency  participation in the PIC. Appendix IV presents the survey questions we  asked, and summarizes the responses we received. We received  responses from all 24 PIOs (a 100 percent response rate). Selected  results from our survey were also reported in another GAO report that  focused on quarterly performance reviews under GPRAMA. We  administered the web-based survey from October 18, 2012 to December  14, 2012. Respondents were sent an e-mail invitation to complete the  survey on a GAO web server using a unique username and password.  During the data collection period, we sent reminder e-mails and made  phone calls to nonresponding agencies. Because this was not a sample  survey, it has no sampling errors. The practical difficulties of conducting  any survey may also introduce nonsampling errors, such as difficulties  interpreting a particular question, which can introduce unwanted  variability into the survey results. We took steps to minimize nonsampling  errors by pretesting the questionnaire in person with PIOs and deputy  PIOs at three different agencies. We conducted these pretests to make  sure that the questions were clear and unbiased, the data and information  were readily obtainable, and that the questionnaire did not place an  undue burden on respondents. Additionally, a senior methodologist within  our office independently reviewed a draft of the questionnaire prior to its  administration. We made appropriate revisions to the content and format  of the questionnaire after the pretests and independent review. All data  analysis programs used to generate survey results were independently  verified for accuracy. Additionally, in reviewing the answers from  agencies, we confirmed that PIOs had correctly bypassed inapplicable  questions (skip patterns).

HHS is a relatively large agency when ranked according  to annual budget and number of staff, while NSF is a relatively small  agency. Additionally, HHS\u2019s PIO is a political appointee, while NSF\u2019s PIO  is a career civil servant. In making our selection, we excluded agencies  with certain characteristics, including those with a PIO that was relatively  new to the role at the time of our survey and agencies that had been the  subject of recent case studies on performance management by us or  other organizations. We conducted interviews with both selected  agencies\u2019 COOs, PIOs, and deputy PIOs.", "In addition, in order to understand the priority goal leader role and its  contributions to performance management, we selected three of HHS\u2019s  six priority goals and two of NSF\u2019s three priority goals and interviewed the  responsible goal leaders. We selected these goals on the basis of several  characteristics that may affect their management. These include: (1)  number of priority goal leaders\u2014we selected some goals with one leader  and some with multiple leaders; (2) number of agency components  involved in the goal\u2014we selected goals with varying numbers of  components and other stakeholders involved; (3) type of goal\u2014we  selected some process goals and some outcome goals; and (4)  relationship to cross-agency priority goals\u2014we included one goal in our  set that relates to a cross-agency priority goal.
