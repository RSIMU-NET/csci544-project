The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated our original report as Limited Official Use because of the sensitive and specific nature of the information it contained. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the DHS bureau responsible for protecting the nation's borders at and between the official ports of entry, has the dual goals of preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States and also facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel. Approximately 90 percent of the world's cargo moves by container. Addressing the threat posed by the movement of containerized cargo across U.S. borders has traditionally posed many challenges for CBP, in particular balancing the bureau's border protection functions and trade enforcement mission with its goal of facilitating the flow of cargo and persons into the United States. CBP has said that the large volume of imports and its limited resources make it impossible to physically inspect all oceangoing containers without disrupting the flow of commerce, and it is unrealistic to expect that all containers warrant such inspection. To address its responsibility to improve cargo security while facilitating commerce, CBP employs multiple strategies. Among these strategies, CBP has in place an initiative known as C-TPAT, which aims to secure the flow of goods bound for the United States by developing a strong, voluntary antiterrorism partnership with the trade community. C-TPAT members commit to improving the security of their supply chain (flow of goods from manufacturer to retailer) and develop written security profiles that outline the security measures in place for the company's supply chain. In exchange for this commitment, CBP offers C-TPAT members benefits for participating that may reduce the level of scrutiny given to their shipments, potentially resulting in a reduced number of inspections of their cargo at U.S. borders. The program is promising, but previous work has raised concerns about its management and its ability to achieve its ultimate goal of improved cargo security. Given our past concerns about the program's effectiveness and in light of the program's rapid expansion, we examined selected aspects of the program's operation and management.

These benefits may change the risk characterization of their shipments, thereby reducing the probability of extensive documentary and physical inspection. Other benefits include access to FAST lanes on the Canadian and Mexican borders, expedited cargo processing at FAST lanes, and an emphasis on self-policing and self-monitoring of security activities. In addition, CBP grants benefits to C-TPAT members that do not directly affect the level of scrutiny given to their shipments. Before providing benefits, CBP uses a two-pronged approach to assess C-TPAT members. First, CBP has a certification process to review the self-reported information contained in applicants' membership agreements and security profiles. Second, CBP has in place a vetting process to try to assess the compliance with customs laws and regulations and violation history of and intelligence data on importers before granting them benefits. CBP believes that this two-pronged approach provides adequate assurance before granting benefits. However, this approach grants benefits to members before they undergo the validation process. After providing benefits, CBP has a validation process to verify that C-TPAT members' security measures have been implemented and that program benefits should continue. However, we found several weaknesses in the validation process that compromise CBP's ability to provide an actual verification that supply chain security measures in C-TPAT members' security profiles are accurate and are being followed. First, the validation process is not rigorous enough to achieve its stated purpose, which is to ensure that the security procedures outlined in members' security profiles are reliable, accurate, and effective. Related to this, CBP has no written guidelines for its supply chain specialists to indicate what scope of effort is adequate for the validation to ensure that the member's measures are reliable, accurate, and effective. In addition, CBP has not determined the extent to which validations are needed. While CBP has recently completed a strategic plan, we found weaknesses in some of the tools it uses to manage the program that could hinder the bureau in achieving the program's dual goals of securing the flow of goods bound for the United States and facilitating the flow of trade. CBP's new strategic plan appears to provide the bureau with a general framework on which to base key decisions, including key strategic planning elements such as strategic goals, objectives, and strategies. However, CBP still lacks a human capital plan, a fact that has impaired its ability to manage its resources. Furthermore, CBP still has not developed a comprehensive set of performance measures and indicators, including outcome-based measures, to monitor the status of program goals. Finally, the C-TPAT program lacks an effective records management system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report is a publicly available version of our report on the Customs- Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT).

To  ascertain the manner in which CBP validates security procedures for  participating companies, we asked CBP to provide us with examples of  participant files, including files of participants with responsibilities along  various parts of the supply chain. While the files we reviewed were not a  representative sample of files, we noted that in many cases these files  were incomplete. We also reviewed CBP\u2019s database for tracking  participant status in the program. Initial reliability testing of this database  and interviews of staff with responsibility for the program led us to  conclude that data used to track participant status had some serious  reliability weaknesses. However, we found the data sufficiently reliable for  limited use in describing the program\u2019s status.

Disruptions to the supply chain  could have immediate and significant economic impacts. For example, in  terms of containers, CBP data indicates that in 2003 about 90 percent of  the world\u2019s cargo moved by container. In the United States, almost half of  all incoming trade (by value) arrived by containers on board ships. Almost  7 million cargo containers arrive and are offloaded at U.S. seaports each  year. Additionally, containers arrive via truck and rail. Therefore, it is vital  for CBP to try to strike a balance between its antiterrorism efforts and  facilitating the flow of legitimate international trade and travel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Vulnerability of the Supply Chain", "paragraphs": ["The terrorist events of September 11, 2001, raised concerns about  company supply chains, particularly oceangoing cargo containers,  potentially being used to move weapons of mass destruction to the United  States. An extensive body of work on this subject by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation and academic, think tank, and business organizations  concluded that while the likelihood of such use of containers is considered  low, the movement of oceangoing containerized cargo is vulnerable to  some form of terrorist action. Such action, including attempts to smuggle  either fully assembled weapons of mass destruction or their individual  components, could lead to widespread death and damage.", "The supply chain is particularly vulnerable to potential terrorists because  of the number of individual companies handling and moving cargo through  it. To move a container from production facilities overseas to distribution  points in the United States, an importer has multiple options regarding the  logistical process, such as routes and the selection of freight carriers. For  example, some importers might own and operate key aspects of the  overseas supply chain process, such as warehousing and trucking  operations. Alternatively, importers might contract with logistical service  providers, including freight consolidators and nonvessel-operating  common carriers. In addition, importers must choose among various  modes of transportation to use, such as rail, truck, or barge, to move  containers from the manufacturer\u2019s warehouse to the port of lading. As  shown in table 1, there are many players in the trade community, each  with a role in the supply chain.", "According to research initiated by the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s  Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, importers who own and  operate the entire supply chain route from start to finish suffer fewer  security breaches than others because they have greater control over their  supply chains. However, relatively few importers own and operate all key  aspects of the cargo container transportation process, relying instead on  second parties to move containerized cargo and prepare various  transportation documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP\u2019s Layered Enforcement Strategy", "paragraphs": ["CBP has implemented a layered enforcement strategy to prevent terrorists  and weapons of mass destruction from entering the United States through  the supply chain. A key element of this strategy is CBP\u2019s targeting and  inspection of cargo that arrives at U.S. ports. For all arriving cargo  containers, CBP uses a targeting strategy that employs its computerized  targeting model, the Automated Targeting System (ATS). CBP uses ATS to  review container documentation and help select, or target, shipments for  additional documentary review or physical inspection. ATS is operated by  CBP\u2019s National Targeting Center and is characterized by CBP as an expert  system that uses hundreds of targeting rules to check available data for  every arriving container, assigning a risk characterization to each  container. The risk characterization helps to determine the type and level  of scrutiny a container will receive. For example, CBP could review the  container\u2019s bill of lading, examine the container with nonintrusive  inspection equipment (that is, X-ray), or physically open the container. The  extent of review varies, since according to CBP, the large volume of  imports and CBP\u2019s limited resources make it impossible to physically  inspect all containers without disrupting the flow of commerce.", "Initiated in November 2001, C-TPAT is another element of CBP\u2019s layered  enforcement strategy. C-TPAT is a voluntary program designed to improve  the security of the international supply chain while maintaining an  efficient flow of goods. Under C-TPAT, CBP officials work in partnership  with private companies to review their supply chain security plans to  improve members\u2019 overall security. In return for committing to making  improvements to the security of their shipments by joining the program,   C-TPAT members may receive benefits that result in reduced scrutiny of  their shipments (e.g., reduced number of inspections or shorter border  wait times for their shipments). C-TPAT membership is open to U.S.-based  companies in the trade community, including (1) air/rail/sea carriers,   (2) border highway carriers, (3) importers, (4) licensed customs brokers,  (5) air freight consolidators and ocean transportation intermediaries and  nonvessel-operating common carriers, and (6) port authorities or terminal  operators. According to CBP officials, program membership has grown  rapidly, and continued growth is expected, especially as member  importers are requiring their suppliers to become C-TPAT members.   For example, as of January 2003 approximately 1,700 companies had  become C-TPAT members. By May 2003, the number had nearly doubled  to 3,355. According to CBP officials, as of November 2004, the C-TPAT  program had 7,312 members. For fiscal year 2004, the C-TPAT budget was  about $18 million, with a requested budget for fiscal year 2005 of about   $38 million for program expansion efforts. As of August 2004, CBP had  hired 40 supply chain specialists, who are dedicated to serve as the  principal advisers and primary points of contact for C-TPAT members.  The specialists are located in Washington, D.C., Miami, Florida, Los  Angeles, California, and New York, New York.", "CBP has a multistep review process for the C-TPAT program. As figure   1 shows, applicants first submit signed C-TPAT agreements affirming their  desire to participate in the voluntary program. Applicants must also  submit security profiles\u2014executive summaries of their company\u2019s existing  supply chain security procedures\u2014that follow guidelines jointly developed  by CBP and the trade community. These security profiles are to summarize  the applicant\u2019s current security procedures in areas such as physical  security, personnel security, and education and training awareness. CBP  established a certification process in which it reviews the applications and  profiles by comparing their contents with the security guidelines jointly  developed by CBP and the industry, looking for any weaknesses or gaps in  the descriptions of security procedures. Once any issues are resolved to  CBP\u2019s satisfaction, CBP signs the agreement and the company is  considered to be a certified C-TPAT member, eligible for program benefits.  Members that are not importers begin receiving benefits at this point, but  members that are importers must undergo another layer of review, as  described below. CBP encourages members to conduct self-assessments  of their security profiles each year to determine any significant changes  and to notify CBP. For example, members may be using new suppliers or  new trucking companies and would need to update their security profiles  to reflect these changes.", "For certified importers, CBP has an additional layer of review called the  vetting process in which CBP reviews information about an importer\u2019s  compliance with customs laws and regulations and violation history. CBP  requires the vetting process for certified importers as a condition of  granting them key program benefits. As part of the vetting process, CBP  obtains trade compliance and intelligence information on certified  importers from several data sources. If CBP gives the importer a favorable  review, benefits are to begin within a few weeks. If not, benefits are not to  be granted until successful completion of the validation process (see  below).", "The final step in the review process is validation. CBP\u2019s stated purpose for  validations is to ensure that the security measures outlined in certified  members\u2019 security profiles and periodic self-assessments are reliable,  accurate, and effective. In the validation process, CBP staff meet with  company representatives to verify the supply chain security measures  contained in the company\u2019s security profile. The validation process is  designed to include visits to the company\u2019s domestic and, potentially,  foreign sites. The member and CBP jointly determine which elements of  the member\u2019s supply chain measures will be validated, as well as which  locations will be visited. Upon completion of the validation process, CBP  prepares a final validation report it presents to the company that identifies  any areas that need improvement and suggested corrective actions, as well  as a determination if program benefits are still warranted for the member.", "We have conducted previous reviews of the C-TPAT program and CBP\u2019s  targeting and inspection strategy. In July 2003, we reported that CBP\u2019s  management of C-TPAT had not evolved from a short-term focus to a long- term strategic approach. We recommended that the Secretary of  Homeland Security work with the CBP Commissioner to develop (1) a  strategic plan that clearly lays out the program\u2019s goals, objectives, and  detailed implementation strategies; (2) performance measures that include  outcome-oriented indicators; and (3) a human capital plan that clearly  describes how C-TPAT will recruit, train, and retain new staff to meet the  program\u2019s growing demands as it implements new program elements.

If the issues are resolved, CBP considers  the member to be certified. However, if CBP determines that the security  profiles contain weaknesses, CBP is not supposed to certify the member.  According to CBP, approximately 20 percent of applications are not  immediately certified because of initial shortcomings with the security  profiles. However, CBP has stated that a company will not be rejected  from participating in C-TPAT if there are problems with its security profile.  Instead, CBP says it will work with companies to try to resolve and  overcome any deficiencies with the profile itself.", "Second, CBP has in place a vetting process to assess the compliance and  violation history of importers before granting them benefits. If, in  conducting the vetting process, CBP finds no prior negative compliance,  violation, or intelligence information, it grants certified importers program  benefits. According to CBP, to date most certified members who have  been vetted have proven to have favorable or neutral importing histories.  CBP officials told us that not many members have been denied benefits.", "At the program\u2019s inception in November 2001, CBP began granting benefits  to applicants upon receipt of their application for C-TPAT membership  without any review of the applicants\u2019 paperwork. In February 2004, CBP  changed its policy to retroactively delay granting the benefits until after  CBP reviewed and certified applicants\u2019 security profiles and completed the  vetting process. By providing incentives to members to implement certain  security measures and performing various levels of checks on these  measures, the C-TPAT program aims to encourage the reduction of  vulnerability throughout the supply chain. CBP established a certification  process in which it reviews the applications and profiles by comparing  their contents with the security guidelines jointly developed by CBP and  the industry, looking for any weaknesses or gaps in the descriptions of  security procedures. The vetting process, which is required for importers  eligible to receive benefits, augments the certification process by  providing information about past compliance and violations, which CBP  officials told us may suggest whether members\u2019 security practices have  historically been effective at reducing vulnerability to exploitation. In  addition, the vetting process may disclose threat concerns by pulling in  information contained in intelligence databases. Ultimately, however,  neither the certification nor vetting process provides an actual verification  that the supply chain security measures contained in the C-TPAT  member\u2019s security profile are accurate and are being followed before CBP  grants the member benefits.

CBP has indicated that it does not  intend for the validation process to be an exhaustive review of every  security measure at each originating location; rather it selects specific  facets of the members\u2019 security profiles to review for their reliability,  accuracy, and effectiveness. For example, the guidance to ocean carriers  for preparing a security profile directs the carriers to address, at a  minimum, three broad areas (security program, personnel security, and  service provider requirements), which contain several more specific  security measures, such as facilities security and pre-employment  screening. According to CBP officials, as well as our review of selected  case files, validations only examine a few facets of members\u2019 security  profiles. CBP supply chain specialists, who are responsible for conducting  most of the validations, are supposed to individually determine which  segments of a company\u2019s supply chain security will be suggested to the  member for validation. To assist in this decision, supply chain specialists  are supposed to compare a company\u2019s security profile, as well as any self- assessments or other company materials or information retrievable in  national databases, against the C-TPAT security guidelines to determine  which elements of the profile will be validated.

CBP\u2019s Director, Strategic Planning and Audit Division, Office of  Policy and Planning, noted that developing these measures for C-TPAT, as  well as other programs in the bureau, has been difficult. The director  noted that CBP lacks data necessary to exhibit whether a program has  prevented or deterred terrorist activity. For example, as noted in the   C-TPAT strategic plan, it is difficult to measure program effectiveness in  terms of deterrence because generally the direct impact on unlawful  activity is unknown. The plan also notes that while traditional workload  measures are a valuable indicator, they do not necessarily reflect the  success or failure of the bureau\u2019s efforts. CBP is working to collect more  substantive information\u2014related to C-TPAT activities (i.e., current  workflow process)\u2014to develop its performance measures.

Further, standards  for internal control in the federal government require that all transactions  be clearly documented in a manner that is complete, accurate, and useful  to managers and others involved in evaluating operations.", "To get a better understanding of the validation process, we asked CBP to  provide us with examples of company files for which validations had been  completed. CBP selected six members\u2019 files for us to review for some of  the initial validations the bureau conducted. During our review, it was not  always clear what aspect of the security profile was being validated and  why a particular site was selected at which to conduct the validation  because there was not always documentation of the decision-making  process. The aspects of the security profiles covered and sites visited did  not always appear to be the most relevant. For example, one validation  report we reviewed for a major retailer\u2014one that imports the vast  majority of its goods from Asia\u2014indicated that the validation team  reviewed facilities in Central America. CBP officials noted that it recently  revised its validation report format to better capture any justification for  report recommendations and best practices identified. CBP then provided  us with eight additional member files with more recently completed  validation reports. After reviewing the more recent validation reports  contained in these files, we noted that there appeared to be a greater  discussion related to the rationale for validating specific aspects of the  security profiles. However, these files did not consistently contain other  documentation of members\u2019 application, certification, vetting, receipt of  benefits, or validation. While files contained some of these elements, they  were generally not complete. In fact, most files did not usually contain  anything beyond copies of the member\u2019s C-TPAT agreement, security  profiles, and validation report. When we asked if CBP required its supply  chain specialists to document their communications with C-TPAT  members, CBP officials told us there has been no requirement that  communications be documented. For example, member files we reviewed  contained no documentation of communications between CBP and  members regarding how the scope of a validation was determined.  Recently, supply chain specialists located at CBP headquarters (but not at  field offices) have been asked to document all conversations with member  companies on a spreadsheet, so that each supply chain specialist will be  aware of the outcomes of conversations with member companies.", "CBP does not update programmatic information regularly or accurately. In  particular, the reliability of CBP\u2019s database to track member status using  key dates in the application through validation processes is questionable.  The database, which is primarily used for documentation management and  workflow tracking, is not updated on a regular basis. In addition, C-TPAT  management told us that earlier data entered into the database may not be  accurate, and CBP has taken no systematic look at the reliability of the  database. CBP officials also told us that there are no written guidelines for  who should enter information into the database or how frequently the  database should be updated. We made several requests over a period of  weeks to review the contents of the database to analyze workload factors,  including the amount of time that each step in the C-TPAT application and  review process was taking. The database information that CBP ultimately  provided to us was incomplete, as many of the data fields were missing or  inaccurate. For example, more than 33 percent of the entries for validation  date were incomplete. In addition, data on the status of companies  undergoing the validation process was provided in hard copy only and  included no date information. CBP officials told us that they are currently  exploring other data management systems, working to develop a new,  single database that would capture pertinent data, as well as developing a  paperless environment for the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CBP\u2019s primary reliance on members\u2019 self-reporting about their security  procedures to receive C-TPAT benefits places added importance on the  validation process, which is CBP\u2019s method of verifying the effectiveness,  efficiency, and accuracy of the security profile. However, the weaknesses  in the validation process we found raise questions about its effectiveness.  CBP\u2019s validation process, the purpose of which is to ensure that members\u2019  security measures are reliable, accurate, and effective, is not rigorous  enough to achieve CBP\u2019s goals because of the bureau\u2019s consideration of  the process as a joint, partnership review with the member company. In  this vein, without guidelines for what constitutes a validation, CBP cannot  be sure that it effectively and consistently verifies a standard set of  security measures to ensure some minimally appropriate level of  vulnerability reduction, nor can it apply a methodical approach to  assessing the security procedures. In addition, CBP has not assessed the  extent (in terms of numbers or percentage) to which it must conduct  validations to ensure that the C-TPAT program is consistent with its  overall approach to managing risk. Also, we found a lack of clear  documentation for the validation process. Because of these weaknesses,  CBP\u2019s ability to provide assurance that the program prevents terrorists and  terrorist weapons from entering the United States is limited.", "Finally, CBP has not completed corrective actions from our July 2003  report, which were meant to change the management of the program from  a short-term focus to a strategic focus. Specifically, CBP has not  completed (1) developing performance measures with which to measure  the program\u2019s success in achieving bureau goals and inform decisions for  process improvement and (2) developing a human capital plan to account  for how the program will recruit, train, and retain staff to achieve program  goals.

Specifically, CBP said that it was  developing standard operating procedures, guidance, and written baseline  criteria for the validation process, as well as an automated validation tool  to document validations. CBP also agreed to determine the extent to  which C-TPAT members should be validated, stating that it will develop  member selection criteria and an automated system to standardize and  assist in the selection of companies for validation. If properly  implemented, these actions should address the intent of these  recommendations.", "Our draft report also included a recommendation to complete a formal  strategic plan that clearly articulates goals, linkages, and strategies. While  our draft report was with DHS for comment, CBP issued its final strategic  plan on January 13, 2005. Our brief review of this strategic plan indicates  that it appears to address the intent of our recommendation. Therefore, we  removed the recommendation from this report. Nevertheless, as CBP  further refines its strategic plan in the future, we encourage CBP to  include all of the key elements of a strategic plan as described in the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Specifically, the formal  strategic plan should include a description of performance goals and how  they are related to the general goals and objectives of the program, as well  as a description of program evaluations, which are useful for identifying  key factors likely to affect program performance.", "CBP agreed with our recommendation on developing performance  measures, and has developed initial measures relating to membership,  inspection percentages, and validation effectiveness. CBP has developed  new performance measures for use in the FY 2006 Fiscal Year Homeland  Security Plan and plans to enlist the help of a contractor to develop other  outcome-based performance measures and targets. If properly  implemented, these plans should help address the intent of this  recommendation.", "In addressing our recommendation to complete a human capital plan for  the C-TPAT program, CBP told us it is still developing an implementation  plan for the program that will include those elements required in a human  capital plan. For example, CBP said it has developed new positions,  training programs and materials, and a staffing plan. Further, CBP said the  C-TPAT program will continue to refine all aspects of its human capital  plan to include headquarters personnel, additional training requirements,  budget, and future personnel profiles. If the final implementation plan  contains these elements, the plan should address the intent of the  recommendation.", "CBP agreed with our recommendation on implementing a records  management system that accurately and timely documents key decisions  and significant operational events. While its comments did not specify the  nature or capabilities of a new system, CBP indicated that in the near  future, it plans to automate every aspect of the C-TPAT program, both  internally and externally. In automating its system, to fully meet the intent  of this recommendation, CBP needs to ensure that the system addresses  all aspects of C-TPAT operations and that tracking member status is done  timely, accurately, and reliably.", "Notwithstanding its general agreement with the recommendations, CBP  expressed some concerns regarding the report. In its general comments,  CBP said that C-TPAT is a voluntary program that is not designed to  confirm company compliance with regulatory requirements. Further, CBP  said it is very difficult for the U.S. government to regulate supply chain  security procedures outside the country. CBP also noted that it is looking  to establish more broadly applicable minimum security standards that may  build on C-TPAT requirements. Our report clearly notes that the program  is of a voluntary nature, designed around security guidelines jointly  developed by CBP and the trade community. The cooperation envisioned  by the C-TPAT program can build productive relationships and encourage  supply chain security. However, in accepting members into the program,  CBP still has the responsibility for verifying that security measures  planned or claimed by C-TPAT members are properly implemented and  effective. This program goes beyond trade facilitation in that it awards  benefits that can reduce the scrutiny given cargo containers arriving in the  United States. This is not a matter of regulating supply chain security in  other countries. Rather, it is a matter of providing a security benefit for  containers arriving at our nation\u2019s ports. If CBP does not ensure that this  important security-related benefit is deserved, it runs the risk of  overlooking potentially dangerous cargo during the inspection process.", "CBP also said that the report\u2019s title is misleading, asserting that it creates  the improper impression that only the validation process ensures adequate  security for containerized cargo and does not place enough emphasis on  the certification and vetting processes, as well as omits that C-TPAT cargo  is not exempt from advance reporting requirements or enforcement and  security inspections, such as random inspections and nonintrusive  screening technology. Our report clearly describes the various steps CBP  takes in the overall cargo inspection process and how the C-TPAT  program fits into that process. The report also clearly describes the  purpose of each process within the C-TPAT program, including the  validation process that is to determine whether C-TPAT members\u2019 security  procedures are accurate, reliable, and effective. We did modify the report\u2019s  title and, where appropriate, the text to better reflect the report\u2019s focus on  C-TPAT versus other programs in CBP\u2019s layered enforcement strategy for  cargo security. However, any weakness in C-TPAT could weaken CBP\u2019s  layered approach. Given that C-TPAT members enjoy benefits that reduce  the likelihood of an inspection of their cargo, not having an effective  validation process could serve to defeat the purposes of the other  enforcement layers.", "Finally, CBP noted many benefits achieved under the C-TPAT program,  including that thousands of companies working as part of C-TPAT have  taken concrete steps to improve their security procedures and that   C-TPAT has fostered an expanding international dialogue on best security  practices. We agree that actions on the part of program members to shore  up supply chain security are valuable and desirable. Again, with the threat  of terrorism present in the global supply chain, we believe that verifying  that planned improvements are actually implemented and ensuring that  security controls are effective are important responsibilities that cannot be  achieved only with members self-reporting about their security  procedures.", "CBP also offered technical comments and clarifications, which we  considered and incorporated where appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.
