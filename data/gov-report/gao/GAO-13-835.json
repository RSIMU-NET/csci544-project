According to Office of Management and Budget Circular A-94, in order to evaluate and compare funding initiatives, decision-makers need to be aware of benefits, costs, and strategies related to achieving program goals. By improving guidance on the type of data to include, IRS could help ensure the templates are fully completed.", "IRS significantly improved its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) cost estimate. In particular, the December 2012 estimate is more comprehensive, reflecting the full life-cycle cost of the program--estimated at $1.89 billion for fiscal year 2010 through 2026. A few areas of improvement remain, primarily regarding the accuracy and credibility of the cost estimate. For example, IRS showed how the December 2012 estimate differed from the previous estimate, but did not explain the factors that resulted in the variances. In addition, IRS did not obtain a second cost estimate that could be used to assess the reasonableness of the $1.89 billion estimated program costs.", "Although the information technology (IT) systems for PPACA met dollar thresholds (as outlined in the Department of Treasury's guidance) as a major investment for public reporting, IRS did not report this as such. Officials told GAO they did not have time to prepare the information for the fiscal year 2014 budget justification, but plan to do so for fiscal year 2015. Until IRS publicly reports the IT systems for PPACA as a major investment, transparency about these systems' implementation and administration is limited.", "Although IRS included new and useful information on its major IT investments in the budget justification (such as life-cycle costs) other important information (such as the start date and percent of life-cycle costs obligated) is reported elsewhere or must be calculated.

For  example, non-IT costs for merchant card and basis matching are tracked  separately from the related Information Reporting and Document  Matching (IRDM) IT system. Furthermore, organizational entities and  other efforts of interest are not discrete. Obligations can be analyzed in  different ways, such as from an organizational perspective or a program  perspective. Different analyses should not necessarily be summed  together because they may use different perspectives and, when  considered together, might result in overlaps or gaps.

According to IRS, if funded, the initiative would  protect revenue because these activities would identify fraudulent returns  related to identity theft and resolve cases prior to issuing a refund. To  estimate the amount of projected revenue that would be protected, IRS  determined the dollar amount of erroneous refunds detected per FTE  from the beginning of the 2012 tax filing season through August of that  year.

(See  appendix IV for our full assessment of the updated PPACA cost  estimate.) In June 2012, we reported that IRS\u2019s cost estimate for PPACA  did not fully meet best practices for a reliable cost estimate.", "When enacted, PPACA contained 47 tax-related provisions that IRS is  responsible for implementing with effective dates through 2018. Meeting  these statutory requirements has required a significant IT investment in  new data models, databases, and IT systems and operations support.  IRS\u2019s PPACA cost estimate is important in determining and  communicating a realistic view of a program\u2019s likely cost and schedule  outcomes that can be used to plan the work necessary to develop,  produce, install, and support the program.

We found that the cost estimate only partially met best practices  for accuracy and credibility. Specifically, we identified three deficiencies in  the accuracy of the cost estimate. First, the cost estimate was not fully  adjusted for inflation. IRS adjusted future costs for inflation, and  documented inflation rates, but reported past costs in current year dollars.  Because sunk costs were not adjusted for inflation, their contribution to  the cost estimate is higher than it should be. In August 2013, the IRS  Chief Financial Officer told us that, as a result of this finding, IRS has  already revised the next update to the PPACA cost estimate to adjust  sunk costs for inflation. Second, IRS included actual sunk costs in the  estimate, but it did not use earned value management\u2014a process for  capturing actual costs and comparing them to estimated costs. Earned  value management would enable IRS to continuously update the estimate  to reflect actual costs. Third, the estimate shows how it varies from a  previous estimate, but it does not explain factors behind the variance. If  the reasons for cost variances are not captured, estimators cannot  identify lessons learned that would improve future estimates.", "We also identified three deficiencies in the credibility of the cost estimate.  First, IRS conducted a sensitivity analysis on two cost drivers (a  sensitivity analysis examines the effects on changing assumptions and  estimating procedures to highlight elements that are cost-sensitive).  However, it is not clear how the two cost drivers were selected for  analysis or whether IRS identified the cost elements that were the most  sensitive to change. Second, IRS developed multiple risk management  plans and conducted a risk and uncertainty analysis, but it is unclear how  the risk management plans were applied to address the risks identified in  the cost estimate. In addition, IRS incorrectly treated the total funding risk  for the entire program as equal to the sum of the risks of individual  elements. A proper risk and uncertainty analysis is necessary to correctly  assess the variability in the cost estimate due to program risks. Third, IRS  did not obtain a second cost estimate. The GAO Cost Guide specifies that  producing two cost estimates that are independent of one another is a  best practice because the second cost estimate can validate the first and  provide an unbiased test of whether the original cost estimate is  reasonable.", "We discussed each of these deficiencies with IRS officials, who stated  they gained a better understanding of the criteria in the GAO Cost Guide  based on our meeting. Because it provides a sound basis for informed  investment decision making, realistic budget formulation, and  accountability for results, developing a reliable cost estimate that meets  best practices is critical to PPACA\u2019s success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Did Not Report PPACA Investment Information on the OMB Dashboard Website", "paragraphs": ["Although the IT systems used to implement PPACA (which IRS refers to  as the ACA IT investment) meet the Department of Treasury\u2019s (Treasury)  definition of a major investment, IRS reported the investment as a non- major investment in fiscal year 2014.

Consulting with relevant committees regarding IT  investments would provide IRS with an opportunity to share performance  information and confirm that various committees are getting the types of  performance information needed. Congressional staffs have requested  comprehensive, easy to understand information on IRS\u2019s IT investments:  providing it in a comprehensive, consolidated format could provide them  with better information to guide decisions. Congress directed IRS to  include a summary of cost and schedule performance information for its  major IT investments in its budget justification for fiscal year 2013; in  addition, starting in March 2012, IRS was required to submit  a report  after every quarter with specific information on IRS\u2019s selected major IT  investments, including a \u201cplain English\u201d explanation of the cost and  schedule for the previous three months and the cost and schedule  performance for the upcoming three months. IRS has been submitting  these reports and briefing the Appropriations Committees and other  congressional stakeholders.

Furthermore, IRS\u2019s new pre-selection process for determining which  initiatives to request funding for was reported by officials to be a more  efficient method for commencing budget formulation, although enhanced  guidance could make it more effective. We also identified some other  actions that could improve the budget request and aid Congress in  decision making, including (1) improving the accuracy and credibility of  the PPACA cost estimate in future updates because it provides the basis  for informed investment decision making, realistic budget formulation, and  accountability for results, (2) ensuring the ACA IT investment is publicly  reported to increase transparency and (3) reporting consolidated  information on major IT investments to make the information more  accessible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the budget process and to improve transparency, we  recommend the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue take the  following four actions:  Improve guidance given to business units for the pre-selection budget  formulation process, emphasizing the importance of information on  the estimated impact\u2014qualitative or quantitative\u2014of proposed budget  initiatives.", "Improve the accuracy and credibility of future updates to the PPACA  cost estimate by taking the following actions to more closely follow  best practices outlined in the GAO Cost Guide:", "Use earned value management to capture actual costs and use  them as a basis for future updates.", "Explain why variances occurred between the current estimate and  previous estimates.", "Document how cost drivers are selected for future sensitivity  analyses.", "Conduct future risk and uncertainty analyses consistent with best  practices, and develop and document plans to address risks.", "Validate the original cost estimate by preparing a second,  independent cost estimate.", "Publicly report the ACA IT investment as a major investment on the  OMB IT Dashboard and the fiscal year 2015 budget request, including  standard cost, schedule, and performance information.", "Report key data on major IT investments in one consolidated  document, such as the congressional justification, in consultation with  congressional stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Acting Commissioner of the IRS  for his review and comment. We received an email on September 18,  2013 from the Chief Financial Officer, which included an attachment that  provided the agency\u2019s comments to our recommendations. This  attachment is reprinted in appendix VI. In response to our draft report, the  Chief Financial Officer stated that IRS agreed with three of our four  recommendations and identified actions planned and taken to address  them. For example, IRS agreed to include additional data on its major IT  investments in the congressional justification, such as actual obligations  for the investment to date. IRS agreed with the majority of the actions  associated with our fourth recommendation on improving the accuracy  and credibility of future updates of the PPACA cost estimate. IRS  disagreed with two actions contained in our fourth recommendation.  Specifically,  IRS disagreed with our recommended action to use earned value  management, a process that would enable IRS to continuously update  the cost estimate to reflect actual costs.  IRS stated that earned value  management is not part of its current program management  processes because the cost and burden to use earned value  management outweigh the value added. We disagree with IRS\u2019s view  as to the benefits of earned value management. GAO has found that  programs that establish good earned value management systems  realize better project management decision making and fewer cost  and schedule overruns. While there is an upfront investment to  establish the earned value management system, there are long-term  benefits that go beyond the individual project, such as fostering  accountability, improving insight into program performance, and  providing objective information for managing the program. Further, the  OMB Capital Programming Guide states that earned value  management is a critical component of risk management for major  investments.  IRS also disagreed with our recommended action to validate the  PPACA cost estimate by preparing a second, independent cost  estimate. IRS stated that the cost and burden of having an external  organization produce a second, independent cost estimate of the  same scope would outweigh the value added. In addition, IRS stated  that an external organization would lack the knowledge necessary to  produce a reasonable estimate without relying heavily on the IRS  group that produced the first estimate. We disagree with IRS\u2019s view.  As reflected in the GAO Cost Guide, GAO has found that producing a  second, independent cost estimate is considered one of the best and  most reliable methods for validating a cost estimate. Without a  second, independent cost estimate, decision makers lack insight into  a program\u2019s potential costs and may lack confidence that the estimate  is reasonable and costs described in the first estimate can be  achieved. While preparing a second cost estimate that is independent  of the first cost estimate requires additional resources, it is generally  based on the same detailed technical and procurement information.  Furthermore, an independent cost estimate does not need to be  conducted by an external organization, but the estimation team should  be outside the acquisition chain and have nothing at stake with regard  to program outcome or funding decisions. The major benefit of a  second, independent cost estimate is that it provides an objective and  unbiased assessment of whether the original estimate can be  achieved; reducing the risk that the program will proceed underfunded  or costs will exceed its value.", "We plan to send copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking  Members of other Senate and House committees and subcommittees that  have appropriation, authorization, and oversight responsibilities for IRS.

The objectives of this report were  to (1) describe IRS\u2019s capacity to report fiscal year 2012 obligations and  full-time equivalent (FTE) data for program activities, organizational  entities, and other efforts of interest; (2) assess IRS\u2019s process and the  type of information used to prioritize and select new program initiatives;  (3) describe proposed base budget savings; (4) describe IRS\u2019s new  projected return on investment (ROI) methodologies; (5) evaluate steps  IRS took to improve the cost estimate for the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in accordance with GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide and determine the extent to which IRS is  transparently reporting on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) information  technology (IT) investment; (6) summarize IRS\u2019s major IT investments  and assess the type of information available in the congressional  justification; and (7) describe IRS\u2019s progress in implementing our prior  budget-related recommendations.", "To describe IRS\u2019s capacity to report fiscal year 2012 obligations and FTE  data, we reviewed documentation related to IRS budget formulation and  budget execution, including IRS\u2019s Financial Management Codes  Handbook, IRS\u2019s organizational chart, and its fiscal year 2014  congressional budget justification. We also interviewed knowledgeable  officials in IRS\u2019s Corporate Budget Office. We selected eight program  activities, organizational entities, and efforts of interest for analysis: (1)  Appeals, (2) Identity Theft, (3) International Exam and Collections, (4)  Merchant Card and Basis Matching and the related Information Reporting  and Document Matching (IRDM) IT system, (5) Offshore Voluntary  Disclosure Program, (6) Online Services, (7) Telephone and  Correspondence Services, and (8) Wage and Investment. We selected  this list based on the following criteria: whether it was included in the  proposed fiscal year 2014 budget initiatives, whether it was the topic of  prior GAO work, and whether the selected list (as a whole) spans most of  IRS\u2019s appropriation accounts and encompasses a range of methods by  which the data can be obtained from IRS\u2019s financial management system.  To determine IRS\u2019s capacity to compile fiscal year 2012 obligations data  for these eight items, we interviewed knowledgeable officials in IRS\u2019s  Corporate Budget Office. From the eight selected program activities,  organizational entities, and other efforts of interest, we selected two  illustrative examples to report fiscal year 2012 obligations data and to  show how IRS\u2019s budget formulation and budget execution structures  interact: Appeals, and Wage and Investment. We selected these two  examples largely to demonstrate the differences in structures. While they  are both fund centers in IRS\u2019s budget execution structure that manage  and distribute funds, Appeals is also a program activity in IRS\u2019s budget  formulation structure and shows a relatively simple relationship between  these structures. In contrast, Wage and Investment is a complex fund  center that receives funding from many segments of IRS\u2019s budget  formulation structure. We assessed the reliability of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2012  obligations data by reviewing relevant IRS documents, including the  Financial Management Codes Handbook, as well as prior work we  conducted that assesses IRS\u2019s financial statements.
