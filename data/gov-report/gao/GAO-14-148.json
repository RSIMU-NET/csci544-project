MA organizations' actual medical expenses, nonmedical expenses, and profits were 86.3 percent, 9.1 percent, and 4.5 percent of total revenue, respectively. As a percentage of revenue, all three categories were within 0.3 percentage points of what MA organizations had projected. In addition, MA organizations received, on average, $9,893 in total revenue per beneficiary, slightly higher than the projected amount of $9,635.", "The percentage of revenue spent on medical expenses and profits varied between MA contracts. For example, while MA organizations spent an average of 86.3 percent of revenue on medical expenses, 39 percent of beneficiaries were covered under contracts where less than 85 percent of revenue was spent on medical expenses. In addition, the accuracy of MA organizations' projections varied on the basis of the type of plans offered under the contract. For example, contracts for private fee-for-service plans--a plan type with new provider network requirements in 2011--had average profit margins that were 4 percentage points lower than projected.", "In 2011, plans offered by MA organizations with specific eligibility requirements had higher-than-projected profits. Special needs plans (SNP), which serve specific populations, such as those with specific chronic conditions, had an 8.6 percent profit margin, but had projected 6.2 percent. This higher percentage, combined with higher-than-projected revenue, resulted in SNPs reporting an average profit per beneficiary of $1,115, or 44 percent higher than projected ($777). Employer group plans, which are offered by employers or unions to their employees or retirees, as well as to Medicare-eligible spouses and dependants of participants in such plans, had a 7.6 percent profit margin, but had projected 4.2 percent.

In  addition to projections, MA organizations are required to report actual  medical expenses, nonmedical expenses, and profits for the year 2 years  prior to the upcoming year. For example, MA organizations reported their  actual 2011 expenses in their bid submission for 2013.", "In June and December 2008, we reported on MA organizations\u2019 projected  and actual medical expenses, nonmedical expenses, and profits for 2005  and 2006, respectively. We reported that, on average, MA organizations\u2019  self-reported actual medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were  lower in 2005 and 2006 than they had projected. Specifically, MA  organizations projected that they would spend, on average, 90.2 percent  of revenue on medical expenses in 2005 and 86.9 percent in 2006.  However, MA organizations\u2019 self-reported actual medical expenses were  85.7 percent of revenue, on average, in 2005, and 83.3 percent in 2006.  The lower-than-projected expenses resulted in MA organizations  receiving more profits, on average, than projected. Specifically, MA  organizations earned profits of $1.1 billion more than projected in 2005  and $1.3 billion more than projected in 2006.", "The accuracy of MA organizations\u2019 projections is important because, in  addition to determining Medicare payments to these organizations, these  projections affect the extent to which MA beneficiaries receive additional  benefits not provided under FFS and the amounts beneficiaries pay in  cost-sharing and premiums. Specifically, once Medicare payments are  determined, they are not modified if there are differences between actual  and projected expenses. Thus, if MA organizations had more accurately  projected their revenue and expenses in 2005 and 2006, they would  have, on average, been able to provide beneficiaries with additional  benefits or cost-sharing reductions and still maintain the level of profits  projected.", "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) included a new  requirement that, starting in 2014, MA organizations\u2019 must have a  minimum medical loss ratio of 85 percent\u2014that is, they must spend at  least 85 percent of their revenue on medical expenses, quality improving  activities, and reduced premiums.

If an MA organization\u2019s bid is higher than the benchmark,  the organization must charge beneficiaries a premium to collect the  amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark. If an MA organization\u2019s  bid is lower than the benchmark, the organization receives the amount of  the bid plus additional payments, known as rebates, equal to a  percentage of the difference between the benchmark and the bid.

CMS adjusts for differences in projected and actual enrollment through its  method for paying MA organizations. Specifically, MA organizations get  paid a PMPM amount and thus only get paid for actual enrollees. CMS  also adjusts PMPM payments to MA organizations on the basis of the  ratio of the benchmark rate in the beneficiary\u2019s county to the plan  benchmark. Thus, if a beneficiary comes from a county that has a  benchmark rate that is lower than the plan\u2019s benchmark, the plan will  receive a lower PMPM payment for that beneficiary.
