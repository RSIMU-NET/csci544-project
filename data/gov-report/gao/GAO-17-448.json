GAO's objectives were to (1) assess agencies' progress against OMB's data center optimization targets, (2) identify agencies' notable optimization successes and challenges, and (3) evaluate the extent to which agencies are able to effectively measure server utilization. To do so, GAO evaluated the 24 DCOI agencies' progress against OMB's fiscal year 2018 optimization targets, interviewed officials, and assessed agencies' efforts to implement monitoring tools for server utilization."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the 24 agencies required to participate in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI), 22 collectively reported limited progress against OMB's fiscal year 2018 performance targets. Two agencies did not have a basis to report on progress as they do not have agency-owned data centers. For OMB's five optimization targets, five agencies or less reported that they met or exceeded each of the targets (see figure).", "Further, as of April 2017, 17 of the 22 agencies were not planning to meet OMB's targets by September 30, 2018. This is concerning because the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act's (FITARA) data center consolidation and optimization provisions, such as those that require agencies to report on optimization progress and cost savings, expire a day later on October 1, 2018. Extending the time frame of these provisions would increase the likelihood that agencies will meet OMB's optimization targets and realize related cost savings. Additionally, until agencies improve their optimization progress, OMB's $2.7 billion initiative-wide cost savings goal may not be achievable.", "All 24 agencies reported successes in optimizing their data centers\u2014notably, the benefits of key technologies, such as virtualizing systems to improve performance, and increased energy efficiency. However, agencies also reported challenges related to, for example, improving the utilization of their data center facilities and competing for labor resources. It will be important for agencies to take action to address their identified challenges\u2014as GAO previously recommended\u2014in order to improve data center optimization progress.", "Of the 24 agencies required by OMB to implement automated monitoring tools to measure server utilization by the end of fiscal year 2018, 4 reported in their data center inventories as of February 2017 that they had fully implemented such tools, 18 reported that they had not, and 2 did not have a basis to report on progress because they do not have agency-owned data centers. Collectively, agencies reported that these tools were used at about 3 percent of their centers. Although federal standards emphasize the need to establish plans to help ensure goals are met, of the 18 agencies, none fully documented plans, 6 agencies had partially documented them, and 12 did not document them. Agencies provided varied reasons for this, including that they were still evaluating available tools. In addition, the lack of a formal requirement from OMB to establish the plans also contributed to agencies not having them. Until these plans are completed, agencies may be challenged in measuring server utilization."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider extending the time frame for the data center consolidation and optimization provisions of FITARA to provide agencies with additional time to meet OMB's targets and achieve cost savings.

In recent years, as federal agencies have modernized their  operations, put more of their services online, and improved their  information security profiles, their need for computing power and data  storage resources has grown. Accordingly, this growing demand has led  to a dramatic rise in the number of federal data centers and a  corresponding increase in operational costs. In response, the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO)  launched the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) in  2010 to reduce the growing number of centers.", "Congress has also recognized the importance of reforming the  government-wide management of IT, and in December 2014, Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform provisions (commonly  referred to as FITARA) were enacted as a part of the Carl Levin and  Howard P. \u2018Buck\u2019 McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2015. The law includes specific requirements related to federal  data center optimization including, for example, that OMB is to establish  metrics to measure data center optimization progress (to include server  efficiency).", "Pursuant to FITARA, in August 2016, the Federal CIO issued a  memorandum that announced the Data Center Optimization Initiative  (DCOI) as a successor effort to FDCCI. According to OMB, this new  initiative supersedes and builds on the results of FDCCI, and is also  intended to improve the performance of federal data centers in areas  such as facility utilization and power usage. Among other things, DCOI  requires 24 federal departments and agencies (agencies) to develop  plans and report on strategies (referred to as DCOI strategic plans) to  consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve  security posture, and achieve cost savings.", "Over the past several years, we have reported and testified that, while  data center consolidation and optimization could potentially save the  federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses exist in the execution  and oversight of these efforts. For example, in March 2016, we reported  that 22 agencies had collectively made limited progress against OMB\u2019s  fiscal year 2015 data center optimization performance metrics. As a  result, we recommended that these agencies take action to improve  optimization progress. Most agencies agreed with our recommendations  or had no comments.", "Given the importance of the optimization initiative, this report responds to  the committees\u2019 request that we review federal agencies\u2019 data center  optimization progress.

According to OMB, the federal government  reported 432 data centers in 1998, 2,094 in July 2010, and 9,995 in  August 2016. Operating such a large number of centers has been and  continues to be a significant cost to the federal government, including  costs for hardware, software, real estate, and cooling. For example, in  2007, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that the  electricity costs to operate federal servers and data centers across the  government were about $450 million annually. According to the  Department of Energy (Energy), a typical data center has 100 to 200  times the energy use intensity of a commercial building. In 2009, OMB  reported that server utilization rates as low as 5 percent across the  federal government\u2019s estimated 150,000 servers were a factor driving the  need to establish a coordinated, government-wide effort to improve the  efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of federal data  center activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB and the Federal CIO Established FDCCI", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the size of the federal data center inventory and the  potential to improve the efficiency, performance, and the environmental  footprint of federal data center activities, OMB, under the direction of the  Federal CIO, established FDCCI in February 2010.

In addition, agencies were required to submit an asset inventory  baseline and other documents that would result in a plan for consolidating  their data centers. The asset inventory baseline was to contain detailed  information on each data center and identify the consolidation approach  to be taken for each one. It would serve as the foundation for developing  the final data center consolidation plan. The data center consolidation  plan would serve as a technical road map and approach for achieving the  targets for infrastructure utilization, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency.", "In October 2010, OMB reported that all of the agencies had submitted an  inventory and plan. OMB also clarified the definition of a data center and  noted that, for the purposes of FDCCI, a data center is defined as any  room used for the purpose of processing or storing data that is larger than  500 square feet and meets stringent availability requirements. Under this  definition, OMB reported that agencies had identified 2,094 data centers  as of July 2010. \u201c\u2026a data center is\u2026a closet, room, floor, or building for the storage, management, and  dissemination of data and information and  computer systems and  associated components, such as database, application, and storage systems and data  stores [excluding facilities exclusively devoted to communications and network equipment  (e.g., telephone exchanges and telecommunications rooms)]. A data center generally  includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications  connections, environmental controls\u2026and special security devices housed in leased,  owned, collocated, or stand-alone facilities.\u201d", "Under the new definition, OMB estimated that there were a total of 3,133  federal data centers in December 2011, and its goal was to consolidate  approximately 40 percent, or 1,253 data centers, for a savings of  approximately $3 billion by the end of 2015. See figure 1 for an example  of an image of data center server racks at the Social Security  Administration\u2019s (SSA) National Support Center.", "In March 2012, OMB launched the PortfolioStat initiative, which requires  agencies to conduct an annual agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among  other things, reduce commodity IT spending and demonstrate how its IT  investments align with the agency\u2019s mission and business functions.  PortfolioStat is designed to assist agencies in assessing the current  maturity of their IT portfolio management process, make decisions on  eliminating duplication, and move to shared solutions in order to  maximize the return on IT investments across the portfolio.", "Subsequently, in March 2013, OMB issued a memorandum that  documented the integration of FDCCI with PortfolioStat and stated that  agencies should focus on an enterprise-wide approach to address  commodity IT (including data centers) in a comprehensive manner. The  memorandum also discussed consolidating previously collected IT-related  plans, reports, and data submissions. For example, agencies were no  longer required to submit the data center consolidation plans previously  required in 2012. However, OMB required agencies to update their data  center inventories and report on consolidation progress at the end of  every quarter.", "OMB\u2019s 2013 memorandum also increased the focus on optimizing the  performance of federal data centers. Specifically, OMB stated that, to  more effectively measure the efficiency of an agency\u2019s data center  assets, agencies would also be measured by the extent to which their  primary data centers were optimized for total cost of ownership by  incorporating metrics for data center energy, facility, labor, and storage,  among other things. Subsequently, in May 2014, OMB issued  memorandum M-14-08, which established a set of data center  optimization metrics to measure agency progress.

More specifically, we determined that  agencies had collectively reported 9,658 data centers in their  inventories\u2014an increase of about 6,500 compared to OMB\u2019s previous  estimate from December 2011. We noted that agencies had plans to  close about 3,700 data centers by September 2015.", "We also reported that 19 of the 24 FDCCI agencies had collectively  reported achieving an estimated $1.1 billion in cost savings for fiscal  years 2011 through 2013, and that, by 2017, that figure was estimated to  rise to about $5.3 billion. However, we pointed out that planned savings  may be higher because 6 agencies\u2014the Departments of Health and  Human Services (HHS), Interior (Interior), Justice (Justice), and Labor  (Labor), GSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA)\u2014that reported closing as many as 67 data centers had also  reported limited or no savings.", "In addition, our 2014 report noted that 11 of the 21 agencies with planned  cost savings had underreported their fiscal years 2012 through 2015  figures to OMB by approximately $2.2 billion.

Although  OMB\u2019s August 2016 memorandum required agencies to submit a DCOI  strategic plan by September 30, 2016, and to update it by April 14, 2017,  these plans were not required to include detailed information describing  how the agency was planning to meet OMB\u2019s requirement to implement  automated monitoring tools at all agency-owned tiered and non-tiered  centers.", "Recognizing this issue, OMB staff from the Office of the Federal CIO  stated that they have been advising agencies to include these more  detailed plans and milestones for implementing data center automated  monitoring tools as part of their publicly available FITARA implementation  milestones. However, OMB has not established a formal requirement in  its data center guidance or FITARA implementation guidance provided to  agencies. As mentioned previously, our analysis of agency\u2019s FITARA  implementation milestones showed that most agencies were not aware of  OMB\u2019s request to include this information.", "Until OMB requires agencies to include detailed plans to implement  automated monitoring tools in their FITARA implementation milestones,  agencies may continue to lack a roadmap to meet a key DCOI goal.  Further, until agencies complete their plans, they may be challenged in  implementing the tools needed to effectively measure server utilization\u2014a  data center optimization area highlighted in FITARA, and that we  previously reported as being critical to improving the efficiency,  performance, and environmental footprint of federal data center activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the August 2016 launch of DCOI, OMB took a considerable step  forward in providing guidance for the implementation of the data center  consolidation and optimization requirements of FITARA and increasing  the oversight of agencies\u2019 efforts to optimize their data centers. OMB\u2019s  fiscal year 2018 optimization targets provide clear and transparent goals  for agencies\u2019 optimization efforts; however, agencies reported limited  progress against those targets. Additionally, although agencies\u2019 DCOI  strategic plans provide a mechanism for agencies to report planned fiscal  years 2017 and 2018 milestones toward achieving OMB\u2019s optimization  targets, most agencies reported that they are not planning to meet OMB\u2019s  targets by the end of fiscal year 2018. Considering that OMB established  a DCOI-wide savings goal of $2.7 billion, the ability of agencies to meet  the optimization targets will be critical to achieving these savings.  Extending the time frame for the agencies to meet the required data  center consolidation and optimization provisions of FITARA beyond  October 2018 could provide agencies with additional time to achieve the  benefits of optimization. In addition, agencies\u2019 implementation of our prior  recommendations to address optimization challenges and improve  progress could help ensure that they are better positioned to meet key  DCOI goals.", "As a result of OMB\u2019s increased focus on data center optimization  beginning in 2013 and its more recent efforts to launch DCOI, agencies  have reported noteworthy successes in optimizing their data centers\u2014 particularly in leveraging virtualization and cloud computing as a means to  optimize their data centers. These constructive experiences indicate that  DCOI is moving in the right direction. However, as agencies work toward  achieving OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2018 optimization targets, many are reporting  challenges related to improving data center facility utilization, measuring  and reporting on server utilization progress, and obtaining the funding  within their agency for optimization efforts. Such a dynamic environment  reinforces the need for agencies to address their identified challenges\u2014 as we previously recommended\u2014in order to improve data center  optimization progress.", "OMB\u2019s efforts to establish a metric to measure server utilization as part of  its August 2016 memorandum were consistent with our 2014  recommendation and an important step toward ensuring that agency  computing resources are being used more efficiently. Additionally, OMB\u2019s  requirement that agencies implement automated monitoring tools at their  data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018 will help to ensure that they  have the necessary foundation in place to effectively measure and report  on server utilization progress. However, with agencies collectively  reporting that these tools are only installed at about 3 percent of the total  data centers and with 18 agencies lacking complete plans to implement  these tools at their remaining data centers, significant work remains  toward meeting OMB\u2019s requirement. The lack of a formal OMB  requirement to establish detailed plans in this area and report them to  OMB further increases the likelihood that agencies will continue to lack  them.", "In the absence of such a requirement and completed plans, agencies will  be missing an important roadmap for implementing the automated  monitoring tools needed to measure server utilization\u2014an area that both  we and OMB have reported as critical to improving the efficiency,  performance, and environmental footprint of federal data center activities.  Moreover, with automated monitoring tools not required by OMB to be  fully implemented by agencies until the end of fiscal year 2018, extending  the time frame of FITARA\u2019s data center consolidation and optimization  provisions could also better ensure that server utilization is effectively  measured and reported beyond fiscal year 2018, after the necessary  monitoring tools are implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["As most agencies lack plans to meet OMB\u2019s data center optimization  targets by the end of fiscal year 2018, it is increasingly likely that these  agencies will require additional time to achieve the data center  consolidation and optimization goals required by FITARA and OMB  guidance. In order to provide agencies with additional time to meet OMB\u2019s  data center optimization targets and achieve the related cost savings,  Congress should consider extending the time frame for the data center  consolidation and optimization provisions of FITARA beyond their current  expiration date of October 1, 2018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that agencies complete important DCOI planning  documentation and that the initiative improves governmental efficiency  and achieves intended cost savings, we are recommending that the  Director of OMB direct the Federal CIO to formally document a  requirement for agencies to include plans, as part of existing OMB  reporting mechanisms, to implement automated monitoring tools at their  agency-owned data centers.", "We are also recommending that the Secretaries of Agriculture,  Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Energy, HHS, Interior, Labor,  State, Transportation, Treasury, and VA; the Attorney General of the  United States; the Administrators of EPA, GSA, and SBA; the Director of  OPM; and the Chairman of NRC take action to, within existing OMB  reporting mechanisms, complete plans describing how the agency will  achieve OMB\u2019s requirement to implement automated monitoring tools at  all agency-owned data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received comments on a draft of this report from OMB and the 24  agencies that we reviewed.
