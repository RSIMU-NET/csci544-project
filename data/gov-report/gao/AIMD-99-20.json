Traditionally, the military services and Defense agencies have managed their civilian personnel service delivery organizations and systems through local civilian personnel offices located at or near military bases and installations all over the world. During the past 5 years, Defense has been attempting to reduce personnel management costs through the following actions. (1) Reducing the number of civilian personnelists. Personnelists provide face-to-face assistance to civilian employees, answering questions about such issues as life insurance, health insurance, and position classification. They process paperwork for new hires, promotions, awards, and a wide variety of personnel actions and assist in training, benefits administration, management/employee relations, recruitment, and staffing. In 1994, Defense reported that a single personnelist served about 67 employees. Defense\u2019s goal was to reduce the number of personnel staff to the point where one personnelist served 88 employees by the year 2001 and 100 employees by the year 2003. As of June 30, 1998, Defense reported that it had cut 1,700 personnelists and had achieved a ratio of 1 personnelist to 77 employees. (2) Improving personnel management processes. To help increase the personnelist-to-civilian employee ratio, Defense is attempting to improve and automate its personnel management business processes. For example, it has automated and improved processes for (1) developing, tracking, and monitoring all personnel actions, (2) handling injury compensation claims, and (3) estimating retirement eligibility and benefits. It has acquired an automated tool called RESUMIX, which helps personnelists analyze resumes of people applying for a position with Defense. It is also developing an interactive voice response system that enables employees to use a Touch-Tone phone to change selected data in their own personnel records. (3) Creating regional centers. Defense is creating regional centers that will specialize in selected personnel management functions and reducing the number and size of local offices. It anticipates that specialization of labor within the regions combined with improved business processes will reduce operating costs. As of September 30, 1998, the Army had established all 10 of its planned regions, the Navy had established 7 of 8 planned regions, the Air Force had established its 1 region, and the Defense agencies participating in this initiative had established all 3 of their planned regions. Table 1 further illustrates the changes in personnel management that will occur through Defense\u2019s improvement initiative."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A COTS Personnel Management System Is Acquired to Support Initiative", "paragraphs": ["At the beginning of this effort, Defense components operated a number of personnel management information systems that assisted in all aspects of personnel operations, such as developing position classification documents; preparing vacancy announcements; and processing appointments, reinstatements, transfers, promotions, retirements, and terminations. These systems were redundant and not interoperable, and Defense believed that they were antiquated.", "To modernize this environment, Defense eliminated the duplicative systems and used the Air Force civilian personnel management information system, located in San Antonio, Texas, to do all personnel processing. This legacy system meets Defense-unique personnel management requirements; is able to process Defense\u2019s large-scale workload successfully; and because it operates in one location, it can be maintained by CDA personnel with experience in operating and protecting systems. However, Defense believed that there were a number of significant shortfalls with this mainframe system and, therefore, the system should be replaced with a new COTS system. For example, according to Defense the legacy system relied on outdated technology for its database structure, file update, and retrieval; manpower resources and costs needed to develop and maintain the system were extensive; the system required duplicative data entry; the system could only be accessed by personnelists\u2014it could not be easily modified to provide access to civilian employees so that they could review and make prescribed changes to their own benefit, insurance, and other personnel-related data; modifications reflecting improvements in business processes were difficult to make; and the system was not Year 2000 compliant.", "As a result, Defense acquired a COTS product from Oracle Corporation. In contrast to the legacy system, which operated on two 1970s era mainframes, the new system will operate in a distributed, networked environment at regional and local offices. According to Defense, the system will enable any authorized civilian employee with a personal computer to directly access the system and to perform prescribed personnel-related operations or management tasks, can be easily modified to reflect improvements in business processes, will cost less to maintain and operate, and will be Year 2000 compliant.", "However, because the Oracle product was originally designed for use in the private sector, it did not satisfy all federal and Defense-unique requirements for personnel management. For example, it could not process federal personnel forms, such as the standard personnel action form (Form 52). It did not address the federal General Schedule for salaries, Defense\u2019s demonstration projects for pay banding, or the Defense-unique salary schedule for tens of thousands of foreign nationals who work for the Department overseas but do not get the same salaries or benefits as American employees. It did not have DOD-unique data for security and mobilization. In addition, it did not directly interface with Defense\u2019s existing payroll system. As a result, the product needed to be modified and/or enhanced before it was deployed.", "The Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS), which was established in 1993 to provide departmentwide leadership for the civilian personnel business area, is responsible for managing the new system. CPMS acquired the system using an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) DOD contract under which Oracle Corporation was a participating vendor. Defense components are responsible for purchasing and maintaining hardware to support the new system. CPMS has assigned the Air Force Central Design Activity (CDA) responsibility for managing technical modifications to the system under the contract. According to CPMS, the system is currently in the test phase. Once system qualification tests are completed, the system will be deployed to four tests sites during January and February 1999. The Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) will then evaluate the test results to ensure that the system meets user needs in an operational environment. Deployment to the remaining sites is expected to begin in late 1999 and end by March 2000. DOD officials stated that this schedule is likely to slip at least 2 months to ensure that the system is fully tested and meets user needs before it is fully deployed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs of DOD\u2019s Personnel Initiative", "paragraphs": ["The cost of Defense\u2019s personnel initiative is estimated to be $1.2 billion over its estimated 15-year life cycle (fiscal years 1995 through 2009), of which Defense reports that over $300 million has been spent through the end of fiscal year 1998. These totals are itemized in table 2."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Question: How Did Defense Determine the Number and Locations for Regional Centers and Why Is There a Wide Disparity?", "paragraphs": ["Answer: Defense considered only a narrow range of alternatives for improving personnel operations before deciding to regionalize personnel centers. This left the Department without assurance that it was pursuing the most cost-effective and beneficial approach. After it decided to regionalize, Defense did not follow a sound process for selecting regions, it did not require services and agencies to base their decisions on data-driven analyses. Consequently, the analyses of the services and agencies were inconsistent, each considering different factors in choosing regions and none included a formal cost/benefit analysis. This process resulted in the wide disparity in the number of regions chosen, and it left Defense without the objective data needed to determine whether any of the choices were optimal.", "Before embarking on a major, costly initiative to improve personnel management, sound practices call for examining a range of improvement options, including those that would radically change the current way of doing business. For example, in addition to, or instead of regionalizing, Defense could have considered (1) outsourcing its personnelist computer operations or all of its civilian personnel management services, (2) integrating its personnel/payroll management systems, (3) creating regions that cross-service between agencies and the military services, (4) consolidating local personnel offices that are near each other to provide face-to-face services to multiple bases or installations out of the same office, and/or (5) centralizing all, or portions of, civilian personnel management in DOD. By thoroughly considering these and other choices, Defense would have ensured that the most cost-effective and beneficial alternative was chosen before deciding to invest $367 million in the project and that any systems acquired or developed would support the most efficient and effective business processes.", "Defense did not examine all of these promising alternatives. Instead, it considered only the possibility of outsourcing computer operations with the National Finance Center. This option was determined to be infeasible.Defense did not analyze other alternatives, including cross-servicing, integrating payroll/personnel systems, collocating personnel offices, DOD-wide management of personnel operations, or outsourcing all of its personnel operations.", "In addition, once it decided on regionalization, Defense did not follow a sound process for selecting the regions. For example, Defense did not require the services and agencies to base their selections on data-driven analyses. In fact, the services were allowed to select whichever and as many regions as they wanted as long as they achieved at least a 1 to 88 personnelist-to-civilian employee ratio.", "Consequently, the services considered different factors in choosing their regions. However, none based their selections on a thorough cost/benefit analysis. This resulted in the wide disparity in the number of regions chosen, as the following examples illustrate.", "The Army and the Navy considered the distance between regions, proximity to the installations they serviced, and coverage across time zones as well as some costs associated with establishing and operating regions and transferring personnel. After considering these factors, the Army selected 10 regions and the Navy selected 8. It was decided that the regions would be responsible for about 60 percent of the work while local offices would be responsible for about 40 percent. Neither the Army or the Navy conducted cost/benefit analyses in making their decisions. Nor did they consider the costs of personnel work processes or the relationship between per capita servicing costs and region size.", "Because it had already demonstrated that it could reduce overhead and technology costs and facilitate standardization in service and business processes by collocating the civilian personnel center with its military center, the Air Force decided to use a single Air Force personnel center to serve all of its personnel. The Air Force decided that its local offices would continue to be responsible for about 53 percent of the work.", "While Defense allowed the services wide latitude in choosing their regions, it directed that its agencies be serviced by three regional offices. The two largest agencies\u2014the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Defense Logistics Agency\u2014were directed to establish their own regions and the Washington Headquarters Service was directed to serve as a regional personnel office for the smaller agencies. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service selected the location for its regional center based on the fact that it had already started to regionalize personnel operations there. The Defense Logistics Agency selected the location for its regional center after considering the location and space availability of its depots. However, neither conducted formal cost/benefit analyses in choosing their regions or considered the cost of personnel work processes and the relationship between per capita servicing costs and region size.", "CPMS officials cited several reasons for taking this approach. First, they pointed out that CPMS had no authority to require the services and agencies to base their decisions on thorough, data-driven analyses or, in fact, to require that they adopt any standard personnel system or approach at all. At the same time, they noted that the military services had a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and had the independent budget authority to see that the status quo was preserved. Second, Defense lacked basic cost and performance data for examining options, including data on the cost of personnel work processes and the relationship between per capita servicing costs and region size. Third, the agency was directed in 1994 to implement the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s (OSD) recommendations quickly, i.e., to reduce the number of personnelists to a ratio of one personnelist to every 88 civilian employees by fiscal year 1998. CPMS officials held that this did not allow time to develop objective data and rigorously examine alternatives. The 1 to 88 goal was later extended to the year 2001. Fourth, CPMS officials stated that because most of the costs for performing personnel functions are for personnelists, and systems, facilities, and operations constitute relatively smaller costs, as long as it achieved the 1 to 88 ratio, Defense would accrue significant cost savings regardless of the number of regions selected.", "Nevertheless, several of the alternatives Defense ignored offered the opportunity to achieve far greater savings while streamlining personnel operations, as the following examples illustrate.", "By consolidating some or all of its personnel management, Defense could reduce the numbers of staff that perform duplicative overhead functions. As of June 1998, there were 886 people performing civilian personnel management and oversight functions at component headquarters and major command levels at a cost of about $63 million annually.Furthermore, if Defense had centralized management of departmentwide personnel operations, it could take a departmentwide perspective in deciding which local offices and which regions should be consolidated.", "Cross-servicing could have enabled Defense to further consolidate regional offices and reduce duplicative overhead costs. Some Defense components have already found this alternative to be beneficial. The military services, for example, are doing some cross-servicing with employees in remote locations and the Washington Headquarters Service is servicing the smaller Defense agencies as well as some federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management. Additionally, having local personnel offices service multiple bases or installations could further reduce duplicative overhead costs. Integrating payroll and personnel systems could have helped Defense reduce system operation and maintenance costs as well as further streamline and improve personnel and payroll management business processes. In fact, after considering the potential benefits of this alternative and its feasibility, the Defense Science Board recommended it as a solution for military personnel in 1996.", "While it may have required more time and greater management commitment to change Defense practices, the potential for substantially greater savings and efficiencies should have compelled Defense to perform a rigorous analysis of all alternatives and to select the one proven most cost effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Question: In Developing, Managing, and Overseeing DCPDS, Is Defense Applying the Clinger-Cohen Act?", "paragraphs": ["Answer: Defense did not adequately apply the three requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 we reviewed which are designed to maximize the value of major investments. While the act was passed after Defense initiated its development of DCPDS, the act\u2019s requirements reflect basic and widely accepted principles of sound system acquisition management. Similar practices are also called for by Defense\u2019s own system acquisition regulations and guidelines, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and other legislative requirements effective at the time DCPDS decisions were made, including the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990.", "The Clinger-Cohen Act requires federal agencies to focus on the results achieved through information technology investments while streamlining the federal information technology (IT) procurement process. Specifically, this act introduces much more rigor and structure into how agencies approach the selection and management of IT projects. Although the act was passed after Defense decided to develop a new personnel management system, its principles are based on practices that are widely considered to be integral to successful IT investments.", "We examined whether Defense applied the following three requirements of Clinger-Cohen, which are designed to maximize the value of a major investment such as DCPDS. (1) Agency heads should analyze the missions of the agency and, based on the analysis, revise the agency\u2019s mission-related and administrative processes, as appropriate, before making significant investments in IT supporting those missions. (2) Investments should be selected based on objective data, including quantitatively expressed projected net, risk-adjusted return on investment, and specific quantitative and qualitative criteria for comparing and prioritizing alternative information system projects. (3) Agency heads should ensure, through the use of performance measurements, that mission-related benefits are defined and assessed for all IT investments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defense Did Not Reengineer Business Processes Before Investing in DCPDS", "paragraphs": ["Defense did not reengineer its personnel processes before investing in the new system. Before initiating development, CPMS and the individual services conducted an extensive effort to identify and document the preproject business processes at the local offices. Most of the improvements they made to these operations were minor. For example, they developed automated tools to help personnelists analyze resumes and to track civilian employee costs. However, for the most part, these initiatives did not involve radical or major changes to existing processes. As noted in the previous section, Defense considered only the option for outsourcing computer operations and failed to consider other alternatives that had the potential to provide significantly greater benefits, such as integrating personnel and payroll systems, centralizing personnel management, or cross-servicing. Because Defense did not examine these options, there is no evidence that the personnel management system acquired will support the most effective way of doing business or provide optimal return on investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs, Benefits, and Returns on Investments Not Adequately Analyzed", "paragraphs": ["Costs, benefits, and returns on investments were not adequately analyzed before Defense acquired the Oracle package.

The importance of developing complete and accurate analyses of the costs/benefits and returns of system alternatives is underscored by several governmentwide requirements in addition to the Clinger-Cohen Act. For example, OMB\u2019s Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, calls on agencies \u201cto conduct benefit-cost analyses to support ongoing management oversight processes that maximize return on investment and minimize financial and operating risks for investments in major information systems and on an agencywide basis.\u201d Likewise, Supplement to OMB\u2019s Circular A-11 (July 1997), Part 3, Capital Programming Guide Version 1.0, and OMB Bulletin No. 95-03, Planning and Budgeting for the Acquisition of Fixed Assets, state that \u201cthe planning for fixed asset acquisitions should be based on a systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs.\u201d Because Defense did not perform these analyses, it does not know if it chose the best system.", "Once an alternative is selected, Defense regulations require that an economic analysis be prepared to compare the selection against the status quo. This analysis establishes baseline life cycle costs, estimates benefits for the new system, and calculates expected return on investment. However, Defense did not perform an economic analysis before acquiring the new system. In addition, the analysis that Defense performed after the initiative was underway did not separate the costs and benefits of the system from costs and benefits associated with cutting personnel and regionalizing.

The military services and Defense agencies then developed several detailed measures within the categories, and CDA and CPMS developed several information technology or system-level measures to measure DCPDS\u2019 contribution to the mission area, including process cycle time and system response time.", "However, because military services have not agreed on two fundamental definitions, they will not be able to calculate these measures consistently and compare measures across services.

Second, they could not agree on a common definition of \u201cpaperwork errors.\u201d Because the military services are not using common definitions, some critical performance measures will not be comparable across DOD.

As other organizations do the same, DOD may be faced with managing multiple, incompatible encryption products and approaches.", "The military services and Defense agencies recognize that firewalls, which are hardware and software components that check all incoming network traffic and block unauthorized traffic, are also essential to protecting sensitive data and have begun installing them. However, DISA has not established standards to ensure a consistent level of protection and to ensure that computer systems protected by firewalls can still communicate with each other.", "During our review, we identified several sites that were not maintaining adequate physical security over computer resources, indicating a lack of security awareness at the local level. For example, at two of the four local personnel offices we visited, the door to the computer room was unlocked. At one of these offices, one of the computer room\u2019s walls consisted of a row of standard metal filing cabinets, offering little obstruction to the room even if the door had been locked. At a third local office, the computer room was collocated with the office\u2019s paper shredder, to which the personnel office staff were given unsupervised access. Also, the network communications room at one of the local offices was unlocked and personnel office staff were given unsupervised access to the room. Additionally, at one of the four regional offices we visited, the network communications room door was unlocked and tied open. Further, our review identified fire protection deficiencies at four offices\u2014three local offices and one regional office. Specifically, the four offices did not have automatic fire detection equipment in or near the computer room.", "Our review identified problems with disaster recovery procedures and planning for the regional and local offices. For example, we observed inadequate data backup and recovery procedures at one of the four regions visited. In this regard, the draft DCPDS Trusted Facilities Manual, dated February 2, 1998, noted that Defense had not resolved basic disaster recovery planning issues for DCPDS such as, \u201cwhat data to backup, how often that data will require backup, the method of backup, and testing to ensure the backup has been accomplished successfully.\u201d Additionally, the military services had not completed service-level or site-specific disaster recovery plans for their regional and local personnel offices. As of July 1998, CDA had drafted guidelines for the services and agencies to use in developing disaster recovery plans, but it did not have complete data on the number of regional and local offices that had finalized and tested site-level disaster recovery plans. After discussions on this issue, CDA began requiring all sites to provide these plans before becoming operational. However, neither CPMS nor CDA have determined how the plans will be tested or whether CDA will periodically verify that the disaster recovery plans are updated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Year 2000 Risks Not Fully Mitigated", "paragraphs": ["The Year 2000 computing problem is rooted in the way dates are recorded and computed in automated information systems.

With this two-digit format, however, the Year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900, or 2001 from 1901, etc. As we reported earlier this year, the impact of computer failures resulting from the problem could be widespread, costly, and potentially disruptive to military operations. Year 2000 problems could adversely affect Defense\u2019s ability to train civilian personnel, administer benefits, recruit staff, and handle management/employee disputes. However, Defense has not fully mitigated this risk.", "We compared Defense\u2019s efforts to correct the Year 2000 problem to criteria detailed in our Year 2000 Assessment Guide.

Until these agreements are in place, Defense will not have assurance that partners are working to correct interfaces effectively or promptly.", "In addition, Defense has not developed adequate business continuity and contingency plans for the legacy system. To mitigate the risk that Year 2000-related problems will disrupt operations, our guide, entitled Year 2000 Business Continuity and Contingency Planning, recommends that agencies perform risk assessments and develop and test realistic contingency plans to ensure the continuity of critical operations and business processes. Business continuity and contingency plans are important because they identify the manual or other fallback procedures to be employed should systems miss their Year 2000 deadline or fail unexpectedly in operation. Business continuity and contingency plans also define the specific conditions that will cause their activation.", "In order for these plans to be effective, our guide recommends that, among other things, agencies analyze business process composition and priorities, dependencies, cycles, and service levels, and most important, the business process dependency on mission-critical information systems. The results of this analysis should be used to assess the cost and benefits of contingency alternatives and to identify and document contingency plans and implementation modes. These plans should define roles and responsibilities for contingency operations and provide a master schedule and milestones.", "Defense recently developed a contingency plan for the legacy system, but this plan is perfunctory and does not meet the minimum criteria defined in our Business Continuity and Contingency Planning guidance which OMB has adopted as a standard for federal agencies. Specifically, the plan only states that if the legacy system fails, critical personnel actions will be prepared using one of three other commercial software packages. The plan does not provide a description of the resources, staff roles, procedures, and timetables needed for its implementation. And there is no evidence that Defense (1) assessed and documented risks posed by external systems and the public infrastructure, (2) defined the minimum acceptable level of outputs and services for each core business process, or (3) assessed the costs and benefits of contingency strategy alternatives.", "The steps detailed in our guide are integral to helping agencies to manage the risk of potential Year 2000-induced disruptions to their operations. For example, the civilian personnel business area depends on information and data provided by other Defense and federal agencies whose systems can introduce Year 2000 problems into DCPDS. It also relies on services provided by the public infrastructure, which are susceptible to Year 2000 problems that could disrupt personnel operations\u2014including power, water, and voice and data telecommunications.

While it may have required more time to develop needed data and greater management commitment to changing Defense business practices, the potential for substantially greater savings and efficiencies should have persuaded Defense to perform a rigorous analysis of all alternatives and to select the one proven most cost effective.", "Additionally, because Defense did not adequately estimate and evaluate costs, benefits, and returns, there is not adequate assurance that its decision to replace the legacy system with the Oracle COTS package is optimal. Furthermore, Defense does not know whether modifications to the Oracle product will satisfy its needs, how it will maintain the system, how it will protect sensitive data in the system, or how it will ensure the continuity of core civilian personnel operations in the event of Year 2000 failures. Despite this uncertainty, Defense reports having already spent about $300 million on developing the system and establishing the regional offices and plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more to operate and support DCPDS and the regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Before Defense starts to deploy the new system beyond test sites, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense rigorously evaluate all business and system alternatives to providing personnel services as envisioned by the Clinger-Cohen Act, and, using this data and the system test results, select the most cost beneficial business and system alternative and develop and implement a transition plan for that alternative.", "Specifically, business alternatives considered should include (1) use of regions and local offices to serve specific agencies or services, (2) use of regions or local offices to serve multiple agencies and services, (3) centralizing all or parts of personnel management operations that currently operate at component headquarters and major commands, (4) integrating DOD\u2019s civilian personnel and payroll management systems, (5) outsourcing civilian personnel computer operations, (6) outsourcing all civilian personnel management services, and (7) acquiring other commercially available products. In analyzing commercially available products, we recommend that Defense consider the costs, benefits, and returns-on-investment of all commercially available products that support personnel management. We also recommend that the analysis of commercially available products consider technical risks, including whether each available product can support Defense\u2019s needs and whether each one can be modified in the future at a reasonable cost. In evaluating the range of business alternatives consideration should be given to the substantial investment that has already been made in the current approach.", "Regardless of the business and system alternative selected, we recommend that Defense optimize it by collecting, analyzing and using reliable cost and performance data and making improvements. We also recommend that, regardless of the chosen approach, Defense take the following actions to mitigate technical, security, and Year 2000 risks.", "To ensure that the system is adequately maintained and that modifications are carefully controlled, Defense should (1) develop agreements with system partners and interface partners to define responsibility for system operations, maintenance, and security, (2) establish a configuration control board comprised of system users to assist in deciding on which changes need to be made to the system, prioritizing change requests, and ensuring that changes are correctly made, (3) assign clear responsibility for providing technical assistance to Defense components.", "To ensure that sensitive personnel data are adequately protected, Defense should (1) assess its risks and determine security needs, (2) define and implement appropriate policies and related controls, including standards for encrypting data and firewalls, (3) promote security awareness at all sites maintaining the system, and (4) continually monitor and evaluate policy and control effectiveness.", "To mitigate Year 2000 risks, Defense should (1) establish interface agreements that clearly specify date format changes, time frames for these changes, and processes for resolving conflicts, (2) refine business continuity and contingency plans to ensure that they consider risks posed by external systems and infrastructure; assess the costs and benefits of alternative contingency strategies; and describe resources, staff roles, procedures, and timetables needed for implementation of the plan, and (3) test contingency plans to ensure that they are capable of providing the desired level of support to the agency\u2019s core business processes and can be implemented within a specified period of time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Acting Assistant Secretary for Force Management Policy provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in appendix I.

We used the Clinger-Cohen Act to evaluate Defense\u2019s decisions because the act\u2019s requirements reflect basic and widely accepted principles of sound system acquisition management. Similar practices are also called for in OMB Circulars A-11 and A-130, the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\u2014all of which were applicable in some manner to Defense\u2019s decisions in this effort.

Although the Clinger-Cohen Act was not in existence when DOD made the initial decisions in developing the modern DCPDS, it has been in effect since 1996 and should have been applied to all decisions made subsequent to its enactment. Further, OMB Circulars A-11 and A-130 existed prior to the initial decisions related to DCPDS and included basic principles of sound system acquisition management. In addition, several acts that were in effect when the initial decisions were made contain requirements similar to those outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act relating to improved information technology management in the federal government. For example (1) the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires federal agencies to set strategic goals, measure performance, and report on accomplishments, (2) the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA), Title V, requires agencies to define cost, schedule, and performance goals for federal acquisition programs (including information technology projects) and to monitor these projects to ensure that they remain within prescribed tolerances, (3) the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) emphasizes achieving program benefits and meeting agency goals through the effective use of information technology, and (4) the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 focuses on the need to improve financial management and reporting practices of the federal government, which is critical for knowing an information technology project\u2019s actual costs and for computing accurate returns on investment. Finally, Defense\u2019s own system acquisition regulations and guidelines, in existence at the time Defense made the initial decisions in developing the modern DCPDS, include requirements similar to those outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act related to basic principles of sound system acquisition management. 2. Before embarking on an improvement approach for its civilian personnel mission area, Defense performed cost and performance analyses which indicated the Department\u2019s civilian personnel servicing ratios could be improved significantly. However, because these analyses did not fully consider the costs and benefits of numerous alternative business and systems approaches for improving the servicing ratios, the Department may not have selected the most cost-effective improvement approach. 3. We revised the report to delete specific information on the scoring criteria used in the DCPDS procurement. 4. While Defense reports that it has already consolidated some civilian personnel functions at component headquarters and major commands and reduced staff by 23 percent, in June of 1998, there were still 886 people performing civilian personnel management and oversight functions at component headquarters and major command levels at a cost of about $63 million a year. Given that the Civilian Personnel Management Service performs the same management and oversight functions as component headquarters and major commands, there are substantial opportunities for further consolidation and staff reduction. 5. The A-76 study includes some but not all promising alternatives. While it will evaluate outsourcing civilian pay operations, it will not consider outsourcing personnel operations or integrating personnel and payroll systems. Furthermore, while Defense considered the possibility of outsourcing personnel computer operations in 1994, it lacked the cost and performance data necessary to sufficiently analyze this approach. 6. While it is important for Defense components to develop comprehensive metrics to measure the timeliness and value of regional service center work, they must also standardize these metrics so that meaningful comparisons can be made across the Department. The components must also collect baseline data that define the current operations so that Defense can determine whether new systems and business strategies are achieving predicted cost and performance improvements. 7. If implemented effectively, the site-by-site risk assessments and other actions Defense is taking should help address the security concerns identified in this report. However, to maximize protection over DCPDS data, Defense still needs to establish departmentwide standards on encryption and firewalls. 8. Although CPMS has interface agreements with the owners of major external interfaces for the legacy DCPDS system, those agreements have not been adequately updated to include Year 2000 issues. Specifically, the agreements do not define agreed upon date formats, nor describe how problems with data exchanges will be resolved. Further, as of the completion of our review, CPMS had not identified the system interfaces or developed agreements with its interface partners for the modern DCPDS. 9. Defense plans to complete interface agreements by April 1999 and contingency plans by May 1999 and to begin testing contingency plans by June 1999. However, the Office of Management and Budget and GAO\u2019s Year 2000 guidance recommend that agencies develop interface agreements and realistic contingency plans during the assessment phase, i.e., by August 1997, in order to minimize the risk of Year 2000 problems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To analyze how Defense determined the number and locations for civilian personnel regional service centers and why there is a wide disparity in the number of regional centers among the services, we interviewed Office of the Secretary of Defense, military service, and Defense agency officials and reviewed guidance mandating regionalization, the services\u2019 and Defense agencies\u2019 regionalization studies, and their rationale for determining the number and location of regions.
