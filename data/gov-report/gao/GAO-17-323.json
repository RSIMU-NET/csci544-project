In particular, the Navy plans to request authority from Congress in 2017 to pursue what the Navy calls a block buy of 12 planned frigates and funding for the lead ship, which the Navy intends to award in 2018. Approval of these plans would effectively represent the final decision for the entire planned buy of 40 LCS and frigates. According to the Navy's approved acquisition strategy, the frigates would still require annual appropriations, so Congress would maintain its oversight through its annual appropriation decisions; however, any decision to reduce or delay the program, should that become warranted, could nevertheless be more difficult as the Navy may point to losses in favorable block buy prices, as has been done previously with LCS.", "The Navy's impending request presents a key opportunity for Congress to affect the way forward for the frigate program by ensuring the Navy possesses sufficient knowledge on cost, design, and capability before authorizing an investment of a potential $9 billion for a program that", "\u2022 has no current formal cost estimate\u2014independent or otherwise,", "\u2022 will not begin key detail design activities until late fiscal year 2018,", "\u2022 has significant unknowns in regards to operational performance of the ship upon which its design will be based, and", "\u2022 based on the existing and planned shipyard workloads, has no industrial base imperative to begin construction in the Navy's planned time frame.", "The Navy's previous frigate acquisition plans included achieving a higher degree of ship design knowledge before awarding the lead ship in fiscal year 2019, as the plans included significant detail design activities prior to contract award. As GAO has previously found, such an approach\u2014which has been supported by shipbuilders\u2014offers greater confidence in the understanding of design changes and how they will affect ship construction costs. Further, as GAO's work on best practices for program cost estimates suggests, the Navy's prior plans for frigate design efforts and an award in fiscal year 2019 would have provided more information on which to base a decision, including a better understanding of risks and costs. The previous plans also better aligned with LCS test plans to improve the department's understanding of the operational capability and limitations for each ship variant. This knowledge could then be used to inform the Navy's decision on which LCS-based design for the frigate it will pursue. In addition to the valuable knowledge to be gained by not pursuing the frigate in the planned 2018 time frame, the existing and planned LCS construction workload for both shipyards is another important factor to consider. Specifically, each shipyard has LCS construction demands that extend into 2021, suggesting no imperative for the Navy to award the frigate in 2018.

To execute the  program, the Navy deviated from traditional shipbuilding acquisition in  hopes of rapidly delivering ships to the fleet. The consequences of this  approach are well known today\u2014costs to construct the ships have more  than doubled from initial expectations, with promised levels of capability  unfulfilled and deliveries significantly delayed. Since 2014, two  Secretaries of Defense have stepped in to address concerns with the  combat capability of LCS. First, Secretary Chuck Hagel questioned the  appropriate capability and quantity of the LCS in February 2014 and  directed the Navy to re-evaluate its small surface combatant capability  needs. Acknowledging capability and affordability concerns, the Navy\u2014 with the Secretary of Defense\u2019s approval\u2014then changed course in late  2014 to pursue an LCS with minor modifications, now called a frigate.

The Navy planned to experiment with these ships to determine  its preferred design variant. This experimentation strategy was  subsequently abandoned. The Navy determined that, based on cost  considerations, it would be impractical to have the two competing  shipyards build only one or two ships and then wait for the Navy to  complete the period of experimentation before awarding additional  contracts. Instead, the Navy opted to continue funding additional  seaframes without having completed the planned period of discovery and  learning. The Navy has made several other revisions to the LCS  acquisition strategy over time, some in response to direction from the  Office of the Secretary of Defense. These have included changes over  time regarding whether the Navy would downselect to one seaframe  design. Although it might be expected that a new acquisition concept  would require some adjustments over time, the LCS program has evolved  significantly since it began, as shown in figure 1.", "As figure 1 indicates, the Navy now plans to buy LCS with minor  modifications, which it refers to as frigates.

The Navy has  noted that the selected design provides some improvements, such as  multi-mission and over-the-horizon missile capabilities, at a relatively  lower cost than other options by leveraging the existing LCS shipyards  and vendors.

When presented with this  conclusion, senior Navy leadership directed the task force to explore what  capabilities might be more feasible on a minor modified LCS. In response  to this direction, the task force created two additional LCS options with  minor modifications. These options provided a multi-mission capability  instead of the single-mission capability of LCS and retained the modular  mission package characteristic of the LCS program (i.e., ability to more  readily swap mission systems in and out). In developing these  alternatives, the task force also found that it was feasible to permanently  install an over-the-horizon missile to offer longer range surface warfare  capability, plus a lightweight towed torpedo countermeasure and multi- function towed array sonar to offer some anti-submarine warfare  capability. However, these improvements would still need to be  augmented by an LCS surface warfare or anti-submarine warfare mission  package to provide the full suite of LCS capability.

Further, the Navy sacrificed capabilities that were prioritized by  fleet operators. For example, when asked in engagement sessions by the  Small Surface Combatant Task Force, fleet operators consistently  prioritized a range of 4,000 nautical miles, but the selected LCS concept  with minor modifications was noted to have a minimum range requirement  of 3,000 nautical miles.

Additionally, the  Navy plans to make some similar capability improvements to existing and  future LCS, narrowing the difference between LCS and the frigate.

Though specific details are  classified, there are only a few areas where there are differences in  frigate warfighting capability compared to the LCS.", "Since the frigate will be based on an LCS design, it will likely carry  forward some LCS design limitations. For example, LCS is configured to  support up to 98 personnel, including core and mission package crew and  an aviation detachment. Navy officials have stated that the frigate is being  designed for a crew of 130. However, given the space limitations on LCS  and the fact that the frigate will be based on one of the two LCS designs,  achieving this significant increase in crew size could prove challenging.

This  improved understanding of the frigate design was then going to be  available to support the Navy\u2019s construction contracts to both shipyards  for frigates in fiscal year 2019. However, as we noted above, the Navy  changed course in response to direction from the Secretary of Defense  and currently plans for a downselect award in 2018.

Specifically, the  two shipbuilders for the Navy\u2019s newest configuration of the Arleigh Burke  class destroyers\u2014DDG 51 Flight III\u2014agreed that allowing more time for  the design to mature, via detail design, would provide greater confidence  in their understanding of the Flight III-specific design changes and how  the changes will affect ship construction costs.

For example, the  Navy negotiated target prices for construction of the lead San Antonio  class ship (LPD 17) and the first two follow-on ships (LPD 18 and LPD  19) before detail design even began, preventing the Navy from leveraging  information that would be gained during detail design when negotiating  target prices for these three ships.

According to the Navy\u2019s approved acquisition strategy, the  frigates would still require annual appropriations and Congress could thus  conduct oversight of the program through that process; however, it will  likely be more difficult to make decisions to reduce or delay the program  should that become warranted, as the Navy may point to losses in  favorable block buy prices, as has been done previously with LCS.", "We recognize that the Navy had to revise its frigate acquisition plans  based on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction to reduce quantities and  select a single ship design. However, the direction did not necessitate an  acceleration of the frigate procurement and the corresponding shift away  from a planned approach that would have provided substantially improved  cost, design, and capability information to inform the frigate acquisition  decisions. Reverting back to a frigate award in fiscal year 2019 would  provide time to complete realistic cost estimates, build detail design  knowledge, and make significant progress in understanding the  operational capability and limitations of LCS, upon which the frigate  design will be based."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To ensure sound frigate procurement decisions, Congress should  consider not enacting authority pursuant to the Navy\u2019s request for a block  buy of 12 frigates in the fiscal year 2018 budget and consider delaying  funding of the lead frigate until at least fiscal year 2019 when sufficient  cost, design, and capability knowledge is expected to be available to  inform decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the department and the shipbuilders have sufficient knowledge  of the frigate\u2019s anticipated cost and design during the procurement  process, the Secretary of Defense should direct the Secretary of the Navy  to delay frigate procurement plans and the award of the lead frigate  contract until at least fiscal year 2019 when cost estimates will be  completed, detail design could be underway, and significant progress will  have been made in demonstrating through testing the operational  capabilities of LCS that are relevant to the frigate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. Its  written comments are reprinted in appendix I of this report. DOD partially  concurred with our recommendation to delay procurement plans and the  award of the lead frigate contract until sufficient cost, design, and  capability knowledge is available to inform decisions.", "In its response, DOD acknowledged that the Navy\u2019s final contract  decision includes risks, but stated that it believes the current plan offers  an acceptable tradeoff between technical and affordability risks. DOD  highlighted two actions that it believes will allow the department to assess  program risk before moving forward: (1) annual frigate program review  activities in 2017 intended to ensure risks are understood prior to the  release of the formal frigate request for proposals, and (2) the planned  completion of an independent cost estimate in fiscal year 2018 by the  Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, which is expected to  inform a 2018 annual program review prior to a contract award.", "While these are positive oversight actions, the assessments of design risk  and maturity for these reviews will lack any frigate-specific detail design  information, which leads us to maintain that waiting until at least fiscal  year 2019 to procure the first ship and to make decisions on future frigate  procurements would provide DOD and Congressional decision-makers  with a more comprehensive understanding of frigate cost, design, and  capability expectations before making substantial commitments to the  program. This lack of knowledge, coupled with the ongoing and planned  LCS construction workload at both shipyards, present, in our view, a  compelling rationale for delaying a frigate decision.", "DOD also separately provided technical comments on our draft report.  We incorporated the comments as appropriate, such as to provide  additional context in the report. In doing so, we found that the findings  and message of our report remained the same. In some cases, the  department\u2019s suggestions or deletions were not supported by the  preponderance of evidence or were based on a difference of opinion,  rather than fact. In those instances, we did not make the suggested  changes.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, and  other interested parties.
