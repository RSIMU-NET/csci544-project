CMS is responsible for enforcing the use of ICD codes and is requiring providers to begin using the 10th revision of the codes (ICD-10) on October 1, 2015. Its role in preparing for the transition includes making changes to the agency's information technology systems used to process Medicare fee-for-service claims and supporting stakeholders' efforts to implement changes to the systems they use to submit Medicare claims that are to include ICD-10 data. GAO was asked to study the actions planned and taken by CMS to support entities' transition to ICD-10. This report discusses (1) CMS's efforts to implement system changes needed for the agency to process claims that include ICD-10 codes, (2) the extent to which CMS's testing and verification actions are sufficient to ensure the system changes are made, and (3) steps CMS is taking to ensure that stakeholders have access to technical support needed to make system changes. To do this, GAO reviewed project documentation and held discussions with Medicare officials, contractors, and selected stakeholder groups that represent providers, health care clearinghouses, and insurers that share claims data with CMS. GAO provided a draft of this report to HHS and incorporated its comments as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has finished updating its systems with the changes it determined were needed to process the new International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-10) on Medicare fee-for-service claims. In 2007, CMS began taking steps to identify components of its systems that needed to be changed to update the ICD codes from version 9 to 10. CMS began making the system changes in early 2010 as part of an established change management process for releasing system updates on a quarterly basis, and, by October 2013, had completed actions to modify its systems to process the new data. In doing so, CMS made changes to validate that codes on submitted claims were of the correct length and format specific to ICD-10 requirements and to determine whether submitted claims data included the proper codes to be processed and approved for payment.", "Industry guidance states that systems testing should be conducted early and often in the life cycle of a project to allow for the modification of software in a timely manner, and that organizations should define procedures for approving systems for release and plan for contingencies to help mitigate risks that may be introduced when software changes are implemented into a live production environment. Consistent with these practices, CMS began testing and validating the changes made to its systems in March 2010. For each quarterly release, CMS conducted three levels of testing prior to implementing the systems that had been changed, including a level conducted to simulate a live production environment of Medicare claims processing. Agency reports on the outcomes of the tests described errors found and steps taken to ensure any such errors were corrected. The agency also held management reviews to determine whether each version of the modified systems was ready to be released into a live claims processing environment. In addition, CMS officials defined contingencies for cases when systems may not properly process claims that include ICD-10 codes. Such actions are important to help minimize the impact on Medicare stakeholders that could result from errors in CMS's systems. While CMS's actions to update, test, and validate its systems, and plan for contingencies can help mitigate risks and minimize impacts of system errors, the extent to which any such errors will affect the agency's ability to properly process claims cannot be determined until CMS's systems begin processing ICD-10 codes.", "CMS provided technical support to help its stakeholders identify and make system changes. As early as 2008, CMS had developed and published a website that includes information related to the implementation of system changes to process and submit ICD-10 codes, such as checklists and \u201clessons learned\u201d identified through collaboration with stakeholders, to help stakeholders identify and implement system changes. The agency also developed tools to help its Medicare Administrative Contractors update claims review and submission systems, such as those used to ensure valid claims are transmitted to CMS's claims processing systems. In addition, CMS expanded and enhanced capabilities to accommodate end-to-end testing that allowed stakeholders to test the integration of their systems with CMS's internal systems, and offered alternative technical solutions for submitting claims with ICD-10 data in case their systems are not modified in time to meet the compliance date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, every claim submitted by a health care provider to a  health care payer for reimbursement includes International Classification  of Diseases (ICD) codes.

Toward this end, we issued the results of a study in January 2015 that  examined the agency\u2019s efforts to help entities affected by changes to the  codes better prepare for the upcoming transition, and described  stakeholders\u2019 concerns and recommendations regarding CMS\u2019s  activities.", "Further, in response to your request, we conducted this second study.  This report addresses:  the status of CMS\u2019s effort to implement changes needed to be made  to its systems to process Medicare claims that include ICD-10 codes;  the extent to which CMS\u2019s testing and verification actions are  sufficient to ensure changes to its systems have been made to  process Medicare claims that include ICD-10 codes by October 1,  2015;  steps CMS is taking to ensure that health care insurers, providers,  and other entities have access to the technical support, tools, and  other resources needed to identify, develop, and test system  modifications, and to process Medicare claims that include ICD-10  codes if needed system changes have not been made; and what is known about estimated costs to CMS, insurers, and providers.", "In conducting this study, we focused on CMS\u2019s activities to develop and  test changes that needed to be made to its internal Medicare fee-for- service claims processing systems in order to process ICD-10 codes. We  also included within our scope of work the stakeholders that use systems  to process, store, and transmit claims for payment of Medicare services,  such as providers, insurers, and health care clearinghouses.", "To address the first objective, we collected and analyzed documentation  from CMS, such as project schedules, that described the agency\u2019s plans  and milestones to identify and implement the necessary system changes  for the ICD-10 transition. In addition, we assessed artifacts, such as  release notes and documents that provided evidence of management  reviews, to determine whether the changes had been implemented.", "To address the second objective, we identified criteria for assessing the  sufficiency of systems testing and verification practices based on  established industry standards for conducting software and systems  testing. We analyzed information from CMS\u2019s contractors and agency  officials that described plans and activities conducted to test system  changes made to support the transition to ICD-10. We compared CMS\u2019s  management and oversight of the contractors\u2019 testing activities to industry  standards to determine the extent to which steps were taken to validate  the agency\u2019s claims processing systems\u2019 readiness to process claims that  include ICD-10 codes.

We  focused our study of CMS\u2019s test and validation activities on the final  phase\u2014the user acceptance testing\u2014that was conducted prior to the  initial ICD-10 compliance date. In doing so, we assessed detailed data  reported by CMS from April 2013 through October 2013 on the plans and  outcomes of the tests, including descriptions of the errors found and steps  taken by CMS\u2019s development and testing contractors to ensure any such  errors were corrected. To determine the reliability of these data, we  reviewed related evidence, such as documents of system change  requests and software release approvals. We also interviewed agency  officials responsible for overseeing contractors\u2019 testing activities. We  determined that the data we collected were reliable for the purposes of  this report to understand the extent to which CMS\u2019s efforts to validate  errors associated with ICD-10 system changes were addressed and the  software changes approved for release into production.", "To address the third objective, we identified stakeholders\u2019 need for  technical support from CMS based on our prior report on the ICD-10  transition and through discussions with eight professional associations  that represent Medicare stakeholders. We obtained information from CMS  and through documentation research that identified the technical  resources the agency provided to help these stakeholders ensure that the  changes needed to process ICD-10 codes had been made to their  systems. Specifically, we analyzed documents, such as guidance  delivered via CMS\u2019s website and stakeholder testing instructions that  described the technical support the agency provided (e.g., access to test  facilities, call center support, and claims processing software). We also  interviewed five of the stakeholder groups that play a role in supporting  the implementation of health information technology to obtain their views  on the usefulness of the support and resources provided by CMS in  helping them implement system changes and mitigate issues that may  arise if their systems are not ready to process ICD-10 codes.", "Further, we collected from CMS and health care professional associations  any data that reflected any knowledge of estimated costs that have been  incurred by the agency and its stakeholders for the development, testing,  and implementation of necessary system changes made to Medicare  claims submission and processing systems needed to be made to  support the ICD-10 transition. This included additional costs incurred as a  result of delaying the transition until October 1, 2015. We assessed the  reliability of the cost data we collected by holding discussions with CMS  officials and reviewing related agency documentation that described  CMS\u2019s financial statement reporting practices and outcomes of  independent audits of the statements. We determined that the cost data  we collected were reliable for the purpose of our report to identify any  costs known to have been incurred by CMS and its Medicare  stakeholders for implementing system changes needed to process ICD- 10 codes.", "For all four objectives, we supplemented the information we obtained  from our analysis of CMS and stakeholder data by obtaining information  and views from CMS officials in the agency\u2019s Office of Technology  Solutions and Office of Enterprise Information and from the various  Center for Medicare groups. We also held discussions with five  stakeholder groups that we selected based on their roles in supporting  and advocating the use of information technology for health care  purposes and that represent stakeholders who needed to implement  system changes to prepare for the ICD-10 transition. These groups are  the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA),  Cooperative Exchange, Health Administrative Technology Association  (HATA), Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society  (HIMSS), and Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI). In  addition, we held discussions with representatives from three entities that  we selected based on their roles in representing the providers and payers  of health care services impacted by the transition to ICD-10. These  included the America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), American Medical  Association (AMA), and Medical Group Management Association  (MGMA).

It was expanded and adopted in 2000 under HIPAA  as the standard code set for use in all electronic transactions by covered  entities. Specifically, ICD-9 codes are currently used in all U.S. health  care settings to document diagnoses and are also used in all U.S.  inpatient hospital settings to document procedures.", "ICD codes are used in a variety of ways by Medicare. For example,  Medicare uses the codes to help determine hospital inpatient payment  rates based on the Medicare-Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups system,  which classifies inpatient stays according to both patients\u2019 diagnoses and  the procedures a patient receives. Further, CMS uses the diagnosis  codes to determine whether the care provided by physicians is medically  necessary and, therefore, eligible for reimbursement.", "The transition to ICD-10 is intended to increase the number of codes and,  thus, improve providers\u2019 ability to designate the level of specificity when  documenting diagnoses and procedures. Specifically, ICD-9 codes are  made up of three to five alphanumeric values, while ICD-10 codes are  made up of three to seven values, allowing for more codes and increased  specificity. While there are approximately 15,000 ICD-9 diagnosis codes,  there are approximately 70,000 ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Likewise, there  are approximately 4,000 ICD-9 procedure codes, while there are  approximately 72,000 ICD-10 procedure codes.", "The additional codes were defined by the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention and CMS to enable providers and payers to capture  greater specificity and clinical information in medical claims. For  example, using ICD-10 codes, a provider will be able to identify a body  part and the side of the body subject to an evaluation or procedure;  however, the ICD-9 codes do not allow this level of differentiation  between the left and right sides of the body. As another example, there is  only one ICD-9 code that a provider would enter on a claim for  angioplasty (a procedure to restore blood flow through an artery), but  there are 854 ICD-10 codes for angioplasty, with these codes including  additional details on the affected body parts and the approaches and  devices used for the procedure. (Within these 854 codes there will be  higher-level generic codes available for entry if a lower level of detail is  not needed. Therefore, a provider may not need to know or use all the  854 codes for angioplasty.)", "Another difference between the ninth and tenth versions of the codes is  the terminology and disease classifications, which are to be updated so  that they are consistent with new technology and current clinical practice.  For example, under ICD-9, when filing Medicare claims, providers use a  single code to reflect tobacco use or dependence, while, under ICD-10,  they will be able to use a code that indicates a category for nicotine  dependence with subcategories to identify the specific tobacco product  and nicotine-induced disorder. In this example, the updated disease  classifications for nicotine disorders reflect the increased knowledge of  the effects of nicotine. Other differences between the code sets include  the addition of new concepts that do not exist in ICD-9 diagnosis codes,  such as the expansion of postoperative codes to distinguish between  intraoperative and post-procedural complications, and the designation of  trimester for pregnancy codes.", "HHS issued a final rule on January 16, 2009, that mandated the use of  ICD-10 codes by all HIPAA-covered entities by October 1, 2013; hence,  the transition from version 9 to version 10 of the codes was initially to take  effect approximately 2 years ago. However, on September 5, 2012, the  department issued a final rule that delayed the effective date until October  1, 2014. The Secretary of HHS made this decision because, among other  reasons, results of industry surveys and polls had indicated that HIPAA- covered entities throughout the country were not prepared to successfully  complete the transition. Subsequently, the Protecting Access to Medicare  Act of 2014, enacted April 1, 2014, mandated an additional delay by  prohibiting HHS from requiring the use of ICD-10 codes sooner than  October 1, 2015.", "On August 4, 2014, the department issued a final rule that established  October 1, 2015, as the new compliance date. Accordingly, on October 1,  2015, all health care transactions that include ICD codes must begin  using the tenth version of the codes for services that occur on or after that  date.

For  example, health care providers use systems within their practices to  complete claims for payment of services delivered to their patients,  including beneficiaries of the Medicare fee-for-service program. Once the  data for a patient visit have been entered into a provider\u2019s system, the  claim is electronically submitted for processing and payment  authorization, either directly from the provider\u2019s systems or through a  health care clearinghouse\u2014an organization that converts nonstandard  data elements of health information into standard data elements so that  they can be transmitted to and used within other claims processing  systems.

These systems, referred to as \u201cfront-end\u201d  systems, are used to first determine whether the data submitted are  valid.  There are two front-end validation systems\u2014one for the Part A/B  institutional, physician and non-physician practitioner claims, and one for  durable medical equipment, prosthetics, and orthotics claims. When  validating ICD codes, the front-end systems are designed to check to  ensure that the codes and related data are properly entered on the claim.  Specifically, in order to be accepted by the MACs\u2019 systems, the claim  must include a diagnosis indicator that specifies whether the ICD-9 or  ICD-10 code set is being used, one or more dates of service, and ICD  codes.", "These ICD-related data must be consistent in order to pass through the  front-end systems and on to the MACs\u2019 systems. For example, a claim  with an ICD-10 diagnosis indicator; a September 30, 2014, date of  service; and an ICD-10 code entered into a data field that is 7 values in  length should be rejected by the front-end data validation routines  because the date of service (September 30, 2014) is earlier than the ICD- 10 compliance date (October 1, 2015). Instead, the claims data would  require an ICD-9 indicator and code. Therefore, it would not be  transmitted from the front-end validation system for further processing by  the MAC; rather, it would be rejected and sent back to the submitting  provider (via the MAC\u2019s system) for correction. Thus, these front-end data  validation systems would require modifications in order to accept and  process the expanded 7-value ICD-10 code field in addition to the 5-value  ICD-9 code field. The systems would also need to be modified to ensure  that they can determine that the version of the codes used is consistent  with the date service was delivered\u2014for version 9, a date of service prior  to October 1, 2015, and for version 10, a date of service on or after  October 1, 2015.", "After claims pass the front-end validation routines, each MAC uses its  own systems to receive electronic Medicare claims data that would  include ICD codes from providers (or clearinghouses). For example, the  MACs use systems such as claims imaging software, interactive voice  response systems, provider portals, and workflow management systems  to accept providers\u2019 data. A MAC then uses its systems to transmit the  claims data to CMS\u2019s systems that are used to determine whether to  approve and authorize payment of the claims. Each of the systems used  by a MAC to accept, process, and transmit claims data would require  modifications in order to process ICD-10 rather than ICD-9 codes.", "While private insurers do not submit health care claims data to CMS, they  nonetheless also use systems that would need to be changed to process  ICD-10 codes that are included with other claims data sent to them by  CMS. Specifically, in cases when a beneficiary is covered by both  Medicare and another payer, such as a supplemental Medigap insurer or  a primary payer other than Medicare, the other payer (insurer) could  receive claims data, including ICD codes, from CMS if it was responsible  for paying all or a portion of a claim.

If the systems determine that the data do not meet  the requirements, the claim is denied and sent back via the MAC\u2019s  system to the provider for corrections. For example, the shared systems  execute automated prepayment controls called \u201cedits,\u201d which are  instructions programmed into the system software to identify errors in  individual claims and prevent payment of incomplete or incorrect claims.  These prepayment edits may rely on an analysis of ICD codes to identify  claims for services unlikely to be provided in the normal course of medical  care and services for diagnoses that are anatomically impossible.", "For example, the analysis conducted by a prepayment edit may identify  two ICD-10 codes on a claim that indicate a patient was diagnosed with  two broken right femurs, when there is only one femur on a person\u2019s right  side. As a result, payment of the claim would be denied because the  ICD codes used indicate a diagnosis that is anatomically impossible.  However, an ICD-10 code that indicates a broken right femur and another  that indicates a broken left femur would be accepted because it is  anatomically possible for a person to break both femurs. On the other  hand, ICD-9 codes entered on the claim for two broken femurs would not  indicate that the right and left femurs were both broken, so the analysis  conducted by the same prepayment edit would likely identify the ICD  coding to be duplicative and, consequently, deny payment of the claim.  As such, the software that processes such edits would need to be  modified to conduct the analysis based on ICD-10 values rather than ICD- 9 since, as noted in the example, the logical analysis performed would be  different for each.", "Once a claim has been completely processed by the appropriate shared  system, its data are transmitted to the Common Working File, which  conducts additional processing to determine whether the claim\u2019s  beneficiary is eligible for the service for which the claim was filed,  compares the claims to other claims filed for that beneficiary across the  shared systems, and determines whether payment for the claim should  be authorized.

Any claims that were rejected by the  front end could be corrected and re-submitted by the provider or  clearinghouse. The accepted test claims data were then transmitted to a  test environment of CMS\u2019s shared systems, which determined whether  the claims had been properly submitted. The approved claims data were  transmitted to a test version of the Common Working File, which  authorized or denied payment of the claim.

Officials with AHIMA, AHIP,  HIMSS, WEDI, Cooperative Exchange, and the MACs stated that they  believed that the majority of their constituencies\u2014i.e. providers, insurers,  and clearinghouses\u2014have updated their systems to accommodate the  ICD-10 transition, and most had done so in time for the earlier October  2014 compliance date\u2014the first extension allowed by HHS to give  stakeholders more time to prepare for the transition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS and MACs Offer Alternative Technical Solutions for Filing Medicare Claims", "paragraphs": ["The agency and the MACs have also provided alternative methods for  providers to submit claims data to CMS should any of their systems not  be ready to process and submit claims with ICD-10 codes by October 1,  2015. For example, free billing software is available from all the MACs  and can be downloaded from their websites onto providers\u2019 computers  and used by providers to manually enter and electronically submit claims  data until they have completed the system changes needed to submit  claims with ICD-10 codes. Additionally, five of the nine MACs (that cover  8 of the 16 MAC jurisdictions) provide access to online portals that allow  entry of Medicare Part B claims data for submission to CMS. For  example, a provider may log into its MAC\u2019s website and access the  claims data entry system, which allows providers to manually enter data,  including ICD-10 codes, and submit them to the MAC\u2019s system.  According to CMS data provided by the Office of Technology Solutions, in  2014, more than 1.3 million Medicare Part B claims were submitted in this  manner. CMS also defined a contingency plan that would allow for paper  claims submission for a temporary period of time, if specified conditions  are met, in the event that stakeholders\u2019 systems are not ready to submit  ICD-10 codes beginning October 1, 2015.", "Under some circumstances, CMS allows providers to request a waiver  from electronic submission requirements and, if granted, submit paper  instead of electronic claims. However, very few stakeholders currently  submit paper claims. According to a CMS official with the Office of  Technology Solutions, 98 percent of Medicare fee-for-service claims are  filed electronically.  However, this alternative to electronic claims filing  provides an option for providers to submit claims that include ICD-10  codes if they have not yet completed making changes to their systems.", "CMS communicated information to its stakeholders about the availability  and use of these alternative solutions through its \u201cRoad to 10\u201d web page.  The agency also included information about the free billing software and  the MACs\u2019 portals in a \u201cMedicare Learning Network\u201d article published on  its website in February 2014."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Estimated Costs to Update Its ICD-10 Systems; Stakeholders\u2019 Costs Are Not Known", "paragraphs": ["According to CMS officials in the Office of Enterprise Information, the  known costs of the agency\u2019s efforts to update its claims processing  systems for the ICD-10 transition are estimated to be approximately $116  million for developing, testing, and implementing the system changes.  The officials stated that the agency incurred about $96 million of these  costs from September 2007 through September 2014. The officials added  that this estimate reflects efforts to address 42 ICD-10-related change  requests that were submitted during that time.", "Although CMS identified its systems changes as having been completed  in time for the initial October 2013 compliance date, additional costs were  incurred after the delay of the compliance date from October 2014 to  October 2015. Specifically, agency officials stated that they incurred costs  associated with rework that needed to be completed in order to reinstate  software specific to ICD-9 that had been changed to process ICD-10  data. In addition, CMS officials reported that resources were redirected to  conduct regression tests of the systems throughout the delay to ensure  that functionality and changes already implemented, such as for ICD-10,  were not negatively affected by additional changes made to the systems  for other reasons (e.g., new technologies or policy changes) at each  quarterly release. Agency officials with the Office of Technology Solutions  further stated that they had initially planned to conduct just one period of  end-to-end testing prior to the October 2014 compliance date, but added  that they were able to schedule the two later end-to-end test periods  during the delay to provide additional opportunities for stakeholders to  test their systems from October 2014 through October 1, 2015. According  to officials with the Office of Enterprise Information, the additional IT costs  associated with these combined activities were estimated to be about $20  million.", "Beyond the estimated costs reported by CMS, little is known about the  costs that providers, clearinghouses, and insurers incurred for updating  their Medicare claims submission systems. Such costs were not identified  by the professional associations we contacted or by industry studies that  we reviewed. HHS (in its final ICD-10 compliance rule) and the  associations reported estimates of the overall costs for their  constituencies to transition to ICD-10, and one study conducted for AMA  estimated costs that would be incurred by providers to update their  systems environment, including the systems they use for provider  management and electronic health records implementation. However,  none of these entities studied, estimated, or reported costs specific to  stakeholders\u2019 efforts to upgrade systems to process Medicare fee-for- service claims data that include ICD-10 codes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of our report, signed by HHS\u2019s  Assistant Secretary for Legislation. In the comments (reprinted in  appendix III), HHS described a number of actions that it has taken to help  ensure that its systems are ready to process Medicare claims that include  ICD-10 codes and ongoing efforts to support stakeholders in their  transition to the new code set. The department also said our report stated  that CMS\u2019s systems were completely updated and had undergone  comprehensive and sufficient testing to process ICD-10 codes. In fact, we  reported that agency officials had finished making the changes that they  determined were needed to process the new codes and had conducted  system testing and validation procedures consistent with industry  practices. We cautioned that unanticipated system errors could disrupt  Medicare claims processing when systems are required to begin  processing ICD-10 codes and emphasized that the actions taken by CMS  were important steps to help minimize the impact of any such disruptions.  HHS also provided technical comments, which have been incorporated as  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the secretaries and agency heads of the departments and  agencies addressed in this report, and other interested parties.

For each of the objectives, our scope included  the CMS systems used to process Medicare fee-for-service claims  including the Fiscal Intermediary Shared System (FISS), the Multi-Carrier  System (MCS), the ViPS Medicare System (VMS), and the Common  Working File.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and reviewed documentation  describing the CMS systems impacted by the ICD-10 transition, the  necessary system changes, and the modified systems\u2019 implementation  dates. To determine the actions taken by CMS to implement the changes  for the ICD-10 transition, we obtained and examined relevant project  management documents, including project plans and release notes that  provided information about the systems changes that were needed and  activities planned for completion by October 1, 2015. To determine the  steps taken to identify and address risk, we examined documentation  describing practices and methods for identifying and categorizing risks  associated with ICD-10 system changes. We also reviewed  documentation describing mitigation strategies used to manage the  identified risks such as contingency plans for processing claims data in  case errors occurred. In addition, we held discussions with CMS officials  responsible for the ICD-10 systems transition to obtain their views on the  status of steps taken to implement system changes.", "To address the second objective, we identified criteria for assessing the  sufficiency of systems testing and verification practices based on  established industry standards for conducting software and systems  testing. We obtained and analyzed documentation describing the  processes CMS has established to test and validate the changes it  identified that needed to be made to process Medicare claims with ICD- 10 data. We compared the reported outcomes of CMS\u2019s testing and  validation processes to criteria and practices defined by industry  standards. In particular, we assessed steps conducted by the agency  during the testing phases of its systems change management process to  practices defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  standards for conducting software and system tests.", "To determine the extent to which CMS followed its established process  and adhered to these standards, we reviewed documentation that  described test schedules, plans, and results. We focused our study of  CMS\u2019s ICD-10 testing activities on the final phase, the user acceptance  test, because its purpose is to provide a comprehensive test that  replicates a live production claims processing environment and involves  the participation of end users along with the support of the testing and  development contractors that conducted lower levels of testing that  preceded user acceptance testing. These contractors\u2019 support was  intended to ensure that any errors that were not detected previously could  be corrected prior to systems being released into production. We  examined documents, including minutes of weekly status meetings, that  described tests conducted by CMS\u2019s contractors, errors identified during  the tests, and the status of efforts to address the errors prior to the initial  compliance date of October 1, 2013. We also reviewed minutes of and  documentation supporting release readiness reviews held by CMS  officials that describes the status of testing and any remaining tests to be  done. We assessed the reliability of the data provided by CMS by  reviewing related documentation and collecting supporting data via  questionnaires we issued to, and received from, all the Medicare  Administrative Contractors (MACs) that documented the status of and  progress made toward testing system changes and correcting errors. We  analyzed detailed test data, such as examples of test cases and  documented test results, provided by the MACs\u2019 documents to  understand the extent of testing that was conducted leading up to the  October 2013 release. We determined that the data we collected were  reliable for the purpose of our report to understand the extent to which  CMS\u2019s efforts were sufficient to validate that any errors associated with  ICD-10 system changes were addressed and the software changes  approved for release into production.", "To address the third objective, we identified stakeholders\u2019 needs for  technical assistance based on prior GAO work and information collected  from entities such as professional associations that represent providers,  insurers, and health care clearinghouses, and the MACs that process  Medicare fee-for-service claims. To determine the types of technical  resources CMS provided to help stakeholders identify and test the  changes that needed to be made to their systems, we examined  documentation describing tools such as user guides and data crosswalks,  and additional resources such as claims processing software and testing  facilities to support the ICD-10 transition. We also analyzed agency and  contractors\u2019 documentation that described practices for selecting and  approving participants for testing activities conducted by CMS to help  stakeholders test the integration of their systems with CMS\u2019s claims  processing systems. We obtained and reviewed the list of participants  and number of claims submitted to obtain an understanding of the level of  stakeholder representation in the testing activities. We also collected  information from the contractors that supported the stakeholders to obtain  their views on the outcomes and comprehensiveness of the tests. Finally,  we examined CMS\u2019s plans for providing alternate resources for  stakeholders\u2019 to submit claims that include ICD-10 codes in case their  systems are not yet updated to include and submit ICD-10 data for  Medicare claims.", "To determine the extent to which the industry stakeholder groups found  the support provided by CMS useful, we selected and held discussions  with entities that play a role in supporting the implementation of health  care information technology, including implementing system changes  needed to be made for the ICD-10 transition. The entities we selected  were the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS),  American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA),  America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), and the Workgroup for  Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI). From these discussions, we  obtained their views on the effectiveness of the technical support CMS  has provided to their constituencies since 2008.", "For the fourth objective, we collected data available from CMS regarding  any actual or estimated costs known to have been incurred by the agency  associated with the development, testing, and implementation of  necessary system changes for the ICD-10 transition, to include additional  costs incurred as a result of the delay until October 1, 2015. We assessed  the reliability of the data provided by CMS by examining agency  documentation and discussing with an official of the Office of Enterprise  Information the agency\u2019s approach for producing financial statements and  the outcomes of independent audits of those statements, which were  reportedly produced in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. We also reviewed published reports of selected health care  professional associations that support providers that submit claims to  CMS for reimbursement. These entities were the Professional Association  of Health Care Office Management and the American Medical  Association, along with HHS\u2019s final rule on ICD-10 compliance. We  determined that the cost data we collected were reliable for the purpose  of our report to identify any costs known to have been incurred by CMS  and its Medicare stakeholders for implementing system changes needed  to process ICD-10 codes.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to September  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
