Meeting these needs domestically is the responsibility of the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for federal government users and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for all other users. The current legal framework for domestic spectrum management evolved as a compromise over the questions of who should determine how spectrum is allocated among competing users and what standard should be applied in making this determination. Current methods for allocating spectrum face difficulties, and FCC and NTIA's efforts are not guided by a national spectrum strategy. Since nearly all of the usable radio spectrum has been allocated already, accommodating more services and users generally involves redefining current radiofrequency allocations. One method used by FCC and NTIA is to increase the amount of spectrum that is designated for shared use, so that additional types of services or users may be placed within a particular frequency allocation. Another method, called band-clearing, involves relocating a service or user from one area spectrum to another in order to make room for a new service or user. The challenges the United States faces in preparing for World Radiocommunication Conferences, where decisions are made regarding the global and regional allocation of spectrum, have raised questions about the adequacy of the United States' current preparatory process. Under the current structure, FCC and NTIA develop positions on agenda items through separate processes that involve the users of the spectrum they manage. NTIA has several oversight activities to encourage accountability and efficient use of the spectrum by federal agencies, but federal officials stated that the effectiveness of these activities is hindered by staffing and resource shortages. Specifically, NTIA has directed federal agencies to use only as much spectrum as they need and has established frequency assignment and review processes that place primary responsibility for promoting efficiency in the hands of the agencies. As an accountability measure, NTIA requires that agencies justify their initial need for a frequency assignment and periodically review their continued need for the assignment, generally every 5 years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The radiofrequency spectrum is the medium that enables wireless  communications of all kinds, such as mobile phone and paging services,  radio and television broadcasting, radar, and satellite-based services.

One of these agencies\u2019 most important tasks is to decide  how to allocate (apportion) the spectrum among the different types of  wireless services and users\u2014a task that is increasingly difficult as the  spectrum becomes more crowded and competition for radiofrequencies  intensifies. A further complication is that domestic management and use of  the spectrum and its commercial development are greatly affected by  international agreements on spectrum use. Our ability to promote our  strategic and economic interests internationally has become more difficult  as countries vie with the United States for leadership in the multibillion  dollar global telecommunications marketplace. As a result of these  developments, debate has been intensifying about whether our current  approach to spectrum management is adequate to meet the challenges of  the wireless age.", "As the Congress begins to debate whether fundamental reforms are needed  in spectrum management, you asked us to provide an overview of the  development of the legal and regulatory framework for spectrum  management at the federal level and assess key issues associated with  spectrum management at federal agencies. As agreed, we focused on the  following issues: (1) the evolution of the current legal and regulatory  framework for domestic spectrum management; (2) the current methods  for allocating spectrum domestically and planning for its use; (3) the  adequacy of the current U.S. preparatory process for the World  Radiocommunication Conferences, at which decisions are made on how to  allocate spectrum internationally; and (4) the activities used to increase  accountability and encourage the efficient use of spectrum by federal  agencies.", "In addition to these issues, you requested that we review how the current  rules and regulations governing spectrum holders affect the rollout of new  technologies and services and the level of competition in markets that use  spectrum. Work on this issue is ongoing and will result in a separate report  early in 2003, which will also include a discussion of approaches to  spectrum management in other countries, such as the use of incentives for  efficient spectrum use.", "To address the four issues covered in this report, we reviewed major  legislative and regulatory developments in spectrum management over the  past century, along with relevant agency manuals, policies, and regulations.  We interviewed officials responsible for spectrum management at FCC,  NTIA, and the Department of State. We also interviewed representatives  from the commercial wireless industry. To gain an understanding of how  the federal government uses and manages spectrum, we reviewed relevant  documents and interviewed officials from the following seven agencies that  are major users of this resource: the Department of Energy, the Department  of the Interior, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard, the  Department of Justice, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We conducted our  review from July 2001 through July 2002 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To a large degree, spectrum management policies flow from the technical  characteristics of the radio spectrum. Although the radio spectrum spans  the range from 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz, 90 percent of its use is  concentrated in the 1 percent below 3.1 gigahertz. The crowding in this  region has occurred because these frequencies have properties that are  well suited for many important wireless technologies, such as mobile  phones, radio and television broadcasting, numerous satellite  communication systems, radars, and aeronautical telemetry systems.", "The process known as spectrum allocation has been adopted, both  domestically and internationally, as a means of apportioning frequencies  among various types of wireless services and users to prevent radio  interference. Interference occurs when two or more radio signals interact  in a manner that disrupts the transmission and reception of messages.  Spectrum allocation involves segmenting the radio spectrum into bands of  frequencies that are designated for use by particular types of radio services  or classes of users, such as broadcast television and satellites. Over the  years, the United States has designated hundreds of frequency bands for  numerous types of wireless services. Within these bands, government,  commercial, scientific, and amateur users receive specific frequency  assignments or licenses for their wireless operations. The equipment they  use is designed to operate on these frequencies. Appendix I provides an  overview of how the major frequency ranges of the spectrum are currently  used.", "During the last 50 years, developments in wireless technology have  increased the number of usable frequencies, reduced the potential for  interference, and improved the efficiency of transmission through various  techniques, such as reducing the amount of spectrum needed to send  information. In June 2002, for example, FCC initiated a proceeding to  promote the commercial development of several undeveloped bands in the  upper region of the spectrum where new uses for these bands are  becoming practical due to technological developments. Nevertheless, the  demand for frequencies by both government and the private sector remains  high as new technologies that use spectrum are developed and used. An  example of this is the unexpectedly rapid growth of mobile phone use in  the United States. Subscribers of mobile phone service jumped from 16  million in 1994 to an estimated 137 million in 2002, greatly exceeding even  the wireless industry\u2019s original projections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concern Over Concentrating Authority Led to Divided Structure for Spectrum Management", "paragraphs": ["Our nation\u2019s approach to spectrum management evolved in response to  technical developments, legislation, court decisions, and policy initiatives.    The legal and regulatory framework in place today for allocating radio  spectrum among federal and nonfederal users emerged from a compromise  over two fundamental policy questions: (1) whether spectrum decisions  should be made by a single government official or shared among several  decision makers; and (2) whether all nonfederal government users should  operate radio services without qualification, or if a standard should be used  to license these operators. The resulting structure\u2014dividing spectrum  management between the President and an independent regulatory body\u2014 reflects both the President\u2019s responsibility for national defense and the  fulfillment of federal agencies\u2019 missions, and the U.S. government\u2019s  longstanding encouragement and recognition of private sector investment  in developing and deploying commercial radio and other communications  services.", "The need for government regulation of the radiofrequency spectrum  became apparent at the beginning of the twentieth century with the  application of wireless communications to maritime safety. In 1904,  President Theodore Roosevelt adopted a recommendation of an  interagency board and placed all government coastal radio facilities under  the U.S. Navy\u2019s control.   The first federal statute to establish a structure for  spectrum management was the Radio Act of 1912, which was enacted in  part to rationalize the burgeoning use of the radio spectrum. The Act  required users of the radio spectrum to obtain a license, and it consolidated  licensing authority with the Secretary of Commerce. Commerce\u2019s practice  was to grant licenses for particular frequencies on a first-come, first-served  basis.", "This approach proved to be deficient, however, when the burgeoning  growth of radio communications in the late 1910s and 1920s led to  radiofrequency interference problems. The courts determined that the  Secretary of Commerce lacked the authority under the 1912 Act to alleviate  these problems by using licensing as a means of controlling radio station  operations or by designating frequencies for uses or issuing licenses of  limited duration.", "In recognition of such limitations, deliberations began in the 1920s to  devise a new framework for radio spectrum management. Although there  was general agreement that licensing should entail more than a registration  process, there was debate about designation of the licensing authority and  the standard that should govern the issuance of licenses.   This debate went  on over several years as the Department of Commerce convened four radio  conferences (1922\u201325) attended by manufacturers, broadcasters, civilian  and military government users, and other stakeholders to make  recommendations addressing overcrowding of the airwaves. For example,  at the first national radio conference in 1922, a bill was drafted that was  subsequently introduced in the House of Representatives, that would have  placed the issuance of licenses under the absolute discretion of the  Secretary of Commerce. Subsequent bills introduced in the House and  Senate in 1925 took differing approaches to licensing authority. The House  bill would have vested licensing authority with the Secretary of Commerce  with licensing appeals going to a commission, while the Senate bill would  have placed all licensing functions in an independent commission from the  start.", "The Radio Act of 1927 reflected a compromise on a spectrum management  framework. In order to allay concerns about vesting all licensing authority  in the hands of one person (specifically, the Secretary of Commerce) the  new Act reserved the authority to assign frequencies for all federal  government radio operators to the President and created the Federal Radio  Commission (FRC) to license nonfederal government operators.   Under  the Act, the FRC was granted licensing authority for one year to resolve  interference problems, after which it was to become an appellate body to  address disputes with the Secretary of Commerce, who was to assume  licensing duties. Composed of five members from five different regions of  the country, FRC was empowered to assign frequencies, establish coverage  areas, and establish the power and location of transmitters under its  licensing authority. Further, the Act delineated that a radio operation  proposed by a nonfederal license applicant must meet a standard of \u201cthe  public interest, convenience, and necessity,\u201d and that a license conveyed no  ownership in radio channels nor created any right beyond the terms of the  license.", "The FRC\u2019s one-year authority over licensing was extended several times by  the Congress because the commission needed more time to deal with  interference problems. As these problems persisted, the FRC\u2019s authority  was extended for an indefinite term pending new legislation. By 1930, it  was becoming evident that the licensing task was too complex to be  conferred permanently on the Department of Commerce, which was  perceived as being already overburdened with other issues. New legislation  was enacted in the form of the landmark Communications Act of 1934.  Under this Act, the FRC was abolished and its authorities transferred to the  new Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which brought together  the regulation of telephone, telegraph, and radio services under one  independent regulatory agency. The 1934 Act, however, also retained the  authority of the President to assign spectrum to and manage federal  government radio operations. For over 75 years, this division in  responsibilities has remained the essential feature of U.S. spectrum  management, unlike many other countries that chose to concentrate  spectrum management within one government entity.", "The President\u2019s authority for managing federal spectrum has been lodged in  various parts of the government since the 1934 Act. However, a source of  advice and support on federal government spectrum use during these  changes has been IRAC, composed of representatives from federal  agencies that use the most spectrum. IRAC was formed in 1922 when  Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover drew attention to the need for  cooperative action in solving problems arising from the federal  government\u2019s interest in radio use. He invited interested government  departments to designate representatives for a special government radio  committee. The committee recommended the establishment of a  permanent interdepartmental committee. As a result, the  Interdepartment Advisory Committee on Governmental Radio  Broadcasting (later renamed IRAC) was formed. Over the ensuing decades,  IRAC, whose existence and actions were affirmed by the President in 1927,  has continued to advise whomever has been responsible for exercising the  authority of the President to assign frequencies to the federal government.  Currently, IRAC assists NTIA in assigning frequencies to federal agencies  and developing policies, programs, procedures, and technical criteria for  the allocation, management, and use of the spectrum. Figure 1 shows  IRAC\u2019s present membership, which includes FCC in a nonvoting liaison  capacity.", "Over the past 75 years, since the 1927 Act formed our divided structure of  spectrum management, there is historical evidence of cooperation and  coordination in managing federal and nonfederal spectrum to promote its  effective use. For example, FCC and IRAC agreed in 1940 to give each other  notice of proposed actions that might cause interference or other problems  for their respective constituencies. Further, FCC has participated in IRAC  meetings, and NTIA frequently provides comments in FCC proceedings  that affect federal radio operations. As will be discussed later, FCC and  NTIA also work together with the Department of State to formulate a  unified U.S. position on issues at international meetings that coordinate  spectrum use regionally and globally.", "However, as demand for this limited resource increases, particularly with  the continuing emergence of new commercial wireless technologies, NTIA  and FCC face serious challenges in trying to meet the growth in the needs  of their respective incumbent users, while accommodating the needs of  new users. As FCC has noted, the basic problem is that demand for  spectrum is outstripping the supply."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods for Allocating Spectrum Face Difficulties and Are Not Guided by a Coordinated National Plan", "paragraphs": ["Since nearly all of the usable radio spectrum has been allocated already,  accommodating more services and users often involves redefining  spectrum allocations. The current divided U.S. spectrum management  structure has methods for allocating spectrum for new uses and users of  wireless services, but these methods have occasionally resulted in lengthy  negotiations between FCC and NTIA. Several, including Congress, have  suggested that coordinated planning could help identify and resolve some  allocation difficulties. FCC and NTIA have not yet implemented long- standing congressional directives to conduct joint, national spectrum  planning although they have conducted independent planning efforts and  have recently taken steps to improve coordination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spectrum Is Allocated through Sharing and Band- clearing", "paragraphs": ["One method to accommodate more services and users is spectrum  \u201csharing,\u201d which enables more than one user to transmit radio signals on  the same frequency band. In a shared allocation, a distinction is made as to  which user has \u201cprimary\u201d or priority use of a frequency and which user has  \u201csecondary\u201d status, meaning that it must defer to the primary user. Users  may also be designated as \u201cco-primary,\u201d in which the first operator to  obtain authority to use the spectrum has priority to use the frequency over  another primary operator. As shown in figure 2, more than half of the  spectrum from 9 kHz to 3.1 GHz is shared between federal and nonfederal  users. NTIA must ensure that the status assigned to users in shared  spectrum (primary/secondary or co-primary) meets users\u2019 needs, and that  users abide by rules applicable to their designated status.", "Another method to accommodate new users and technologies is \u201cband- clearing,\u201d or reclassifying a band of spectrum from one set of radio services  and users to another, which requires moving previously authorized users to  a different band. Band-clearing decisions affecting only nonfederal or only  federal users are managed within FCC or NTIA, respectively, albeit  sometimes with difficulty. However, band-clearing decisions that involve  radio services of both types of users pose a greater challenge. Specifically,  they require coordination between FCC and NTIA to ensure that moving  existing users to a new frequency band is technically feasible and meets  their radio operation needs. In addition, such moves often involve costs to  the existing user of the band, who may need to modify or replace existing  equipment to operate on new frequencies.", "The need for spectrum reallocation can originate from many different  sources, including the results of international decisions on spectrum use or  requests from industry or federal users. Also, the Congress has in the past  mandated the reallocation of spectrum from federal to nonfederal use.  Once any needed research has been conducted and both FCC and NTIA  agree on the proposed reallocation, FCC issues a \u201cNotice of Proposed  Rulemaking\u201d to obtain public comments on the proposed allocation  change. After the comment period, FCC publishes a Report and Order that  directs any changes that will be made to the frequency allocation table.  Spectrum users who disagree with the Report and Order may petition FCC  for a change that could result in an amended decision. Figure 3 depicts the  primary steps in the process by which the reallocation of a frequency band  from a federal to nonfederal government designation would occur if no  court challenges arise.", "While many such band-clearing decisions have been made throughout radio  history, these negotiations can be protracted and contentious. A hotly  debated issue today is how to accommodate \u201cthird-generation\u201d wireless  services, which enable handheld communication devices to provide both  voice and high-speed data.   In October 2000, President Clinton directed  that a plan be developed to select spectrum for third-generation services,  but this attempt was unsuccessful. A new task force was established. In  July 2002 the Department of Commerce in conjunction with FCC, the  Department of Defense (DOD), and other federal agencies released its  study that concluded that 90 MHz of spectrum could be allocated for third- generation services without disrupting communication services critical to  national security. This 90 MHz of spectrum could be available for third- generation services no later than December 2008 and would come from  both federal and nonfederal bands.", "FCC told us that the relationship between FCC and NTIA on spectrum  management became more structured since the Congress became active in  the 1990s in directing the reallocation of spectrum from federal to  nonfederal government use. For example, the Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66, Aug. 10, 1993) directed the  reallocation of not less that 200 MHz of spectrum from federal to private  sector use. NTIA was directed to identify frequency bands that could be  reallocated; use specific criteria in making recommendations for their  reallocation; issue a preliminary report upon which public comment on  proposed reallocations would be solicited; obtain analyses and comment  from FCC; and transfer frequency bands within specified time frames. The  Act also required FCC to gradually allocate and assign these frequencies  over the course of 10 years. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33,  Aug. 5, 1997) imposed a stricter deadline for NTIA to identify frequency  bands for reallocation and required FCC to reallocate, auction, and assign  licenses by September 2002 for an additional 20 MHz of spectrum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Options for Facilitating Reallocations Have Been Raised", "paragraphs": ["To deal with the protracted nature of some spectrum reallocation  decisions, some officials we interviewed have suggested establishing a  third party\u2014such as an outside panel or commission, an office within the  White House, or an interagency group\u2014to arbitrate or mediate differences  between FCC and NTIA. For example, the United Kingdom has a formal  standing committee, co-chaired by officials from the Radiocommunications  Agency and the Ministry of Defense, that has authority to resolve  contentious spectrum issues. FCC officials noted, however, that an  arbitration function would go to the core of the responsibilities currently  entrusted to FCC and NTIA in making allocation decisions. Moreover, it is  not clear how such a function would be set up or the extent to which the  President, who retains spectrum management authority for government  users and national defense, would allow this authority to be placed in the  hands of an arbitrator.   FCC officials maintain that the handful of issues  involving inherently difficult reallocation choices attracts attention and  leads to what, in their view, is a mistaken assumption that the current  reallocation process is broken. They noted that FCC and NTIA have  coordinated successfully on over 50 spectrum-related rulemakings in the  past year alone.", "Mechanisms for ensuring that incumbent users receive comparable  spectrum and are reimbursed for the cost of relocating are also being  developed or proposed. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2000 specified a number of conditions that have to be met if  spectrum in which DOD is the primary user is surrendered. The Act  requires NTIA, in consultation with FCC, to identify and make available to  DOD for its primary use, if necessary, an alternate band(s) of frequency as  replacement(s) for the band(s) surrendered. Further, if such band(s) of  frequency are to be surrendered, the Secretaries of Defense and  Commerce, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must jointly  certify to relevant congressional committees that such alternative band(s)  provide comparable technical characteristics to restore essential military  capability. Under the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 1999, federal agencies are authorized to accept  compensation payments when they relocate or modify their frequency use  to accommodate nonfederal users of spectrum. The Act directs NTIA and  FCC to develop procedures for the implementation of the relocation  provisions. NTIA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding these  provisions in January 2001 and a final rule in June 2002. Under this rule,  federal agencies would prepare an estimate of their relocation costs. This  figure would be provided to potential bidders at future auctions. FCC has  stated that the Commission will adopt any additional rules or procedures  necessary to supplement NTIA\u2019s reimbursement procedures. Under current  law, however, federal agencies would be unable to expend these payments  without additional congressional action. In July 2002, the Department of  Commerce sent to the congressional leadership a draft bill to amend the  Communications Act of 1934 to create a Spectrum Relocation Fund to  revise the procedures under which federal entities are paid for relocating  from spectrum frequencies reallocated for auction to commercial entities.  According to NTIA, this fund would benefit both the agencies, by providing  greater certainty in recovering their relocation costs, and the private sector,  by providing greater certainty on the ultimate price of the licenses they  obtain at auction. However, it would be important for the Congress to  establish up front what controls it wants to maintain over such a fund. For  example, would the Office of Management and Budget control when and  how much an agency received in reimbursement or would the Congress  maintain control by requiring an agency to obtain an appropriation?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC and NTIA Have Not Yet Implemented Congressional Planning Directives", "paragraphs": ["Several U.S. spectrum experts said that one means of improving the  spectrum allocation process is to develop coordinated, national spectrum  planning and policies that better anticipate future needs and put more  predictability into spectrum decision-making. The Congress called for  coordinated spectrum planning in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  of 1993, which required NTIA and FCC to conduct joint spectrum planning  sessions. Subsequently, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2000  included a requirement for FCC and NTIA to review and assess the  progress toward implementing a national spectrum plan. Even before  these congressional directives, NTIA itself, in a 1991 report, recommended  that NTIA and FCC seek to institute a coordinated, strategic, long-range  planning process. The output of this process would be a formal joint  FCC/NTIA plan that would be periodically updated, with goals, policies,  and specific actions to provide for future spectrum requirements and  improved spectrum management. The Defense Science Board similarly  concluded in November 2000 that the United States lacks a mechanism to  formulate a national spectrum policy that balances traditional national  security uses of the spectrum with new commercial uses of the spectrum.  According to NTIA, the United States Table of Frequency Allocations,  which documents the spectrum allocations for over 40 radio services, along  with existing spectrum management processes, constitutes a basic U.S.  strategic spectrum plan, which covers all cases of spectrum use. However,  as we pointed out in an earlier report, the national allocation table reflects  only the current landscape of spectrum use and does not provide a  framework to guide spectrum decisions for the future.", "FCC and NTIA have each undertaken planning efforts, but they are focused  largely on issues involving their separate constituencies and, as such, do  not fulfill the requirements of the congressional directives. For example,  FCC conducts spectrum planning for nonfederal government use through  two staff committees and uses public forums, en banc hearings, advisory  committees, and other methods to gather and provide information for its  spectrum planning. NTIA\u2019s spectrum planning has resulted in several  spectrum planning documents over the last 20 years, including the  September 2000 Federal Long-Range Spectrum Plan that identified current  and future federal spectrum uses, along with any unsupported spectrum  requirements. In addition, NTIA established the Strategic Spectrum  Planning program in 1992, through which it produced several additional  reports on spectrum planning, dealing with land mobile spectrum planning  options, radio astronomy spectrum planning options, and federal radar  spectrum requirements.", "Interaction between the two agencies also takes place on an ongoing basis.  For example, FCC has liaison status on IRAC and its subcommittees, which  provides it with an avenue for commenting on federal government issues.  NTIA, for its part, provides comments on FCC proceedings on issues that  could affect federal users. In addition, both agencies (along with industry)  are involved in preparing the United States\u2019 unified position for World  Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs). One FCC official called the  consensus-building involved in this preparatory process as being the  closest thing the United States has to a national spectrum strategy.  However, FCC and NTIA officials acknowledged that these interactions  have not fulfilled the congressional mandate for coordinated national  spectrum planning. FCC and NTIA officials stated that a key problem in  developing a strategy for national spectrum planning is the inherent  difficulty of trying to predict future trends in the fast-developing area of  wireless services. For example, FCC officials noted that both FCC and  wireless industry forecasts greatly underestimated the huge growth of  mobile phone service during the 1990s. On the other hand, emerging  wireless technologies that appear promising may not develop as planned,  resulting in underutilization of spectrum that has been set aside for them.", "The Chairman of FCC and the Administrator of NTIA recently commented  on the need for coordinated planning, and the agencies are currently  engaged in efforts that could provide a basis for improved planning. For  example, in early 2002, FCC announced the creation of a Spectrum Policy  Task Force to explore how spectrum can be put to the highest and best use  in a timely manner. In July 2002, FCC received comments in response to a  public notice issued for the Task Force on several spectrum management  and use issues including market-oriented allocation and assignment  policies, interference protection, spectral efficiency, public safety  communications, and international coordination. In August 2002, the  Spectrum Policy Task Force held four public workshops addressing  spectrum policy issues. Participants included representatives from  academia, industry, and government. The Task Force intends to report to  the Commission by October 2002.", "For its part, NTIA hosted a spectrum summit in early April 2002 that  included participants from FCC, NTIA, and federal agency and industry  representatives. The summit included several sessions to explore ways to  improve the management of the spectrum through planning and  technological innovations. In addition, NTIA\u2019s 2003 budget request includes  over $1 million in funding to develop a plan to review and improve its  overall performance of spectrum management duties. In June 2002, NTIA  officials stated that FCC and NTIA had recently adopted a \u201cOne Spectrum  Team\u201d approach to improve interagency communication and take a more  proactive approach to spectrum management.

Department of State and FCC officials told us that the  work of FCC and NTIA with their respective constituencies and with each  other in preparation for a conference leads to U.S. positions on WRC  agenda items that are thoroughly scrutinized, well reasoned, and generally  supported among federal and nonfederal parties. In contrast, some industry  officials told us that the NTIA process does not allow the private sector  adequate involvement in the development of U.S. positions for the WRC.  Also, some federal and industry officials said that, because each agency  develops its positions through separate processes, it takes too long to meld  the two toward the end of the preparatory period. For example, in the past,  the U.S. position on some items has remained unresolved until the eve of  the conference, leaving the United States with little time to build  preconference support for them. The former U.S. Ambassador to the 2000  WRC recommended merging the separate FCC and NTIA preparatory  groups to get an earlier start at working with industry and government  users to reach a consensus on U.S. positions regarding WRC agenda  items. However, NTIA said that the separate processes are needed  because much of the government side of spectrum policy and use is  classified and because NTIA and FCC are responsible for separate groups  of constituents. In June 2002, FCC, NTIA, and Department of State officials  stated they believed coordination in developing U.S. positions was  improving and that most of the 2003 WRC agenda items were close to  resolution.", "There has been long-standing concern about the length of tenure of the  individual who is designated head of the U.S. delegation. The President\u2014 under his authority to confer the personal rank of ambassador on an  individual in connection with a special mission of a temporary nature\u2014has  selected an ambassador to head the U.S. delegation to each WRC for a time  period not exceeding 6 months. This authority allows the conferral of the  personal rank of ambassador to be made without confirmation by the  Senate, subject to appropriate notification. The former U.S. Ambassador to  the 2000 WRC said that ambassador status is generally believed to confer a  high level of support from the administration, helps to achieve consensus  in finalizing U.S. positions, and enhances our negotiating posture with  other countries. However, the former U.S. Ambassador also said that the  brief tenure of the appointment leaves little time for an ambassador to get  up to speed on the issues, solidify U.S. positions, form a delegation, and  undertake preconference meetings with heads of other delegations to  promote U.S. positions. In addition, the Ambassador said there is concern  about the lack of continuity in leadership from one conference to the next,  in contrast to other nations that are led by high-level government officials  who serve longer terms and may represent their nations at multiple  conferences. FCC and NTIA officials stated that longer-term leaders of  national delegations are perceived by other participants as being more able  to develop relationships with their counterparts from other nations, and  that this helps them to negotiate and build regional and international  support for their positions. Similar observations were made by the Office of  Technology Assessment as far back as 1991, but no consensus has  emerged to resolve this issue.", "Department of State officials said previous administrations have identified  the person who was to become the ambassador early so that they could  involve that person in conference planning prior to the start of the 6-month  term. For example, the 2000 WRC Ambassador knew she would be chosen  for the position and was given a temporary telecommunications policy  position in the White House 4 months prior to her official selection. This  position provided additional time for her to learn the issues and observe  WRC preparatory meetings, but she could not lead the meetings until her  formal selection about 5 months before the conference. Department  officials said that the current administration is also planning to identify the  2003 WRC Ambassador several months before the official selection. Other  suggestions for dealing with this issue that have been raised include  establishing a telecommunications policy office in the White House, whose  head would also be responsible for leading the delegation; extending the  length of an ambassador\u2019s appointment through a Senate confirmation  process; and creating an upper-level career position within the Department  of State to provide continuity from one conference to the next and organize  WRC preparations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Officials Said that FCC Has Been Slow to Implement All WRC Agreements Domestically", "paragraphs": ["Officials at the Department of State said that, after a WRC concludes,  countries need to implement the agreements reached at the conference\u2014 known as the Final Acts.

NTIA  officials stated that FCC has still not formally considered their request for a  national primary allocation for this service.

Agencies generally  rely on mission staff to identify and justify the need for a frequency  assignment and to complete the engineering and technical specifications  for the application. Once an application is submitted, it goes through an  NTIA review and a 15-day IRAC peer review process. NTIA staff members  said they examine assignment applications to ensure that they comply with  technical rules, while IRAC members said they primarily look to see  whether the assignment could cause interference with other users.

One spectrum manager we  interviewed stated that Spectrum XXI has greatly reduced the amount of  time and work involved in applying for a frequency assignment.

Federal  spectrum users are expected to modify or delete frequency assignments as  needed based on the results of these reviews. NTIA said that it may delete  assignments that have not been reviewed in more than 10 years.", "Using its database of federal agencies\u2019 frequency assignments, NTIA is to  track assignments that are due for review and provide a listing to the  respective agencies. NTIA is notified that an agency has completed an  assignment review when the agency requests a modification to the  database that contains the frequency assignments. These modifications  may simply be requesting a change to the date on which the assignment  was last reviewed or may indicate technical and operational changes made  since the last review.   NTIA forwards modification requests to IRAC  members for their review.

Every 6 months, NTIA provides  IRAC with a list of these overdue assignments for a case-by-case review  and recommendation on whether to retain or delete the assignment.   NTIA  officials said this method of notification works very well in getting the  reviews done because federal users recognize that it is easier to review  existing assignments than it is to lose the frequency authorizations and  start the process over. NTIA does not maintain any information on the  number of assignments that have been deleted for noncompliance with the  review program.", "According to NTIA officials, the Frequency Assignment Review Program  \u201cweeds out\u201d assignments that are no longer being used so that they can be  returned for use by others. We found, however, that the program relies  mainly on self-reported agency information that receives no independent  verification by NTIA. Comments by spectrum managers at the seven  agencies we reviewed raise concerns about how well these reviews are  being carried out. Officials from these agencies told us that they attempt to  use spectrum as efficiently as possible, but five of them acknowledged that  they are not completing the 5-year reviews in a timely or in-depth way. For  example, a spectrum manager for a major agency division said that over  1,000 of its frequency assignments have not been reviewed in 10 years or  more. According to agency officials, problems with performing timely  assignment reviews are occurring due to shortages in qualified staff to  complete the reviews and because completing the reviews is a lower  priority compared to other agency work. For example, a spectrum manager  at one agency noted that all field staff responsible for helping with the  5-year reviews had been eliminated, which impaired the timeliness and  quality of the reviews.", "Another spectrum manager stated that his agency\u2019s central spectrum  management staff had operated a comprehensive program of oversight, on- sight inspections, field staff training, and planning until 8 of their 10 full- time positions were eliminated. This official said that he could not ensure  all spectrum assignments are being used as authorized. The spectrum  manager at another agency said that he was sure that the agency was not  using all of its frequency assignments, but he added that conducting a  comprehensive review would be time consuming and of limited benefit.  The spectrum manager located at an agency\u2019s field office stated that some  frequency assignments connected to a single system critical to mission  functions had been deleted by NTIA because the agency did not have the  staff or time to complete the assignment reviews. This manager stated the  agency continued to use these frequencies while staff struggled to find the  time to reapply for them.", "Aside from the assignment review process, NTIA had established  additional programs for overseeing how federal agencies were using their  spectrum, but these programs have been scaled back or discontinued. One  component of NTIA\u2019s Spectrum Measurement Program used van-mounted  monitoring equipment by NTIA staff to verify that federal agencies were  using assigned frequencies in different geographic locations in accordance  with applicable technical regulations. Although NTIA officials recently  stated that this program was an invaluable monitoring tool, the van- mounted verification has been discontinued due to a lack of agency  resources. Another effort that is no longer active is NTIA\u2019s Spectrum  Management Survey Program, established in 1965, which included on-site  visits by NTIA staff to determine whether federal agencies\u2019 transmitters  were being used as authorized, to educate field staff on NTIA requirements,  and to improve spectrum management. NTIA said that although this  program helped to correct frequency assignment information and provided  for an exchange of information, the program is not currently operating  because of increased workloads and a shortage of staff.", "The issue of reported spectrum staffing shortages at federal agencies has  broader ramifications for the general management of spectrum that go  beyond the frequency review and monitoring programs. In January 2002,  NTIA officials told us that its Office of Spectrum Management was facing  serious staffing problems. Specifically, the office had 21 vacancies out of a  total of 122 positions. In addition, over 40 percent of the current staff will  be eligible for retirement by 2006. NTIA officials said that agencies such  as FCC and the Department of State have recently had a number of  openings for technical positions at higher salary levels then NTIA currently  offers. As a result, their Office of Spectrum Management has lost staff to  these agencies. In addition, two other agencies we reviewed have  conducted staffing needs assessments that indicate that their current levels  of staff are inadequate. First, an internal analysis conducted by the Coast  Guard Maritime Radio and Spectrum Management Division showed an  immediate need for six additional field staff members and at least one  additional headquarters staff to assist with spectrum management. Second,  a June 2002 study sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE) reviewed  the resources and management structure of the 12 IRAC member federal  agencies that hold more than 1000 frequency assignments. Although the  study\u2019s analysis focused on agencies with large numbers of assignments,  the complete study includes a description of all 20 IRAC agencies\u2019  spectrum management organizational structures, reporting chains, and  resource allocations, among other spectrum management issues. It  concluded that federal and contract staffing for DOE\u2019s spectrum  management was inadequate when compared to that of other agencies,  particularly with regard to planning, homeland security, and spectrum-use  initiatives.", "Although the loss of qualified staff and the need to recruit new staff has  been a source of concern for the agencies, no concerted effort has been  made to define the federal government\u2019s needs in this area or develop a  strategy for addressing it. NTIA officials mentioned that they had been  working with the Office of Personnel Management to consider establishing  a federal job series for spectrum management in order to help attract and  retain these specialists. However, they said the effort appears to have lost  momentum.", "Addressing these perceived human capital issues may help increase  accountability. However, even if these problems were addressed, it is  unclear that this type of oversight management approach in itself would  ensure the efficient use of federal spectrum.

For example, NTIA\u2019s  Institute for Telecommunication Science (ITS), established in 1977,  operates the primary telecommunications research laboratory in the  United States involved in the development and application of radio wave  propagation measurements, studies, and prediction models. ITS provides  the tools, analysis, and data that enable studies of spectrum use, efficiency,  coverage, and interference analysis. ITS has participated in antenna studies  that may result in a substantial increase in the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d of a radio  system (or piece of spectrum) by providing multiple beams to  independently link to different users on the same channel. In addition, ITS  has been assisting the public safety community in increasing spectrum  efficiency by examining and implementing system improvements to  support increased voice and data traffic. Working with IRAC, NTIA also  strives to establish standards that are equal to or better than private sector  standards at aiding in the conservation of spectrum. For example, NTIA  officials have noted that federal radar standards are among the tightest  radar spectrum standards in the world and are currently under review for  further refinements.", "NTIA officials said that, when applicable, NTIA uses the definition of  spectrum efficiency described by ITU, namely the ratio of communications  achieved to the spectrum space used, which has practical value for many  types of commercial communications systems. The specific technical  measurement may take different forms, depending on the system. For  example, the spectrum efficiency of a commercial wireless system might  be measured in terms of subscribers served per megahertz of spectrum  used per square kilometer of service area. NTIA officials cautioned,  however, that many or most of the systems used by the federal government,  including radars, navigation, military tactical, and scientific systems, do not  fall within the scope of this type of measure of spectrum efficiency and that  no effective measure for spectrum efficiency has been identified for these  latter types of systems.", "Implementing more spectrum-efficient technologies at federal agencies can  be challenging. For example, around 1990, NTIA began exploring the use of  \u201cnarrowbanding\u201d because of concerns over its ability to continue to meet  federal agencies\u2019 land mobile communications needs. Narrowbanding is a  technique for reducing the amount of spectrum (bandwidth) needed to  transmit a radio signal, thereby freeing up spectrum to meet future growth.  In 1992, the Congress directed NTIA to adopt and implement a plan for  federal agencies with existing mobile radio systems to use more spectrum- efficient technologies. With the approval of IRAC, NTIA required all  federal agencies to upgrade their existing land-based mobile systems so as  to reduce the bandwidth needed per channel from 25 kHz to 12.5 kHz. NTIA  set deadlines for the narrowbanding requirement, which is to be completed  in two stages by 2008.", "All federal agencies need to meet the narrowbanding requirement in order  to prevent harmful interference. NTIA officials stated that any agency not  meeting the narrowbanding requirements would be responsible for  eliminating the harmful interference. NTIA officials also stated that no  acceptable justifications for not adopting narrowbanding have been  proposed or developed. Spectrum managers from the seven agencies we  reviewed presented a mixed picture about their ability to meet this  deadline. While some believed that they were on track, others stated that  they were either having difficulty meeting the deadlines or would not meet  the deadlines at all. The Chief Information Officer in one agency compared  the requirement to an unfunded mandate; he said the agency had not been  provided with the financial resources needed to make system design  changes, buy new equipment, and maintain current equipment until the  transition was finalized. He stated that his office could not compete with  other agency priorities for funding. Officials at other agencies stated that  shortages in qualified staff were affecting their ability to meet the  narrowbanding deadlines. For example, they said additional staff are  needed to design systems using the smaller amount of bandwidth and to  find and request the needed frequencies. Finally, several officials stated  that the commercial sector would be unable to provide them all the  narrowbanding equipment and support needed to continue their operations  even if the money was available. On June 26, 2002, NTIA requested that  federal agencies provide the status of their compliance with the  narrowbanding requirements.", "Another example of problems in implementing spectrum-efficient  technologies involves a technique known as trunking. Trunking systems  conserve spectrum by enabling users to share a common set of voice radio  channels rather than have their own dedicated channels that may not be  heavily used at all times. NTIA sponsored a pilot trunking program for  federal agencies in the early 1990s that included six cities. According to  NTIA, some agencies resisted the program because, although spectrum  could be conserved, the agencies found that it was more costly to  participate in trunking than it was to use their own channels. In addition,  some agencies said the trunking systems did not meet their mission  needs. In 1993, NTIA insisted that the contracted system be used unless a  waiver had been approved for an economic and/or technical exemption.", "NTIA noted that the program has only been successful in Washington, D.C.,  where agency demand for frequency assignments, and therefore spectrum  congestion, is extremely high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unclear Whether Spectrum Management Fees Provide an Incentive for Efficient Spectrum Use", "paragraphs": ["NTIA told us that the congressionally-mandated spectrum management  fees agencies pay help promote spectrum efficiency by providing federal  users with an incentive to return frequency assignments that they no longer  need. These fees are designed to recover part of the costs of NTIA\u2019s  spectrum management function. The fees began in 1996 and amounted to  about $50 per frequency assignment in 2001. NTIA decided to base the fee  on the number of assignments authorized per agency instead of the amount  of spectrum used per agency because the number of assignments better  reflects the amount of work NTIA must do for each agency. Moreover,  NTIA stated that this fee structure provides a wider distribution of cost to  the agencies. For example, basing the fee on the amount of bandwidth used  would have resulted in the Air Force paying the majority of the fees  because of the large amount of spectrum used by the radar systems they  operate.", "Although NTIA officials said that spectrum fees provide an incentive for  agencies to relinquish assignments, it is not clear how much this promotes  efficient use of spectrum. Officials from two agencies said that the financial  costs were not high enough to cause them to decrease the number of  frequency assignments they retained. Specifically, officials from one of the  agencies said that the amount of money paid in spectrum fees was a small  share of the money needed to operate a radio system. In addition, agencies  may be able to reduce assignments without returning spectrum. For  example, a spectrum manager for a federal agency said that the spectrum  fee has caused the agency to reduce redundant assignments, but that it has  not affected the efficiency of the agency\u2019s spectrum use because the agency  did not return any spectrum to NTIA as a result of reducing its assignments.", "Other countries are moving toward using payment mechanisms for  government spectrum users that are specifically designed to encourage  efficiency, rather than to recover the cost of managing the spectrum.

However, some  federal agencies are not conducting comprehensive reviews of their  frequency assignments. Compounding this problem is NTIA\u2019s  discontinuation of two spectrum-monitoring programs that helped promote  accountability by verifying that federal agencies were using their spectrum  assignments as specified. Federal agencies and NTIA primarily attributed  the lack of comprehensive reviews and the discontinuation of NTIA  monitoring programs to staffing and resource issues. The result of these  limitations is that the federal government does not have the information  necessary to assure that federal agencies are using only as much spectrum  as needed to fulfill their mission requirements. Moreover, even if additional  resources became available to enable agencies to conduct reviews to  determine how effectively they are using spectrum available to them, it is  unclear if this alone could ensure the efficient use of hundreds of  thousands of federal spectrum assignments.

The major parts and uses of the spectrum are as  follows:  The lower frequency waves (including very low frequency , low  frequency , and medium frequency ) are located from 3  kilohertz (kHz) to 3 megahertz (MHz). They tend to travel along the  ground and penetrate water and solid objects. Uses include submarine  communication and AM radio.", "High frequency (HF) waves are located from 3 MHz to 30 MHz.

Further, Congress had become concerned with other issues  related to spectrum use, such as vested rights in the spectrum, the basis or  criteria for granting licenses, and the potential monopoly in radio  equipment manufacturing. Five years in the making, the Radio Act of 1927  was enacted with two key provisions: the creation of a new government  commission to manage nongovernment spectrum use, and the adoption of  the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity\u201d standard for licensing.", "Concerns about placing all regulatory authority for radio licensing in one  individual, such as the Secretary of Commerce, led to the adoption of a  compromise\u2014the creation of the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), a five- member independent regulatory agency with licensing authority for  nongovernment stations for a period of one year. After 1 year, as originally  enacted, licensing authority would revert back to the Secretary of  Commerce and the FRC would serve as an appellate body. Among the  responsibilities assigned to the FRC were the following: issuing station  licenses, classifying radio stations, assigning frequencies, describing types  of service, preventing interference, establishing power and location of  transmitters, and establishing coverage areas.
