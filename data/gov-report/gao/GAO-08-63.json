State proposes to charge $45 for the card, which would include a $25 execution fee. Acceptance facilities, including State's passport offices, as well as post offices and state courts, execute passport applications on State's behalf, and retain this fee. GAO was asked to examine (1) the factors State considered when setting the proposed fee and (2) how execution cost data were developed. GAO reviewed current laws that authorize the setting of fees and met with State officials to determine how they set the execution fee.

State has proposed to reduce the current execution fee from $30 to $25, which would help the department to issue a lower cost passport card that meets the new documentation requirements. Consular officials told GAO that State made a commitment to Congress to issue a document that would be, at most, one-half the price of the current passport book, which costs $97 for first time, adult applicants. To do this, State needed to reduce its fees, including the execution fee. Consular officials stated that State did not want to reduce the execution fee below $25 because it wanted to recover its costs, which it estimated at $24.36 per execution. In addition, the fee needed to be high enough to avoid jeopardizing State's relationship with acceptance facilities, on which State depends to provide passport services. State concluded that $25 would compensate acceptance facilities based, in part, on data from USPS that initially indicated its passport execution costs were about $19, as well as a projected increase in application volume. USPS later told State that the $19 figure did not include additional indirect costs. GAO found that State's most recent cost of service study, which estimated passport execution costs, lacked documentation of key decisions. Rigorous documentation increases an estimate's credibility and helps support an organization's decision-making process. Documentation of cost estimates should explicitly identify the primary methods, calculations, results, and rationales or assumptions. State was not able to provide documentation of critical components of the study's methodology. For example, consular officials could not provide details of its survey used to estimate the time it takes to execute a passport, including how the data was used to arrive at the final time estimate.

Prior to this legislation, U.S. citizens did not need a  passport to enter the United States if they were traveling from Canada,  Mexico, the Caribbean, or Bermuda. DHS and State implemented this  requirement for airports on January 23, 2007, and are to implement the  requirement for land and sea ports before June 1, 2009 (see fig. 2 for key  dates in WHTI implementation). The departments have indicated that  they will begin to phase in the requirement for land and sea ports in 2008.", "The current passport book fee is $97 for first time, adult applicants (16  years and older).

Thus, in October 2006, State announced  plans to produce a passport card as a lower cost means of establishing  citizenship and identity for U.S. citizens. For the passport card, State has  proposed to charge $45, which includes a $25 execution fee. The current  execution fee is $30 for passport books.

Consular officials told us that they considered several factors when setting  the proposed execution fee. These include:    Commitment to Congress to issue a low-cost document. According to  consular officials, the department made a commitment to issue an  alternative document to meet WHTI requirements that would be, at most,  one-half the cost of the passport book, which currently costs $97.", "State\u2019s estimates of its passport execution costs. State, through an  independent contractor, conducts cost studies for its consular services,  including passport execution, to determine the full costs for providing  these services. Consular officials stated that the department\u2019s policy is to  review these fees on a periodic basis, rather than biennially, due to the  length of time it takes to complete the cost of service studies. State\u2019s  most recent cost of service study estimated the full costs for execution  services to the department for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to be $24.36.  Because OMB guidance states that subject to exceptions, user charges will  be sufficient to recover the full cost to the federal government, consular  officials told us that the department decided to not lower the execution  fee below the amount estimated in the most recent cost of service study.", "Maintaining State\u2019s network of acceptance facilities. According to  consular officials, State wanted to ensure that, while the cost of the  passport card was lower than the cost for the current passport book, that  its execution fee was not so low that it jeopardized State\u2019s relationship  with its network of acceptance facilities, on which the department  depends to provide passport services to U.S. citizens. State has seen an  increase in passport demand from a base level of 7 million passports  issued in 2003 to an expected more than 17 million issuances in fiscal year  2007. Based, in part, on these data, consular officials concluded that,  even with the reduced execution fee, the department and its acceptance  facilities could continue to expect additional funds from passport services.", "Figure 3 shows that, historically, passport execution fees have been higher  than State\u2019s estimated costs. For example, in 2002, State set the execution  fee at $30 based on a cost estimate of $16.20. Consular officials told us  that, based on policy considerations, there are certain services for which  State does not charge a fee or the fee covers only a portion of the cost of  the service. For example, State may not charge a passport fee from certain  relatives of a deceased member of the Armed Forces proceeding abroad to  visit the grave or to attend a funeral or memorial service for that member.  Consular officials stated that their general management practice has been  to round cost estimates for some services up to cover the cost of those  services for which the public is not charged.", "In 2005, State kept the passport execution fee at $30 based on the $24.36  cost of service study estimate. For the passport card, State only rounded  up its cost estimate to the nearest dollar to help reduce the total cost of  the card."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Considered Information from USPS", "paragraphs": ["Based on a 2000 interagency agreement, consular officials consider cost  information from USPS in setting passport execution fees. In a fiscal year  2001 internal cost study, USPS estimated that its costs were about $13 per  passport. In April 2006, using this study as a baseline, USPS notified  Congress that its projected costs for fiscal year 2005 had increased to  about $19 per passport. According to consular officials, over the next  several months, State and USPS met to discuss the Service\u2019s estimated  passport execution costs. Then, in early August 2006, USPS sent a letter to  State to notify the department that its initial estimate of $19 did not  include a contribution to institutional costs that USPS applies to postal  and nonpostal products and services. According to USPS, its average  contribution to institutional costs was approximately 76 percent of  directly attributed costs. Using this average, USPS told State that its full  costs for passport execution for fiscal year 2005 would total about $33 per  execution (see table 3)\u2014about $19 for costs directly attributable to  passport execution and $14 for institutional cost coverage. USPS\u2019s 2001  study did not address institutional costs. Consular officials stated that  State did not receive more detailed information about USPS\u2019s internal cost  study or how the cost estimates were developed.", "A number of factors affecting costs may have changed since USPS\u2019s 2001  cost study, and USPS did not take these changes into account when  projecting passport execution costs for fiscal year 2005. For example, the  estimates that USPS provided to Congress and State did not account for  the projected increase in passport application volume or the growth in  active postal acceptance facilities. As a result, it is unclear whether USPS\u2019s  estimate accurately reflects its costs.", "In late August 2006, State notified USPS that it had decided to propose a  $25 execution fee, which was higher than the directly attributable costs for  passport execution services that USPS reported to Congress in April 2006  (see fig. 4 for a time line of communication involving State and USPS on  this issue). Regarding the additional contribution to institutional overhead,  USPS officials told us that they have some flexibility in the percentage of  institutional costs that the Service assigns to each of its products, in  general, including the percentage used to calculate the passport execution  cost estimate provided to State, specifically. For example, in fiscal year  2006, USPS charged an additional 14 percent of its direct and indirect  costs for insured services to cover the institutional cost assigned to this  service, and 197 percent for presorted, first class letter mail. As of August  2007, USPS officials stated that they have agreed, in principle, to State\u2019s  proposed $25 execution fee.", "State notified its network of acceptance facilities in early 2006 that the  department would be proposing a lower execution fee. However, State did  not seek cost information from nonpostal acceptance facilities. According  to State officials, nonpostal acceptance facilities are not organized in a  way that would make systematic data collection feasible.

Regarding the  passport execution fee, State considered execution cost estimates from its  2004 cost of service study as part of the fee-setting process for the  passport card. We found that this study lacked documentation to justify  key decisions the contractor made when estimating passport execution  costs. We found the following examples:    Estimates of the resources associated with passport execution (both  direct and indirect costs) were integral to the contractor\u2019s calculation of  State\u2019s cost of providing this service. At the time of the 2004 cost of  service study, however, State\u2019s financial systems and processes did not  provide managerial cost information for its activities, such as the full cost  of the department\u2019s passport activities. Thus, State was not able to obtain  necessary cost information directly from the department\u2019s financial system  and made numerous assumptions to estimate the aggregate cost of  consular activities, including the passport execution costs. State\u2019s  contractor used baseline obligations data from fiscal year 2002 to estimate  passport execution costs for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 ($24.36).

Therefore, to estimate the time generally associated with execution  services that State provides, the contractor visited several post offices in  the Washington, D.C., area, and performed time in motion studies at these  facilities. Using the time estimates gathered at the post offices as a proxy,  the contractor concluded that it took State an average of 7.63 minutes for  each passport execution. However, State could not provide documentation  regarding the number, type, and location of post offices visited or detailed  results of the contractor\u2019s time in motion studies.
