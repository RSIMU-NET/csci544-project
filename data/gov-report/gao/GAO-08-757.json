In testing ports of entry, undercover investigators carried counterfeit drivers' licenses, birth certificates, employee identification cards, and other documents, presented themselves at ports of entry and sought admittance to the United States dozens of times. They arrived in rental cars, on foot, by boat, and by airplane. They attempted to enter in four states on the northern border (Washington, New York, Michigan, and Idaho), three states on the southern border (California, Arizona, and Texas), and two other states requiring international air travel (Florida and Virginia). In nearly every case, government inspectors accepted oral assertions and counterfeit identification provided by GAO investigators as proof of U.S. citizenship and allowed them to enter the country. In total, undercover investigators made 42 crossings with a 93 percent success rate. On several occasions, while entering by foot from Mexico and by boat from Canada, investigators were not even asked to show identification. For example, at one border crossing in Texas in 2006, an undercover investigator attempted to show a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer his counterfeit driver's license, but the officer said, \"That's fine, you can go\" without looking at it. As a result of these tests, GAO concluded that terrorists could use counterfeit identification to pass through most of the tested ports of entry with little chance of being detected. In its most recent work, GAO shifted its focus from ports of entry and primarily performed limited security assessments of unmanned and unmonitored areas between ports of entry. The names of the states GAO visited for this limited security assessment have been withheld at the request of CBP. In four states along the U.S.-Canada border, GAO found state roads that were very close to the border that CBP did not appear to monitor. In three states, the proximity of the road to the border allowed investigators to cross undetected, successfully simulating the cross-border movement of radioactive materials or other contraband into the United States from Canada. For example, in one apparently unmanned, unmonitored area on the northern border, the U.S. Border Patrol was alerted to GAO's activities through the tip of an alert citizen. However, the responding U.S. Border Patrol agents were not able to locate the investigators and their simulated contraband. Also on the northern border, GAO investigators located several ports of entry in one state on the northern border that had posted daytime hours and were unmanned overnight. Investigators observed that surveillance equipment was in operation, but that the only preventive measure to stop an individual from crossing the border into the United States was a barrier across the road that could be driven around. GAO also identified potential security vulnerabilities on federally managed lands adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border. GAO concluded that CBP faces significant challenges on the northern border, and that a determined cross-border violator would likely be able to bring radioactive materials or other contraband undetected into the United States by crossing the U.S.-Canada border at any of the assessed locations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Intelligence officials believe that the United States will face a persistent  and evolving terrorist threat and that the terrorist group al Qaeda will  intensify its efforts to put operatives here.

The vulnerabilities are related to traveler screening and border- protection efforts that were consolidated under Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), a component of the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), in March 2003. Our first two testimonies were focused on covert  testing at ports of entry\u2014the air, sea, and land locations where  international travelers can legally enter the United States.

To  summarize our work, we reviewed our prior testimonies and the work  papers associated with them. We also requested information in writing  from DHS related to recent efforts to secure U.S. borders and address the  vulnerabilities highlighted by our work.", "For our testing at ports of entry, we entered the states of Washington,  Idaho, Michigan, and New York from Canada; the states of California,  Arizona, and Texas from Mexico; the state of Florida from Jamaica; and  the state of Virginia from the Bahamas. To create counterfeit documents  we used software, hardware, and materials that are available to the public.  The tested ports of entry were a nonrepresentative selection we identified  using publicly available information. Because we tested a  nonrepresentative selection, it is not possible to project the results of our  work to any other ports of entry. The unmanned and unmonitored border  areas we visited were defined as locations where CBP does not maintain a  manned presence 24 hours per day or where there was no apparent  monitoring equipment in place. We performed limited security  assessments at a nonrepresentative selection of these locations and did  not attempt to evaluate all potential U.S. border security vulnerabilities.  Where possible, and at your request, investigators attempted to simulate  the cross-border movement of radioactive materials or other contraband  to highlight the severity of the vulnerability at these border areas.

When CBP was created, it represented a merger of components from three  agencies\u2014the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service (INS), and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, its implementing  regulations, and CBP policies and procedures, CBP officers are required to  establish, at a minimum, the nationality of individuals and whether they  are eligible to enter the country at ports of entry. All international travelers  attempting to enter the country through ports of entry undergo primary  inspection, which is a preliminary screening procedure to identify those  legitimate international travelers who can readily be identified as  admissible.", "Regarding land ports of entry, the United States shares over 5,000 miles of  border with Canada to the north (including the state of Alaska), and 1,900  miles of border with Mexico to the south. Individuals attempting to legally  enter the United States by land present themselves to a CBP officer at one  of the 170 ports of entry located along these borders. During the period of  our investigations, U.S. citizens could gain entry to the United States by  establishing their citizenship to the satisfaction of U.S. officials at a land  port of entry. While this frequently involved a citizen presenting their birth  certificate, photo identification (e.g., a driver\u2019s license), or baptismal  records, the law did not require U.S. citizens to present any of these  documents as proof of citizenship. Until recently, U.S. citizens could enter  the country at land ports of entry based only on oral statements. However,  as of January 31, 2008, U.S. citizens age 19 and older are required, under  the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, to present both proof of identity  and citizenship when attempting to enter the United States by land.  Documents that would fulfill this requirement could include a passport, a  military ID with travel orders, or an enhanced driver\u2019s license. In the  absence of a single document that establishes both proof of identity and  citizenship, U.S. citizens require multiple documents, such as a driver\u2019s  license and a birth certificate, to enter the United States. Requirements for  entering the United States by sea are similar to those for entering by land.  Regarding air ports of entry, starting on January 23, 2007, U.S. citizens  were required, under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, to present  a passport or secure travel document when entering the United States.  Prior to the implementation of this initiative, U.S. citizens entering the  country by air from such locations as the Bahamas, Mexico, and Jamaica  could establish their citizenship by oral assertions and documents such as  drivers\u2019 licenses and birth certificates.", "It is illegal to enter the United States at any location other than a port of  entry. The U.S. Border Patrol, a component of CBP, patrols and monitors  areas between ports of entry. However, given limited resources and the  wide expanse of the border, the U.S. Border Patrol is limited in its ability  to monitor the border either through use of technology or with a  consistent manned presence. Commensurate with its perception of the  threat, CBP has distributed human resources differently on the northern  border than it has on the southern border. According to CBP, as of May  2007, it had 972 U.S. Border Patrol agents assigned to the northern border  and 11,986 agents assigned to the southern border. The number of agents  actually providing border protection at any given time is far smaller than  these figures suggest. As mentioned above, in the September 2007 hearing  on border security before your Committee, a CBP official stated that  roughly 250 U.S. Border Patrol agents were patrolling the U.S.\u2013Canada  border at any given time\u2014about a quarter of all agents reportedly assigned  to patrol the northern border during that period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Vulnerabilities at U.S. Ports of Entry", "paragraphs": ["We found two types of security vulnerabilities in our covert testing at ports  of entry.

Second, we found that government officials did not  always ask for identification. Although it was not a requirement for  government officials to ask for identification at the time we performed our  tests, we concluded that this was a major vulnerability that could allow  terrorists or other criminals to easily enter the country.", "In table 1 below, each individual instance of an investigator crossing the  border is noted separately, although, in some cases, investigators crossed  the border in groups of two or more.", "We consider our attempts to enter the country through sea and air ports of  entry as different from our land crossings.

Similar  follow-up work was performed throughout 2003 and 2004, resulting in  successful entry at locations in Washington, New York, California, Texas,  and Virginia using counterfeit identification. In 2006, investigators  successfully entered the United States using counterfeit drivers\u2019 licenses  and other bogus documentation through seven land ports of entry on the  northern and southern borders, adding the states of Michigan, Idaho, and  Arizona to the list of states they had entered.", "In the majority of cases, investigators entered the country by land using  rental cars. When requested, they displayed counterfeit Virginia and West  Virginia drivers\u2019 licenses and birth certificates to the government officials  at ports of entry. They also used bogus U.S. passports and, in one case, a  fake employee identification card in the name of a major U.S. airline.  Government officials typically inspected the documentation while  inquiring whether our undercover investigators were U.S. citizens. On  some occasions, the officials asked whether our investigators had  purchased anything in Canada or Mexico. In several instances, CBP  officials asked our investigators to leave their vehicles and inspected the  vehicles; they appeared to be searching for evidence of smuggling.

Our investigators\u2019 oral assertions that they were U.S. citizens  satisfied the INS inspectors and they were allowed to enter the country.  Later, while conducting our 2006 covert tests, we found that CBP officers  did not request identification during several foot crossings from Mexico.  For example, on February 23, 2006, two investigators crossed the border  from Mexico into Texas on foot. When the first investigator arrived at the  port of entry, he was waved through without being asked to show  identification. At this point, the investigator asked the CBP officer whether  he wished to see any identification.

They had received a phone call in advance from another  investigator who had crossed the border earlier using genuine  identification. He said that the CBP officers on duty had swiped his  driver\u2019s license through a scanning machine. Because the counterfeit  drivers\u2019 licenses the other two investigators were carrying had fake  magnetic strips, the investigators realized they could be questioned by  CBP officers if their identification cards did not scan properly. When the  two investigators arrived at the port of entry, they engaged one of the  officers in conversation to distract him from scanning their drivers\u2019  licenses. After a few moments, the CBP officer asked the investigators if  they were both U.S. citizens. They said, \u201cyes.\u201d He then asked the  investigators if they had purchased anything in Mexico, and they  responded, \u201cno.\u201d The CBP officer then said, \u201cHave a nice day\u201d and allowed  them to enter the United States.

While conducting testing  at U.S.\u2013Canada ports of entry, we found that one of our investigators was  able to walk into the United States from Canada at a park straddling the  border. The investigator was not stopped or questioned by law  enforcement personnel from either Canada or the United States. In our  September 2007 testimony, we reported on similar vulnerabilities at  unmanned and unmonitored locations on the northern and southern  borders. The unmanned and unmonitored border areas we visited were  defined as locations where CBP does not maintain a manned presence 24  hours per day or where there was no apparent monitoring equipment in  place.

We identified state roads close to the border that appeared  to be unmanned and unmonitored, allowing us to simulate the cross- border movement of radioactive materials or other contraband from  Canada into the United States. For example, on October 31, 2006, our  investigators positioned themselves on opposite sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada  border in an unmanned location. Our investigators selected this location  because roads on either side of the border would allow them to quickly  and easily exchange simulated contraband. After receiving a signal by cell  phone, the investigator in Canada left his vehicle and walked  approximately 25 feet to the border carrying a red duffel bag. While  investigators on the U.S. side took photographs and made a digital video  recording, the individual with the duffel bag proceeded the remaining 50  feet, transferred the duffel bag to the investigators on the U.S. side, and  returned to his vehicle on the Canadian side. The set up and exchange  lasted approximately 10 minutes, during which time the investigators were  in view of residents both on the Canadian and U.S. sides of the border.  According to CBP records of this incident, an alert citizen notified the U.S.  Border Patrol about the suspicious activities of our investigators. The U.S.  Border Patrol subsequently attempted to search for a vehicle matching the  description of the rental vehicle our investigators used. However, the U.S.  Border Patrol was not able to locate the investigators with the duffel bag,  even though they had parked nearby to observe traffic passing through the  port of entry.", "See figure 1 for a photograph of our investigator crossing the northern  border at another unmanned, unmonitored location on the northern  border with simulated contraband.", "In contrast to our observations on the northern border, our investigators  observed a large law enforcement and Army National Guard presence near  a state road on the southern border, including unmanned aerial vehicles.  On October 17, 2006, two of our investigators left a main U.S. route about a  quarter mile from a U.S.\u2013Mexico port of entry. Traveling on a dirt road that  parallels the border, our investigators used a GPS system to get as close to  the border as possible. Our investigators passed U.S. Border Patrol agents  and U.S. Army National Guard units. In addition, our investigators spotted  unmanned aerial vehicles and a helicopter flying parallel to the border. At  the point where the dirt road ran closest to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, our  investigators spotted additional U.S. Border Patrol vehicles parked in a  covered position. About three-fourths of a mile from these vehicles, our  investigators pulled off the road. One investigator exited the vehicle and  proceeded on foot through several gulches and gullies toward the Mexican  border. His intent was to find out whether he would be questioned by law  enforcement agents about his activities. He returned to the vehicle after 15  minutes, at which time our investigators returned to the main road. Our  investigators did not observe any public traffic on this road for the 1 hour  that they were in the area, but none of the law enforcement units  attempted to stop our investigators and find out what they were doing.

Our investigators were informed by an employee of a  visitor center that because the U.S. government was building a fence, the  road was closed to the public. However, our investigators proceeded to  the road and found that it was not physically closed. While driving west  along this road, our investigators did not observe any surveillance cameras  or law enforcement vehicles. A 4-foot-high fence (appropriate to prevent  the movement of a vehicle rather than a person) stood at the location of  the border. Our investigators pulled over to the side of the road at one  location.
