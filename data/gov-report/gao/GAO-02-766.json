GAO found no comprehensive or centralized data on enforcement results under the federal Identity Theft Act. However, according to a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, federal prosecutors are using the 1998 federal law. As with the federal act, GAO found no centralized or comprehensive data on enforcement results under state identity theft statutes. However, officials in the 10 states selected for study provided examples of actual investigations or prosecutions under these statutes. Generally, the prevalence of identity theft and the frequently multi- or cross-jurisdictional nature of such a crime underscore the importance of promoting cooperation or coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. One of the most commonly used means of coordination, task forces, can have participating agencies from all levels of law enforcement and, in some instances, can have participants from banks and other private sector entities. Although the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General fraud hotline annually receives thousands of allegations involving either (1) SSN misuse or (2) program fraud with SSN misuse potential, the agency concentrates its investigative resources on the latter category of allegations because the protection of the Social Security trust funds is a priority."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we review federal and state efforts to address identity theft, which has been characterized by law enforcement as the fastest growing type of crime in the United States. As noted in our May 1998 report, identity theft or identity fraud generally involves \u201cstealing\u201d another person\u2019s personal identifying information\u2014 such as Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and mother\u2019s maiden name\u2014and then using the information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or take over existing financial accounts. Later that year, Congress passed the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 (the Identity Theft Act). Enacted in October 1998, the federal statute made identity theft a separate crime against the person whose identity was stolen, broadened the scope of the offense to include the misuse of information as well as documents, and provided punishment\u2014generally a fine or imprisonment for up to 15 years or both. Also, since 1998, most states have enacted laws that criminalize identity theft. Thus, various federal and numerous state and local law enforcement agencies are responsible for investigating identity theft crimes. Relevant federal agencies include the Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Postal Inspection Service, as well as the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Office of the Inspector General (OIG), which receives SSN misuse and other identity theft-related allegations on its fraud hotline.", "The passage of federal and state identity theft legislation indicates that this type of crime has been widely recognized as a serious problem across the nation. Now, a current focus for policymakers and criminal justice administrators is to ensure that these laws are effectively enforced.", "Specifically, in response to your request, this report provides information on law enforcement results (such as examples of prosecutions and convictions) under the federal Identity Theft Act; law enforcement results under state statutes that, similar to the federal act, provide state and local law enforcement officials with the tools to prosecute and convict identity theft criminals; the means used to promote cooperation or coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in addressing identity theft crimes that span multiple jurisdictions; and   actions taken by the SSA/OIG to resolve SSN misuse and other identity theft-related allegations received during fiscal year 1999.", "To address these questions, we interviewed responsible officials and reviewed documentation obtained from the Department of Justice and its components, including the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) and the FBI; the Department of the Treasury and its components, including the Secret Service and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the SSA/OIG; and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Also, we conducted a literature search to obtain examples of cases prosecuted under the federal Identity Theft Act. Regarding state and local law enforcement efforts, we focused on 10 states\u2014Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin\u2014which we judgmentally selected on the basis of having either the highest incidences of reported identity theft or the longest-standing applicable statutes. We conducted our work from July 2001 to May 2002 in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Appendix I presents more details about the scope and methodology of our work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the federal Identity Theft Act, a criminal offense is committed if a person \u201cknowingly transfers or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law \u2026\u201d The relevant section of this legislation is codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7)(\u201cfraud and related activity in connection with identification documents and information\u201d). According to an analysis of the new law by the United States Sentencing Commission:  Before passage of the 1998 act, the unauthorized use or transfer of identity documents was illegal under title 18 of the U.S. Code, section 1028\u2014which included subsections (a)(1) through (a)(6). The unauthorized use of credit cards, personal identification numbers, automated teller machine codes, and other electronic access devices was illegal under another section of the U.S. Code\u2014that is, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029 (\u201cfraud and related activity in connection with access devices\u201d).", "The addition of subsection (a)(7) to section 1028 expanded the definition of \u201cmeans of identification\u201d to include such information as SSN and other government identification numbers, dates of birth, and unique biometric data (e.g., fingerprints), as well as electronic access devices and routing codes used in the financial and telecommunications sectors.", "Under the Identity Theft Act, the new definition of means of identification includes prior statutory definitions of \u201cidentification documents.\u201d", "According to the United States Sentencing Commission, a key impact is to make the proscriptions of the new identity theft law applicable to a wide range of offense conduct, which can be independently prosecuted under numerous existing statutes. That is, any unauthorized use of means of identification can now be charged either as a violation of the new law or in conjunction with other federal statutes.", "In further elaboration of the breadth of the definition of means of identification and its impact, the Sentencing Commission\u2019s analysis noted the following:   The new law covers offense conduct already covered by a multitude of other federal statutes. The unauthorized use of credit cards, for instance, is already prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, but now also can be prosecuted under the newly enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7).", "Other examples of offense conduct include providing a false SSN or other identification number to obtain a tax refund and presenting false passports or immigration documents by using the names and addresses and photos of lawful residents or citizens to enter the United States.", "In total, according to the Sentencing Commission, the violation of some 180 federal criminal statutes can potentially fall within the ambit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7).", "Regarding state statutes, at the time of our 1998 report, only a few states had specific laws to address identity theft. Now, as table 1 shows, 44 states have specific laws that address identity theft, and 5 other states have laws that cover activities included within the definition of identity theft. Almost one-half (22) of these 49 states enacted relevant laws in 1999. According to FTC\u2019s analysis, identity theft can be a felony offense in 45 of the 49 states that have laws to address this crime.", "In the view of Justice Department Criminal Division officials, the enactment of state identity theft laws has multi-jurisdictional benefits to all levels of law enforcement\u2014federal, state, and local. In explanation, Justice officials commented that the various state statutes, coupled with the federal statute, provide a broader framework for addressing identity theft, particularly when a multi-agency task force approach is used. The Justice officials noted, for instance, that it is very plausible for a task force to generate multiple cases, some of which can result in federal prosecutions and others in state or local prosecutions.", "Generally, law enforcement agencies widely acknowledge that SSNs often are used as identifiers by thieves to obtain or \u201cbreed\u201d other identification documentation. Through its fraud hotline, SSA/OIG annually receives thousands of allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse. Most of these allegations are classified by SSA/OIG as involving either (1) SSN misuse or (2) program fraud that may contain elements of SSN misuse. In these two categories, SSA/OIG received about 62,000 allegations in fiscal year 1999, about 83,000 allegations in fiscal year 2000, and about 104,000 allegations in fiscal year 2001. SSA/OIG officials explained these two categories of allegations as follows:   Allegations of \u201cSSN misuse\u201d include, for example, incidents where a criminal uses the SSN of another individual for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining credit, establishing utility services, or acquiring goods. SSNs are also misused to violate immigration laws, flee the criminal justice system by assuming a new identity, or obtain personal information to stalk an individual. Generally, this category of allegations does not directly involve SSA program benefits.", "On the other hand, allegations of fraud in SSA programs for the aged, survivors, or disabled often entail some element of SSN misuse. For example, a criminal may use the victim\u2019s SSN or other identifying information for the purpose of obtaining Social Security benefits. When hotline staff receive this type of allegation, it is to be classified under the appropriate category of program fraud.", "In 1999, SSA/OIG analyzed a sample of SSN misuse allegations and determined that about 82 percent of such allegations related directly to identity theft. The analysis covered a statistical sample of 400 allegations from a universe of 16,375 allegations received by the fraud hotline from October 1997 through March 1999. The analysis did not cover the other category mentioned previously, that is, allegations of program-related fraud with SSN misuse potential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Comprehensive Data on Law Enforcement Results under the Federal Identity Theft Act, but Case Examples Illustrate Use of the Law", "paragraphs": ["There are no comprehensive statistics on the number of investigations, convictions, or other law enforcement results under the Identity Theft Act. As noted in our March 2002 report, federal law enforcement agencies generally do not have information systems that facilitate specific tracking of identity theft cases. For example, while the amendments made by the Identity Theft Act are included as subsection (a)(7) of section 1028, Title 18 of the U.S. Code, EOUSA does not have comprehensive statistics on offenses charged specifically under that subsection. EOUSA officials explained that, except for certain firearms statutes, staff are required to record cases only to the U.S. Code section, not the subsection or the sub- subsection.", "Given the absence of comprehensive statistics, we obtained relevant anecdotes or examples of actual investigations and prosecutions under the federal statute. For instance, about 2 years after passage of the Identity Theft Act, a senior Department of Justice official testified at a May 2001 congressional hearing that U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the nation were making substantial use of the new federal law that recognized identity theft as a separate crime. In testimony, the Justice official said that federal prosecutors had used the new statute\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7)\u2014in at least 92 cases to date. One example cited in the testimony involved a defendant who stole private bank account information about an insurance company\u2019s policyholders and used that information to withdraw funds from the accounts of the policyholders and deposit approximately 4,300 counterfeit bank drafts totaling more than $764,000. The case was prosecuted in the Central District of California. The defendant pled guilty to identity theft and related charges and was sentenced to 27 months of imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release.", "Another case cited by the Justice official illustrates that identity theft crimes can have fact-pattern elements encompassing more than one jurisdiction. The case involved a California resident, who committed fraudulent acts in the state of Washington by, among other means, using a Massachusetts driver\u2019s license bearing the name of an actual person not associated with the criminal activities. Also, this case further illustrates that identity theft is rarely a stand-alone crime; rather, it frequently is a component of one or more white-collar or financial crimes, such as bank fraud, credit card or access device fraud, or wire fraud. Pertinent details of this case, prosecuted in the Western District of Washington, are as follows:   Over a period of time in 1999 and 2000, the defendant and other conspirators assumed the identities of third persons without their consent and authorization and fraudulently used the SSNs and names of actual persons. Also, the conspirators created false identity documents, such as state identification cards, driver\u2019s licenses, and immigration cards. Using the identities and names of third persons, the conspirators opened banking and investment accounts at numerous locations and obtained credit cards.", "The defendant and other conspirators presented and deposited at least 12 counterfeit checks (valued in excess of $1 million) to various banks and investment companies in western Washington. Also, the conspirators purchased legitimate cashiers checks, in nominal amounts, and then altered them to reflect substantially greater amounts. The conspirators presented or deposited at least five altered checks (worth almost $350,000) in the Seattle area.", "According to Justice, in July 2000, the defendant pled guilty to committing three felony counts of identity theft, conspiring to commit wire fraud involving attempted losses in excess of $1 million, and using an unauthorized credit card.", "During our current review, Justice Department Criminal Division officials told us that federal prosecutors consider the Identity Theft Act to be a very useful statute. The officials said, for instance, that prosecutors endorse the statute because it provides broad jurisdiction. Further, the Justice officials noted that the Identity Theft Act provides another tool for prosecutors to use, even though in many instances the defendants may be charged under other white-collar crime statutes. The officials explained that identity theft is rarely a stand-alone crime. Thus, cases involving identity theft or identity fraud may have charges under a variety of different statutes relating to these defendants\u2019 other crimes, such as bank fraud, credit card fraud, or mail fraud. Appendix II summarizes selected federal cases prosecuted for such multiple charges, including charges of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Comprehensive Data on Enforcement Results under State Identity Theft Statutes, but Case Examples Illustrate Use of Such Laws", "paragraphs": ["As with the federal Identity Theft Act, we found no centralized or comprehensive data on enforcement results under state identity theft statutes.
