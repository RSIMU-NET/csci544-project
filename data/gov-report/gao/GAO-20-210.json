GAO found other limited information about these topics on IRS's website. With only about 2 percent of IRAs invested in unconventional assets, adding more pages to Publications 590-A and 590-B may not be practical.

Whereas IRS relies on automated enforcement for IRAs invested in conventional assets held by custodians and trustees, enforcement for IRAs invested in unconventional assets or under IRA owner control requires labor-intensive audits of individual taxpayers. Using newly compiled information, IRS identified about 2 million IRAs that held certain types of hard-to-value assets as of 2016; however, about 20 percent of the forms were missing fair market value amounts for these assets (see fig.).", "IRS officials said this type of reporting alone may be inadequate for audit selection and identifying potentially abusive IRAs. When IRS lacks sufficient data to detect abusive transactions, IRS can require taxpayers to self-report certain transactions that have been used by other taxpayers to avoid taxes. Additional taxpayer or custodian disclosure of potentially abusive IRA transactions coupled with IRS analysis of reported details may help IRS to select IRA owner tax returns to audit.", "Fragmented responsibility among IRS divisions creates challenges for examiners who need to share expertise and collaborate on IRA enforcement. The division responsible for tax-exempt entities trains its examiners on how to determine if an employee retirement plan has engaged in business activities subject to taxation.

Many  IRA owners choose to invest in publicly traded assets, such as stocks,  bonds, and mutual funds, through a bank or qualified firm that acts as a  trustee or custodian of those investments. Some IRA owners seek out  alternative investment opportunities in less conventional or nonpublicly  traded assets such as real estate, certain precious metals, private equity,  and virtual currency.

In June 2019,  we issued a separate report on IRS and Department of Labor (DOL)  collaboration on shared oversight of prohibited transaction rules for IRAs  and the DOL process for granting exemptions for prohibited IRA  transactions.

IRA owners are not permitted to engage in  prohibited transactions that personally benefit the owner or other  disqualified persons in a way other than as a vehicle to save for  retirement. Examples of such prohibited transactions include IRA  owners selling their own property to an IRA, or taking a salary from an  IRA-funded business. IRA owners who believe that an otherwise  prohibited transaction should be permitted, may apply to the  Department of Labor (DOL) to request an exemption for a specific  transaction.", "Unrelated business income. Earnings and profits made in tax- deferred savings vehicles like IRAs generally are reinvested in the  account without generating current federal tax liability, but  investments in certain unconventional assets can generate ongoing  tax liability for IRA owners.

Noncompliance risks for most contribution and distribution IRA rules  can be mitigated systemically through automated enforcement. For  example, IRS can detect excess IRA contribution deductions and  unreported IRA distributions by matching information from taxpayer  returns with information reported by custodians. For the large  population of IRA owners investing in conventional assets held by  custodians, IRS relies on automated enforcement.  2.  Noncompliance risks associated with the small population of IRAs  with hard-to-value unconventional assets or under direct control of the  IRA owner are generally mitigated through case-by-case audits. For  example, noncompliance with the complex rules governing prohibited  transactions and unrelated business income is generally not reflected  on individual tax returns. Some custodians rely on IRA owners to  provide asset value information and may not have complete and  accurate data to report to IRS.

For example, the job aides provide instructions on prohibited transactions,  barred collectibles, and FMV issues involving IRAs. When interviewing  taxpayers, examiners are instructed to ask a series of questions covering  subjects such as: what kind of advice the taxpayer received from promoters or  custodians of self-directed IRAs, whether the taxpayer had direct involvement in purchasing  unconventional assets through a control feature known as \u201ccheckbook  access,\u201d whether the taxpayer has a limited liability company (LLC) tied to the how the taxpayer determined the FMV of unconventional assets.", "IRS officials told us that enforcing rules associated with IRAs investing in  unconventional assets can be particularly challenging for investments  involving LLCs or special partnership arrangements. An IRA owner may  establish an LLC that is owned by the IRA. Once the LLC is set up, a  business checking account is linked to the IRA funds and the account  owner is named the manager of the LLC with control over the checkbook.  This allows IRA owners to purchase assets directly from investment  sponsors without having to wait for custodians to execute a purchase or  sale.", "The LLC may be used to invest in businesses that could generate  unrelated business income. According to IRS officials, prohibited  transactions may also be more likely to occur when custodians allow  \u201ccheckbook\u201d access to IRAs, in part because the marketing of this IRA  structure is appealing to individuals who want less oversight of their IRA  transactions and are more likely to intentionally engage in self-dealing  transactions.", "IRS examination officials told us that the 3-year statute of limitations for  assessing taxes owed remains an obstacle in pursuing noncompliance  that may span the many years of an IRA investment. For example,  abuses involving prohibited transactions frequently are not reflected on  any filed tax return and may be difficult to detect within the general 3-year  statute of limitations period. IRS agreed with our October 2014  recommendation for the Commissioner to work in consultation with the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) on a legislative proposal to  expand the statute of limitations on IRA noncompliance.

By assessing options for making  such information clearer, IRS could better inform taxpayers and help them  comply. This is particularly important because misunderstanding the rules  governing IRAs can result in increased tax liability for these taxpayers  and jeopardize their retirement savings.", "Noncompliance associated with nonpublicly traded IRA assets has been  difficult for IRS to detect and time consuming to pursue. In contrast to  automated enforcement for IRAs with conventional investments,  noncompliance involving IRAs with unconventional assets is generally  detected on a case-by-case basis through labor-intensive audits of  individual taxpayers. In recent years, IRS has begun collect information  from IRA custodians that IRS can use to quantify the dollar amounts of  specified types of hard-to-value assets held by IRAs.", "However, the broad IRA asset type data alone may not be sufficient for  audit selection and identifying potentially abusive IRAs in a timely  manner. When IRS lacks sufficient data to detect abusive transactions,  IRS can require taxpayers to self-report certain transactions that have  been used by other taxpayers to avoid taxes. Additional disclosure of  certain IRA transactions coupled with mining the narrative fields of tax  forms could help IRS to efficiently identify potentially abusive IRA activity  and better allocate limited audit resources.", "Fragmented responsibility among IRS operating divisions creates  additional challenges for IRA enforcement. The division responsible for  tax-exempt entities trains its examiners on how to determine if an  employee retirement plan has unrelated business activities subject to  taxation. Yet, examiners in the division that audits complex individual tax  returns, including those involving IRAs, do not receive similar training.  Training for those examiners on unrelated business income tax issues,  and how examiners can refer those cases to other divisions for  assistance, could help improve collaboration on IRA enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to IRS:  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should assess options for  updating Publications 590-A and 590-B to either include more information  or direct taxpayers to other resources for IRA owners with investments in  unconventional assets.
