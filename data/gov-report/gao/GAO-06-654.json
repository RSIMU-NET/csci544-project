Beneficiaries who enroll in Part D may choose a drug plan from those offered by private plan sponsors under contract to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Part D benefit. Beneficiaries have until May 15, 2006, to enroll in the Part D benefit and select a plan without the risk of penalties. GAO was asked to review the quality of CMS's communications on the Part D benefit. GAO examined 70 CMS publications to select 6 documents for review and contracted with the American Institutes for Research to evaluate the clarity of these texts; made 500 calls to the 1-800-MEDICARE help line; and contracted with the Nielsen Norman Group to evaluate the usability of the Medicare Web site."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The information given in the six sample documents that GAO reviewed describing the Part D benefit was largely complete and accurate, although this information lacked clarity. The documents were unclear in two ways. First, although about 40 percent of seniors read at or below the fifth-grade level, the reading levels of these documents ranged from seventh grade to postcollege. Second, on average, the six documents did not comply with about half of 60 common guidelines for good communication. For example, the documents used too much technical jargon and often did not define difficult terms, such as formulary. Moreover, 16 beneficiaries and advisers that GAO tested reported frustration with the documents' lack of clarity and had difficulty completing the tasks assigned to them. Although the documents lacked clarity, they informed readers of enrollment steps and factors affecting coverage decisions and were consistent with laws, regulations, and agency guidance. Customer service representatives (CSR) responded to the 500 calls GAO placed to CMS's 1-800-MEDICARE help line accurately and completely about two-thirds of the time. Of the remainder, 18 percent of the calls received inaccurate responses, 8 percent of the responses were inappropriate given the question asked, and about 3 percent received incomplete responses. In addition, about 5 percent of GAO's calls were not answered, primarily because of disconnections. Accuracy and completeness rates of CSRs' responses varied significantly across the five questions GAO asked. For example, while CSRs provided accurate and complete responses to calls about beneficiaries' eligibility for extra help 90 percent of the time, the accuracy rate for calls concerning the drug plan that would cost the least for a specified beneficiary was 41 percent. For this question, the CSRs responded inappropriately for 35 percent of the calls by explaining that they could not identify the least costly plan without the beneficiary's personal information--even though CSRs had the information needed to answer the question. The time GAO callers waited to speak with CSRs also varied, ranging from no wait time to over 55 minutes. For 75 percent of the calls--374 of the 500--the wait was less than 5 minutes. The Part D benefit portion of the Medicare Web site can be difficult to use. GAO's test of the site's overall usability--the ease of finding needed information and performing various tasks--resulted in scores of 47 percent for seniors and 53 percent for younger adults, out of a possible 100 percent. While there is no widely accepted benchmark for usability, these scores indicate that using the site can be difficult. For example, the prescription drug plan finder was complicated to use and some of its key functions, such as \"continue\" and \"choose a drug plan,\" were often not visible on the page without scrolling down."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the most significant change to the Medicare program since its inception,  the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) established an outpatient prescription drug benefit in  Medicare, known as the Part D benefit. Coverage for this new benefit  began on January 1, 2006. Until this time, Medicare, the federal program  that finances health care benefits for about 42 million elderly and disabled  beneficiaries, had not generally provided coverage for outpatient  prescription drugs. Beneficiaries may choose a Part D plan from multiple  plans offered by private sponsors under contract to the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that is responsible for  administering the Medicare program, including the Part D benefit. These  plans differ in the drugs they cover and the pharmacies they use. In  addition, the costs to the enrollee for the monthly premium, the annual  deductible, and co-payments for covered drugs vary by plan. As of   April 20, 2006, more than 30 million of Medicare\u2019s 42 million beneficiaries  were enrolled in a Part D plan or had other outpatient prescription drug  coverage. Beneficiaries have until May 15, 2006, to select a plan without  the risk of penalties in the form of higher premiums.", "Given the newness and complexity of the Part D benefit, it is critical that  beneficiaries and their advisers, including members of their families,  understand the available options so that beneficiaries can make informed  decisions on whether to enroll in Part D, and if so, which drug plan to  choose. Beneficiaries need to compare drug plans in light of their  anticipated prescription drug needs and existing arrangements for paying  for these drugs. In addition to comparing costs and drug coverage,  beneficiaries need to consider whether the plans they are comparing have  contracted with a local or mail-order pharmacy that will provide a  convenient means of filling their prescriptions.", "As part of its responsibilities, CMS has undertaken outreach and education  efforts to provide beneficiaries and their advisers with the information  they need about Part D through various media, including written  documents, the 1-800-MEDICARE help line, and the Medicare Web site.  As of December 2005, CMS has produced more than 70 written documents  to explain Part D to beneficiaries. Medicare & You\u2014the beneficiary  handbook\u2014is the most widely available of these documents and was sent  directly to beneficiaries in October 2005. Other CMS documents are  targeted to specific groups of beneficiaries, such as dual-eligible  beneficiaries and beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage or Medigap  policies. Since March 1999, CMS has administered its nationwide   1-800-MEDICARE help line to answer beneficiaries\u2019 questions about the  Medicare program. As of December 2005, about 7,500 customer service  representatives (CSR) were handling calls on the help line, which operates  24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is run by two CMS contractors. Calls  are answered by an automated system and are routed to a CSR for specific  questions, including those about Part D. CMS provides CSRs with detailed  scripts to use in answering the questions. CSRs type in related keywords  to generate a list of suggested scripts for a given question, select the script  they consider best suited to the question, and read excerpts or the entire  script. Call center contractors write the scripts, and CMS checks them for  accuracy and completeness. CSRs can also consult other information  sources, such as the Medicare Web site. CMS does not allow CSRs to offer  individualized guidance to callers, including advice in choosing a drug  plan. CMS\u2019s Medicare Web site provides information about all aspects of  the Medicare program. The Web site contains basic information about the  Part D benefit; suggests factors for beneficiaries to consider when  choosing a plan; describes situations common to beneficiaries with  guidance on next steps to take in deciding whether to enroll and what plan  to choose; lists frequently asked questions; and allows users to view, print,  or order publications. In addition, the site contains information on cost,  coverage, and convenience of individual plans. There is also a tool that  allows beneficiaries to enroll directly in the plan they have chosen.", "CMS has also arranged for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs  (SHIP) to provide Part D information on request to Medicare beneficiaries  and their advisers. Currently, CMS provides grants to the 54 SHIPs\u2014one in  each state, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and  Guam. State SHIPs provide subgrants to over 1,300 local organizations to  assist SHIPs in their efforts. In total, SHIPs rely on over 12,000 trained  counselors, most of whom are volunteers, to provide free counseling and  assistance via telephone and face-to-face sessions, public education  presentations and programs, and media activities.", "Widespread confusion among beneficiaries about the costs and coverage  under the new benefit has been reported by the media and others. For  example, according to an October 2005 survey by a research organization,  some beneficiaries are unaware of the penalties for late enrollment and  others did not realize that beneficiaries had to sign up for the benefit. In  light of your interest in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries receive the  information they need to make informed decisions, you asked us to  examine the quality of the information being provided on the Part D  benefit. In this report, we examined  the extent to which CMS\u2019s written documents describe the Part D benefit  in a clear, complete, and accurate manner;  the effectiveness of CMS\u2019s 1-800-MEDICARE help line in providing  accurate, complete, and prompt responses to callers inquiring about the  Part D benefit;    whether CMS\u2019s Medicare Web site presents information on the Part D  benefit in a usable manner; and    how CMS has used SHIPs to respond to the needs of Medicare  beneficiaries for information on the Part D benefit.", "We briefed your staff regarding the results of our review on   April 19, 2006. Appendix I contains information we provided during our  briefing to your staff.", "To evaluate CMS\u2019s written documents describing the Part D benefit, we  examined 70 relevant CMS publications and selected a sample of six  documents for in-depth review. These documents represent a variety of  document types, content, and target audiences and include Section 6 of  the Medicare & You beneficiary handbook, which discusses Part D. To  assess the clarity of the sample documents, we contracted with the  American Institutes for Research (AIR), a firm with experience in  evaluating written documents. AIR evaluated the texts by using three  standard readability tests; 60 commonly recognized good  communications practices; and user testing with 11 Medicare beneficiaries  and 5 advisers to beneficiaries, all of whom were asked to perform   18 specified tasks related to enrollment, coverage, costs, penalty, and  informational resources and provide feedback about their experiences. To  evaluate completeness, we reviewed the sample documents to determine if  they included sufficient information for the beneficiaries to identify   (1) their next steps in deciding whether to enroll and what plan to choose  and (2) important factors, such as penalty provisions, that could affect  their coverage decisions. To evaluate accuracy, we reviewed the sample  documents for consistency with MMA, regulations, and CMS guidance.", "To assess the accuracy, completeness, and promptness of the help line  responses, we made 500 calls to 1-800-MEDICARE, posing one of five  questions about Part D in each call so that each question was asked   100 times. To develop the questions, we considered topics listed on the  Medicare Web site and topics addressed in scripts frequently accessed by  CSRs. To develop our criteria for evaluating the accuracy and  completeness of CSRs\u2019 responses, we used three resources: (1) the  prescription drug finder tool on the Medicare Web site, (2) the 1-800- MEDICARE scripts, and (3) input from CMS officials. We also recorded  the length of each call, including wait times, and the time it took to be  connected to a CSR.", "To assess whether the Medicare Web site presents information on the Part  D benefit in a usable manner, we contracted with the Nielsen Norman  Group (NN/g), a firm with expertise in Web design. NN/g conducted three  evaluations: (1) it calculated an overall usability score for the site\u2014 considering factors such as site navigation, customer support, and  presentation of online forms\u2014to reflect the ease of finding necessary  information and performing various tasks; (2) it determined the usability  of 137 detailed aspects of the Web site, including aspects of Web design,  online tools, and writing style; and (3) it tested the ability of seven  participants (five beneficiaries and two advisers to beneficiaries) to  complete a total of 34 user tests to determine the ease of performing a  variety of Web-related tasks, such as browsing the site and determining  how to join a plan. We also reviewed the results of CMS\u2019s analysis of its  Web site\u2019s compliance with requirements that federal government Web  sites be accessible to people with disabilities.", "Finally, to examine how CMS has used SHIPs to meet the information  needs of beneficiaries regarding Part D, we obtained information about  SHIPs, their funding, changes made in response to the new benefit, and the  impact of Part D on the demand for SHIP services. In addition, we  interviewed CMS officials who monitor SHIP activities as well as SHIP  coordinators in the five states with the largest populations of Medicare  beneficiaries\u2014California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas.", "We performed our work from November 2005 through May 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For  more information on our methodology, see appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Within the past 6 months, millions of Medicare beneficiaries have been  making important decisions about their prescription drug coverage and  have needed access to information about the new Part D benefit to make  appropriate choices. CMS faced a tremendous challenge in responding to  this need and, within short time frames, developed a range of outreach and  educational materials to inform beneficiaries and their advisers about   Part D. To disseminate these materials, CMS largely added information to  existing resources, including written documents, such as Medicare & You;  the 1-800-MEDICARE help line; the Medicare Web site; and support for  SHIPs. However, CMS has not ensured that its communications to  beneficiaries and their advisers are provided in a manner that is  consistently clear, complete, accurate, and usable. Six months have passed  since these materials were first made available to beneficiaries, and their  limitations could result in confusion among those seeking to make  coverage decisions. Although the initial enrollment period for Part D will  end on May 15, 2006, CMS will continue to play a pivotal role in providing  beneficiaries with information about the drug benefit during the year and  in subsequent enrollment periods. CMS has an opportunity to enhance its  communications on the Part D benefit. This would allow beneficiaries and  their advisers to be better prepared when deciding whether to enroll in the  benefit, and if enrolling, which drug plan to choose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the Part D benefit education and outreach materials  that CMS provides to Medicare beneficiaries, we are recommending that  the CMS Administrator take the following four actions:    Ensure that CMS\u2019s written documents describe the Part D benefit in a  manner that is consistent with commonly recognized communications  guidelines and that is responsive to the intended audience\u2019s needs.", "Determine why CSRs frequently do not search for available drug plans if  the caller does not provide personal identifying information.", "Monitor the accuracy and completeness of CSRs\u2019 responses to callers\u2019  inquiries and identify tools targeted to improve their performance in  responding to questions concerning the Part D benefit, such as additional  scripts and training.  Improve the usability of the Part D portion of the Medicare Web site by  refining Web-based tools, providing workable site navigation features and  links, and making Web-based forms easier to use and correct."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from CMS (see  app. III). CMS said that it did not believe our findings presented a  complete and accurate picture of its Part D communications activities.  CMS discussed several concerns regarding our findings on its written  documents and the 1-800-MEDICARE help line. However, CMS did not  disagree with our findings regarding the Medicare Web site or the role of SHIPs. CMS also said that it supports the goals of our recommendations and is already taking steps to implement them, such as continually  enhancing and refining its Web-based tools.", "CMS discussed concerns regarding the completeness and accuracy of our  findings in terms of activities we did not examine, as well as those we did.  CMS stated that our findings were not complete because our report did  not examine all of the agency\u2019s efforts to educate Medicare beneficiaries  and specifically mentioned that we did not examine the broad array of  communication tools it has made available, including the development of  its network of grassroots partners throughout the country. We recognize  that CMS has taken advantage of many vehicles to communicate with  beneficiaries and their advisers. However, we focused our work on the  four specific mechanisms that we believed would have the greatest impact  on beneficiaries\u2014written materials, the 1-800-MEDICARE help line, the  Medicare Web site, and the SHIPs. In addition, CMS stated that our report  is based on information from January and February 2006, and that it has  undertaken a number of activities since then to address the problems we  identified. Although we appreciate CMS\u2019s efforts to improve its Part D  communications to beneficiaries on an ongoing basis, we believe it is  unlikely that the problems we identified in this report could have been  corrected yet given their nature and scope.", "CMS raised two concerns with our examination of a sample of written  materials. First, it criticized our use of readability tests to assess the clarity  of the six sample documents we reviewed. For example, CMS said that  common multisyllabic words would inappropriately inflate the reading  level. However, we found that reading levels remained high after adjusting  for 26 multisyllabic words a Medicare beneficiary would encounter, such  as Social Security Administration. CMS also pointed out that some experts  find such assessments to be misleading. Because we recognize that there  is some controversy surrounding the use of reading levels, we included  two additional assessments to supplement this readability analysis\u2014the  assessment of design and organization of the sample documents based on  60 commonly recognized communications guidelines and an examination  of the usability of six sample documents, involving 11 beneficiaries and 5  advisers.", "Second, CMS expressed concern about our examination of the usability of  the six sample documents. The participating beneficiaries and advisers  were called on to perform 18 specified tasks, after reading the selected  materials, including a section of the Medicare & You handbook. CMS  suggested that the task asking beneficiaries and advisers to calculate their  out-of-pocket drug costs was inappropriate because there are many other  tools that can be used to more effectively compare costs. We do not  disagree with CMS that there are a number of ways beneficiaries may  complete this calculation; however, we nonetheless believe that it is  important that beneficiaries be able to complete this task on the basis of  reading Medicare & You, which, as CMS points out, is widely disseminated  to beneficiaries, reaching all beneficiary households each year. In addition,  CMS noted that it was not able to examine our detailed methodology  regarding the clarity of written materials\u2014including assessments  performed by one of our contractors concerning readability and document  design and organization. We plan to share this information with CMS, once  our report has become public.", "Finally, CMS took issue with one aspect of our evaluation of the   1-800-MEDICARE help line. Specifically, CMS said the 41 percent accuracy  rate associated with one of the five questions we asked was misleading,  because, according to CMS, we failed to analyze 35 of the 100 responses.  However, we disagree. This question addressed which drug plan would  cost the least for a beneficiary with certain specified prescription drug  needs. We analyzed these 35 responses to this question and found the  responses to be inappropriate. The CSRs would not provide us with the  information we were seeking because we did not supply personal  identifying information, such as the beneficiary\u2019s Medicare number or date  of birth. We considered such responses inappropriate because the CSRs  could have answered this question without personal identifying  information by using CMS\u2019s Web-based prescription drug plan finder tool.  Although CMS said that it has emphasized to CSRs, through training and  broadcast messages, that it is permissible to provide the information we  requested without requiring information that would personally identify a  beneficiary, in these 35 instances, the CSR simply told us that our question  could not be answered. CMS also said that the bulk of these inappropriate  responses were related to our request that the CSR use only brand-name  drugs. This is incorrect\u2014none of these 35 responses were considered  incorrect or inappropriate because of a request that the CSR use only  brand-name drugs\u2014as that was not part of our question.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days  after its date.
