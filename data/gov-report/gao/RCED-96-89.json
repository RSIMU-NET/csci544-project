Direct-use material presents a high proliferation risk because it can be used to manufacture a nuclear weapon without further enrichment or irradiation in a reactor. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, approximately 25 kilograms of HEU or 8 kilograms of plutonium is needed to manufacture a nuclear explosive, although the Department of Energy (DOE) suggests the amounts needed to build a weapon may be smaller.", "Many types of nuclear facilities routinely handle, process, or store direct-use material. Besides nuclear weapon production facilities, direct-use material can also be found at research reactors, reactor fuel fabrication facilities, uranium enrichment plants, spent fuel reprocessing facilities, and nuclear material storage sites. Most civilian nuclear power facilities are of less concern because they use low-enriched or natural uranium as fuel, which would require additional enrichment before the fuel would be suitable for nuclear weapons. While these reactors produce plutonium in spent reactor fuel, such fuel is dangerous to handle because it is highly radioactive. Spent reactor fuel also requires reprocessing before it is suitable for nuclear weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Is Nuclear Material Controlled?", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear materials are controlled to prevent and detect their theft. Nuclear material can be stolen or diverted by (1) outside individuals or groups, such as terrorists attempting to break in and steal nuclear material; (2) inside individuals or groups, such as one or more employees that have access to nuclear material; and (3) combinations of insiders and outsiders.", "A nuclear material control system consists of three overlapping components\u2014material protection, material control, and material accounting. Together they compose a set of procedures, personnel, and equipment that address both insider and outsider threats.", "Material protection systems are designed to limit access to nuclear material by outside individuals and prevent the unauthorized removal of material from a facility by inside individuals. Nuclear facilities protect their material by (1) installing fences with sensors and television cameras to delay, detect, and assess unauthorized intrusions; (2) posting armed guards at entry and exit points; (3) establishing a protective response force that can react to unauthorized intrusions; and (4) installing nuclear material monitors to detect attempts to remove material from a facility. Nuclear facilities also assess the reliability of personnel with access to nuclear material by conducting background checks and continuously monitoring their behavior.", "Material control systems contain, monitor, and establish custody over nuclear material. Nuclear facilities control material by (1) storing material in containers and vaults equipped with seals that can indicate when tampering may have occurred, (2) controlling access to and exit from nuclear material areas using badge and personnel identification equipment, and (3) establishing procedures to closely monitor nuclear materials. Nuclear facilities also designate custodians to be responsible for nuclear material in their possession.", "Material accounting systems maintain information on the quantity of nuclear materials within specified areas and on transfers in and out of those areas. They employ periodic inventories to count and measure nuclear material by element and isotopic content. Nuclear facilities use the inventory and transfer data to establish nuclear material balances, which track materials on hand and the flow of material within a specified area. The material balances are closed periodically by reconciling physical inventory with recorded inventories, correcting errors, calculating inventory differences and evaluating their statistical differences, and performing trend analysis to detect protracted theft of nuclear material. Nuclear facilities in the United States are capable of updating material accounting data within 24-hour periods. Some U.S. facilities with more modern nuclear accounting systems are capable of updating material accounting data within 4 hours.", "In addition to facility systems, the United States and most other countries have established national material protection, control, and accounting (MPC&A) systems. These systems include regulations governing procedures for nuclear material protection control and accounting, inspection requirements to ensure that the systems are implemented properly, and tracking systems to provide information on the location and disposition of nuclear material nationally. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and DOE have promulgated regulations on controlling nuclear material."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Is the United States Assisting the Newly Independent States to Improve Their Nuclear Material Controls?", "paragraphs": ["The United States is pursuing two different, but complementary strategies to achieve its goals of rapidly improving nuclear material controls over direct-use material in the newly independent states (NIS).

On June 23, 1995, DOD entered into an agreement with the Ministry of Defense in Belarus to improve controls over its civilian nuclear material. DOE implements the programs under these agreements.", "As a complementing strategy, DOE initiated a program in April 1994 of MPC&A cooperation with Russia\u2019s nuclear institutes, operating facilities, and enterprises. This initiative, known as the lab-to-lab program, brings U.S. and Russian laboratory personnel directly together to work cooperatively on implementing MPC&A upgrades at Russian nuclear facilities.

The cities were separated from other urban areas, self-contained, and protected by fences and guard forces. Personnel working in the Soviet nuclear complex were under heavy surveillance by the KGB. Personnel went through an intensive screening process, and their activities were closely monitored. In general, facilities would control access to nuclear material using a three-person rule, requiring two facility staff members and at least one person from the security services to be present when material was handled. The Soviet-era control system enforced severe penalties for violations of control procedures.", "According to U.S. national laboratory officials, the Soviet system accounted for nuclear material, although it was not complete, timely, or accurate. Facilities paid close attention to end-products to meet production quotas and paid less attention to the use of completely measured material balances to track net gains and losses of materials as they were processed or handled. The Soviet system relied on manual, paper-based systems that made tracking material time-consuming. They also used standard estimates of rates of loss for materials that could be held up in processing equipment, such as pipes, rather then measuring actual losses. According to DOE, in these respects, the Soviet system of accounting was similar to that used in the early days of the U.S. nuclear program.", "According to Russian officials, traditional Soviet approaches to nuclear material controls were generally effective because (1) the Soviet Union was a closed society (separated by a robust iron curtain) with strict controls over foreign travel by its citizens, (2) internal security within the Soviet Union was quite rigid and strict discipline was carried out when controls were violated, and (3) there was no black market in nuclear materials within the country."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Social and Economic Changes May Increase the Threat of Theft and Diversion of Nuclear Material", "paragraphs": ["Social and economic changes in the NIS have increased the threat of theft and diversion of nuclear material, and Soviet-era MPC&A systems may not be able to adequately counter the increased threat.

According to this official, this causes changes in their attitudes toward their work and places pressures on their families. The outsider threat has also increased at this facility because the closed city is now open to businesspeople and outside workers who visit for short periods of time. According to this official, the institutes do not have background information on the visitors.

According to a Los Alamos National Laboratory official, these facilities typically weigh material at certain points in production and generally measure radiation emitted from the material. These procedures, while useful in identifying the types of material present, are less rigorous than required in the United States because they do not measure the quantity of material.

The slow pace of the government-to-government program in Russia can be attributed to two major obstacles. The first obstacle involved difficulties in negotiating agreements with MINATOM to obtain access to sites handling direct-use material. The United States proposed to MINATOM in March 1994 that demonstration projects be initiated at two HEU fuel fabrication facilities. The U.S. position was that including these facilities would support nonproliferation objectives. MINATOM rejected the U.S. proposal saying that the inclusion of direct-use material was a sensitive and delicate issue and that experience in cooperating on low enriched uranium facilities would be needed before expanding to direct-use materials. As a result, the United States agreed to fund only one project in Russia, the low enriched uranium facility at Elektrostal. Recently, physical protection equipment was installed in the building housing the low enriched uranium fuel line. The same building also houses an HEU fuel fabrication line, which will be protected by this equipment. In the summer of 1994, the United States proposed a quick-fix approach to upgrade MPC&A at Russian facilities with direct-use material.
