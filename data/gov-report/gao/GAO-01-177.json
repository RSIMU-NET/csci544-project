Regarding the $1 billion in federal funds spent in fiscal year 1999, FSIS spent about 70 percent, overseeing about 20 percent of federally regulated foods; FDA spent about 30 percent, overseeing about 80 percent of federally regulated foods. These outlays reflect the regulatory approaches or inspection frequencies contained in the laws under which each agency operates."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Foodborne illness in the United States is an extensive and expensive problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that unsafe foods cause as many as 76 million illnesses annually. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that the costs associated with foodborne illness due to seven pathogens, including salmonella, campylobacter, and E. coli O157:H7, range up to $37 billion annually. Federal and state expenditures for activities to help ensure the safety of the nation\u2019s food supply are also significant, with federal efforts alone exceeding $1 billion annually. While there are 12 federal agencies with food safety responsibilities, USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the primary federal regulatory agencies responsible for food safety. FSIS is responsible for ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products moving in interstate and foreign commerce are safe, wholesome, and marked, labeled, and packaged correctly. FDA is responsible for ensuring that (1) all foods moving in interstate and foreign commerce, except those under FSIS\u2019 jurisdiction, are safe, wholesome, and labeled properly; and (2) all animal drugs and feeds are safe, properly labeled, and produce no human health hazards when used in food-producing animals. In addition, state agencies conduct inspection and regulation activities that help ensure the safety of foods produced, processed, or sold within their borders.", "To obtain a better understanding of federal and state food safety efforts, you asked us to determine for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 the amount of resources that were expended by FSIS, FDA, and the states for food safety and how the agencies used these resources.", "To make this determination for FSIS and FDA, we analyzed their annual appropriations and financial documentation, which included information on actual food safety expenditures, activities and accomplishments. For food safety activities, we obtained and reviewed the associated costs and staff year levels and supplemented this information with agency programmatic documents and discussions we had with agency officials.", "To determine the amounts that states expended on food safety and how they used the resources, we surveyed the agriculture and health departments of all 50 states, 3 territories, the commonwealths of Puerto Rico and North Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the District of Columbia. The survey asked respondents for information on the scope of food safety activities their departments performed, the costs and staffing levels of those activities, and the scope and frequency of inspection activities. We analyzed these data to determine the extent of state food safety activities and expenditures nationwide. The survey was limited to state agriculture and health departments and did not include other state agencies or county and city agencies. Appendix I provides details on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The extent of foodborne illness in the United States and its associated costs are significant. CDC estimates that unsafe foods cause as many as 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths annually. In terms of medical costs and productivity losses, foodborne illnesses associated with seven major pathogens cost the nation between $7 billion and $37 billion annually, according to USDA\u2019s estimates.", "According to CDC, almost 12,000 cases of foodborne illness were reported in 1997, the latest year for which data are available. Of the approximately 7,000 cases in which the food source for the illness was known, about 85 percent were associated with food products that are regulated by FDA, such as fish, shellfish, fruits, vegetables, and salads. The remaining 15 percent were associated with food products, such as meat and poultry, that fall under FSIS\u2019 jurisdiction. The relative proportion of illness associated with foods under each agency\u2019s jurisdiction reflects consumer expenditures for food products under the jurisdiction of each. Nearly 80 percent of consumer expenditures are for foods under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction, while FSIS is responsible for the remaining 20 percent.", "While 12 different federal agencies located within six federal departments conduct food safety activities, FSIS and FDA have primary regulatory responsibility for ensuring the safety of the nation\u2019s food supply. FSIS has responsibility for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products, overseeing about 6,000 meat, poultry, egg product and import establishments. Under the governing inspection acts, FSIS, in effect, preapproves products before they are marketed. As such, FSIS operates under a mandated continuous inspection frequency for meat and poultry slaughter plants and egg processing plants and inspects meat and poultry processing plants daily. FSIS marks all inspected and approved meat, poultry, and egg products with a USDA inspection stamp. Without this marking, the products cannot be legally marketed.", "FSIS also reviews and assesses the effectiveness of state intrastate meat, poultry, and egg product inspection programs to ensure that their standards are at least equal to federal standards. In addition, FSIS reviews and assesses foreign inspection systems and facilities that export FSIS-regulated products to the United States for equivalency with U.S. standards. In 1998, FSIS reviewed 7 of the 26 states with intrastate inspection programs for meat and/or poultry and reviewed foreign inspection programs in 22 of the 37 countries that were eligible to export to the United States. In addition to the inspection activities, FSIS conducts emergency responses, including retention, detention, or voluntary recall of adulterated foods and epidemiological investigations of foodborne hazards or disease outbreaks. Furthermore, FSIS engages in developing and implementing cooperative strategies to prevent health hazards associated with animal production practices, coordinating U.S. participation in international sanitary standard-setting activities, and providing safety information to food handlers and consumers.", "FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of a broad range of products, including foods, animal drugs and feeds, human medicines and vaccines, radiation-emitting devices, medical devices, blood and blood products, and cosmetics. Specifically, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FDA is responsible for ensuring that domestic and imported food products (except meat, poultry, and processed egg products) are safe, wholesome, and labeled properly. This includes ensuring the safety of ingredients that make up foods, such as food additives that change a food\u2019s color or taste, and reviewing and approving new additives unless they are generally recognized as being safe. In administering the act, which generally follows the regulatory approach of allowing food products to enter the market without preapproval, FDA inspects and tests domestic and imported food products. However, the act does not mandate or specify inspection frequencies for overseeing an estimated 57,000 food establishments under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction. Products under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction do not require, and FDA does not place, any inspection mark on the products before they can be legally marketed. FDA is also responsible for maintaining surveillance of all animal drugs and feeds to ensure that they are safe and labeled properly and produce no human health hazards when used in food-producing animals and for overseeing more than 9,000 animal drug and feed establishments.", "States all have departments that are responsible for the regulation and enforcement of their own food safety laws to ensure the safety of foods produced, processed, or sold within their borders. These responsibilities are primarily within the state departments of agriculture and health and may involve others, such as state environmental protection agencies and county departments of health. States and territories may also perform inspections for FSIS or FDA under contract or form partnerships to report their results to the federal agencies. For example, in fiscal year 1998, FDA contracted with 38 states to conduct inspections in accordance with the federal regulations. Under partnership agreements, 29 states shared the results of inspections conducted under their own standards with FDA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSIS, FDA, and State Agency Food Safety Expenditures Total Nearly $1.3 Billion", "paragraphs": ["FSIS was responsible for food safety expenditures of $678 million in fiscal year 1998 and $712 million in fiscal year 1999, or about 55 percent of the nearly $1.3 billion fiscal year 1999 federal and state expenditures. In fiscal years 1998 and 1999, FSIS employed 11,057 and 10,951 staff years, respectively. FDA food safety activities accounted for about 22 percent of the total expenditures\u2014$253 million in fiscal year 1998 and $283 million in fiscal year 1999\u2014and employed 2,505 and 2,609 staff years, respectively.

Specifically:   Inspections at more than 6,000 slaughter, processing, and import establishments accounted for $486 million, or 68 percent, of total agency expenditures. Of the $486 million, FSIS estimates that slaughter inspections conducted at 262 establishments accounted for about $324 million; daily meat and poultry processing inspections at about 4,300 establishments accounted for about $145 million; continuous inspections at 75 egg processor establishments accounted for about $8 million; and inspections at 129 import/export establishments accounted for about $7 million. Regarding slaughter inspections, FSIS estimates that carcass-by- carcass organoleptic (see, touch, smell) inspections accounted for about $296 million of the total inspection expenditures. FSIS does not track expenditures specifically related to Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system inspections and thus could not provide that information.", "Field office administration, supervision, and compliance activities, such as following-up on inspection findings, accounted for $34.1 million, or 5 percent, of total expenditures.", "Field office management by the Office of Field Operations located in Washington, D.C., accounted for $79.9 million, or 11 percent, of total expenditures. The largest expenditure was for grants to states for inspections, field automation, and other activities, accounting for almost $47 million, or over half, of the office\u2019s total expenditures for fiscal year 1999.", "Field laboratory analysis services provided by the Office of Public Health and Science accounted for $14 million of field activity expenditures, or 2 percent, of total expenditures.", "FSIS\u2019 headquarters-based activities accounted for the remaining $98 million of fiscal year 1999 expenditures, or about 15 percent, of total agency expenditures. Four program offices\u2014Management; Public Health and Science; Policy, Program Development, and Evaluation; and the Office of the Administrator\u2014conduct FSIS\u2019 headquarters food safety activities. Specifically:   The Office of Management accounted for about $61.8 million, or 9 percent, of total expenditures. The office is responsible for providing centralized administrative and support services to all other FSIS program offices, including functions such as human resource management, strategic planning, procurement, and financial management.", "The Office of Policy, Program Development, and Evaluation accounted for about $18.9 million, or 3 percent, of total expenditures. The office is responsible for, among other things, coordinating activities, such as developing and recommending domestic and international policies for FSIS; reviewing product process standards; product labeling; and developing and evaluating inspection programs.", "The Office of Public Health and Science accounted for about $11.4 million, or 2 percent, of total expenditures. The office is responsible for conducting scientific analysis, providing scientific advice and data, and making recommendations involving all public health and science concerns relating to products under FSIS\u2019 jurisdiction. This includes mission activities such as epidemiology and risk assessment, surveillance, and response to food safety emergencies.", "The Office of the Administrator accounted for about $6.1 million, or 1 percent, of total expenditures. The office is responsible for managing agency activities such as public affairs, food safety education, coordinating U.S. involvement in international standard-setting for food safety, and maintaining liaison with trade organizations.", "FSIS\u2019 large proportion of expenditures on field and supporting activities reflects the mandate of the meat and poultry acts. The two acts require that meat and poultry slaughter plants be under continuous FSIS inspection. If a federal inspector is not present, the animals cannot be slaughtered. FSIS inspects animals both before and after slaughter. The acts also require FSIS inspectors to monitor processing plant operations, such as deboning and canning, to ensure that plants are sanitary and adhere to approved procedures and label specifications. The acts do not explicitly set inspection frequencies for meat- and poultry-processing plants; however, FSIS has interpreted the acts as requiring the daily inspection of such plants and has established its regulations accordingly. That is, an FSIS inspector must visit each meat- and poultry-processing plant for an unspecified period of time\u2014which may be as little as an hour\u2014each operating day. As such, the majority of FSIS expenditures are directed to conducting inspection activities based on frequencies derived from the regulatory acts, rather than on the food safety risk of a specific plant or process.", "In 1998, we reported that FSIS\u2019 funds could be used more effectively if they were redirected using risk-based criteria. Specifically, the approximate $296 million in fiscal year 1999 expenditures for organoleptic, carcass-by-carcass slaughter inspections do not optimize federal resources because these inspections do not detect the most serious public health threat associated with meat and poultry\u2014microbial contamination. Rather, some of these funds and funds used for daily inspections of meat- and poultry-processing plants could be used, for example, to increase testing for microbial and other types of contamination, risk assessment, and scientific research, or could be congressionally redirected to other food plants, such as seafood processors, based on the health risk posed. We continue to hold this view."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Food Safety Expenditures Are More Closely Divided Between Field Inspection and Headquarters Activities", "paragraphs": ["FDA expended $253 million in fiscal year 1998 and $283 million in fiscal year 1999 on food safety activities.

As with FSIS, FDA\u2019s food safety activities can be separated into two major elements: (1) inspection and enforcement operations conducted in the field by district offices or at headquarters in direct support of those district offices, and (2) operations conducted primarily in headquarters offices. As shown in figure 3, about 56 percent of FDA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 food safety expenditures were for field activities and about 44 percent were for headquarters-based activities of FDA\u2019s centers. Appendix III provides detailed information on FDA\u2019s fiscal years 1998 and 1999 activities, expenditures, and staff years.", "In aggregate, FDA\u2019s field activities accounted for about $159 million in fiscal year 1999, or about 56 percent of the agency\u2019s total food safety expenditures. The Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) is responsible for conducting field activities designated by the centers. ORA\u2019s compliance, inspection, and laboratory field staff manage, supervise, and conduct enforcement, compliance, inspection, sample collection and analysis activities, as well as criminal investigation, education, and outreach activities. Specifically:   The ORA-conducted field activities in support of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition accounted for about $145 million in expenditures for fiscal year 1999. Using these funds, FDA conducted over 14,600 domestic food establishment inspections, including those conducted by states under contract with FDA, at a cost of about $2 million; and about 765 inspections of food importers. About $27 million, or 19 percent, of the $145 million went to domestic and imported seafood hazard analysis and critical control point inspection activities. Also included in these total expenditures is more than $40 million for laboratory analysis of about 25,000 domestic and foreign product samples associated with field inspection activities.", "The ORA-conducted field activities in support of the Center for Veterinary Medicine accounted for about $13.5 million in expenditures in fiscal year 1999. With these funds, FDA conducted nearly 3,500 domestic animal drug and feed establishment inspections, including those conducted by states under contract with FDA at a cost of about $600,000. Also included in these expenditures is about $2 million for laboratory analysis of about 1,800 feed samples associated with field inspection activities.", "In aggregate, the headquarters-based activities of FDA\u2019s centers accounted for about $125 million in fiscal year 1999, or 44 percent of the agency\u2019s total food safety expenditures. Specifically:   The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\u2019s activities accounted for about $96 million in fiscal year 1999, or 34 percent of total agency food safety expenditures. The center operates FDA\u2019s Foods Program, which is responsible for ensuring that FDA-regulated food is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and labeled properly. To attain this goal, the center implements programs that address specific food safety concerns; premarket review of food and color additives, infant formula and medical foods accounted for about $10 million in expenditures, and postmarket monitoring and response activities accounted for about $17 million in expenditures, and cross-cutting activities that address both premarket and postmarket concerns, such as regulatory policy development and education and outreach activities, accounted for about $61 million in expenditures. Food safety research and risk assessment accounted for about $32 million, or about half of cross-cutting activity expenditures.", "The Center for Veterinary Medicine\u2019s activities accounted for about $28 million in fiscal year 1999, or 10 percent, of total agency food safety expenditures. The center operates FDA\u2019s Animal Drugs and Feeds Program, which has primary goals of ensuring that only safe and effective animal drugs, feeds, and feed additives are marketed and that foods from animals that are administered drugs and food additives are safe for human consumption. The center maintains surveillance over all animal drugs and feeds to minimize threats to human health. Premarket application review for new animal drugs accounted for the center\u2019s largest expenditures, about $12.8 million in fiscal year 1999. In the same year, FDA reviewed 36 original new animal drug applications, approving 17, and reviewed 767 supplemental applications to change the conditions of existing approvals, approving 421.", "The National Center for Toxicological Research located in Jefferson, Arkansas, accounted for nearly $1.5 million in fiscal year 1999, or about 1 percent of total agency expenditures. The center\u2019s mission is to conduct peer-reviewed scientific research that provides the basis for FDA to make sound, science-based regulatory decisions and to protect the public health through pre- and post-market surveillance. During fiscal year 1999, the center conducted 10 research projects that contributed to FDA\u2019s food safety mission; due to the center\u2019s research focus, it did not engage in field activities related to food safety.", "FDA\u2019s relatively small proportion of expenditures on field inspection and supporting activities in comparison to FSIS\u2019 expenditures for those activities reflects the absence of specified inspection frequencies in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The act, which FDA has primary responsibility for administering, generally follows the regulatory approach of allowing almost all food products to enter the market without preapproval by federal agencies. Therefore, FDA is not required to inspect foods or food firms on a given schedule. As a result, FDA inspects the more than 57,000 food establishments under its jurisdiction about once every 5 years, on average, and according to FDA officials, inspected less than 1 percent of the 3.7 million imported food entries in fiscal year 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Report Expenditures of About $300 Million Annually for Food Safety", "paragraphs": ["State agriculture and health departments reported expenditures of about $292 million in fiscal year 1998 and $301 million in fiscal year 1999.

We believe that the report clearly identifies FSIS\u2019 responsibilities\u2014i.e., ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products moving in interstate and foreign commerce are safe, wholesome, and marked, labeled, and packaged correctly. Regarding nonfood safety expenditures, throughout our review, FSIS officials said that the expenditure information provided to us was for food safety or food safety- related activities. As such, we believe that the FSIS expenditures in this report are appropriately characterized as \u201cfood safety\u201d expenditures.", "FSIS also said that it would be useful if we included the size and scope of the products it regulates. We believe the report adequately describes the size and scope of FSIS\u2019 activities.

The level of detail provided on FSIS\u2019 responsibilities and activities is similar to that provided on FDA\u2019s activities.", "FSIS also said that the statistics provided in the report regarding the relative proportions of food purchases and agency food safety expenditures were misleading due to the high risk of FSIS-regulated products compared with some of the FDA-regulated products. While the relative risk of FSIS-regulated products may be greater in some cases than FDA-regulated products, it was not our intent to analyze or compare the risk of products. We believe that the data accurately reflect the proportion of each agency\u2019s expenditures and the proportion of consumer expenditures for foods under each agency\u2019s jurisdiction. The report also clearly identifies the food products for which each agency has responsibility.", "Finally, FSIS said that the report should further define its responsibilities under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act. FSIS also described court actions related to its efforts to design new inspection models that would realign roles and responsibilities of industry and federal inspectors. We modified the report to clearly identify FSIS\u2019 responsibilities under the federal meat and poultry inspection acts and described its efforts, with guidance from the courts, to realign the responsibilities and roles of industry and federal inspectors.", "FDA agreed with the report and said that it contained valuable information on the allocation of food safety resources. FDA applauded the report for including important information on the efforts and resources expended by states but believed that the report was incomplete because it did not include information on the expenditures and efforts of other agencies, such as USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Regarding FSIS and FDA, we obtained appropriations documentation showing the amount of funding provided to each agency. We collected records of expenditures and staff years for specific activities from each of the agencies as follows:   FSIS provided expenditure and full-time equivalent staff-year information from its accounting system for each of its headquarters and field offices for specific food safety activities within those offices, such as inspection, education, and laboratory activities. FSIS could not provide expenditure information from its accounting system for approximately 2 weeks at the end of fiscal year 1999 because of problems created by the implementation of a new accounting system. Instead, FSIS determined the allocation of expenditures for that time period based on other expenditure records. The Office of Inspector General could not give an opinion on the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) financial statements for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 because of weaknesses in evidence and internal controls.We did not verify FSIS\u2019 accounting information, as it was the only information available, and such an audit was outside of the scope of our review.", "FDA provided records of expenditures and staff years from the agency\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), and Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA). Each center used its own methodology to identify and provide expenditures and staff years for specific food safety activities, using a combination of accounting system information, staff activity time records, and estimations. FDA\u2019s Office of Financial Management reviewed the information provided by the centers for accuracy and consistency and also provided us with the share of FDA central administrative costs allocable to each center. We did not verify FDA\u2019s accounting information; we relied on an independent auditor\u2019s finding that FDA\u2019s accounting records fairly reported its financial position and had no internal control weaknesses in fiscal years 1998 and 1999.", "At each agency, we gathered documentation and interviewed agency officials to (1) obtain additional information on the specific activities funded by the expenditures and accomplishments associated with those activities and (2) discuss the expenditure and staff-year information they provided. We also collected documentation and the transfer of funds between food safety and nonfood safety activities at each agency and discussed other financial concerns, such as FSIS\u2019 fiscal years 1997 and 1998 anti-deficiency violations caused by the over-obligation of as much as $4 million each year.", "To determine the amounts that states expended on food safety and how they actually used the resources, we surveyed the agriculture and health departments of 50 states, 3 territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia; we surveyed the health departments of the Commonwealth of the North Mariana Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, which do not have agriculture departments. In total, we sent out 112 surveys. The survey requested information on the scope of food safety activities performed by their departments, the costs and staffing levels of those activities, the scope and frequency of inspection activities, how the states allocated expenditures between various activities, and perceptions regarding the extent of local government involvement in food safety activities. In developing the survey, we coordinated with staff from FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs, Division of Federal/State Relations, which is also surveying the states.", "We pretested the survey at seven food safety departments in four states\u2014Colorado, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Virginia\u2014to ensure that our questions were clear, unbiased, and precise and that responding to the survey did not place an undue burden on their agencies. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the state officials\u2019 responses. We also reviewed each response to identify internal data inconsistencies and other issues needing clarification, called respondents to resolve questions, and made agreed-upon changes to their responses as appropriate.

The report clearly identifies FSIS\u2019 responsibilities\u2014i.e., ensuring that meat, poultry, and processed egg products moving in interstate and foreign commerce are safe, wholesome, and marked, labeled, and packaged correctly. Regarding nonfood safety expenditures, FSIS officials assured us during the review that the expenditure information that they provided was for food safety or primarily food safety related activities. As such, we believe the FSIS expenditures in this report are sufficiently related to food safety to be appropriately characterized as \u201cfood safety\u201d expenditures. 2.  We believe the report adequately describes the size and scope of FSIS activities. For example, the report includes information on the number of meat, poultry, egg product, and import establishments FSIS oversees; the number of state and foreign programs it reviewed; and the number and type of inspections it conducted. The level of detail provided on FSIS\u2019 responsibilities and activities is similar to that provided on FDA activities. 3.  It was not our intent to analyze or compare the relative risks of products under the jurisdiction of FSIS and FDA. While the relative risk of FSIS-regulated products may be greater in some cases than FDA-regulated products, we believe that the data accurately reflect the proportion of each agency\u2019s expenditures and the proportion of consumer expenditures for foods under each agency\u2019s jurisdiction. The report also clearly identifies the food products for which each agency has responsibility. 4.
