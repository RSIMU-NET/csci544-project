Government tax, regulatory, and infrastructure investment policies can affect the costs that shippers pass on to their customers. If government policy gives one mode a cost advantage over another, by, for example, not recouping all the costs of that mode's use of infrastructure, then shipping prices and customers' use of freight modes can be distorted, reducing the overall efficiency of the nation's economy. As requested, this report (1) describes how government policies can affect competition and efficiency within the surface freight transportation sector, (2) determines what is known about the extent to which all costs are borne by surface freight customers, and (3) discusses the use of the findings when making future surface freight transportation policy. GAO reviewed the transportation literature and analyzed financial and technical data from the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and the Environmental Protection Agency to make cross-modal comparisons at a national level. Data limitations and assumptions inherent in an aggregate national comparison are noted in the report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Public spending, tax, and regulatory policies can promote economic efficiency in the freight transportation sector when they result in prices that reflect all marginal costs (the cost to society of one additional unit of service). These costs include private costs; public costs, such as infrastructure maintenance; and external costs, such as congestion, pollution, and accidents. When prices do not reflect all these costs, one mode may have a cost advantage over the others that distorts competition. As a consequence, the nation could devote more resources than needed to higher cost freight modes, an inefficient outcome that lowers economic well-being. Inefficient public investment decisions can result when all construction and other fixed costs are not passed on to the beneficiaries of that investment. GAO's analysis shows that on average, additional freight service provided by trucks generated significantly more costs that are not passed on to consumers of that service than the same amount of freight service provided by either rail or water. GAO estimates that freight trucking costs that were not passed on to consumers were at least 6 times greater than rail costs and at least 9 times greater than waterways costs per million ton miles of freight transport. Most of these costs were external costs imposed on society. Marginal public infrastructure costs were significant only for trucking. Given limitations in the highway, rail, and waterway economic, financial, technical, and environmental data available for the analysis, GAO presents conservative estimates. While freight costs are not fully passed on to consumers across all modes, a number of issues are important for decision makers to consider when proposing policy changes to align prices with marginal costs or reduce the difference between government fixed costs and revenues. Costs can vary widely based on the specific characteristics of an individual shipment, such as the geography and population density of the shipment's route, and the fuel-efficiency of the specific vehicle carrying it. Policy changes that align prices with marginal costs on a shipment-by-shipment basis would provide the greatest economic benefit, but precisely targeted policy changes can result in high administrative costs. By contrast, less targeted changes--such as charging user fees based on average costs, subsidizing more efficient alternatives, or broadly applying safety or emissions regulations--can change the overall distribution of freight across modes, but may provide fewer benefits. Although the current configuration of transportation infrastructure can limit the shifting of freight among modes, price changes can prompt other economic responses. Over the longer term, there is greater potential for responses that will shape the overall distribution and use of freight services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

These networks connect and intersect, and play a  critical role in providing the American public with the freight mobility  needed to sustain national economic vitality and international  competitiveness. According to the Department of Transportation (DOT),  our surface freight transportation system connects an estimated 8 million  businesses and 116 million households moving $12 trillion in goods. The  movement of goods involves both private and public interests from private  trucking companies, railroads, and waterborne vessel operators to federal,  state, and local governments. While the major freight railroad  infrastructure is privately owned and operated, and port infrastructure is  privately or publicly owned and operated, governments play a primary role  in planning, building, maintaining, and operating highways and keeping  our waterways navigable. This infrastructure is designed for multiple types  of users, not just freight service providers.  Governments collect taxes and  tolls, which help offset transportation expenditures, but have a minimal  role in the direct regulation of prices and rates. Governments also regulate  various aspects of freight transportation across all modes, including  pollution, safety, and, to a more limited degree, congestion.", "How governments tax, regulate, and make investment decisions across  modes could affect relative freight shipping prices. If government policy  results in giving one mode of freight transportation a cost advantage over  others\u2014by, for example, ensuring that the wear and tear costs on  infrastructure from users are fully recouped in one mode, but not in  another mode\u2014then shipping prices and choices made between  alternative shipping options could be distorted. As a consequence, freight  may be moved by a mode\u2014for some portion or all of a trip\u2014that imposes  higher costs on the general public than might occur if such distortions did  not exist. Because of your interest in the potential impact these policies  can have on the freight transportation sector and beyond, you asked us to  (1) describe how such policies can affect competition and efficiency  within the surface freight transportation sector; (2) determine what is  known about the extent to which costs are borne by surface freight users;  and (3) discuss how our findings could be used when making future  surface freight transportation policy.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed reports issued by the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO), DOT, the Transportation Research  Board (TRB), and the Brookings Institution. We interviewed officials from  DOT, the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), representatives from professional research organizations  and industry, members of academia, and individuals knowledgeable about  freight transportation to obtain advice on economic concepts, appropriate  and available data sources, methodological approaches, and views on  government spending and regulatory policies. We obtained preliminary  reviews about the scope, methodology, and analysis contained in this  report from DOT, EPA, the Corps, as well as two members of the  Comptroller General\u2019s Advisory Board\u2014comprised of individuals with  broad expertise in public policy.", "We obtained, reviewed, and analyzed several datasets that can be used to  estimate the revenues received from and costs imposed by users of the  surface freight transportation system\u2014federal, state, and local highways  and roads; all classes of rail lines; and the inland, coastal, and Great Lakes  waterways. Specifically, we identified data on federal, state, and local  government revenues and expenditures on highways, railroads, and  waterways from fiscal years 2000 through 2006, the time frame of Federal  Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA) ongoing highway cost allocation study.  We also obtained available data on external costs associated with freight  transport, including pollution, accidents, and congestion from EPA,  related research from DOT, and the Texas Transportation Institute. We  analyzed these data to estimate the costs at a national level that freight  users impose on the public transportation infrastructure and society and  the revenues collected to offset those costs. When multiple data sources  were available for our analyses, we explain why we selected one over  another.", "To assess the reliability of the financial and technical data collected and  published by various federal government agencies\u2014such as DOT\u2019s  Highway Statistics Series; the Department of the Treasury\u2019s statistics on  income, debt, and tax expenditures; the Corps\u2019 Waterborne Commerce  Statistics; and Census Bureau statistics, among others\u2014we reviewed  relevant documentation about the agencies\u2019 data collection and quality  assurance processes, talked with knowledgeable officials from the  agencies about these data, and compared these data against other sources  of published information to determine data consistency and  reasonableness. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of providing high-level cost and revenue estimates by mode.", "We used federal statistical databases to obtain federal, state, and local  data for estimating government costs and revenues. We also used  nationwide data to estimate external costs. We recognize several  important limitations in our high-level analysis, such as discrepancies in  ton-mile estimates and difficulties in allocating costs between freight and  nonfreight users. However, we explain how we deal with such limitations  throughout the report by, for example, conducting sensitivity analyses to  understand changes in costs with respect to ton-miles. Further, this  analysis of high-level data is limited in the sense that it can obscure  variations in state spending and revenue policies, and external costs by  geographical location or by type of truck, locomotive, or marine engine.  Moreover, this type of high-level analysis does not consider how modes  compete with one another or the services or operations within each mode  that compete with one another (e.g., rail long-haul with long-distance  trucking); nor does it consider the complementary nature of freight  modes, wherein, freight moved by rail or waterways may also involve  trucks for at least some portion of its overall journey. Consequently, the  results should be viewed as representing averages across all of the  marginal shipments that were made under a wide variety of different  conditions in a wide variety of locations.

Public roads account for the majority of our nation\u2019s transportation  infrastructure mileage, reaching nearly every corner of the United States,  and as a result, enable trucks to move the greatest amount of freight on a  tonnage basis. However, tonnage as a measure does not capture important  aspects of freight mobility across the modes, such as the distances over  which freight moves. For making comparisons across the modes  throughout this report, we use ton-miles as a unit of measurement. Ton- miles measure the amount of freight moved, as well as the distance over  which it moves. Table 1 shows the estimates and sources for ton-miles of  freight moved on each mode for 2007, the most recent year that data are  available. Appendix I provides more detail on our methodology for  determining ton-miles used for the estimates in this report.", "Freight shipments can also move by more than one mode before reaching  their final destination. In particular, freight moved by rail or waterways  may also be moved by truck at some point to reach its final destination, as  rail and waterways may not reach locations that can be reached by truck.  On the other hand, trains and waterborne vessels typically have far greater  capacity than does a single freight truck, so rail and waterways generally  move large volumes of commodities (e.g., coal and grain) long distances  that would not be feasible by truck alone. Modes often work as  complements to complete a shipment. For example, a ton of grain may  move from a grain elevator by rail, be transported to a port on an inland  waterway, move by barge to another port on an inland waterway, and then  be distributed by truck to its final destinations. A particular type of  shipment known as \u201cintermodal\u201d is designed to move on multiple modes,  using a container that can be moved from a truck to a train to a ship  without handling any of the freight itself when changing modes. Such  freight movements are growing and FHWA forecasts that intermodal  freight will continue to increase in the future.", "In some cases, the modes may be substitutable for certain types of trips  and will compete directly for shipments or for segments of shipments  based on price and performance. For example, long-haul trucking and rail  shipments may be substitutable, or short sea shipping legs can be a  substitute for rail or truck shipments along coastal routes. The extent to  which mode-shifting is possible in the United States is difficult to estimate  and will largely be determined by the types of parameters discussed above,  such as whether shipping is feasible by another mode (e.g., rail lines or  waterways may not be available for some routes), or practical (e.g.,  sending heavy coal shipments by truck or time-sensitive shipments by rail  or waterways are not practical), and by the relative prices and other  service characteristics of shipping by different modes.

Governments also play a  role in regulating the freight industry, which we address in the next  section. FHWA, state departments of transportation, and local  transportation organizations plan and fund new highway infrastructure  and maintain existing highways. The Corps has the responsibility for  construction, operation, and maintenance of the nation\u2019s waterway  system. There is limited public sector funding for rail infrastructure. All  Class I railroads, which comprise about 91 percent of all railroad revenues,  are privately owned and, as one of the most capital-intensive industries in  the United States, make considerable investments in their own  transportation networks.", "Highway infrastructure. The federal government authorized over $190  billion for the federal-aid highway program for fiscal years 2005 through  2009. A small portion of this funding was specifically identified for  surface freight transportation projects, including $25 million for the freight Truck Parking Facilities program and $30 million for the Freight  Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant program. For the most part, however,  funding is provided for construction, reconstruction, restoration, and  rehabilitation of roads that serve both freight and nonfreight users.  Because the federal government\u2019s expenditures for highways are based, in  part, on the user pay principle, the government collects taxes and fees,  which flow into the Highway Trust Fund\u2014historically, the principal  mechanism for funding federal highway programs. The fund\u2019s highway  account reported revenues of about $34 billion in fiscal year 2007\u2014mainly  from fuel (diesel and gasoline) tax that constitutes the majority of  revenues from both freight and nonfreight users, as well as a variety of  taxes imposed on trucks used in freight movement, including a truck and  trailer sales tax, a heavy vehicle use tax, and a tire tax.

Consequently, highway funding shifted aw the contributions of highway users, breaking the link between highway  taxes paid and benefits received by users. The American Recovery  and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) further augmented  transportation spending using general fund revenues of about $48 billion,  of which about 57 percent was identified for federal highway projects.", "State and local governments also invest in public highways and roads.  Within the federal-aid highway program, the federal government is  responsible for funding 80 to 100 percent of highway project costs, and  state and local governments are responsible for the remainder of the costs.  State governments spent about $36 billion on capital outlays and about $21  billion more on maintenance of state-administered highways in 2007, while  local governments spent approximately $69 billion on public roads.  According to FHWA, state governments collected about $61 billion in user  revenue, and local governments collected about $4 billion from a  combination of fuel taxes, vehicle taxes and fees, and tolls. State and local  governments supplement user revenue with general fund appropriations to  support highway and road activities.", "Railroad infrastructure. The federal government has helped improve  public safety on freight railroad infrastructure by providing limited funds  to states for railroad-highway grade crossings and grants for relocating  railroad tracks away from urban centers. Since January 1, 2007, freight  railroads no longer pay federal fuel taxes, and there is no federal user fee  specific to freight railroads. However, the federal government pays freight  rail companies for intercity passenger train usage of the companies\u2019  railroad tracks to the extent that these costs are not recovered through  passenger fares. Recently, the Recovery Act funded two discretionary  grant programs, the Transportation Investment Generating Economic  Recovery (TIGER) grant program at $1.5 billion and the High-Speed  Intercity Passenger Rail program at $8 billion, both of which can provide  capital investment in railroad infrastructure. Additional funding for these  programs were made available through the 2010 appropriations for DOT,  nearly $600 million for TIGER grants and $2.5 billion for the high speed  rail program. Because these programs are new, they are not included in  the scope of our analysis of government spending on freight  transportation.", "Little systematic information is available about state programs and  financial assistance for the freight railroad industry. A 1997 survey of state  departments of transportation found 10 states with dedicated freight  railroad budgets exceeding $1 million annually. A few states (e.g.,  Alabama, North Dakota, and Tennessee) tax fuel for locomotives, but this  revenue is not always used for rail projects. Railroads also pay state and  local property taxes on their infrastructure; the nation\u2019s major railroads  paid $625 million in property taxes in 2008, according to the Association of  American Railroads.", "Waterway infrastructure. The Corps, under its civil works program, is  responsible for planning, constructing, operating, and maintaining the  nation\u2019s waterways used primarily by commercial vessels, as well as  recreational and commercial passenger boats along some sections of the  waterways. For fiscal year 2007, the Corps spent about $1.2 billion to  operate and maintain the inland waterways, as well as the nation\u2019s coastal  harbors and channels (deep and shallow draft), and $686 million more for  a variety of construction projects along inland waterways and coastal  harbors and channels. For the same year, the Saint Lawrence Seaway  Development Corporation budgeted about $33 million for operations and  maintenance activities and $1 million for construction activities. Much of  these funds are from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.", "The general fund pays for all of the Corps\u2019 operations and maintenance  activities and one-half of the inland waterway construction costs for  rehabilitating, modernizing, or replacing locks and dams. The other half  comes from commercial waterway users that pay fuel taxes which flow  into the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The Inland Waterways Users Board  and the National Academy of Public Administration have both reported on  inefficiencies in the delivery of construction projects which have led to  delays and cost escalation that have strained the trust fund and resulted in  fewer and less-beneficial projects being funded. Some waterborne  vessels are exempt from the fuel tax, including oceangoing ships,  passenger boats, recreational craft, or government vessels. Receipts  totaled about $101 million, including excise taxes and interest on  investments, in fiscal year 2007. In contrast, revenue for the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund comes largely from an excise tax on imports  imposed on commercial users of certain ports. The tax applies a second  time to cargo that has already arrived at a U.S. port, but is transferred by  barge or short-sea route to another U.S. port. Importers or shippers pay an  amount equal to 0.125 percent of the value of the commercial cargo  involved at the time of unloading. Exporters are exempted from the excise  tax. In fiscal year 2007, this trust fund received about $1.4 billion from tax  collections\u2014including $68 million from domestic shippers, which is  relevant to the scope of this study\u2014and $154 million from interest on  investments in U.S. treasury bonds. Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund  revenues exceed expenditures, and in 2007 the Fund was carrying a  balance of nearly $4 billion, which has continued to grow.

Governments can best promote economic efficiency in the freight  transportation sector by minimizing subsidies that produce gaps between  prices and marginal social costs and by correcting price gaps that can  occur naturally in the market.

First, there  are private costs, such as labor, equipment, and fuel that are typically paid  directly by freight service providers. Freight rail infrastructure falls into  this category, as it is mainly funded privately by the rail companies.  Second, there are the costs of public investments and services, such as the  construction, maintenance, and operations of highways and waterways.  These public costs are paid out of government budgets and can be funded  through a variety of general or targeted taxes and fees. Finally, there are  \u201cexternal\u201d costs, such as congestion, accidents, and health and  environmental damage caused by pollution that are generated while  transporting freight, that are not paid for directly by either the service  providers or by government. These external costs are imposed on other  members of society who are directly affected by these externalities. Each  of these cost categories can be divided further between marginal costs and  fixed costs. As noted earlier, marginal costs are those associated with the  production of additional units of service. In contrast, fixed costs, such as  those associated with the initial construction of infrastructure, are  incurred before any service can be provided; however, the production of  additional units of service does not add to these costs.", "In order to remain in business, private companies need to set prices that  not only will cover their private marginal costs, but that will also include a  margin that provides a sufficient rate of return to be able to obtain needed  investment funds from capital markets. In a competitive market economy,  only private costs will be passed on in prices to the final consumers of  freight services, unless government policies are designed to pass the  public and external costs on to those consumers as well. Governments can  recover the public costs that support freight transportation by imposing  taxes or fees on freight service providers. Competitive market forces  should lead service providers to pass the cost of these payments on to  their customers in the same manner that private costs are passed on. If  competitive pricing prevents a particular business from passing such costs  on to its customers, it may not earn a sufficient rate of return to remain in  business. To the extent that public costs are not covered by taxes or fees  levied on freight providers or consumers, governments would be providing  a subsidy to the industry, which is paid by other taxpayers. Governments  can also attempt to make freight service consumers bear the external  costs generated by service providers by imposing taxes or fees on those  providers in proportion to the external costs that they generate. Again,  these costs should be passed on to the customers or noncompetitive  businesses will drop out of the market. Government regulation of pollution  and other factors that generate external costs can be used in conjunction  with taxes and fees to address those costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "When Prices Do Not Reflect All Marginal Costs, Competition Can Be Distorted and Economic Efficiency Reduced", "paragraphs": ["The hypothetical scenarios in figure 2 illustrate how discrepancies  between marginal social costs (plus a competitive return on investment)  and prices, whether caused by government subsidies or by external costs,  can distort competition and cause inefficient allocations of resources in  the freight transportation sector. In the scenarios, a shipper has to  choose between two transportation modes to ship a package. Except for  price, the services provided by the two modes are equal in all respects,  such as timeliness and reliability. In the first scenario, Mode B uses $125 in  resources to ship the package; Mode A uses $100 in resources. Price  accurately reflects costs incurred to provide the freight service for both  modes. Looking to minimize expenses, the shipper makes the logical  decision and chooses the less expensive option (Mode A). The freight  service provider represented by Mode A is rewarded for providing service  more efficiently than the competitor, and the $25 of resources that  otherwise would have been used if the product were shipped by Mode B  can be used more efficiently in other ways to produce benefits for society.", "The second scenario in figure 2 shows the detrimental effects of a  subsidy. In this scenario, the government provides a subsidy to Mode B,  enabling it to charge a price that is $50 below its marginal costs. As in the  first scenario, the shipper selects the lower-priced option; however, in this  case the subsidy results in the service being provided by the higher-cost  producer. As a result, $25 of resources that otherwise could have been  used to provide other societal benefits are not used efficiently.", "The third scenario in figure 2 shows how external costs can distort  competition and reduce economic efficiency in a manner similar to  government subsidies. In this scenario, Mode B generates $50 in external  costs that are not reflected in the price charged to the shipper. The fact  that these costs are not passed on to the shipper makes Mode B more  competitive than it would be if it had to include those costs in the price.  Consequently, the shipper chooses Mode B, despite the fact that society  bears $25 more in costs than if the other mode had provided the service.", "When prices do not reflect marginal social costs, investment decisions are  also distorted, potentially resulting in a misallocation of resources. Much  like a freight service shipper whose primary concern is price, an investor  that is primarily concerned with profit potential is not concerned with the  social costs that a freight service provider generates if they do not affect  the provider\u2019s net profit. Therefore, an investor looking to maximize his or  her return will invest resources in the more profitable provider regardless  of social costs. From an economywide perspective, this is a misallocation  of resources because those investment resources could be used more  efficiently if applied to another area in the economy that is more efficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "There Can Be a Tradeoff between Recovering Fixed Public Infrastructure Costs and Promoting the Efficient Use of Existing Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Certain freight transportation costs, such as the construction of new  infrastructure, are considered to be \u201cfixed\u201d (rather than marginal) in the  sense that they do not increase as use of the infrastructure increases. As  an example, the construction cost of a bridge is a fixed cost, but pavement  wear is a marginal cost. In freight transportation, fixed costs to build  infrastructure are generally large relative to the marginal costs of an  additional vehicle trip on an uncongested highway. Consequently, if  governments were to charge users only for the marginal costs of their use,  they usually would not be able to recover the full costs of building much of  the infrastructure. As private companies that own and invest in their own  infrastructure, freight railroads must pass on fixed costs to customers in  order to remain in business. However, once the infrastructure is in place,  charging users a portion of the fixed costs each time they use the  infrastructure (on top of a charge for any marginal costs they impose) can  result in underutilization of the infrastructure. Appendix V outlines a  number of different ways that governments can address this tradeoff  between efficiency and cost recovery.

The benefit  principle holds that government services should be financed by those who  benefit from those services. In the case of transportation funding, motor  fuel taxes adhere more closely to the benefit principle than does the  income tax because fuel consumption is correlated with road use.  However, motor fuel taxes are regressive, meaning that lower income  individuals pay a greater share of their income toward these taxes than do  higher income individuals. This regressivity can conflict with the ability-to- pay principle, unless compensating relief to lower income individuals is  provided in other parts of the tax system.", "Other objectives may be important to policymakers, such as whether or  not a policy can be administered cost effectively. For example, attempts to  achieve a high level of precision in marginal cost pricing through taxes and  fees carry with them an administrative burden, as we discuss later in this  report. The administrative costs of implementing finely calibrated versions  of a tax may outweigh any efficiency gains achieved through increased  precision. Efficiency in the freight transportation sector depends on prices  fully reflecting marginal costs on a shipment-by-shipment basis; however,  subsidies and external costs can vary considerably from one shipment to  another based on the geographic origin and destination, time of day, and  other factors.

Specifically, we estimate that freight trucking costs that were  not passed on to customers were at least 6 times greater than rail costs  and at least 9 times greater than waterways costs per million ton miles of  freight transport. Most of these costs were external costs imposed on  society. In particular, the modes generate external costs related to  accidents and pollution that are not reflected in prices.

In a competitive economy, private  costs such as payments for labor and fuel are generally passed on in prices  to the final consumers of freight services; therefore, those costs did not  need to be included in our estimation of costs that are not passed on. We  are also able to estimate the amount of revenue that governments collect  from highway taxes and fees, such as those on motor fuels and tires that  are associated with marginal activity. (We use the payment of such taxes  and fees as a measure of the extent to which governments have passed  some of the nonprivate costs on to final consumers). The extent to which  the nonprivate marginal costs exceed tax and fee payments indicates the  extent to which some nonprivate marginal costs are not reflected in prices  charged to freight consumers. We refer to this difference as \u201cunpriced  costs.\u201d The available evidence suggests that, on average, an additional  million ton-miles of freight service provided by trucking generates  significantly more unpriced costs than an additional million ton-miles of  either freight rail or waterways service generates. We estimate that over  $55,000 per million ton-miles of service in unpriced freight trucking costs  were not passed on to consumers.

The  estimates we present for pollution and other external costs are based on  conservative volume estimates and valuation approaches from the  available literature. Moreover, we do not include cost estimates for carbon  dioxide (CO2) emissions because of the considerable uncertainty  surrounding such estimates. For these reasons, our bottom-line estimates  for marginal social costs not passed on to consumers are likely to  represent minimum values for those costs.", "Marginal public infrastructure costs\u2014the second cost item in table 3\u2014 relate to public highway spending attributable to miles driven by freight  trucks (i.e., pavement preservation costs per million ton-miles).

We also estimate from  FHWA data that pavement preservation costs borne by all levels of  government attributable to all single-unit and combination trucks  (excluding pickup trucks) averaged about 6.1 cents per vehicle miles  traveled (VMT). The cost per ton-mile would increase with truck weight  and decrease with the number of axles. The costs also varied by location  (urban or rural), type of road surface, temperature, and other factors.  When we compared single-unit and combination trucks using DOT data,  we found that marginal revenues exceeded the marginal infrastructure  costs by 4.8 cents per VMT for single-unit trucks and by 3.5 cents per VMT  for combination trucks, meaning that both types of trucks pay more than  their share of pavement preservation costs.

The closest asset category for waterways freight includes all  investments in ships and boats. CBO estimated the effective tax rate on  these investments to be 16.5 percent. These relative effects are on top of  any benefits due to public infrastructure investments that trucking and  waterways receive over railroads.

We also noted that the extent to which modes are substitutable is  difficult to estimate and will largely be determined by whether shipping is  feasible or practical by another mode, and by the relative prices and other  service characteristics of shipping by different modes. In addition to  mode-shifting, price changes can prompt other economic responses in the  short run, such as the use of lighter-weight materials; over the longer term  there is greater potential for responses that will shape the overall  distribution and use of freight services.", "Costs can vary widely based on the specific characteristics of an individual  shipment, such as the geography and population density of the shipment\u2019s  route, and the fuel-efficiency of the specific vehicle carrying it. Ideally,  policy that is able to align marginal prices with marginal costs on a  shipment-by-shipment basis would provide the greatest economic benefit.  However, achieving this in practice would typically result in high  administrative costs. For example, freight carriers may have to purchase  new technologies or be required to maintain more complex and detailed  records. Similarly, government agencies would likely have to devote more  resources to enforcement efforts. As a result, economic efficiency could  be reduced because the costs to administer the policy may actually exceed  the benefits achieved.", "Less targeted interventions (e.g., charging fees or taxes based on average  costs, subsidizing more efficient alternatives, or broadly applying safety or  emission regulations) can have impacts on users and potentially change  the overall distribution of freight across modes or demand for freight  overall, but provide fewer benefits. Further, more general policy  interventions can push too much of the cost onto users who previously  had below-average unpriced costs and too little of the cost onto users who  previously had above-average unpriced costs. For example, a policy that  charges freight providers on the amount of their emissions would result in  an overcharge for those traveling in rural areas where few people live and  an undercharge for those traveling in more densely populated urban areas.  External costs from the same amount of emissions would be higher in  more densely populated urban areas because more people are exposed to  the pollutants.", "Other complexities arise when attempting to align fixed costs and  revenues. In general, our current system is set up as a user pay system,  wherein the costs of building and maintaining the system are to be borne  by those who benefit. However, available data suggest that in the trucking  and waterways modes, current government mechanisms to recover the  fixed costs associated with public infrastructure do not achieve full  recovery. Aligning fixed costs and revenues for public infrastructure\u2014 whose multiple users include passenger cars and recreational boats along  with freight trucks and vessels\u2014is a complex task requiring detailed cost  allocation studies, which are expensive and time-consuming, and are not  done regularly. Furthermore, policies designed to recover fixed costs can  conflict with policies designed to address gaps between marginal social  costs and revenues. As discussed previously, if governments were to  charge users only for the marginal costs of their use, in many cases they  would not be able to recover the costs of building the infrastructure to  begin with. However, once the infrastructure is in place, charging users a  portion of the fixed costs each time they use the infrastructure (on top of a  charge for any marginal costs they impose) would likely result in  underutilization of the infrastructure because some potential users would  not be willing to bear the higher cost. Appendix V provides options that  governments can take to address this tradeoff between efficiency and cost  recovery.", "Finally, marginal social costs can vary widely across jurisdictions, and  have varying levels of impact, which has implications for the level of  government that is best suited to administer a policy response. For  example, congestion costs are local in nature, thus cities, counties, or local  authorities are in the best position to develop interventions that reduce  those costs, or attempt to price those costs. On the other hand, some air  pollution costs can be imposed on multiple states, the entire nation, or  other countries. State or local governments may not be equipped or  institutionally capable of implementing policies that are regional in nature  and affect multiple states. National policy responses to pollution and  emissions must also consider that air pollution reductions can be achieved  across a number of different industries, potentially at lower cost than in  the transportation sector. Furthermore, although considerable research  has gone into estimating the effects of climate change, there is uncertainty  around how increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases  and temperature within ecosystems and economic growth will vary across  regions, countries, and economic sectors, and therefore, appropriate  policy responses require international coordination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report to DOT and the Corps for  review and comment.

State  and local governments are generally responsible for maintaining the  nation\u2019s highways, and therefore, we again used a proportion derived from  data from the 1997 study and applied it to Highway Statistics Series table  SF-2 (State Disbursements for Highways) containing maintenance and  services figures to estimate operations and maintenance costs attributed  to freight trucking at the state level. As with the federal spending data, we  considered system preservation expenditures to be the best available  approximation of costs associated with marginal highway use. We  consider all other costs, such as new construction, system enhancements,  and routine maintenance to be fixed costs.", "To estimate marginal state revenues attributable to freight trucks from  fiscal years 2000 through 2006, we first determined the average, annual  total receipts from motor fuels receipts (minus penalties and fines)  reported in table MF-1 (State Motor Fuel Taxes and Related Receipts) and  tolls from bridge, tunnel, and road crossings receipts reported in table SF- 3B (State Administered Toll Road and Crossing Facilities). We then  determined what shares of these revenues were attributed to freight trucks  as follows: except for tolls, the revenue shares from fuel for freight trucks  were based on results from the 1997 Highway Cost Allocation Study. The  revenue shares for each year after 2000 were adjusted for changes in VMT,  motor fuels consumed, and vehicle registrations. Since the 1997 study did  not allocate tolls, we assumed that for each freight truck category, the  share of tolls was equal to its share of total VMT in a given year. For fixed  revenues, we also included registration, drivers license, and weight- distance receipts, as reported in table MV-2 (State Motor-Vehicle and  Motor-Carrier Tax Receipts), in our calculations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local Highway Infrastructure Marginal and Fixed Costs and Revenues", "paragraphs": ["We also developed marginal and fixed cost estimates for local highway  spending and revenues attributed to freight trucks. For local expenditures,  we summarized local disbursements on highways, averaged from 2000  through 2006 using table LGF-2 from the Highway Statistics Series. The  table grouped data by capital outlays, maintenance and traffic services,  administration and miscellaneous, and law enforcement, among other  categories. We grouped the data as closely as we could into categories  approximating those that FHWA used in their 1997 study and then  allocated these disbursements to single-unit and combination trucks based  on those trucks\u2019 shares of the 1997 categories. Given that capital  construction and system preservation was reported as a single category,  the only option we had for estimating the amount spent on pavement  rehabilitation (which we used to benchmark marginal costs) was to  assume that pavement rehabilitation accounted for the same share of total  capital costs as it did in 2000. On the revenue side, we again used tables  from the Highway Statistics Series: table LDF (Local Government  Receipts from State and Local Highway User Revenue) and table LGF-3B  (Receipts of Local Toll Facilities). Table LDF reported motor fuel and  motor vehicle revenues combined as a single number. Using data from the  1997 cost study, we estimated that motor fuel accounted for 45 percent of  combined motor fuel and motor vehicle revenue in 1994. We used the  trucks\u2019 shares of local motor fuel and motor vehicle taxes from the 1997  study to allocate our updated revenue amounts to trucks. For tolls, we  used the same allocation assumption as we did for state toll revenues.  Local revenues account for less than 3 percent of the marginal revenue  and fixed revenue amounts that we report in tables 3 and 5 respectively.  Table 6 summarizes expenditures and revenues by mode by government  per million ton-miles.", "All Class I railroad infrastructure is privately owned, and most other  classes of railroads are also privately owned. However, the federal  government provides some limited assistance to privately owned railroads,  but it was negligible for the purposes of our analysis. The federal  government no longer levies any federal excise tax on railroads. There is  little available evidence on the extent to which railroads receive financial  assistance from states or local governments, but this evidence suggests  that these amounts are negligible.

We allocated  the Corps\u2019 total operations and maintenance harbors and channels (deep  and shallow draft) expenditures by year to each state based on the Harbor  Maintenance Trust Fund expenditures by state. We also obtained  waterway infrastructure investment costs by project by state from the  Corps. We allocated the expenditures to domestic freight based on  tonnage\u2014specifically, the percent of total tonnage moved through each  state that is domestic waterways freight\u2014as reported by Corps data  supporting table 4-1, Waterborne Commerce by States, Waterborne  Commerce of the United States, National Summaries. Such allocation may  overstate costs attributable to domestic freight operations for at least two  reasons. First, CRS reports that a significant amount of harbor spending is  directed toward harbors that handle little cargo, and therefore the primary  beneficiaries of the spending will be nonfreight users of the harbors and  channels. Second, dredging at U.S. ports may be done primarily to  accommodate ever-larger container ships involved in oceanic trade, and  therefore costs attributable to domestic trade may be negligible in those  cases. However, without a waterways cost allocation study, little more is  known about how costs may be distributed among the various users of  harbors, channels, and other waterways, and thus tonnage appears to be  the most reasonable method to allocate costs.", "Inland waterways operations, maintenance, and construction costs.  After consultations with a Corps official, we allocated 50 percent of the  Corps\u2019 inland waterways operations, maintenance, and construction  spending from fiscal years 2000 through 2006 to freight. We used 50  percent because federal law establishes a 50/50 federal/nonfederal cost- share arrangement for construction. We could not definitively determine  the extent to which waterways freight activity accounted for all waterway  activity. Two studies provide a wide range of possibilities. A 1980 Corps  study indicated that for selected waterways (the Ohio, Allegheny,  Monongahela, Lower and Upper Mississippi, among others) within the  boundaries of three Corps districts\u2014St. Paul, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh\u2014 the average waterways freight activity accounted for 75 percent. More  recently, however, a 2010 preliminary report concluded that a wide range  of consumers benefit from the pools of water created and operated to  facilitate commercial navigation and other uses, but commercial  navigation itself appears to be a relatively small beneficiary of this system.  This finding was based on a limited scope of work, and without further  research, allocating costs or revenues to commercial freight has  limitations.", "State and local governments spend their own funds for investments in  state-owned port facilities involved in domestic freight transportation.

DOT has  another series of ton-mile estimates produced by the Bureau of  Transportation Statistics (BTS); however, according to DOT officials the  BTS series does not capture as much domestic truck freight activity as the  FAF estimate. We determined that the FAF data were more appropriate  for the purpose of presenting our cost and revenue data on a per-ton-mile  basis because the cost and revenues data we used were for the broadest  definition of truck freight traffic. One difficulty in using the FAF  estimates is that 2007 is the only recent year for which DOT has applied  the current FAF methodology. DOT in previous years applied a differentmethodology to estimate ton-miles based on 2002 data. However, given  that the methodology for estimating these figures changed significantly  between 2002 and 2007, DOT cautions that the estimates from the 2 years should not be combined in the same time series. mile estimates for all of the years that we needed, we multiplied the BTS  figure for each year by the ratio of the FAF estimate to the BTS esti mate  for 2007.
