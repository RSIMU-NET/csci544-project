Most of the records were from calls to a consumer phone line the company maintained. Metabolife International voluntarily provided the call records to GAO. Specifically, GAO (1) examined the extent to which consumer information in the call records was comprehensive, interpretable, and consistently recorded, (2) counted the number of call records reporting types of adverse events that FDA had identified in 1997 as serious or potentially serious, and (3) compared GAO's findings to those of six other reviews of the call records, including one by Metabolife International."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Adverse event reports generally are not sufficient on their own to establish that reported problems are caused by the use of a particular product, but can signal potential health problems that deserve investigation. The information in the Metabolife International call records was limited. Call records were sometimes difficult to understand, and consumer information was not consistently recorded. In some cases, the evidence for a report of an adverse event was limited to a single word on the record. Most call records also did not record complete information about potentially relevant items such as the consumer's age, sex, weight, and height. Information about both the amount of product used and the duration of use was recorded for 60 percent of the call records. Handwritten call records were difficult to read and understand. By GAO's categorization, 14,684 of the call records contained reports of at least one adverse event. GAO found that there were 92 reports of the serious adverse events identified in FDA's proposed label warning--18 reported heart attacks, 26 reported strokes, 43 reported seizures, and 5 reported deaths. Other types of adverse events identified as serious or potentially serious by FDA in 1997 that were reported in the call records included significant elevation in blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm, loss of consciousness, and systemic rash. Because of the inherent limitations of adverse event reports and the incomplete nature of these call records, it can not be established from the information available to GAO that the adverse events reported were caused by Metabolife 356. All of the reviews of Metabolife International call records--one by Metabolife International; three by consultants commissioned by Metabolife International; one by the minority staff of the Committee on Government Reform, House of Representatives; one by the RAND Corporation; and one by GAO--found reports of serious adverse events, although none reported identical results. For the set of adverse events counted by Metabolife International--heart attack, stroke, seizure, death, and cardiac arrest--GAO's counts were similar to those of the other reviews. GAO counted 96 such reports and the counts of the other reviews ranged from 65 to 107. In commenting on a draft of this report, FDA discussed the value of reports of adverse events in helping to understand the causes of such events."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medical experts have expressed concerns about the safety of dietary  supplements containing ephedra or ephedrine alkaloids, which are used by  millions of Americans annually. On February 28, 2003, the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) announced several proposed changes to its  regulation of dietary supplements containing ephedra, including requiring  a product label warning that \u201cHeart attack, stroke, seizure, and death have  been reported after consumption of ephedrine alkaloids.\u201d As of  September 27, 2002, FDA had received approximately 1,800 adverse event  reports regarding consumers of dietary supplements containing ephedra.  Of these, 322 concerned Metabolife 356, a weight loss product first  marketed in 1995 by Metabolife International, a large manufacturer of  dietary supplements containing ephedra. Adverse event reports can signal  potential health problems that deserve additional investigation, but, on  their own, generally are not sufficient to establish that the reported  problems were caused by use of the product.", "Metabolife International has also received complaints about adverse  health events among users of Metabolife 356. Between August and  December 2002, Metabolife International made available to the public  redacted copies of nearly 16,000 pages of documentation that it identified  as containing reports of adverse events among consumers of Metabolife  356. These complaints, which were received between May 1997 and July  2002, had not been previously released to FDA. Most of them were records  of calls received through a consumer health information phone line  established by Metabolife International in 1998 and staffed by its nurses.  Metabolife International officials told us that the phone line was  established to provide information to consumers regarding appropriate  use of Metabolife 356. In letters to the Texas Department of Health and  FDA, company officials described the phone line as a \u201csafety monitoring  procedure\u201d for the reporting of medical complaints. The call records  ranged from handwritten notes to printed versions of records that had  been entered into a database developed by Metabolife International. These  call records have been the subject of six previous reviews: one by  Metabolife International, three by consultants commissioned by  Metabolife International, one by the minority staff of the Committee on  Government Reform, House of Representatives, and one by the RAND  Corporation.", "You asked us to review the content of all health-related call records made  public by Metabolife International. Specifically, you asked us to answer  the following questions. (1) To what extent was consumer information in  the call records comprehensive, interpretable, and consistently recorded?  (2) How many call records reported health-related problems, and how  many of those were serious? (3) How do our counts of reported serious  adverse events compare with those of other reviews for those events  counted by Metabolife International?", "In responding to your request, we reviewed all the pages of documentation  voluntarily provided to us by Metabolife International. We did not  independently verify that we received all of the call records held by  Metabolife International. We excluded from our review call records that  duplicated other records.  To determine the extent to which consumer  information was comprehensive, interpretable, and consistently recorded  in the call records, we recorded information about the adverse event,  demographic information about the individual consumer, and other details  in the call record. Specifically, we recorded background information  similar to that used by FDA in the reporting of adverse events, including  age, sex, weight, height, the amount of Metabolife 356 used, the duration  of use, and whether any medical history was noted in the call record.", "To assess how many call records reported health-related problems and  how many of those were serious, we first counted the number of call  records that reported at least one adverse event. Within this set of call  records, we then counted the number of reports of heart attack, stroke,  seizure, and death\u2014the types of serious adverse events identified in FDA\u2019s  proposed label warning. We also counted the number of reports of the   23 other types of adverse events that were described as serious or  potentially serious in FDA\u2019s 1997 proposed rule on dietary supplements  containing ephedrine alkaloids. For call records that did not report any of  the above adverse events, we counted the number of records, but did not  count the number of other specific types of adverse events reported.", "We classified events in the call records based solely on the words and  phrases therein; we did not attempt to diagnose a consumer\u2019s condition or  to otherwise interpret the information presented. We did not apply  medical judgment in the process of classifying events and we did not  independently verify the accuracy of the information in the records or  determine the validity of the claims made in the call records. We also did  not attempt to determine whether Metabolife 356 caused the reported  adverse events. Our results may either overestimate or underestimate the  number and severity of adverse events because the call records generally  do not include medical diagnoses made by qualified professionals.", "To determine how our counts of reported serious adverse events compare  with those of other reviews, we examined the six previous reviews of  Metabolife International\u2019s call records.

The product label recommends that adults take  one to two caplets two to three times per day or every 4 hours, not to  exceed eight caplets per day. Warnings on the product label suggest that a  health care professional be consulted by individuals who are using any  other dietary supplement, prescription drug, or over-the-counter drug  containing ephedrine alkaloids or who have, or have a family history of,  any of 11 health conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure,  diabetes, recurrent headaches, and depression. The label also  recommends that persons should not use the product for more than   12 weeks and that exceeding the recommended amount may cause serious  adverse health effects including heart attack or stroke. Other possible side  effects mentioned on the label include rapid heartbeat, dizziness, severe  headache, and shortness of breath. The complete product label is in  appendix II.", "The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 created a  framework for FDA\u2019s regulation of dietary supplements as part of its  oversight of food safety. Dietary supplements are generally marketed  without prior FDA review of their safety and effectiveness.  Manufacturers of dietary supplements are responsible for ensuring the  safety of the dietary supplements they sell. Therefore, FDA relies on  voluntary reports of adverse events from consumers, health professionals,  and others in its effort to oversee the safety of marketed dietary  supplements.", "Although there are no adverse event reporting requirements for  manufacturers of dietary supplements, there are such requirements for  many other products regulated by FDA. Various types of adverse events  associated with the use of human drugs and biologics, animal drugs,  animal feeds containing animal drugs, medical devices, infant formulas,  and radiation-emitting devices must be reported to FDA. In addition to  dietary supplements, other products regulated by FDA that do not require  adverse event reporting are foods, cosmetics, and color additives. (See  app. III for details about adverse event reporting requirements.)", "Voluntary adverse event reporting systems can be valuable tools for  identifying potentially serious health issues that may be associated with  the use of a product and for maintaining ongoing surveillance. FDA has  used adverse event reports to identify issues for further investigation and,  as we previously reported, it has used adverse event reports to help  identify dietary supplements for which evidence of harm existed, and has  issued warnings and alerts for dietary supplements. However, by  themselves, adverse event reporting systems generally are not sufficient to  establish that a product caused the reported health problem. As we noted  in 1999, all voluntary surveillance systems, including FDA\u2019s adverse event  reporting system, have certain weaknesses. These include  underreporting, reporting biases, difficulties estimating population  exposure, and poor report quality. For example, the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) Inspector General reported that a study  commissioned by FDA estimated that FDA receives reports for less than   1 percent of adverse events associated with dietary supplements.  In  addition, it is often difficult to rule out other possible explanations for the  event; for example, the event may have been caused by preexisting  medical conditions, or by the concurrent use of prescription drugs, over- the-counter drugs, or other supplements. For these reasons, data from  adverse event reports alone cannot be used to determine if the occurrence  of a symptom among product users is unusually high.", "Between August and December 2002, Metabolife International released  copies of 15,948 pages of documents that it said contained call records  that reported adverse events associated with Metabolife 356 that the  company had received from May 1997 through July 2002.

Relatively few of these  records involved consumers who reported taking too much Metabolife 356  or using it for too long a period.
