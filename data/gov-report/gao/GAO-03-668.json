First, GAO found that SPAWAR centers' budgeted gross carryover for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 was significantly less than the reported actual year-end gross carryover. Budgeted gross carryover was understated primarily due to problems with estimating the underlying customer order data. For example, for fiscal year 2002, SPAWAR's budgeted amount for customer orders was 88 percent less than the reported actual orders received. Second, SPAWAR's reported actual carryover balances were also unreliable and adjusted downward by hundreds of millions of dollars. These adjustments understated carryover and resulted in Navy reports to the Congress showing that SPAWAR carryover balances for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 did not exceed DOD's 3-month carryover standard. SPAWAR was able to report reduced carryover balances for the following reasons. As GAO previously reported, the DOD guidance for calculating the number of months of carryover allowed carryover to be adjusted and understated. DOD agreed with GAO's previous recommendation and in December 2002 changed its carryover guidance. SPAWAR centers used accounting entries to manipulate the amount of customer orders for the sole purpose of reducing reported carryover below the 3-month standard. For example, the centers did this for at least $50 million at the end of fiscal year 2001. SPAWAR officials issued guidance in September 2002 discontinuing this practice. Finally, SPAWAR had not taken key steps to verify the underlying financial data on which reported actual carryover is based. The SPAWAR centers had only recently begun conducting the required tri-annual reviews of such data, which DOD has required since 1996. However, the reviews were ineffective, including the exclusion of slightly less than half of their reported actual carryover from the review process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This is the third in a planned series of reports that discusses the Defense  Working Capital Fund fiscal year-end workload funding issue, generally  referred to as \u201ccarryover.\u201d  Section 1051 of the Floyd D.

Excessive amounts of carryover financed with customer appropriations  may indicate excessive or unneeded funds and are subject to reductions by  DOD and the congressional defense committees during the budget review  process.

DOD policy also requires  the activity groups to establish their sales prices prior to the start of each  fiscal year and to apply these predetermined or \u201cstabilized\u201d prices to most  orders received from customers during the year\u2014regardless of when the  work is actually accomplished or what costs are actually incurred.", "Customers use appropriated funds to finance the orders placed with the  SPAWAR systems centers.  When a systems center accepts the customer  order, its own obligational authority is increased and the customer\u2019s  appropriation is obligated by the amount of the order.  The working capital  fund activity incurs obligations for costs, such as material and labor, to  perform the work.", "In addition to receiving orders from customers to do work as part of the  working capital fund, SPAWAR systems centers also award hundreds of  millions of dollars in contracts with the private sector for work to be  performed for the centers\u2019 customers.  These contracts and related work  are not included in the working capital fund from a financial standpoint  because the contractors directly bill the customers for work performed and  the customers directly pay the contractors.

Carryover consists of both the  unfinished portion of work started but not yet completed, as well as  requested work that has not yet commenced.  To manage carryover, DOD  converted the dollar amount of carryover to equivalent months of work.   This was done to put the magnitude of the carryover in proper perspective.   For example, if an activity group performs $100 million of work in a year  and had $100 million in carryover at year-end, it would have 12 months of  carryover.  However, if another activity group performs $400 million of  work in a year and had $100 million in carryover at year-end, this group  would have 3 months of carryover.", "The congressional defense committees and DOD have acknowledged that  some carryover is necessary at fiscal year-end if working capital funds are  to operate efficiently and effectively.  In 1996, DOD established a 3-month  carryover standard for all the working capital fund activities except for the  contract portion of the Air Force depot maintenance activity group.  In  May 2001, we reported that DOD did not have a basis for its carryover  standard and recommended that DOD determine the appropriate carryover  standard for the depot maintenance, ordnance, and research and  development activity groups.  Based on our recommendation, in December  2002, DOD revised its carryover policy for working capital fund activities.   Under the revised method, DOD eliminated the 3-month standard, and the  allowable amount of carryover is to be based on the overall disbursement  rate of the customers\u2019 appropriations financing the work.  Too little  carryover could result in some activity groups not having work to perform  at the beginning of the fiscal year, resulting in the inefficient use of  personnel.  On the other hand, too much carryover could result in an  activity group receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not  performing the work until well into the next fiscal year or subsequent  years.

These decision makers use carryover  information to determine whether the SPAWAR systems centers have too  much carryover.  If the systems centers have too much carryover, the  decision makers may reduce the customers\u2019 budgets and use these  resources for other purposes.  For example, during its review of the fiscal  year 2003 budget, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) noted that the Navy research and development activities  carryover had been steadily increasing from about $2.2 billion in fiscal year  1997 to about $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2003.  Since a significant portion of  the carryover was related to work that was to be contracted out, the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) reduced the customer  funding by $161.1 million because these efforts could be funded in fiscal  year 2004 with no impact on performance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Customers\u2019 Underestimated Budgeted Orders Caused Understated Budgeted Gross Carryover", "paragraphs": ["SPAWAR systems centers\u2019 reported actual year-end gross carryover was  substantially greater than their budgeted gross carryover.

They also  stated that the dollar amount of orders that the systems centers receive  from customers must match the dollar amount of orders that customers  submit in their appropriated fund budgets.  Customers only record in their  budgets those orders that they will be sending directly to the systems  centers.  If a customer initially allocates budgeted funds to an activity not  related to the working capital fund\u2014which is a third party\u2014and the third  party places the order with a SPAWAR systems center, the customer\u2019s  budget reflects that these funds went to a third party.  This results in the  amount of budgeted orders that the systems centers receive from  customers being understated.   Navy headquarters officials stated that this  is not an easy problem to resolve because there are many customers and no  one person or office is responsible for fixing the problem and it is hard to  pinpoint which customers are not budgeting correctly.", "Navy headquarters budgeting officials also stated that the fiscal year 2001  and 2002 budgets further understated gross carryover and orders for the  following three reasons.  First, the Naval Computers and  Telecommunications Command merged with SPAWAR, which resulted in  about $125 million of additional orders being received in fiscal year 2001  than was reflected in SPAWAR systems centers\u2019 budget.  Second, the Navy  changed its policy on work performed on certain types of work orders  placed with the San Diego Systems Center.  As a result, customers placed  more orders for work that was contracted out by the working capital fund  than was originally budgeted for in fiscal years 2001 and 2002.  Third, the  SPAWAR systems centers received $166.7 million in orders financed by the  Defense Emergency Response Fund in fiscal year 2002 that was not  reflected in the SPAWAR systems centers\u2019 budget.  These funds were  provided via a supplemental appropriation.", "Navy headquarters officials were aware of this budgeting problem and  issued guidance in March 2002 on preparing the fiscal 2004/2005 budget  estimates that stressed the importance of customers accurately preparing  budget estimates for orders placed with the Navy Working Capital Fund,  including the SPAWAR systems centers.  The guidance also stated that (1) it  was imperative that all funds to be sent to the Navy Working Capital Fund  be accurately reflected in the budget and (2) customers have historically  underreported the funds to be placed with the Navy Working Capital Fund  (particularly with the research and development business area that  includes the SPAWAR systems centers) and overreported the use of these  funds in other areas."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reported Actual Carryover Balances Were Consistently Understated", "paragraphs": ["In addition to understating budgeted gross carryover, SPAWAR systems  centers also consistently understated their reported actual carryover.

Because of the  military services\u2019 concerns about (1) the methodology used to compute the  months of carryover and (2) the reductions that were being made to  customer budgets because of excess carryover, Defense performed a joint  review of carryover in 1996 to determine if the 3-month standard should  be revised.  Based on the joint review, DOD decided to retain the 3-month  carryover standard for all working capital fund activity groups except Air  Force contract depot maintenance.  Furthermore, as a result of the review  and concerns expressed by the Navy, DOD also approved several policy  changes that had the effect of increasing the carryover standard for all  working capital fund activities.  Specifically, under the policy implemented  after the 1996 review, certain categories of orders, such as those from non- DOD customers, and contractual obligations, such as SPAWAR system  centers\u2019 contracts with private sector firms for research and development  work, can be excluded from the carryover balance that is used to  determine whether the carryover standard has been exceeded.", "These policy changes were documented in an August 2, 1996, DOD decision  paper that provided the following formula for calculating the number of  months of carryover.

As table 3 shows, these  adjustments have allowed the systems centers to significantly reduce  actual reported gross carryover by hundreds of millions of dollars,  resulting in reported carryover below the 3-month standard.  As discussed  below, we do not agree with how the Navy interpreted DOD\u2019s guidance for  using contractual obligations and related revenue in calculating carryover.   Our analysis of the systems centers\u2019 adjustments to their carryover  amounts shown in table 3 found that contractual obligations accounted for  75 percent to 89 percent of the dollar adjustments made.", "In May 2001, we reported that the months of carryover reported by Navy  activity groups, which include the SPAWAR systems centers, would more  accurately reflect the actual backlog of in-house work if adjustments for  contract obligations affected both contract carryover and contract  revenue.  As shown in figure 1, DOD\u2019s formula for calculating months of  carryover is based on the ratio of adjusted orders carried over to revenue.   The formula specifies that gross carryover should be reduced by the  amount of contract obligations.  However, DOD did not provide clear  guidance on whether downward adjustments for the revenue associated  with contract services should also be made.  Unless this is done, the  number of months of reported carryover will be understated.", "In our May 2001 report we recommended, among other things, that the  revenue used in calculating months of carryover be adjusted (reduced) for  revenue earned for work performed by contractors.  However, as discussed  below, until recently DOD had not changed its policy for calculating  carryover.  As a result, the Navy did not adjust the revenue amount used in  the denominator of the calculation and, therefore, continued to understate  its reported carryover in its budget submissions to the Congress through  fiscal year 2003.  Navy officials informed us that they used total revenue in  their calculation because total revenue represents the full operating  capability of a given activity group to accomplish a full year\u2019s level of  workload.  Further, even though Navy officials acknowledged that the  revenue amount used in the calculation includes revenue earned from  contracts, they stated the reason for not removing contract-related revenue  from the denominator of the calculation was that the numerator of the  calculation includes carryover (funds) related to work for which contracts  would eventually be awarded but which had not yet been awarded at fiscal  year-end.  In addition, Navy officials told us that the accounting systems  cannot readily break out what portion of the total revenue amount is  contract-related.  They further told us that the revenue information can be  extracted from the system, but doing so involves a lot of work to develop  the program(s) necessary to obtain the information.", "When the Navy reduces the dollar amount of carryover (numerator) by the  amount of contractual obligations and does not reduce the revenue amount  (denominator) for revenue associated with contracts, it is not being  consistent with the use of adjustments in the formula to calculate  carryover.  Because the Navy cannot readily determine the amount of  contract-related revenue, we asked SPAWAR headquarters to estimate what  the amount would be for the systems centers based on the same criteria  they use to determine the dollar amount of contractual obligations to be  deducted in the carryover calculation.  SPAWAR\u2019s estimate shows that 63  percent of the total revenue amount used in calculating the SPAWAR  systems centers\u2019 number of months of actual carryover reported for fiscal  year 2002 is related to revenue associated with contractual services.  By not  reducing total revenue used in the calculation for revenue related to work  performed by contractors, the systems centers\u2019 reported months of  carryover for that fiscal year were understated.", "In response to our May 2001 report, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) agreed that the methodology for calculating carryover  needed to be revised.  In December 2002, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) issued new guidance on carryover for working capital fund  activities.  Under the revised methodology, the formula shown in figure 1  has been eliminated and, therefore, working capital fund activities can no  longer reduce reported carryover by the amount of their contractual  obligations.  DOD adopted the revised methodology for the Defense  Working Capital Fund fiscal year 2004 budget estimates, but DOD has not  yet issued written procedures to ensure that the services consistently  implement the new policy.

Customer work that is not  performed by the working capital fund is referred to as direct cite work.   Under the direct cite method of performing work, the working capital fund  acts as an agent to get the work done through a private sector contractor.   Customer funds that finance work done on a direct cite basis are not  included in the working capital fund.  Instead, the customer uses the direct  cite funds to directly pay private sector contractors for the work performed  rather than reimbursing or paying the working capital fund.  Because the  funds for direct cite work are not part of the working capital fund, there is  no carryover associated with this work.  Therefore, the work is not subject  to DOD\u2019s 3-month carryover standard.", "The two SPAWAR systems centers made some accounting entries at fiscal  year-end that moved customer orders out of the working capital fund for  the sole purpose of reducing reported carryover below the 3-month  standard, which understated the amount of carryover that SPAWAR  reported to the Navy and DOD.  They then reversed these accounting  entries in the beginning of the next fiscal year.

Obligated carryover refers to the portion of customer orders for which the  systems centers have obligated their own funds.  For example, if a  customer submits a $1,000 order for engineering services, and a contractor  will accomplish 10 percent of the work, then the systems center will award  a contract for $100\u2014which will obligate the center\u2019s funds\u2014and the $100  will, therefore, be referred to as obligated carryover.  A customer order\u2019s  unobligated carryover balance is calculated by subtracting obligated  carryover from the total amount remaining on the order\u2014or $900 for this  example.  As of September 30, 2002, the two SPAWAR systems centers had  about $896.1 million of reported actual carryover\u2014$379.5 million of  obligated carryover and $516.6 million of unobligated carryover.", "The distinction between obligated carryover and unobligated carryover is  important because (1) neither DOD nor Navy guidance explicitly requires  the systems centers to review unobligated carryover during their tri-annual  reviews (unless the work is recorded as a commitment in their accounting  records) and (2) about $414 million of the systems centers\u2019 September 30,  2002, unobligated carryover was not recorded as a commitment in the  centers\u2019 accounting records.  In other words, even if the tri-annual reviews  were performed effectively and in a timely manner, they would not cover  about 46 percent of the systems centers\u2019 reported actual carryover.", "DOD guidance does require customers, as part of their tri-annual reviews,  to validate the orders they have placed with working capital fund activities  because these orders are recorded as obligations in their accounting  records, regardless of whether they are obligated or unobligated carryover  in the working capital fund activities\u2019 records.  However, customers have  limited visibility over whether the unobligated portion of their funded  orders are needed to finance future work, and, therefore, the working  capital fund activities are in a better position than the customers to make  this determination.", "If the systems centers were required to review unobligated carryover  balances when performing their tri-annual reviews, they could (1) reduce  the amount of carryover on their records and (2) better identify unneeded  funds and be in a better position to return them to customers before the  funds expired so the customers could use them for new obligations.  For  example, our review of 34 customer orders that (1) had $7 million of  unobligated carryover balances as of September 30, 2001, and (2) were  financed with funds that had already expired as of that date showed that  most of the orders contained unneeded funds that were eventually returned  to customers.  Our analysis showed that (1) 27 of the orders (about 79  percent) had unneeded funds and (2) $2.9 million, or about 41 percent, of  the orders we reviewed represented unneeded funds.", "Although most of the unneeded funds we identified were eventually  returned to customers, in some instances the funds were not returned until  long after the funds expired.  For example, $469,916 of unneeded funds on  two Charleston Systems Center orders expired in September 2001, but was  not returned to the customer until September 2002\u2014almost 1 year after the  funds had expired.  Similarly, $71,718 of unneeded funds on a San Diego  order expired in September 1998, but was not returned to the customer  until December 2002\u2014more than 4 years after the funds had expired.", "We believe, and a senior DOD accounting official agreed, that the systems  centers and other working capital fund activities should be required to  validate their unobligated carryover during tri-annual reviews because, as  noted previously, they have better visibility over whether unobligated funds  will be needed in the future.  However, neither center requires its managers  to review unobligated carryover during the tri-annual reviews because, as  financial managers at one center pointed out, they are concentrating on the  requirements explicitly identified in the DOD guidance, and they will add  other tasks, such as reviews of unobligated carryover, if and when (1) the  guidance is changed or (2) they have the time and resources to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Effective Reviews of Dormant Obligations Could Result in More Effective Use of Customer Funds", "paragraphs": ["A key element of the tri-annual reviews is the requirement to follow up on  all obligations that have been dormant for more than 120 days to determine  if unused funds are still needed.  This task is one of the 16 tri-annual review  requirements and is important from the systems centers\u2019 perspective  because the identification and return of unneeded funds to the customer  will reduce the centers\u2019 reported carryover\u2014thereby reducing the  likelihood of customers\u2019 budget cuts.  Additionally, the task is important  from the customers\u2019 perspective because the funds can be reused for other  purposes if they are returned before they expire.", "However, our analysis of the two centers\u2019 financial data and review of  individual customer orders showed that neither center was effectively  identifying unneeded funds and returning them to customers in a timely  manner.  For example, our analysis of the two systems centers\u2019 financial  data showed that, as of September 30, 2002, the two centers had thousands  of obligated carryover balances, valued at more than $7 million, that had  not changed for more than a year.  Further, some of these dormant balances  were financed with customer funds that had long since expired.  For  example, 165 of the dormant carryover balances were financed with fiscal  year 1996 or earlier appropriations.  According to a systems center official,  the monumental financial workload involved with the acquisition of  additional activities and the transition to a consolidated financial  accounting system occurring over the past several years greatly hindered  their efforts to close all expired funding documents and return the unused  funds to customers in a timely manner.  For example, the official pointed  out that the center had almost 13,000 old funding documents needing to be  reconciled and closed at the start of fiscal year 2000 because of these  problems and that the center was still working on them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Large Accrued Expenditure Balances Warrant Increased Management Emphasis", "paragraphs": ["At the conclusion of their tri-annual reviews, fund holders are required to  certify that they have conducted adequate research on all accrued  expenditures that are more than 120 days old to determine if they are  valid.  This task is important because   large accrued expenditure balances, in general, and large dormant  accrued expenditure balances, in particular, can indicate either serious  accounting problems or ineffective procedures for developing accrued  expenditure schedules and   accrued expenditures reduce reported carryover balances, and overly  optimistic accrued expenditure schedules can, therefore, cause  reported carryover to understate actual carryover.", "The task of validating accrued expenditures is especially important for the  two SPAWAR systems centers because they had about $673 million of  accrued expenditures as of September 30, 2002.", "However, the San Diego Systems Center, which had the larger accrued  expenditure balance\u2014about $423 million as of September 2002\u2014is  currently developing a methodology for validating its accrued  expenditures.  Further, although the Charleston Systems Center had  developed a methodology to review its accrued expenditures, the  Charleston Comptroller was concerned about the timeliness and adequacy  of these reviews and, therefore, was unwilling to certify that the center  adequately reviewed its dormant accrued expenditures.", "Although the tri-annual review\u2019s tasks related to accrued expenditures  focus primarily on accounting problems, reviews of dormant accrued  expenditures are also important from a carryover perspective.  Overly  optimistic accrued expenditure schedules\u2014which are the basis for  determining when accrued expenditures will be recorded in the accounting  system\u2014can cause reported carryover to understate actual carryover.  For  example, if a contractor is to perform $600 of work, and an accrued  expenditure schedule is based on the assumptions that the work will begin  immediately and will be performed at a uniform rate over a 6-month period,  then (1) $100 of expenditures will be accrued each month and (2) each  accrued expenditure will trigger a $100 customer payment and, in turn, a  $100 reduction in the reported carryover.  Thus, after 4 months, the  reported carryover will be $200, regardless of how much work has actually  been accomplished.  If the work begins later than expected or if it takes  longer than expected to complete, and accrued expenditures are not  adjusted accordingly, reported carryover would be understated.", "Two ways to put the magnitude of the systems centers\u2019 accrued  expenditure balances in perspective are to (1) compare the balances with  other financial indicators and (2) show their impact on reported carryover.   For example, the San Diego Systems Center\u2019s September 2002 accrued  expenditure balance of $423 million is the equivalent of about 32 percent of  the orders the center received during fiscal year 2002 ($1.315 billion) and  about 31 percent of the revenue it received during the year ($1.372 billion).   The accrued expenditures allowed the center to reduce its reported  carryover at the end of fiscal year 2002 by about 3.7 months.", "A San Diego Systems Center accounting official acknowledged that the  center\u2019s large accrued expenditure balance is a major area of concern.   Specifically, this official indicated that the center\u2019s large accrued  expenditure balance is caused partly by delays in contractor and interfund  billings, but acknowledged that there are other apparent problems that  warrant attention.  For example, the official said that the $405 million  variance between the center\u2019s September 30, 2002, accrued expenditure  and accounts payable balances is an apparent problem that should be  reviewed.", "However, the accounting official also pointed out that currently the center  cannot analyze its accrued expenditures because its new accounting  system, which has been tailored to meet its specific needs and is unique  within DOD, cannot provide the data in a format that will allow it to do so.   When asked what the San Diego Systems Center is doing to develop the  data needed to effectively analyze its accrued expenditure data, the  accounting official indicated that the center is developing a \u201cdata  warehouse.\u201d  However, the official acknowledged that (1) they have just  begun identifying the specific requirements for the data warehouse,   (2) there will be many competing requirements, (3) due to resource  constraints, the data warehouse will not be able to satisfy all of the center\u2019s  data analysis needs, and (4) they, therefore, do not know when or, for that  matter, if they will ever have the data they need to effectively analyze their  accrued expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements Are Needed in SPAWAR\u2019s Tri-Annual Review Procedures", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the major problems identified above, our review of the  procedures that SPAWAR headquarters and its two systems centers use to  conduct their tri-annual reviews identified several areas that need  improvements.

The Comptroller\u2019s Office then provides  these lists to the center\u2019s technical departments, which are then required to  conduct the actual reviews.

For example, because the systems  center\u2019s draft tri-annual review guidance does not specifically require the  technical departments to accomplish many important tasks, the  effectiveness and usefulness of the reviews varied significantly from one  department to another.  For example, two of the center\u2019s technical  departments did not (1) summarize or analyze the results of their reviews,  (2) establish internal controls to ensure that timely and appropriate  corrective action was taken on problems that were identified during the  reviews, or (3) maintain adequate documentation to show who conducted  the reviews, what problems were identified, and/or what additional actions  were required.", "Conversely, although it was not required to do so, another department   (1) summarized the results of its reviews in a single Excel spreadsheet to  facilitate analysis of the review results, (2) analyzed the data to determine  if there were any indications of systemic or compliance problems (e.g.,  inadequate reviews by one or more of the department\u2019s divisions or  problems with accrual schedules), and (3) developed internal control  procedures to ensure that timely and appropriate action was taken on  identified problems and/or unresolved research requirements.   Additionally, this department requires its managers to maintain  documentation that (1) shows who conducted the actual reviews (so these  individuals can be held accountable for the adequacy of the reviews),   (2) identifies the additional research or corrective action that is required as  a result of the reviews, and (3) indicates who is responsible for taking the  action.", "Managers from this department said that they were initially skeptical about  the benefits of the tri-annual reviews, but indicated that they are now  strong supporters because the reviews have provided a structured way to  address their data problems and have already resulted in significant  improvements in the quality of their data.  Additionally, they acknowledged  that documenting what corrective action is required and who is responsible  for taking it requires additional time, at least in the short term.  However,  they believe this documentation is essential for (1) holding people  accountable and (2) having effective internal controls to ensure that timely  and appropriate corrective action is taken on the problems that are  identified.

This approach allows  the Comptroller\u2019s Office to concentrate on the tasks it is best qualified to  perform, such as tracing obligations back to source documents, and lets the  technical departments concentrate on those tasks that they are best  qualified to perform, such as verifying that dormant obligations are still  valid.  Second, the Charleston Comptroller provides the technical  departments with a list of all dormant commitments, obligations, and  accrued expenditures so they can easily focus on those that they must  follow up on.  Finally, Charleston\u2019s tri-annual review guidance requires  those who conduct the reviews to document actions taken during the  reviews and is to (1) include corrective actions remaining to be taken and  when such actions will be completed and (2) identify actions that have  been taken to preclude identified problems from recurring in the future.", "However, we did identify several problems with Charleston\u2019s overall  approach.  More specifically, we found the following:  Although the Comptroller must sign a certification statement attesting  to the results of the center\u2019s tri-annual review, the systems center has  not conducted all of the required reviews, and the Comptroller has not  developed internal control procedures to ensure that the reviews that  were conducted were performed properly and completely.", "Charleston\u2019s technical department heads are responsible for ensuring  that reviews are properly conducted and documented, but they are not  required to certify that this has been done.  Consequently, the  Comptroller does not have a sound basis for certifying that the tri- annual review tasks the center is required to accomplish have been  completed.  In fact, Charleston\u2019s Comptroller acknowledged that our  work shows that the technical departments\u2019 reviews are not adequate,  and he indicated that his concern about the timeliness and adequacy of  the technical departments\u2019 reviews is the reason why he has limited his  tri-annual review certification to the 4 tasks that are under his control  and why he has been unwilling to certify the remaining 12 tasks.  The  Comptroller stated, and we agree, that department heads should be held  accountable for their respective departments\u2019 portion of the tri-annual  review process.

In its comments,  DOD concurred with 12 of our 14 recommendations and partially  concurred with the remaining 2 recommendations.  For these 2  recommendations, DOD agreed with our intent to ensure that obligations,  unobligated balances, and commitments are reviewed regularly to ensure  effective use of funds.  Our evaluation of DOD\u2019s comments is presented  below.  DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "For the 12 recommendations with which DOD concurred, it stated that 7 of  them were completed based on the issuance of SPAWAR Instruction  7301.1A on Tri-Annual Reviews of Commitments and Obligations, dated  October 9, 2002.  We believe that the guidance provided in the instruction is  an important step.  SPAWAR and the systems centers now need to develop  and issue implementing procedures because, in most cases, the guidance  provided in the instruction that is related to these 7 recommendations is  too general to fully address our recommendations.  For example, although  the instruction requires those responsible for conducting the review to  report the results to the systems center\u2019s comptroller, the instruction does  not require, as we recommended, that cognizant managers, such as  department heads, sign a written statement to be provided to the  comptroller to confirm that they have performed the required reviews and  certify the results of those reviews.", "Further, in concurring with our recommendation that SPAWAR compare  budgeted to actual orders received from customers and consider these  trends in developing budget estimates on orders to be received from  customers, DOD did not state how the Navy would ensure that SPAWAR\u2019s  budget estimates would accurately reflect orders to be received from  customers.  In its comments, DOD stated that the Navy will continue to  refine its budget estimates for customer orders.  We believe that the Navy  must take additional actions to develop more reliable budget estimates.  As  noted in our report, reported actual customer orders received exceeded  budget estimates from 36 percent to 88 percent during fiscal years 1998  through 2002.  For example, for fiscal year 2002, in formulating its budget  request, the Navy expected the SPAWAR systems centers to receive about  $1.3 billion in customer orders, but the Navy reported that the centers  actually received about $2.4 billion in customer orders\u2014a difference of  $1.1 billion, or about 88 percent.  Having reliable budget estimates on  customer orders to be received is critical since this information is used in  calculating carryover using DOD\u2019s new carryover policy.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that it revise its tri- annual review guidance in the DOD Financial Management Regulation to  require working capital fund activities to expand their tri-annual reviews to  include unobligated balances on customer orders.  In its comments, DOD  stated that reviewing such balances during the tri-annual reviews was the  responsibility of the customer who placed the order with the working  capital fund and that the working capital fund activity should work in  cooperation with the customer to ensure that unobligated balances are  reviewed.  We agree that the working capital fund activity should work in  conjunction with customers to review unobligated balances.  However, as  stated in our report, working capital fund activities are in the best position  to determine whether unobligated balances are still needed to finance  future work.  To ensure that unobligated balances are properly reviewed  during the tri-annual review process, we continue to recommend that the  DOD Financial Management Regulation be revised to specify the working  capital fund activities\u2019 role in reviewing unobligated balances on customer  orders.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation for the SPAWAR  systems centers to review all balances related to dormant customer orders  in excess of $50,000 during the January and May tri-annual reviews.  In its  comments, DOD indicated that the current guidance is not clear with  regard to whether all such dormant balances over $50,000 are to be  reviewed during the specified months.  DOD stated that it will review the  guidance, as it pertains to working capital fund activities, and make  adjustments if appropriate.  We agree that DOD\u2019s tri-annual review  guidance regarding the dollar thresholds for reviewing outstanding  commitments and obligations was unclear.  We have revised our report  accordingly, including the related recommendation, to reflect that DOD\u2019s  tri-annual review guidance was unclear.", "In addition, in the cover letter transmitting its comments on our draft  report, DOD took exception to our discussion in the draft report regarding  the methodology used by Navy to determine the levels of carryover\u2014 reducing the numerator in the carryover formula by the amount of  contractual obligations, but not reducing the formula\u2019s denominator by the  amount of revenue earned from contractual services.  Because DOD  revised its methodology for calculating carryover in December 2002, DOD  commented that such a discussion in the report was irrelevant and  confusing to the reader and recommended that it be deleted.  We disagree  with DOD\u2019s comment.  Although DOD revised its methodology for  calculating carryover, it was not incorporated into Navy\u2019s budget  submissions until fiscal year 2004.  When we undertook this review in July  2002, one of our objectives was to determine if reported carryover  accurately reflected the amount of work remaining to be accomplished.  As  such, this issue was and still is relevant.  As stated in this report, our May  2001 report recommended that the revenue used in calculating carryover  be adjusted (reduced) for revenue earned for work performed by  contractors.  Unless this is done, reported carryover will be understated.   The Navy did not adjust the revenue amount and, therefore, continued to  understate its reported carryover in its budget submissions to the  Congress.  We continue to believe that this is a reportable issue and have  made a related recommendation for DOD to develop and issue written  procedures to implement the December 2002 carryover policy.  Further, we  believe this issue remains of interest to the Congress since the Navy has  understated SPAWAR\u2019s reported carryover from fiscal year 1998 through  fiscal year 2002.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services; the Subcommittee  on Readiness and Management Support, Senate Committee on Armed  Services; the Subcommittee on Defense, Senate Committee on  Appropriations; the House Committee on Armed Services; the  Subcommittee on Readiness, House Committee on Armed Services; and the  Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, House Committee  on Appropriations.

When variances  occurred between the budgeted and reported actual information, we met  with accounting and budgeting SPAWAR and Navy headquarters officials to  ascertain why there were differences.  We also discussed with officials  what actions they were taking to develop more reliable budget information  on carryover and orders received from customers.", "To determine if the reported actual carryover balances reflected the  amount of work that remained to be accomplished, we obtained and  analyzed the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) regulations and guidance on  carryover.  We also obtained and analyzed the SPAWAR systems centers\u2019  calculations for the fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002 actual reported  year-end carryover balances.  We met with officials from SPAWAR and  Navy headquarters to discuss the methodology they used to calculate  carryover.  We (1) obtained explanations about why the Navy made  adjustments in calculating the dollar amount of carryover balances as well  as the number on months of carryover and (2) determined the impact of  those adjustments on the carryover figure.  We also reviewed year-end  transactions that affected the dollar amount and number of months of  carryover.  For these year-end transactions, we met with officials from  SPAWAR and the two systems centers to determine why these transactions  occurred at year-end.", "To determine if the Charleston and San Diego SPAWAR Systems Centers  have the financial data they need in order to provide reliable data on actual  carryover levels to DOD and congressional decision makers, we reviewed  the policies and procedures SPAWAR headquarters and the two systems  centers have used to implement DOD\u2019s tri-annual review guidance.   Specifically, we (1) reviewed the DOD, Navy, SPAWAR headquarters, and  the two SPAWAR systems centers\u2019 tri-annual review guidance and  discussed it with cognizant individuals, (2) reviewed the tri-annual review  certifications that the two systems centers have submitted since DOD  issued its tri-annual review guidance in 1996, and discussed these  certifications with cognizant individuals, (3) discussed the systems centers\u2019  tri-annual review procedures with cognizant individuals, including those  who actually accomplished the reviews, and (4) reviewed documentation  on the results of the reviews.  We also obtained data on the status of  unfilled orders and carryover at the end of fiscal year 2001.  Additionally,  from these data, we selected and analyzed 34 orders that had outstanding  carryover balances at the end of fiscal year 2001 to determine if the  carryover balances accurately reflected the amount of work that remained  to be performed.  We selected orders that (1) were financed with expired  appropriations and (2) were unobligated carryover at year-end since these  orders were more likely to have unneeded funds and because a review of  these orders was, therefore, more likely to identify problems with the  systems centers\u2019 review procedures.", "We performed our work at the headquarters offices of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller) and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy  (Financial Management and Comptroller), Washington, D.C.; Space and  Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, California; the Charleston  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston, South Carolina; and  the San Diego Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego,  California.  The reported actual year-end carryover information used in this  report was produced from DOD\u2019s systems, which have long been reported  to generate unreliable data.  We did not independently verify this  information.  The DOD Inspector General has cited deficiencies and  internal control weaknesses as major obstacles to the presentation of  financial statements that would fairly present the Defense Working Capital  Fund\u2019s financial position for fiscal years 1993 through 2002.", "Our review was performed from July 2002 through June 2003 in accordance  with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.
