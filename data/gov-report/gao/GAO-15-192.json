The process used to manage  the acquisition of these systems has been characterized by organizations  both internal and external to DOD as one that is inefficient, cumbersome,  and bureaucratic. A contributing factor to this inefficient process is the  significant time and effort required to complete information requirements  before an acquisition program can proceed through a milestone to the  next phase in the weapon system acquisition process. DOD leadership  has acknowledged that too much time is invested in preparing for key  milestones, including the documentation and oversight of information  required by statutes and policy, which takes time away from conducting  day-to-day core program management tasks such as contractor  oversight, engineering, and risk management.", "There is a natural tension between oversight and accountability on one  hand and efficient program management on the other. Oversight and  accountability add process, which is justifiable given the high cost and  risk associated with major weapons and the inherent incentives for  program managers and contractors to be optimistic about what they can  accomplish. The additional process does come at a cost of time and other  resources that a program manager could potentially employ better. If it  were clearly demonstrable that program cost and schedule outcomes  have improved as oversight has intensified, then the additional process  would be easy to accept. But, as we have reported over the years,  program outcomes have not significantly improved. Thus, it is an  appropriate time to assess the value of the documents and reviews  demanded of today\u2019s acquisition process.

Companies minimize the levels of review needed to  determine whether a program is ready to advance to the next acquisition  phase, resulting in a quicker, more efficient process.", "The companies prepared documents similar to those of DOD such as  development, test, engineering, and manufacturing plans. Officials at  Motorola Solutions, Cummins, and Boeing stated that most documents  are prepared and approved by functional managers assigned to the  program office core team. Programs prepare an integrated document that  summarizes key program information for the decision makers to review  and approve. Figure 9 illustrates the levels at which documents are  generally prepared and approved for commercial companies we visited.", "According to company officials, the integrated document may include  information on customer requirements, resources, schedules, risks,  technical data, and market launch plans. As part of the milestone decision  process, program managers also provide evidence that the other program  documents have been completed and approved by the appropriate  official.", "For the companies we visited, ensuring that the program management  team has a strong link to decision makers was a critical factor to their  streamlined approach. Several companies held meetings between  program officials and senior managers at frequent intervals to assess  progress towards the next milestone decision. Officials stated that  frequent, regular interactions enable senior managers to stay informed of  program issues and plans, allowing the decision meeting to focus on  making a well-informed decision, instead of spending time bringing  decision makers up to date (see fig. 10).", "Cummins functional managers, for example, meet one-on-one with  senior program managers on a monthly basis to review program  progress. Officials stated that about 2 weeks prior to the decision  meeting, a comprehensive review is conducted with each program\u2019s  functional area manager, supporting team, and senior functional  manager to ensure required activities have been completed before a  milestone review and the plan going forward is sound.", "Boeing officials stated that they conduct a series of monthly meetings  between program functional area managers and senior managers to  assess whether a program is meeting the criteria needed for moving  into the next phase. According to officials, the results provide support  for the milestone decision.", "Honda has established an environment that encourages frequent,  direct interaction between program participants. Senior managers,  program managers, and staff work in an open bullpen environment,  rather than offices. This layout facilitates real-time discussions across  organizational levels, multiple programs, and functional areas. Issues  can be quickly discussed and resolved as they arise so only the most  important ones need to be addressed at the milestone decision  meetings.", "Companies we visited told us it typically takes only a few months or  sometimes even a few weeks to complete the milestone decision  process. The process for these companies included one or two levels of  review to assess whether a program is ready to advance to the next  phase. For example, Motorola Solutions and Cummins use a process in  which programs proceed directly to the decision maker after they have  packaged together information needed to support a milestone decision.  Motorola Solutions program officials provided information to their decision  makers about a week in advance of the decision meeting. During that  week, program officials meet individually with principal members on the  decision-making committee. The purpose of these meetings is not to  present the program\u2019s plans but to address any last minute concerns.  According to Motorola officials, the decision meeting typically lasts about  30 minutes because issues are usually resolved in these earlier meetings.  Boeing and Honda generally include one additional level of review.", "The commercial model, in which good program outcomes can be  achieved with a more streamlined oversight process, includes a natural  incentive that engenders efficient business practices. Market imperatives  incentivize commercial stakeholders to keep a program on track to meet  business goals. In addition, awards and incentives for managers are often  tied to the company\u2019s overall financial success. As a result, commercial  managers are incentivized to raise issues early and seek help if needed.  They know if the program fails, everyone involved fails because market  opportunity is missed and business revenues will be impacted.  Commercial product development cycle times are relatively short (less  than 5 years), making it easier to minimize management turnover and to  maintain accountability. DOD\u2019s acquisitions occur in a different  environment in which cycle times are long (10 to 15 years), management  turnover is frequent, accountability is elusive, and cost and schedules are  not constrained by market forces. Seen in this light, DOD must have an  oversight process that substitutes discipline for commercial market  incentives. Several industry officials stated that companies often add  oversight levels or reviews as a first reaction after failures or problems  occur. However, the officials further stated that this does not solve the  root problems and often it makes the process less efficient. Two  companies we visited highlighted an inspection-intensive oversight  process they implemented as a deliberate attempt to address problems  that had occurred but found that it led to an adversarial environment and  an inefficient process. Both companies eventually abandoned this  approach and replaced it with an approach where program officials are  incentivized to reach out to recognized experts within the company for  assistance when needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over time, DOD has essentially tried to overcome a legacy of negative  cost and schedule weapon system program outcomes by requiring  extensive documentation to support program strategies, plans, and other  information prior to a milestone decision. Much of the information required  in this documentation was added by policy as well as statute and these  requirements likely represented legitimate reactions to problems.  However, the consequence of this approach is that an extensive process  has built up, in which program offices and other DOD organizations spend  an enormous amount of time and effort preparing and reviewing  documentation. Given the persistence of weapon system acquisition  problems over decades, especially schedule delays and cost overruns,  the effort involved with documenting and reviewing information  requirements does not appear to correspond to the value gained.  Programs we surveyed spent over 2 years completing information  requirements that in some instances can be reviewed by as many as 56  organizations at eight levels. In the end, program officials felt almost half  of these information requirements were not of high value. Further,  program managers did not highly value the reviews by higher level DOD  organizations for 90 percent of the documentation.", "The need to document information about essential aspects of a program  and for an appropriate level of review and approval is legitimate.  However, over time, the outcomes of weapon system programs have  proven resistant to the oversight process. At the same time, the process  has become bloated, time-consuming, and cumbersome to complete. The  challenge is to find the right balance between having an effective  oversight process and the competing demands such a process places on  program management. Meeting the challenge will depend on DOD\u2019s  ability to identify the key problem areas in weapon system acquisitions  and the associated root causes that exist today and whether information  requirements and reviews are linked to addressing these problems. As  we have noted in prior work, the most important information  requirements\u2014those that enable a program to establish a sound  business case\u2014include well-defined requirements, reasonable life-cycle  cost estimates, and a knowledge-based acquisition plan. If information  requirements and reviews are not clearly linked with the elements of a  sound business case and/or the key issues facing acquisitions today,  then they can be streamlined or even eliminated. If they are linked, but  are not working well, then they warrant re-thinking. While the data support  that change is needed, change does not mean weakening oversight, as  unsatisfactory outcomes from acquisition programs may persist. Rather,  the goal of change is to perform effective oversight more efficiently, and  to recognize problems or incentives that require remedies and not just  more information requirements.", "In this time of decreasing defense budgets, where every dollar spent on  inefficient activities is one less dollar available for modernizing our future  force, a close look at the review process is warranted to provide  stakeholders needed information in a more efficient and cost effective  manner. The surveys of DOD acquisition officials we conducted, the  results of which are shown in figure 3 and appendix III, highlight  information requirements that provide less than moderate value to  acquisition officials. These requirements, as well as ones that take a year  or more to complete, could serve as a starting point for discussions on  what documentation is really needed for weapon acquisition programs  and how to streamline the review process. Officials within the Office of the  Secretary of Defense believe the Electronic Coordination Tool shows  promise for reducing review times on documents. Currently, it is being  used to reduce review times for acquisition strategies, and other  documents may be added in the future. Automating the document review  process, however, is relatively easy compared to potentially eliminating  levels of review because that will require DOD to move away from its  \u201ccheckers checking checkers\u201d culture and make tough choices as to  which levels of review do not add value and are not necessary. If DOD  does not eliminate levels of review, inefficiencies are likely to continue.  According to federal internal control standards, agencies should develop  effective and efficient processes to ensure that actions are taken to  address requirements, such as in this case, completing the required  information to aid in milestone decisions. In other words, DOD should be  striving to make its process more efficient.", "Selecting pilot test programs to experiment with streamlined acquisition  processes, while capturing lessons learned from the pilot, would be steps  in the right direction. The pilot programs could rely on practices used by  some DOD classified programs and private industry companies we  visited\u2014namely, fewer information requirements and levels of review and  more frequent interaction between the program office and actual decision  makers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve DOD\u2019s milestone decision process, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics in collaboration with the military  service acquisition executives, program executive officers, and program  managers take the following two actions:  In the near term, identify and potentially eliminate (1) reviews  associated with information requirements, with a specific focus on  reducing review levels that do not add value, and (2) information  requirements that do not add value and are no longer needed. For the  remaining reviews and information requirements, evaluate and  determine different approaches, such as consolidating information  requirements and delegating approval authority, which could provide  for a more efficient milestone process. This effort should also include  a re-examination of the reason(s) why an information requirement was  originally considered necessary in order to determine what information  is still needed and if a more efficient approach could be used.  Findings and survey responses included in this report could be used  as a starting point for this examination.", "As a longer-term effort, select several current or new major defense  acquisition programs to pilot, on a broader scale, different approaches  for streamlining the entire milestone decision process, with the results  evaluated and reported for potential wider use.

DOD  concurred with both of our recommendations. DOD\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix IV.", "DOD concurred with our first recommendation, indicating that the  Department\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative contains efforts to streamline  documentation requirements and staff reviews and its recent (February  2015) set of legislative proposals to Congress seeks to reduce some  DOD reporting requirements. We acknowledge these efforts as steps in  the right direction. We believe DOD can and should do more to eliminate  reviews and information requirements that do not add value and are no  longer needed. For the most part, efforts to date have been limited in  scope and have not yet had a significant impact on the amount of time  and effort program offices spend on documentation required at  milestones. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics acknowledged in April 2014 that DOD has not had  significant success in eliminating unproductive processes and  bureaucracy. We also note that DOD\u2019s recent set of legislative proposals  to Congress for inclusion into the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2016 primarily seek to reduce reporting requirements, but do  not address streamlining the many levels of review. As we reported, a  primary reason it takes over 2 years to complete the information required  for a milestone decision is the large number of stakeholders that review  the documents at the many organizational levels above the program  office. While it will take a coordinated effort on the part of the Department,  we believe DOD can reduce the many levels of review.", "DOD also concurred with our second recommendation, indicating that  while not yet fully implemented, it has a Better Buying Power initiative to  identify appropriate programs to pilot test a streamlined acquisition  approach. As we reported, however, DOD has not yet identified candidate  programs even though the initiative was proposed in April 2013 and was  supposed to begin in July 2013. DOD officials told us it has been difficult  to identify programs that meet the preconditions for the pilot set by the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics\u2014 namely programs that have well defined requirements, a strong  relationship with industry, and a highly qualified government team that  can remain with the program until it is delivered. We encourage DOD to  initiate the pilot, specifically on some current programs that have recently  held a milestone B or will be approaching this milestone soon (e.g.  Presidential Helicopter, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, Joint Air-to- Ground Missile, Next Generation Jammer, Amphibious Combat Vehicle),  as long as the aforementioned criterion of well defined requirements is  considered. Almost two years have passed since the initiative was first  proposed and even after DOD decides on the specific programs for the  pilot, it will most likely be several years until lessons learned can be  documented and potentially applied to other programs. We reiterate that,  when implemented, each pilot should examine different approaches for  streamlining the entire milestone decision process, including defining the  appropriate information needed to support milestone decisions, such as  business case principles like well defined requirements, reasonable life- cycle cost estimates, and a knowledge-based acquisition plan. Pilot  programs should also strive to develop a more efficient process for  providing this information to the milestone decision authority, which would  most likely include minimizing reviews between the program office and  the different functional staff offices within each chain of command level  and establishing frequent, regular interaction between the program office  and milestone decision makers, in lieu of documentation reviews.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; and the Secretaries of the Air  Force, Army, and Navy.

One questionnaire was sent  to 11 program managers of current major defense acquisition programs  identified in the Defense Acquisition Management Information Retrieval  system as having completed a Milestone B decision review since January  1, 2010, and a different questionnaire to 15 program managers of current  major defense acquisition programs identified in the Defense Acquisition  Management Information Retrieval system as having completed a  Milestone C decision review since January 1, 2010. We received  responses from 24 program managers, between July and October 2014,  11 program managers from Milestone B programs and 13 program  managers from Milestone C programs.

We asked programs if they had completed a milestone  decision review as of January 1, 2011, and if yes, to provide additional  information regarding that milestone review. Twenty-four programs out of  55 responded that they had completed a milestone decision review in that  time frame; however, not all programs provided information on the review.  Four programs were excluded from our analysis because they were  unable to provide the additional data. Another 5 programs were excluded  because we determined they have been designated as an Acquisition  Category IC program; our analysis was limited to Acquisition Category ID  programs.

In addition, we asked programs to  provide detailed information related to the information requirements they  prepared for the milestone, including the length of time spent  documenting each information requirement; length of time it took the  documentation to make it through the review process; the number of staff  days the program office spent documenting each information  requirement; and the cost to document each information requirement.
