An accurate accounting of MLAP costs is crucial for  proper program management and accountability and serves as a basis for  estimating future costs when preparing and reviewing budgets.

Based on this percentage  being applied to the 10-month MLAP payroll of approximately $11.4 million  for the nine administrative states and offices under review, we estimate the  potential net dollar overcharge to MLAP to be about $1.2 million. The total  MLAP payroll for all states and offices was approximately $24.0 million for  fiscal year 2000.", "We asked the employees who stated that they charged more time to MLAP  than they worked to explain why the additional time was charged to MLAP.  During survey pretesting we had identified four possible explanations,  including: (1) time was charged based on the funding allocations (in other  words, charges were made to subactivities from which funds were  available for obligation rather than from the subactivity related to the task),  (2) time was charged based on the directions of a supervisor, (3) time was  charged based on the directions of a budget officer, and (4) no other codes  were available to charge (for example, the task being done may not have  been anticipated in the budget allocation and therefore the proper  subactivity code was not available to the office). The results of their  responses are presented in table 2. Employees could provide more than  one explanation for the overcharging; therefore the percentages in the  table total to more than 100 percent.", "In addition, we asked the employees who stated that they charged more  time to MLAP than they worked to specify the tasks that they had charged  to MLAP. They reported charging time for such non-MLAP related tasks as  processing and approving applications to drill oil and gas wells, working on  environmental remediation projects, doing recreation management, and  performing vehicle maintenance. BLM officials stated that work involving  these tasks should not have been charged to MLAP. Employees also stated  that they had charged MLAP for labor involved in preparing mineral reports  for land exchanges and conducting work on common variety minerals,  such as sand and gravel. BLM officials stated that charging these tasks to  MLAP would be improper except for specific and unique cases\u2014for  example, preparing a mineral report on a land exchange involving a mining  claim or making a validity determination on a mining claim involving sand  and gravel deposits. Our survey did not address whether the tasks charged  to MLAP were for any of these specific and unique cases.", "Some BLM employees expressed uncertainty as to which tasks were  appropriate to charge to MLAP.

BLM officials stated that  charging these awards to MLAP was appropriate and that the associated  labor should also have been charged to the program. Not charging the  associated labor costs to MLAP resulted in program costs being  understated.", "The remaining four awards were given to individuals for (1) researching  historical land data for a land withdrawal program, (2) assisting in the  moving of a BLM office to a new facility, (3) selling a private residence as  part of a lateral transfer and not using BLM\u2019s relocation service, and  (4) performance resulting in an end-of-year bonus to a Lands and Realty  specialist.

These  improper payments included:  over $34,000 for janitorial services,  $30,000 for the appraisal of federal coal leaseholds,  $25,000 for an attorney in an Equal Employment Opportunity settlement  for an employee who had not worked on MLAP tasks,  $2,800 for a cultural survey of an area prior to an off-highway vehicle  and motorcycle race, and  $2,000 for a habitat survey of a threatened and endangered species of  butterfly in an area with no active mining.", "In addition, on the basis of our review, we questioned whether an  additional $40,000 for two contracts and services were improperly charged  to MLAP.

BLM officials concurred and stated that correcting adjustments would be  made to the proper appropriation for the additional $40,000.", "BLM prepared Instruction Memorandum 2000-148 (IM-148) to provide  guidance on correcting the contracts and services charges that were  improperly charged to MLAP in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. IM-148 required  all offices that had improperly charged contracts and services to MLAP to  develop implementation plans to replace the funds and submit those plans  to BLM\u2019s Director of Budget. Fourteen administrative states and offices  developed and submitted implementation plans to make about $716,000 in  correcting adjustments.", "These correcting adjustments must be made to the appropriations that  were properly available when the obligations were incurred and BLM\u2019s  records adjusted accordingly to charge that appropriation. BLM officials  have told us that they are identifying the appropriations for fiscal years  1998 and 1999 that should have been charged for the costs of these  contracts and services and that there are sufficient funds to make the  correcting adjustments of about $716,000. According to BLM\u2019s Reports on  Budget Execution filed with the Office of Management and Budget for the  fourth quarters of fiscal years 1998 and 1999, MLR unobligated balances  were $54 million and $32 million, respectively.", "On the basis of our review, we determined that BLM offices have complied  with all of the requirements in IM-148. While the memorandum stated that  all funds, not just MLAP funds, should be expended appropriately and costs  properly recorded in BLM\u2019s financial management systems, it did not  establish any additional procedures on how to implement this policy to  prevent future improper charging of MLAP funds.
