This undertaking involved a review of loan files by thirdparty consultants to identify errors in servicing and foreclosure practices. More than 4 million borrowers were eligible for reviews. In January 2013, the regulators announced agreements with 11 of the servicers that replaced the reviews with a broad payment process to compensate borrowers in a more timely manner. Reviews continue for three remaining servicers. GAO has been reviewing various aspects of the foreclosure review process. This report addresses: (1) challenges to the achievement of the goals of the foreclosure review, (2) transparency of the process, and (3) lessons that could be useful for carrying out activities under the amended consent orders and continuing reviews. GAO analyzed third-party consultants' sampling plans, reviewed regulatory guidance and other documents, and interviewed representatives of third-party consultants and law firms, consumer groups, and regulators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Complexity of the reviews, overly broad guidance, and limited monitoring for consistency impeded the ability of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) to achieve the goals of the foreclosure review--to identify as many harmed borrowers as possible and ensure similar results for similarly situated borrowers. Regulators said that coordinating among foreclosure review participants was challenging, and consultants said that the reviews were complex. In spite of regulators' steps to foster consistency, broad guidance and limited monitoring reduced the potential usefulness of data from consultants and increased risks of inconsistency. For example, GAO found that guidance was revised throughout the process, resulting in delays. Other guidance did not specify key sampling parameters for the file reviews and regulators lacked objective monitoring measures, resulting in difficulty assessing the extent of borrower harm. Good planning and collecting objective data during monitoring provide a basis for making sound conclusions. Without using objective measures to assess sampling or comparing review methods across consultants, regulators' ability to monitor progress toward achievement of foreclosure review goals was hindered.", "Although regulators released more information than is typically associated with consent orders, limited communication with borrowers and the public adversely impacted transparency and public confidence. To promote transparency, regulators released redacted engagement letters and guidance on remediation. In addition, OCC released two interim progress reports. However, some stakeholders perceived gaps in key information and wanted more detailed information about how the reviews were carried out. Regulators stated they considered publicly releasing additional information, but expressed concerns that releasing detailed information risked disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. Further, borrowers who requested reviews experienced gaps in communication. For example, borrowers who submitted requests when the submission period opened waited nearly a year before receiving an update.", "The foreclosure review activities to date highlight key lessons related to planning, monitoring, and communication. GAO's prior work shows that assessing and using lessons learned from previous experience can benefit the planning of future activities. The foreclosure review produced lessons in advanced planning and establishing mechanisms to monitor progress toward goals. Without assessing and applying relevant lessons learned, regulators might not address challenges in the continuing reviews or similar challenges in activities under the amended consent orders. In particular, regulators announced the agreements that led to the amended consent orders without a clear communication strategy. Although the regulators plan to release reports on the results of the amended consent orders and the continuing foreclosure reviews, neither regulator had made decisions about what information to provide to borrowers. GAO's internal control standards and best practices indicate that an effective communication strategy and timely reporting can enhance transparency and public confidence. Absent a clear strategy to guide regular communications with individual borrowers and the general public, regulators face risks to transparency and public confidence similar to those experienced in the foreclosure review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["OCC and the Federal Reserve should improve oversight of sampling and consistency in the continuing reviews, apply lessons in planning and monitoring from the foreclosure review, as appropriate, to the activities of the continuing reviews and amended consent orders, and implement a communication strategy to keep stakeholders informed. In their comment letters, the regulators agreed to take steps to implement the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and the  Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) issued consent orders against 14  mortgage servicers after a review of these servicers\u2019 controls over their  foreclosure processes. The consent orders require the servicers to  engage third-party consultants to review the servicers\u2019 loan files to identify  borrowers who suffered financial injury through errors,  misrepresentations, or other deficiencies in foreclosure processes in 2009  and 2010. The regulators also directed servicers to conduct an outreach  process to enable eligible borrowers to request a review of their loan  files. Together, both processes comprise the Independent Foreclosure  Review (foreclosure review). According to regulators, the goals of the  foreclosure review were for consultants to identify as many harmed  borrowers as possible, to treat similarly situated borrowers across all 14  servicers similarly, and to help restore public confidence in the mortgage  market. The consent orders require the servicers to remediate the  financial harms suffered by borrowers as determined by consultants.  Roughly 4.3 million borrowers of the 14 servicers were in some stage of  foreclosure in 2009 and 2010 and, as of December 2012, consultants had  more than 800,000 loans slated for review. In a turn of events, in January  2013, the regulators announced agreements that discontinued the  foreclosure review with 11 of the 14 servicers. These agreements  replaced the foreclosure review with a compensation framework that does  not rely on determinations of whether borrowers suffered financial harm.  The servicers participating in the agreements cover nearly 90 percent of  borrowers who were eligible for the foreclosure review. In late February  2013, the regulators publicly released amended consent orders for the  servicers participating in the agreements that formalized the provisions in  the agreements. The remaining three servicers, covering 450,000  borrowers (10 percent), are continuing with the foreclosure review work.", "This report represents the second phase of our examination of the  foreclosure review process. In a previous report, we reviewed the  servicers\u2019 outreach efforts to inform borrowers of the foreclosure review.  We were in the process of reviewing other aspects of the foreclosure  review when OCC and the Federal Reserve announced the agreements.  We note that this report does not assess the regulators\u2019 rationale for  accepting the agreements. Further, we do not assess any trade-offs  involved in the regulators\u2019 choice to amend the consent orders with the  servicers. We abbreviated our review plan and developed this report to  address: (1) challenges to the achievement of the goals of the foreclosure  review, (2) the extent of transparency in the foreclosure review process,  and (3) lessons that could be useful for the activities under the amended  consent orders and continuing reviews.", "To review third-party consultants\u2019 file review processes, we used a data  collection instrument and gathered information on third-party consultants\u2019  sampling plans, as contained in engagement letters between the  servicers and consultants. We analyzed information in the consultants\u2019  plans for selecting loan files, analyzing file review results, and conducting  additional sampling of harmed borrowers, if needed. We confirmed key  observations of our analysis in interviews and site visits with officials  responsible for developing the sampling plans at five third-party  consultant engagement teams, interviews with regulator staff, and with  regulators\u2019 examination teams that reviewed the plans. We selected these  consultants based on the size of their respective servicer and the identity  of the servicer\u2019s regulator to ensure a range of perspectives. We reviewed  relevant documents from regulators, third-party consultants, and law firms  describing steps taken to foster consistency and accountability among file  reviews. We also reviewed regulators\u2019 guidance issued to third-party  consultants, law firms, and examination teams and compared this  information and these parties\u2019 actions to criteria such as the regulators\u2019  standard practices, regulators\u2019 goals for the foreclosure review, and our  previous work. We reviewed press releases and documents from  regulators related to the foreclosure review, enforcement action  documents available on the regulators\u2019 websites, speeches and  testimonies by agency officials, and agency policies regarding public  disclosure of enforcement action information. We conducted interviews  with regulator staff, selected third-party consultants and law firms, and  consumer groups. For those third-party consultants we did not interview,  we obtained written information from them to address our objectives.

Servicing duties can  involve sending borrowers monthly account statements, answering  borrowers\u2019 inquiries, collecting monthly mortgage payments, and  maintaining escrow accounts for property taxes and insurance. In the  event that a borrower becomes delinquent on loan payments, servicers  also initiate and conduct foreclosures. Errors, misrepresentations, and  deficiencies in foreclosure processing can result in a number of harms to  borrowers ranging from inappropriate fees to untimely or wrongful  foreclosure. A number of federal regulators share responsibility for  regulating the banking industry in relation to the origination and servicing  of mortgage loans. OCC has authority to oversee nationally chartered  banks and federal savings associations. The Federal Reserve oversees  insured state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve  System, bank and thrift holding companies, and entities that may be  owned by federally regulated depository institution holding companies but  are not federally insured depository institutions.", "In September 2010, allegations surfaced that several servicers\u2019  documents accompanying judicial foreclosures may have been  inappropriately signed or notarized. In response to this and other  servicing issues, federal banking regulators directed servicers to  complete self-assessments of their foreclosure processes. In addition,  banking regulators conducted a coordinated on-site review of 14 of the  largest mortgage servicers to evaluate the adequacy of controls over  servicers\u2019 foreclosure processes and to assess servicers\u2019 policies and  procedures for compliance with applicable federal and state laws. On the  basis of their findings from the coordinated review, OCC, OTS, and the  Federal Reserve issued in April 2011 formal consent orders against the  14 servicers under their supervision. To comply with the consent orders,  each of the 14 servicers is required to, among other things: enhance its  vendor management, training programs and processes, and compliance  with all applicable federal and state laws, rules, regulations, court orders,  and servicing guidelines. In addition, the consent orders required each  servicer to retain an independent firm to review certain foreclosure  actions on primary residences from January 1, 2009, to December 31,  2010. Third-party consultants were permitted to retain outside counsel to  provide necessary legal expertise in completing the foreclosure review.", "Through the foreclosure review, consultants were to identify borrowers  who suffered financial injury as a result of errors, misrepresentations, or  other deficiencies in foreclosure actions, and recommend remediation for  harms suffered by borrowers, as appropriate. In general, the consent  orders identified seven areas for consultants to review: (1) whether the  servicer had proper documentation of ownership of the loan; (2) whether  the foreclosure was in accordance with applicable state and federal laws;  (3) whether a foreclosure sale occurred while a loan modification was  under consideration; (4) whether nonjudicial foreclosures followed the  terms of the loan and state law requirements; (5) whether fees charged to  the borrower were permissible, reasonable, and customary; (6) whether  loss-mitigation activities were handled in accordance with program  requirements and policies; and (7) whether any errors,  misrepresentations, or other deficiencies resulted in financial injury to the  borrower. Servicers proposed third-party consultants to conduct the  foreclosure reviews. After regulators reviewed the independence of  proposed third-party consultants, servicers and third-party consultants  submitted engagement letters outlining their foreclosure review processes  to the regulators for their review and approval. OCC and the Federal  Reserve posted approved engagement letters between the servicers and  third-party consultants on their respective websites. Regulators also  posted on their websites a financial remediation framework that provided  examples of errors covered by the consent orders and the corresponding  compensation or other assistance that consultants could recommend  based on their findings.", "The foreclosure review had two components: a process for eligible  borrowers to request a review of their particular circumstances (referred  to as the borrower outreach process) and a review of categories of files  (referred to as the look-back review). The borrower outreach process was  intended to complement the look-back review and help identify borrowers  who may have suffered financial injury. The regulators required the  servicers to inform borrowers who believed they might have been  financially harmed due to inappropriate foreclosure that they could submit  a request for review of their particular circumstances. The servicers  conducted this outreach through advertising and direct mail. After several  extensions, the final deadline for submission of these requests was  December 31, 2012.", "For the look-back review, the consent orders allowed third-party  consultants to use statistical sampling techniques to select samples of  files for review from various categories of loans, pursuant to regulators\u2019  guidance and approval as well as 100 percent review of certain loan  categories. Regulators established minimum sampling requirements for  third-party consultants to conduct statistically valid sampling of the target  population and expectations for additional sampling methods, if  warranted, to identify as many harmed borrowers as possible for  remediation. Bank examiners often use sampling methods to review the  files of a financial institution\u2019s operations. The use of sampling by  examiners has been a regularly accepted practice and is commonly used  as a means to review a bank\u2019s files when a full review of all files is not  practicable. OCC states in its handbook on sampling methodologies,  which is geared toward sampling loan portfolios, that it is impractical or  impossible for bank examiners to review all items or files when examining  an area of a bank\u2019s operations, especially if the volume of information is  large. Examiners use sampling to identify a random subset of files to  learn about the multitude of items from which those files are drawn. Upon  drawing appropriate statistical inferences from this subset, they can state  with a certain level of confidence that the inferences apply to the  population as a whole. The benefits of using statistical sampling include  the ability to generalize results to the sampled populations and to quantify  uncertainty in estimates attributable to sampling.", "In our prior report on the borrower outreach component of the foreclosure  review, we found that regulators and servicers had gradually improved  the communication materials for borrowers but that regulators could make  further enhancements to the outreach efforts. First, we found that  regulators did not consider best practices, such as using tests or focus  groups, to assess the readability of the outreach materials and did not  solicit input from consumer groups when reviewing initial communication  materials. As a result, we reported that the materials at that time might  have been too complex to be widely understood. Second, we found that,  although the communication materials included information about the  purpose, scope, and process for the foreclosure review and noted that  borrowers may be eligible for compensation, the materials did not provide  enough specific information about remediation, which best practices  suggest could have encouraged more borrower responses. Third, we  found that the outreach planning and evaluation targeted all eligible  borrowers with limited analysis conducted to tailor the outreach to specific  subgroups within the population. Therefore, we noted that some  underrepresented borrowers may not have been apparent to regulators  without further analysis of the characteristics of respondents compared to  nonrespondents. To help ensure that all borrowers had a fair opportunity  for review, we recommended that OCC and the Federal Reserve enhance  the language on the foreclosure review website, include specific  remediation information in the outreach, and require servicers to analyze  trends in borrowers who have not responded and, if warranted, take  additional steps to reach underrepresented groups.", "In response to the recommendations that we made in our previous report,  OCC and the Federal Reserve took steps to enhance the independent  foreclosure review website and communication materials and conducted  more targeted outreach. We determined that regulators implemented our  first recommendation by including on the foreclosure review website a  help sheet for the request-for-review form that provides tips in plain  language, an explanation of key terms, and additional instructions to help  borrowers fill out the form. In response to our second recommendation,  OCC and the Federal Reserve publicly released a financial remediation  framework and included ranges of potential payment amounts or  categories in their communication materials and other outreach. For  example, the regulators released 60-second radio and television  advertisements stating that if consultants find errors, homeowners may be  eligible for compensation or other remedies, such as refunding fees,  stopping a foreclosure action, or making payments that could range from  $500 to $125,000. In addition, at the regulators\u2019 instruction, servicers  included similar language on ranges of potential payment amounts or  categories in other outreach materials. In response to our third  recommendation, OCC and the Federal Reserve tailored their recent  outreach actions to target communities based on audience  characteristics, response data, and consumer research. Regulators  included a wide range of minority media and a broad mix of media  formats, including print advertisements, radio, television, and Internet. To  tailor this outreach, a market analysis was completed to identify areas  and ethnic groups with the greatest opportunity for increased awareness.", "Outreach materials also were made available in eight different languages.  Regulators solicited numerous community groups for their input and  assistance on the outreach and identified effective messengers by using  leaders of community groups that represent minorities to deliver radio and  television public service announcements.", "In January 2013, OCC and the Federal Reserve issued joint press  releases stating that they had reached agreements with 11 of the 14  mortgage servicing companies subject to the April 2011 consent orders to  discontinue the foreclosure review conducted by third-party consultants  and to provide almost $8.8 billion in cash payments and foreclosure- prevention assistance to borrowers. With this change in direction from the  foreclosure review to an agreed-upon payment process, regulators and  servicers moved away from identifying the types and extent of harm  borrowers may have experienced and focused instead on assigning  borrowers into categories based on objective criteria and issuing  payments in what they expect will be a shorter amount of time than would  have occurred under the foreclosure review. To explain their rationale for  pursuing the agreements, OCC and Federal Reserve staff said they  considered a variety of factors, including delays in payments to harmed  borrowers, the total remediation payments expected to be made to  borrowers, and costs of the reviews. Under the agreements, servicers will  provide approximately $3.4 billion in direct payments to eligible  borrowers.", "Using a framework provided by regulators and characteristics of  borrowers\u2019 loans, servicers will categorize borrowers, and regulators will  develop a distribution plan and direct a payment administrator to  distribute cash payments. As a result, all borrowers who were eligible for  foreclosure reviews under the consent orders are expected to receive  payments ranging from hundreds of dollars up to $125,000, depending on  the borrower\u2019s category. Under the agreements, servicers will also  provide approximately $5.4 billion in foreclosure-prevention assistance to  borrowers, such as loan modifications. To the extent practicable,  servicers are to prioritize such assistance for borrowers eligible for the  foreclosure review. Eligible borrowers are expected to receive notice  about the payments by the end of March 2013, whether or not they filed a  request-for-review form, and borrowers will not need to take further action  to be eligible for compensation. Nearly 4 million borrowers, or about 90  percent of the eligible borrower population, are covered by the servicers  that signed the agreements. In late February 2013, regulators released  amendments to the April 2011 consent orders that incorporated the  provisions of the agreements. The amended orders are publicly available  on the regulators\u2019 respective websites. Consultants for the servicers that  did not reach agreements with the regulators\u2014Ally Financial (GMAC  Mortgage), Everbank, and OneWest\u2014continue their foreclosure review  activities. More than 450,000 borrowers fall under the three servicers that  do not have amended consent orders.", "In April 2011, regulators entered into consent orders with 14 mortgage servicers.  The consent orders require the servicers to conduct foreclosure reviews by  engaging third-party consultants to review the servicers\u2019 loan files to identify and  remediate the financial injuries suffered by borrowers through errors,  misrepresentations, or other deficiencies in their foreclosure processes in 2009 and  2010.", "In January 2013, the regulators announced agreements in principle with 11 of the 14  servicers subject to the April 2011 consent orders. The parties agreed to replace the  foreclosure review with a compensation framework that does not rely on  determinations of whether borrowers suffered financial harm, instead requiring  participating servicers to provide cash payments and foreclosure-prevention  assistance to borrowers.", "In February 2013, the regulators publicly released amended consent orders that  formally replaced the requirements related to the foreclosure review for the servicers  participating in the agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complexities of the Foreclosure Review Process and Limitations in Regulators\u2019 Guidance and Monitoring May Have Hindered Achievement of Goals", "paragraphs": ["According to regulators, the goals of the foreclosure review were for  consultants to identify as many harmed borrowers as possible, to treat  similarly situated borrowers across all 14 servicers similarly, and to help  restore public confidence in the mortgage market. However, regulators  faced various challenges in accomplishing these goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Size, Scope, and Complexity of the Foreclosure Review Process Posed Challenges", "paragraphs": ["According to regulator staff and third-party consultants, coordinating the  foreclosure review process was challenging because of the large number  of actors directly involved in the review process and the large number of  borrowers eligible for the review. Specifically, the foreclosure review  process included 14 servicers; 14 third-party consultant teams from 7  different consulting and accounting firms, some with subcontractors; and  more than 10 third-party law firms. Further, the reviews were overseen by  local examination teams for OCC or the Federal Reserve as well as  headquarters staff for both regulators. In addition, there were as many as  4.3 million borrowers whose files could have been reviewed. One  examination team informed us that the size of the review population  presented challenges beyond those that accompany a typical consent  order. Another challenge examiners and consultants noted was that, due  to the deadline extensions for borrowers to submit their requests-for- review, the volume of the file review work kept changing and the total  number of files requiring review was unknown. The original deadline for  requests-for-review was April 2012. Regulators reported that more than  160,000 borrowers had submitted requests-for-review as of April 30,  2012. The deadline was extended three times to December 31, 2012.  Regulators reported that more than 510,000 requests were submitted and  received as postmarked on or before the December 31, 2012 deadline.  According to OCC, roughly 300,000 additional files were selected for  review through the consultants\u2019 look-back review process. OCC staff told  us that more files likely would be selected if errors were found and  consultants needed to conduct additional sampling to identify as many  harmed borrowers as possible.", "Third-party consultants and law firms told us that the size of the loan files  and the scope of the file review made the process complicated and time- consuming. Consultants from whom we obtained information told us that  a typical loan file is large with many types of documents. For example,  documents may include servicer notes on communication with the  borrower, documents collected from the state foreclosure attorneys  responsible for the foreclosure activities, records of fees charged and  payments made, and, in many cases, documents assessing a borrower\u2019s  eligibility for loan modification and loss mitigation activities. Consultants  told us that some files may contain as many as 50 documents, potentially  comprising more than 2,000 pages. Consultants also stated that the  reviews were challenging because they covered such a wide variety of  complex issues, including different state foreclosure laws, federal laws  and regulations, and guidelines for federal and servicers\u2019 proprietary loan  modification programs. To assess each of these areas, consultants  developed a series of test questions\u2014generally yes or no questions\u2014to  identify potential errors. The number of test questions used by third-party  consultants to conduct the file reviews varied. For example, one  consultant told us that they had approximately 2,600 test questions with  more than 4,000 discrete steps, while another consultant told us they had  16,000 test questions. Further, third-party consultants from whom we  obtained information stated that their reviewers spent as many as 50  hours to complete a full file review, although review times varied  depending on the issue and type of review.", "OCC and the Federal Reserve stated that the uniqueness of each  servicer\u2019s borrower population and process for recording and storing  information on borrowers\u2019 loan files posed challenges for defining the  review parameters and developing a uniform review structure for all the  consultants. For example, Federal Reserve staff told us that servicers\u2019  systems have different ways to identify borrowers who are current on a  loan modification and that the systems have varying capabilities to  provide information about the last payment received from a borrower. As  a result, consultants had to take different approaches to identify  borrowers with the same characteristics. In addition, Federal Reserve  staff told us that servicers had different concentrations of loans in  geographic areas and that, therefore, consultants might select samples  differently based on these concentrations. For example, if a servicer did  not have high numbers of foreclosures in a particular state, choosing a  large sample of loans in that state would not have been appropriate. As a  result, OCC and Federal Reserve staff said that it was not feasible to  design one file review process that would apply to all servicers and that it  was necessary for third-party consultants to tailor their file review  processes, particularly the review questions used to conduct the file  review, to the unique characteristics of a given servicer.", "Faced with various complexities and challenges that the foreclosure  review posed, regulators told us that they issued guidance and took a  number of oversight steps. First, the sections of the consent orders  issued to servicers supervised by both OCC and the Federal Reserve  outlining the purpose of the foreclosure review were nearly identical.  According to OCC and Federal Reserve staff, the similarity in the consent  orders was intended to ensure that the reviews covered the same issues  and resulted in similar results for similarly situated borrowers. Consultants  we interviewed said that they designed their reviews to address the  issues as they were identified in the consent orders. Second, regulators  issued guidance to third-party consultants to help frame the file review  process and promote consistency in its implementation. Between May  2011 and October 2012, regulators issued 29 joint pieces of guidance to  third-party consultants on various topics. For example, OCC and the  Federal Reserve jointly issued a financial remediation framework that was  designed to be a unifying factor among all the reviews by helping to  ensure that similarly harmed borrowers received similar remediation.  Regulator staff said that they issued guidance in response to similar  questions they received from multiple consultants or examination teams,  which oversaw the reviews at the local level. For example, one third-party  consultant we interviewed said that the reviews of issues related to the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) would likely provide fairly  consistent results for borrowers due, in part, to the clear guidance  provided by regulators.", "In addition to consistent consent orders and guidance, OCC and Federal  Reserve staff implemented regular communication mechanisms to help  foster consistency in the reviews. Regulators had a robust system of  regular meetings involving third-party consultants, servicers, examination  team staff overseeing the consultants\u2019 work, and OCC headquarters and  Federal Reserve Board staff to discuss challenges with the file review  process and help promote consistency among the reviews. OCC and the  Federal Reserve met with the parties both separately and as a group and  received weekly status reports from the consultants. For example,  regulator staff said that weekly calls with third-party consultants provided  consultants with an opportunity to raise areas of inconsistency that they  had identified. These calls were also used to disseminate new guidance  and discuss comments on any pending guidance. According to third-party  consultants and examination team staff we interviewed, these meetings  were helpful for sharing information among the reviews, developing a  similar understanding of the file review process, and discussing  challenges consultants encountered in reviewing files that may have  affected the consistency of the results for borrowers. In addition to  meeting with consultants and servicers, OCC and Federal Reserve staff  also held a separate weekly meeting, which included only headquarters  staff of each regulator, to discuss new and emerging issues or requests  for clarification on guidance that each regulator received from its  respective local examination teams. In addition to the weekly calls, OCC  headquarters staff and Federal Reserve Board staff visited each of the  consultants to observe the file review processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Clarity in Regulators\u2019 Sampling Guidance Could Have Limited the Usefulness of the Information Obtained from the Foreclosure Review Process", "paragraphs": ["The April 2011 consent orders expressly allowed third-party consultants  to use sampling techniques to identify harmed borrowers. According to  regulator staff, the large number of loans in the review population as well  as the complexity of the file review process made it difficult for  consultants to review all the eligible loan files for errors. As a result, the  review relied on sampling, a process of selecting units\u2014in this case,  foreclosure files\u2014in a manner that regulators envisioned would allow  consultants to identify patterns in errors. In May 2011 regulator-issued  guidance on sampling, regulators expressly allowed third-party  consultants to use sampling and noted that the consultants\u2019 sampling  methodologies should take into consideration public perception as well as  the need to provide a high degree of certainty that borrowers who were  financially harmed would be identified and obtain remediation.", "The May 2011 guidance outlined broad parameters for how third-party  consultants should approach the sampling methodology to identify  harmed borrowers and support a consistent review, such that similarly  situated borrowers would have similar results. As part of sampling,  regulators anticipated that third-party consultants would segment the  review population into loan categories as some loan categories had a  potentially higher likelihood of errors. For example, the guidance identified  some potential high-risk loan categories, including certain states,  foreclosure law firms, and servicing or foreclosure processing activities  (e.g., rescinded foreclosures or foreclosure that occurred after loan  modification) that could be associated with a higher likelihood of servicing  or foreclosure-related errors. Regulator staff stated that differences  among the servicer\u2019s loan portfolios and servicing practices made  requiring specific loan categories for review inappropriate, with the  exception of three categories in which regulators anticipated that  consultants would identify a relatively large number of errors in the files.  For these three categories\u2014bankruptcies, SCRA loans, and agency- referred foreclosure cases\u2014regulators required 100 percent review of  files. The May 2011 guidance also indicated that consultants should be  prepared to conduct a second stage of additional analysis of files with a  certain number of servicing and foreclosure-related errors that were  identified during the initial sampling.", "Based on our analysis of the sampling plans developed by third-party  consultants, we found that the sampling methodologies used by  consultants varied among the reviews.", "Expected population error rate. The sampling plans varied in their  expected population error rate from 0 percent\u2014that is, consultants  expected to find few or no servicing or foreclosure processing errors  in the sampled loan category\u2014to 10 percent, with 8 of the 14 reviews  assuming an error rate of zero, three assuming an expected  population error rate of 3 percent, and three a rate of 10 percent.", "Loan category sample size. As a result of different expected  population error rates, the plans varied in the size of the samples for  analyzing various loan categories identified by the consultant. For  example, some consultants selected approximately 100 loans in a  sampled loan category for a review, and some consultants selected  approximately 370 loans in the sampled loan categories.", "Loan categories. Based on our analysis, the loan categories used by  consultants for their analysis varied from review to review. For  instance, although all the consultants analyzed the files for errors  related to loan modifications, some categorized loans by the loan  modification program (e.g., Home Affordable Modification Program  (HAMP) or proprietary) and others categorized loans for reasons  modifications were denied.", "Review parameters: For similar loan categories, some consultants  anticipated conducting 100 percent review of all files in that category  whereas other consultants planned to sample files. For example,  some third-party consultants planned to review all rescinded  foreclosures, whereas others proposed reviewing a sample of those  loans.", "According to regulator staff, differences in the sampling plans reflected  differences in the size and characteristics of the servicers\u2019 loan portfolios  and data systems. Regulator staff explained that they reviewed each  proposed sampling plan to help ensure it met the parameters outlined in  the guidance and would result in statistically valid results. However,  according to OCC staff, they recognized that some consultants had not  fully implemented the sampling approach as expected, and OCC is taking  steps to address these differences for one of the servicers that is not  subject to an amended consent order and must continue its review.", "Our analysis of the May 2011 sampling guidance provided by regulators  found that the guidance was ambiguous about a key parameter that  affected consultants\u2019 sampling methodologies and contributed to  differences in those methodologies. Specifically, in their May 2011  guidance, regulators did not indicate whether consultants should explicitly  set an expected population error rate or provide consultants with direction  on the factors they should consider when setting an appropriate expected  population error rate to determine the size of the sample used for their  analysis. GAO\u2019s Financial Audit Manual and the standards of the  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) have found  that a key element of effective sampling is the determination of an  appropriate sample size based on specified precision and reliability levels  and an expected population error rate or frequency of errors.", "Regulators\u2019 May 2011 guidance on sampling specified that consultants  should use 3 percent precision and 95 percent reliability levels to  determine their sample size. According to regulator staff, these precision  and reliability levels were selected to provide a high-level of confidence in  the sampling results. However, the guidance did not specify an expected  population error rate for consultants to use in determining sample size.  Generally, the expected population error rate, like precision and reliability  levels, is determined based on professional judgment and includes  consideration of factors such as results of prior reviews and knowledge  about any potential risks in servicing and foreclosure processing errors.  According to regulators, they expected consultants to find errors in their  sampled files, because the consent orders that required the foreclosure  review process arose out of assessments conducted by regulators that  identified the potential for servicing and foreclosure-related errors. Similar  to the precision and reliability levels, there is a relationship between the  expected population error rate and sample size needed to attain a  specific precision level (margin of error), where the size of the sample  generally expands as the expected population error rate approaches 50  percent. When an expected population error rate is not specified, it can  be interpreted as implying that the error rate is low or even zero\u2014that is,  that few or no errors are expected to be found in the sample regardless of  whether the expected population error rate of zero is appropriate for the  sample goals. OCC staff told us that their handbook on sampling  methodologies\u2014a reference their staff use for sampling and one that both  regulators suggested consultants consider in designing their sampling  approaches\u2014generally assumes few or no errors will be found in a  sample.", "Variations among the sample sizes used to analyze the various loan  categories identified by consultants result from differences in the  consultants\u2019 expected population error rates and led consultants to use  different triggers to determine when to conduct additional analysis of an  error or errors found in a loan category. As shown in figure 1, Consultant  A would conduct additional analysis of their sampled loan categories if  one or more errors were found. In contrast, Consultant B would conduct  additional analysis only when five or more errors were found in their  sampled categories. Both of these approaches use the precision and  reliability levels specified in the May 2011 guidance, with an expected  maximum threshold of a 3-percent error rate, but relied on different  sampling approaches and different expected population error rates to  calculate sample size. Therefore, with the same number of errors  identified through file reviews, some consultants would conduct additional  analysis and some would not. According to regulator staff, when errors  were found, they expected consultants to conduct additional sampling of  the loan category or to review all of the loans in that category. OCC staff  explained that after approving the original sampling methodologies, they  recognized that their review of the plans had missed some aspects and  that consultants were using various expected population error rates to  calculate sample size. OCC staff told us that they were considering steps  to try and address these differences for one of the servicers that had not  joined the agreements to end the foreclosure review. As a result of this  variation, the reviews could have produced inconsistent results for  similarly situated borrowers, thereby potentially limiting achievement of  one of the goals of the foreclosure review process.", "Our analysis also found that the May 2011 guidance on sampling did not  include a discussion of regulators\u2019 expectations for reporting on sampling,  and variations among the sampling plans would have limited the types of  information that regulators could report. For example, the guidance did  not specify if regulators expected consultants, based on their sampling  methodology, to be able to provide information on the error rate for the  servicer\u2019s whole population of eligible borrowers or for certain  characteristics, such as high-risk loan categories (e.g., states). Our  analysis found that 1 of the 14 reviews explicitly designed samples that  would potentially allow consultants to generate reliable estimates of the  error rate for certain states. Other consultants may have been able to  report counts of errors by state, but some consultants sampled as few as  one or five cases per state, and the counts would not allow regulators to  determine whether reported errors were relatively frequent or infrequent  in specific states. As a result, regulators could not have reported results  by state because some reviews did not have enough cases, selected in a  generalizable manner, from individual states to report statistically reliable  estimates. According to regulators, reporting error rates was not a  consideration in developing the sampling approach outlined in the  guidance; rather, the sampling methodology was intended to find as many  harmed borrowers as possible. However, it would be feasible to develop  sampling approaches that could both produce error rates and identify  characteristics of harmed borrowers.", "Similarly, differences in the loan categories analyzed by the third-party  consultants would have limited regulators\u2019 ability to easily aggregate  results among the reviews or present comparable servicer-specific  information. For example, differences in how consultants organized the  loan modification category could have impeded regulators\u2019 ability to  aggregate the results of the loan modification analyses conducted by  third-party consultants or to present equivalent information among the  servicers to the public. In addition, these differences in the loan category  definitions as well as other differences in the consultants\u2019 sampling  methodologies would have made it difficult for regulators to aggregate  results to represent the full population of eligible loans. One consultant  told us that they anticipated calculating an error rate based on the number  of files reviewed compared to the number of files with errors. This method  might have provided some information on errors, but could be subject to  bias if the sample of loans reviewed were not representative of the  population, regardless of whether the estimates from the samples were  appropriately weighted for probability of selection or included appropriate  confidence intervals to reflect sampling error. However, this information  would not necessarily provide a statistically valid description of the extent  of errors in the full population that regulators and other stakeholders  would need to understand and assess the results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators\u2019 Sampling Approach Hindered Their Ability to Monitor Achievement of a Review Goal", "paragraphs": ["According to regulator staff, they expected consultants to continue  reviewing files until as many harmed borrowers as possible were  identified, a goal of the foreclosure review process. Regulator staff told us  that if third-party consultants\u2019 initial analyses of sampled loans identified  errors within a loan category, consultants were expected to analyze the  characteristics of loans with errors to identify any patterns and use this  analysis as the basis for a second sampling phase or to review all the  files in a loan category. Although not explicitly stated in the May 2011  guidance, according to OCC staff, additional analysis was warranted  when the errors in the sampled loan category exceeded 3 percent with a  95 percent confidence level. Although the May 2011 guidance on  sampling did not specify the characteristics to consider for this analysis,  Federal Reserve staff told us that identifying the characteristics to include  would require consultants to use their judgment and they anticipated it  would include things like the loan category itself\u2014such as an error related  to a certain foreclosure attorney that might warrant additional review of  other loans that had used the same attorney\u2014or some other  characteristic about the loan.", "According to a few consultants, they were considering characteristics  such as the loan product or date of the loan modification solicitation or  foreclosure sale, as potential characteristics. Regulators told us that  based on the results of the consultants\u2019 analyses of the initially sampled  loans with errors, consultants were to develop a methodology\u2014including  conducting additional sampling or reviewing all files with those shared  characteristics\u2014to identify other loans that had similar characteristics that  could have had similar errors to use as a basis for a second review  phase. According to Federal Reserve staff, this process would have been  iterative\u2014where consultants would have found errors, analyzed those  errors, resampled and then repeated the process until as many files with  errors as possible had been found. Third-party consultants were expected  to discuss the results of their initial file reviews, their analysis of error  patterns, and their proposed approach for conducting additional file  reviews with regulators prior to conducting additional reviews.", "Our analysis found that the regulators\u2019 sampling approach did not include  mechanisms to facilitate their oversight of the extent to which consultants  would have reached as many harmed borrowers as possible. For  example, the regulators\u2019 sampling approach did not provide an objective  method for regulators to use in determining if consultants had conducted  sufficient reviews and could stop their review activities, except in those  cases where there were few or no errors. As we described earlier,  consultants were using different triggers of the number of errors to  determine if additional analysis of loan categories was required. Without a  mechanism for regulators to use in assessing the extent to which each  consultant had found as many harmed borrowers as possible or to  compare the review results among the consultants, assessing which  consultants had done enough work to identify a sufficient portion of  harmed borrowers and which consultants needed to conduct additional  analysis would have been difficult for regulators. According to Federal  Reserve staff, they anticipated that consultants would continue reviewing  files until the sampling found no additional errors. However, unless a  large majority of the population is examined for errors, reviewing files until  sampling finds no more errors does not necessarily imply that all or most  errors would be identified. OCC staff told us that at the time of the  agreements that led to the amended consent orders, regulators were  considering developing such mechanisms.", "Additional sampling activities\u2014specifically, the use of baseline samples\u2014 could have provided regulators with a mechanism to use in monitoring the  extent to which consultants had identified as many harmed borrowers as  possible. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for  statistical surveys state that where sampling is used, it should include  protocols to monitor activities and provide information on the quality of the  analyzed data. A baseline sample could have been used to establish an  estimate of the number of harmed borrowers among the servicer\u2019s full  population as part of their sampling methodology and would have  provided an objective and consistent measure for regulators to use to  gauge if a third-party consultant had identified a sufficient portion of  harmed borrowers through their reviews. Specifically, regulators could  have compared a statistically valid estimate of the number of harmed  borrowers in the servicer\u2019s total population of eligible borrowers with the  number of harmed borrowers the consultant identified through file  reviews. Discrepancies between the estimated number of harmed  borrowers and the number found in the review would have helped to  indicate the extent to which there may have been additional harmed  borrowers who had not been identified. Without this type of comparison,  regulators did not have an objective measure to help determine when a  consultant had completed sufficient review of the servicers\u2019 files.", "In addition, the regulators\u2019 sampling approach did not provide a clear  mechanism for regulators to assess the extent to which consultants had  identified the appropriate high- and low-risk loan categories to confirm  that those categories were accurate and to signal if there were additional  potential high-risk loan categories that had not been identified, but  warranted additional sampling and review. As we noted earlier, the  regulators\u2019 sampling guidance suggested a number of high-risk loan  categories consultants should consider in designing their sampling  approach\u2014such as rescinded foreclosure or foreclosures following loan  modification\u2014that were potentially associated with a higher likelihood of  error and, depending on the servicer, warranted targeted sampling to  verify the extent to which errors had occurred among the loans in those  categories. However, there is evidence to suggest that other loan  categories not included in the guidance, such as certain loan categories  based on demographic characteristics may also be associated with higher  likelihood of servicer errors. Without a mechanism to assess the  accuracy and sufficiency of each consultant\u2019s high- and low-risk loan  categories, regulators would not have been able to assess the extent to  which consultants were targeting the appropriate high- and low-risk  categories to find as many harmed borrowers as possible.", "An estimate of the overall error rate for the population\u2014a rate that could  have been generated using information from the baseline sample\u2014could  have been compared with the error rates consultants found for high- and  low-risk loan categories to confirm that those categories were accurate  and to signal if there were additional potential high-risk loan categories  that had not yet been identified. OMB has suggested that where  different characteristics are being compared, agencies should conduct  additional testing to help ensure appropriate statistical conclusions are  derived from the data. In our prior work we have used this type of  statistical testing to compare the performance (such as error rate) in a  total population with the performance for subgroups\u2014such as loan  categories\u2014to help distinguish among those groups. This can be part of  conducting an overall risk assessment of the population to enable users  to better focus on high- and low-risk areas. Without a mechanism to  gauge the extent to which high-risk loan categories had been identified,  regulators could have had difficulty assessing whether the consultants\u2019  proposed activities for additional analysis were targeted at the appropriate  high-risk loan categories to identify as many harmed borrowers as  possible.", "The May 2011 sampling guidance did not include a requirement that  consultants develop a baseline sample, but most consultants included  one in their sampling methodology. According to regulator staff, they had  not considered requiring consultants to include a baseline sample in their  methodology because the purpose of sampling was to help find harmed  borrowers by identifying concentrations of servicing and foreclosure- related errors as described in the consent orders, not to establish an error  rate for the servicer. Our analysis found that most consultants included a  baseline sample for the full review population in their sampling  methodology. However, due to differences among the consultants\u2019  baseline samples, the ability of regulators to use consultants\u2019 baseline  sampling results to assess consultants\u2019 activities varies. For example, the  samples were not designed to estimate actual population error rates and  regulators\u2019 guidance did not direct consultants to statistically test for  differences in the servicer\u2019s total eligible population and among high- and  low-risk loan categories.", "Our analysis also found that the regulators\u2019 approach to conducting  repeated additional analyses to find as many harmed borrowers as  possible potentially involved timeliness trade-offs. OMB\u2019s standards for  statistical analysis state that the sampling design should be appropriate to  achieve the sampling goals; in this case regulator staff told us that the  phase-one sampling was designed to identify patterns from among loans  with errors to facilitate a second phase of analysis to find as many  harmed borrowers as possible. Where the goal of sampling is to identify  patterns from among loans with errors in a sample, using a larger sample  size has the potential to provide more information to use in analyzing  patterns and determining the appropriate next steps. For those  consultants that used smaller sample sizes in their phase one analysis,  for example, a sample size of 100 loans where one error would trigger  additional analysis, finding patterns among the characteristics of those  loans with errors may have been difficult in cases where there were few  errors. As a result, these consultants may have had to conduct  potentially time-consuming repeated sampling of certain loan categories  where errors were found to find enough loans with errors to be able to  analyze the findings and identify patterns that would have allowed them to  conduct additional sampling or review. OCC staff told us that some  consultants were considering using statistical modeling as part of their  analysis of loans with errors to identify patterns from among those loans.  However, in cases where the sample size is small and the number of  loans with errors is small, the value of statistical modeling to identify  patterns could be limited.", "According to Federal Reserve staff, due to concerns about the timeliness  of the sampling process, regulators anticipated that they may have had to  cut short the sampling process and provide remediation based on certain  borrower profiles\u2014that is, borrowers who shared characteristics  associated with loans with a higher likelihood of error\u2014without analyzing  each of the loan files that shared that profile. In contrast, a larger phase  one sample size designed with the goal of identifying patterns among  errors may have provided consultants with more information on loans with  errors to use as the basis for their additional analysis. In particular, this  may have been valuable for loan categories with a relatively large number  of loans\u2014for example, our analysis found that in some cases a loan  category had more than 10,000 loans and, for one review, as many as  50,000 loans\u2014and having more information available to use when  analyzing the results for these categories and determining next steps may  have been helpful. Although a larger sample size does not guarantee a  more timely review, a larger statistical sample may have provided  additional opportunities for analysis even with a similar proportion of  errors. In the case of the foreclosure review, where the goal was to use  sampling to find as many harmed borrowers as possible by analyzing  patterns from among loans with errors, larger sample sizes may have  resulted in a more timely process and potentially may have identified  harmed borrowers more quickly. According to regulators, they designed  their sampling to have a low tolerance for errors so as to find as many  harmed borrowers as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broad Guidance and Limited Monitoring of Inconsistencies Increased Risks of Different Treatment for Similar Borrowers", "paragraphs": ["According to third-party consultants, regulators\u2019 guidance did not address  certain aspects of the foreclosure review and consultants had to use  additional judgment and interpretation when applying certain guidance,  increasing the risks of inconsistency among review results. Consultants  also noted that regulators issued critical guidance throughout the review  process and frequently updated guidance, which expanded the scope of  the reviews and contributed to delays. For example, the Federal Reserve  issued three clarifications of loan modification guidance and OCC  provided seven responses to frequently asked questions on reviews of  loan modifications. According to regulator staff, developing the  foreclosure review process was intentionally iterative where they  responded to the most immediate need and used their evolving  knowledge to help refine the guidance. Consultants said that changes to  guidance required them to develop new test questions, re-train reviewers,  and redo file reviews. Although regulators issued numerous pieces of  formal guidance and informally responded to specific questions about  review procedures that examination teams or consultants raised,  consultants said that some of the guidance issued was not specific,  leaving room for their interpretation and potentially contributing to  inconsistent interpretations.", "Guidance on fees: Guidance from regulators generally directed  consultants to consider whether the fees servicers charged for actions  such as property inspections or lawn care services were permissible  under the terms of the loan, followed applicable state and federal law,  and were reasonable and customary. However, regulators provided  additional explanation in response to requests from consultants for  clarification and guidance on defining the terms \u201creasonable\u201d and  \u201ccustomary.\u201d Consultants for 13 of the 14 reviews indicated that they  used investor guidelines to determine if the fees charged were  reasonable; however, one consultant told us consultants were using  different versions of these guidelines. In some cases, consultants  used additional methods to evaluate whether fees charged to  borrowers were customary. For example, one consultant evaluated  fees against a set of benchmarks created from multiple servicers\u2019  actual fee charges, while others said they benchmarked only against  the investor guidelines.", "Guidance on remediation: Although regulators issued guidance to  consultants on how to determine the appropriate remediation for  different financial harms, 4 out of the 13 remediation categories would  have required consultants to make remediation determinations on a  case-by-case basis, risking inconsistent treatment of borrowers. For  example, consultants would have had to determine remediation on a  case-by-case basis if they found that a servicer had initiated  foreclosure or foreclosed on a borrower who was protected by federal  bankruptcy law. Consultants reported taking a range of approaches to  these case-by-case determinations, including awaiting further  guidance, developing their own guidelines, or relying on  recommendations from their third-party law firms. According to  Federal Reserve staff, at the time of the agreements that led to the  amended consent orders, regulators were considering options to  provide additional guidance to consultants for work in these areas,  including determining remediation amounts.", "Guidance on missing documentation: Guidance issued to  consultants in March 2012 on how to determine whether a borrower  suffered financial harm when key documents\u2014such as documents  that evidenced that foreclosure actions were taken or loan  modification application documents\u2014were missing indicated that  consultants should treat those instances as errors on the part of  servicers. However, this guidance noted that consultants should defer  decisions on how to determine borrower remediation until regulators  provided further guidance. In the absence of additional guidance,  consultants indicated that they took a variety of approaches, including  waiting to make remediation decisions, making preliminary  considerations of whether the error might have caused financial harm,  or working with their third-party law firm to review any applicable legal  precedents. According to OCC staff, at the time of the agreements  that led to the amended consent orders, they were planning to issue  further guidance to consultants on remediation for borrowers with  missing documents and they had informally provided additional  direction about treatment of files with missing documents during their  regular meetings with consultants.", "According to third-party consultants, regulators missed key opportunities  to increase the likelihood of consistent outcomes for borrowers by not  requiring development of common criteria or reference materials that  served as the basis for the foreclosure review process. Third-party  consultants and their respective law firms we interviewed told us that they  each developed their own test questions used by their file reviewers to  determine whether any errors or financial harm occurred. Consultants  developed the test questions based on analyses of state foreclosure laws,  loan modification guidelines, and bank policies, among other references.  According to OCC staff, the state law references were fairly  straightforward and they had confidence that the third-party consultants  and law firms would provide fairly consistent interpretations. However,  according to third-party consultants and law firms we interviewed,  compiling these references and using them to develop review questions  was challenging and time consuming and, in some cases, required  judgment or interpretation of the laws or guidelines. For example, they  noted that certain areas of relevant state law were unsettled and  continued to evolve as courts issued decisions. In addition,  representatives of law firms involved in the reviews told us that each firm  developed its own list of state foreclosure requirements and often came to  interpretations different from those of other law firms involved with the  foreclosure review. Consultants also indicated that some law firms had  different interpretations of which laws were applicable. According to OCC  staff, the scope of the reviews was limited to federal and state laws, but  several consultants reported that they reviewed servicers\u2019 compliance  with certain county- or court-level requirements, whereas other  consultants said they generally did not include these requirements.  Although OCC and Federal Reserve staff told us that law firms were  selected for their independence and capacity to interpret these  documents and make these types of decisions, with multiple law firms  developing their own interpretations of the applicable laws and  requirements, consultants may have based their test questions on  different interpretations of laws, which could have hindered regulators\u2019  ability to achieve one of their goals for the foreclosure review, similar  treatment for similarly situated borrowers.", "Our analysis indicates that regulators missed another opportunity to  standardize reference materials in the area of loss mitigation and loan  modification requirements. Consultants noted challenges in compiling  relevant loan modification program guidelines. For example, according to  consultants, they had to compile requirements for multiple loan  modification programs and representatives of one consultant we  interviewed said that they had to compile requirements of 40 different  loan modification programs that the servicer used during the 2009 to 2010  period. In addition to numerous different programs, the guidelines for a  single program may have changed multiple times. One consultant noted  that they had to track and apply 28 program changes the Department of  the Treasury (Treasury) made to HAMP between 2009 and 2010. Our  prior work on HAMP identified instances of servicers interpreting HAMP  guidelines inconsistently, and a consumer advocacy group report noted  similar challenges with servicers implementing HAMP according to the  guidelines. In addition, several consultants from whom we obtained  information told us that they had to make some judgment calls when  interpreting regulatory guidance and program guidelines. For example,  one consultant noted that HAMP guidelines were unclear in critical  respects, particularly regarding the nature and extent of servicers\u2019  obligations to notify borrowers about steps in the HAMP process. OCC  staff said they were aware of Treasury\u2019s HAMP guidance and other  servicing guidelines and made an effort to make their guidance to  consultants consistent with these materials. OCC and Federal Reserve  staff also stated that certain staff members had general discussions with  Treasury staff to understand the HAMP guidelines. Consultants we  interviewed told us that they largely relied on their internal subject-matter  experts to interpret the relevant guidelines and did not consult with  program experts, such as Treasury staff who designed and developed  HAMP. As a result, third-party consultants and law firms may have  applied different interpretations of the legal or program requirements for  the same programs to the reviews, and the use of different reference  materials could have reduced the likelihood of achieving the goal of  treating similarly situated borrowers consistently.", "Regulators took steps to monitor potential inconsistencies among the  reviews, but these steps were limited and likely would have resulted in  delays in providing remediation to borrowers. First, according to  regulators, they closely monitored weekly reports provided by consultants  to identify any differences in their progress that may have indicated some  inconsistency in the foreclosure review processes. These initial reports  included information on the number of mailings; requests for review; and  high-level counts of file reviews started, in process, and completed and  the number of files with borrower harm, but they did not include  information on the specific types of errors identified in the reviews or the  test criteria used to review files. Therefore, the usefulness of the reports  for identifying inconsistencies was limited. According to OCC staff, they  planned to begin requiring consultants to report on additional information,  such as the types of errors associated with financial harm found in the  reviews and proposed remediation amounts, which would have helped  identify inconsistencies among reviews.", "Second, OCC and Federal Reserve staff said that they would identify  potential inconsistencies among the reviews by having staff from one  examination team assist with another team\u2019s oversight of the foreclosure  review, but these rotations among the staff were not systematically  organized and did not include rotations across regulators. Further, some  examination team members we interviewed said that they had  participated in one or two reviews for other servicers, but examiners  overseeing reviews at a larger servicer noted that they were unable to  participate in multiple reviews because of time constraints. In addition,  OCC and the Federal Reserve did not provide the examination team  members conducting these rotations with guidance on the types of issues  to consider in assessing inconsistencies. This unsystematic approach  limited the extent to which regulators would have been able to identify  trends or inconsistencies.", "Third, according to regulators, they reviewed some test questions but did  not compare them across reviews to identify inconsistencies. OCC staff  acknowledged that inconsistencies were inherent in the foreclosure  review because of the large number of actors and decision points and the  subjective nature of some of the decisions consultants had to make.  Similarly, Federal Reserve staff told us that inconsistencies among  reviews were inevitable due to differences among the servicers\u2019 policies,  procedures, and systems, including their loan modification and loss  mitigation programs. Regulator staff said they had planned to conduct  assessments of the extent of inconsistencies affecting the outcomes for  borrowers across the reviews after the reviews and recommendations for  remediation were completed. However, conducting such an assessment  after the reviews were completed could have resulted in delays in  remediation because third-party consultants may have needed to change  their file review questions and redo file reviews if regulators identified  inconsistencies. In addition, regulators would have had to wait until all  consultants had completed their reviews to conduct such an assessment.  Consultants reported that they had estimated completing their reviews in  different time periods and an OCC official estimated that the reviews  would not have been completed until 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Foreclosure Review Highlighted the Importance of Planning and Monitoring Progress toward Goals", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the foreclosure review process identified challenges in  regulators\u2019 planning for the foreclosure review. These challenges  underscored the importance of the following three aspects of planning  and monitoring: (1) identifying the type and amount of information to  report as final results during the design of data analysis; (2) consulting  with stakeholders; and (3) assessing how well the reviews were tracking  their goals of identifying as many harmed borrowers as possible,  achieving consistent reviews for borrowers, and helping to restore public  confidence in the mortgage market.", "As described earlier, variations among the 14 sampling methodologies  used by third-party consultants for analysis of loan files limited the types  of information that regulators would have been able to report. According  to regulator staff, they did not want to make final decisions on the types of  information they may have needed for public reporting before they had  seen the preliminary results from the file reviews. OMB has found that in  designing data analysis activities, including sampling, agencies should  consider the types of data they need to collect to be able to report useful  information on the results of their activities to the intended audience.  The resulting sample design should have these data output requirements  built into the structure. GAO\u2019s internal control standards state that  producing reliable and relevant data is important for oversight and  management, including oversight provided by Congress. In addition, our  prior work has found that public reporting of results can be important for  strengthening public confidence in a process, and the data analysis  strategy should be designed to include information that can be reported  publicly. Providing useful and relevant public reporting of the review  results also was a key element in renewing public confidence in the  mortgage servicing market, a goal of the foreclosure review process.", "However, regulators were limited in what they would have been able to  report because they did not plan for reporting in the design of the reviews.", "As described earlier, the scope of the foreclosure review was broad and  regulators experienced challenges in issuing guidance on the wide variety  of complex issues covered by the reviews, resulting in delays in  completing file reviews and potentially contributing to inconsistencies in  the file review process. Regulators may have been able to better define  the scope of activities and issue more complete guidance prior to  commencing the foreclosure review process, thereby potentially reducing  the number of revisions to the scope or guidance, by consulting with  organizations directly responsible for or familiar with particular aspects of  the review before initiating the foreclosure review process. For example,  although regulators consulted with Treasury staff for their technical  expertise on the HAMP requirements during their development of the loan  modification and loss mitigation guidance, regulators did not have the  benefit of additional consultations with Treasury compliance officials and  discussions with other agencies responsible for overseeing federal loan  modification and loss mitigation programs to help them more clearly  define the programs covered by the consent order requirements and the  elements to consider in assessing servicers\u2019 evaluation of loan  modification and loss mitigation activities\u2014areas where regulators issued  clarifying guidance to third-party consultants. Regulators issued  additional guidance to clarify that the review of HAMP and proprietary  loan modification programs should include programs overseen by the  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department  of Agriculture, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.", "In addition, regulators did not consult with community groups, such as  national organizations representing housing counselors that have worked  with individual borrowers on their loan modification and loss mitigation  applications. These consultations might have provided input on  challenges specific servicers and borrowers experienced with the range  of loss mitigation and loan modification activities which could have  assisted in identifying high-risk loan categories or program elements to  consider. For example, our prior work surveying housing counselors  found that while assisting borrowers with HAMP applications, counselors  experienced challenges with servicers, including missing documentation,  lengthy decision-making processes, and miscalculations of borrowers\u2019  incomes. Our prior work that establishes generally accepted project  planning practices identified consulting with stakeholders as one of seven  generally accepted practices. In addition, our internal control standards  have found that consulting with external stakeholders can have a  significant impact on the achievement of goals. In contrast to the  process used to develop the loan modification and loss mitigation  guidance, OCC and the Federal Reserve consulted with consumer  groups while developing the remediation framework. In addition, they  consulted with the U.S. Department of Justice in developing the  foreclosure review guidelines related to SCRA. Although this consultation  occurred later in the process after third-party consultants had begun  SCRA reviews, one consultant cited the guidance that resulted from the  consultations as evidence of a strong practice that helped promote  consistent results among the reviews.", "As we described earlier, regulators\u2019 sampling approach did not include  mechanisms that would allow them to objectively measure the extent to  which consultants were on track to identify as many harmed borrowers as  possible. Similarly, as we previously described, regulators had a limited  process in place to identify inconsistencies among consultants\u2019 file review  processes that could have affected results for borrowers. OCC and  Federal Reserve staff told us that they were aware of some areas where  there may have been inconsistencies, but according to Federal Reserve  staff these areas would not have led to significant differences. However,  in the absence of mechanisms to systematically monitor consistency,  regulators did not have the information to verify their understanding or  identify areas of the review with an increased likelihood of inconsistency.", "Our prior work has identified using intermediate activities or measures to  assess progress toward intended results as an effective management  practice to understand the extent to which activities are on track to reach  stated goals.

We found that such activities can help management  target areas in need of improvement and select appropriate  methodologies to realize that improvement.

As illustrated in Treasury\u2019s implementation of the Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), external communications can include  posting information on its website and regular, public reporting. Our  previous work on TARP described the importance of public reporting as a  means to improve transparency and address potential questions of  whether similarly situated borrowers are being treated fairly. For  example, Treasury periodically issued public reports on the progress and  performance of its TARP housing programs. These reports have provided  information to a range of stakeholders, including Congress and the  general public.

In  addition, they recommended that the review guidelines issued by the  regulators be made public, similar to Treasury\u2019s release of guidance for  HAMP. According to consumer groups, these actions, among others,  could have increased the public\u2019s understanding of the reviews and  allowed borrowers to ensure their files were properly reviewed. The  foreclosure review, unlike TARP and TARP-funded programs such as  HAMP, was not a government program. However, as OCC described, it  was part of a larger set of government-directed actions in response to the  housing and mortgage crises.

Our work on designing evaluations, including financial audits, has  found that systematic and comprehensive planning enhances the quality,  credibility, and usefulness of the results and contributes to a more  effective use of time and resources. We found that one of the first steps  in designing a review should be to define the purpose and scope of the  review, including defining what data will be collected and what  comparisons will be made. In addition, evaluation questions should be  clear and specific, and should use terms that can be defined and  measured so that the purpose and scope are readily understood and  feasible. Our prior work establishing a lessons-learned process also has  found that assessing and using lessons learned from previous experience  can provide a powerful method of ensuring that beneficial information is  factored into the planning and work processes of future activities.

Nevertheless, the broad and expanding scope of the reviews and  delays in defining key concepts could have been mitigated by more  advanced planning from regulators, resulting in more efficient and  effective reviews. The April 2011 consent orders provide a general  description of the scope of the file reviews consultants were to conduct.  According to third-party consultants, these parameters resulted in a broad  review scope that generally covered all instances of noncompliance with  applicable law and servicing guidelines as they related to the post-default  residential mortgage loan borrower experience, including instances of  noncompliance that resulted in financial harm to borrowers requiring  remediation. Regulators may have missed opportunities to potentially  narrow and refine the project scope\u2014for example, through earlier  definition of a harmed borrower or agreement on errors not resulting in  remediation that may not have warranted additional review. Changes to  guidance also expanded the scope of the reviews. For example, as we  noted previously, changes to loan modification guidance contributed to an  expanded scope for those reviews and delays in completing the work,  including, in some cases, redoing file reviews.", "According to regulator staff, developing the file review process was  iterative; they learned as the reviews progressed, and regulators used  that knowledge to help refine the review process. In our work on  designing evaluations and audits, we recognize that a review process can  be iterative and that the scope and activities of the review may change as  work progresses and data limitations or new information arise.  Nevertheless, conducting a planning process that involves all  stakeholders provides an opportunity to examine preliminary information  and pilot-test processes and procedures to help further define the scope  of potential activities and hedge against the risk of future changes. In  addition, assessing lessons learned by using project critiques and  discussions with key participants and stakeholders\u2014such as local  examination team staff, third-party consultants and law firms, and external  groups\u2014could identify the root causes of strengths and weaknesses of  the foreclosure review that could apply to the amended consent order  activities.

OCC  staff said that the servicers were instructed to use objective data and  definitions and guidance from regulators in placing borrowers in the  categories and that the examination teams would use the guidance  provided to servicers to conduct their validation process. Regulator  staff said that they agreed that clear guidance on the categorization  and file review process and validation by examination teams are tools  that will help the servicers and examination teams navigate this  complex process.", "In most cases, servicers, with regulators\u2019 approval, have engaged the  third-party consultants to review borrowers\u2019 files in two categories  (SCRA and foreclosed borrowers who were not in default) to  determine whether borrowers experienced those specific types of  harm.

Regulator staff said they provided a list of eligible activities  to servicers and advised them to prioritize borrowers covered under  the consent orders for assistance.

OCC staff stated that the direct payments  provided under the amended consent orders will likely be more consistent  than what would have occurred under the foreclosure review because  servicers are using a standard framework and objective criteria to  categorize borrowers and all borrowers in a particular category will  receive the same payment amount. According to regulator staff, the  categorization instructions provided to servicers, regular meetings with  servicers and examination teams, site visits, and examination team  verification processes will provide opportunities to review and discuss the  results of each servicer\u2019s categorization of borrowers. However, whether  there is a similar process that will compare results across OCC and  Federal Reserve supervised servicers is unclear. Furthermore, to what  extent regulators will assess the implications of any inconsistencies  among the reviews that consultants are continuing to conduct for the  servicers that did not sign agreements with regulators is unknown.", "Applying lessons from the foreclosure review process and our internal  control standards to the amended consent order activities would suggest  that mechanisms to centrally promote consistency and monitor  agreement activities could help achieve consistent results for borrowers.

In our prior  work, we found that using a horizontal review mechanism is an option to  help mitigate risks of inconsistent results for activities conducted by  multiple entities. For example, comparing servicer decision-making  processes, including any criteria used by the servicers to categorize  borrowers, could identify any potential differences and the extent to which  these differences may result in different direct payment decisions for  similarly situated borrowers. Similarly, mechanisms to provide clear and  specific guidance\u2014such as guidance on testing and validation of servicer  activities\u2014for local examination teams to use in their oversight of  individual servicer activities could help regulators to more easily monitor  and compare servicer activities and the results for borrowers among the  reviews. Without using mechanisms to centrally monitor the consistency  of servicers\u2019 activities to categorize borrowers, regulators may risk delays  in providing direct payments to borrowers and inconsistent results.

In addition, as  previously discussed, public reporting is also a mechanism for external  communication that can enhance transparency. Experiences with current  government initiatives that are aimed at assisting struggling homeowners  and involve institutions and mortgage-related issues similar to those of  the foreclosure review also highlight the benefits of regular performance  reporting. Specifically, periodic reports on the performance of and  participation in TARP programs and scheduled reports on servicers\u2019  compliance with requirements of the National Mortgage Settlement are  intended to promote transparency and build public confidence.

Ultimately, the complexity of the foreclosure reviews and  limitations in regulators\u2019 guidance and monitoring of the foreclosure  review challenged their ability to achieve the stated goals. OCC and the  Federal Reserve took a number of steps to foster consistency of this  unprecedented review, including issuance of nearly identical consent  orders and joint issuance of guidance documents for third-party  consultants. However, other efforts related to guidance and monitoring  may have exacerbated the challenges and complexities inherent in the  process. In particular, existing guidance on sampling was ambiguous,  leading to inconsistent sampling methodologies used by consultants, and  did not include key oversight mechanisms to facilitate assessment of the  extent to which consultants had identified as many harmed borrowers as  possible. In addition, regulators\u2019 limited monitoring of consistency of the  consultants\u2019 sampling methodologies and review processes increased  risks that similarly situated borrowers would receive different results. As a  result, the regulators risked not achieving the intended goals of identifying  as many harmed borrowers as possible and treating similarly situated  borrowers similarly, and this remains a challenge for the servicers  continuing the foreclosure review. Our prior work has identified practices,  such as assessing progress toward goals and designing such monitoring  during the planning stage of a project, as effective management  practices. In addition, OMB has found that in planning data analysis  activities, such as sampling, agencies should take necessary steps to  ensure that they have collected the appropriate data from which to draw  conclusions. Assessing the review processes of the continuing reviews  for consistency and implementing a mechanism to assess the sufficiency  of additional sampling activities could help mitigate risk of similarly  situated borrowers receiving different results and facilitate oversight of the  extent to which consultants have reached as many harmed borrowers as  possible.", "Although the regulators have terminated activity related to the foreclosure  review for the servicers with amended consent orders, the foreclosure  review process offers an opportunity for the regulators to leverage this  experience to help ensure that similar difficulties are better addressed in  future efforts.

Therefore,  consideration of lessons from the foreclosure review activities, such as  advance design of data analysis activities and assessment of  inconsistencies in the file review processes, is one way to help regulators  improve the clarity of their guidance and ensure effective monitoring of  progress toward results for the activities under the amended consent  orders and the three remaining servicers still subject to the foreclosure  review requirement that will cover 450,000 eligible borrowers.

The scope of our work was limited to the foreclosure review at  the 14 servicers that are subject to the April 2011 consent orders. We  were in the process of reviewing various aspects of the foreclosure review  when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve)  announced agreements with 11 of the 14 servicers to discontinue the  foreclosure review and replace it with a broad payment process.", "To assess challenges to achieving the goals of the foreclosure review  process, we identified three areas of the review process to use as a basis  for our analysis. Specifically, we analyzed consultants\u2019 application of  guidance to conduct the reviews and recommend remediation;  consultants\u2019 development of test questions related to loan modifications,  state foreclosure laws, and fee reasonableness; and consultants\u2019  sampling methodologies for selecting files to review. Based on our prior  work on the foreclosure review, these were areas we identified as  particularly challenging for ensuring consistent reviews. To obtain  information on consultants\u2019 development of test questions and application  of regulatory guidance, we reviewed the guidance and conducted site  visits and in-person interviews with five consultant engagement teams. To  identify third-party consultants to interview, we selected consultants that  were engaged to conduct reviews for servicers that are overseen by each  regulator. In addition, we selected consultants engaged by servicers with  a range in sizes of eligible population for the review, including some of the  largest servicers. During the site visits we also observed demonstrations  of the file review process and systems. In addition, we obtained  responses to a standardized questionnaire from all of the consultants. We  compared consultants\u2019 processes for compiling reference materials,  developing test questions, and applying guidance. We reviewed  documents regulators used to monitor the file reviews, such as status  reports and meeting agendas. We also interviewed regulator staff and  examination teams on steps taken to promote and assess consistency in  the reviews and the effects of any differences. To obtain information on  third-party consultants\u2019 sampling plans, we used a data collection  instrument created by our statisticians. We analyzed information  contained in engagement letters between the servicers and consultants  for the sampling parameters consultants used to select files. We  confirmed key observations of our analysis in interviews and site visits  with officials responsible for developing the sampling plans at five third- party consultant engagement teams, interviews with regulator staff, and  through examination teams that reviewed the plans. In addition, we  obtained information on consultants\u2019 plans for additional analytical  methods and confirmed other observations of our analysis through a  standardized written questionnaire to consultants. We compared the  information and these parties\u2019 actions to criteria such as the regulators\u2019  standard practices, stated goals for the foreclosure review, and our  internal control standards. In addition, we reviewed our prior work on the  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Home Affordable Modification  Program, and reports where we established criteria on lessons-learned  procedures, generally accepted project management practices, and  effective management practices. We also referred to our sampling  standards and several other references on sampling standards from  OCC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We considered these  practices applicable to the foreclosure review because they concern the  use of data from samples to draw inferences about the populations from  which the samples are drawn. To further evaluate and asses the sampling  plans, we also compiled a list of common sampling terms based on the  work cited above, as well as other analyses, and vetted the definitions for  these terms internally with our methodological staff, including staff  responsible for sampling procedures related to financial audits and  program audits. Any data we obtained on the number of borrowers in the  scope of the reviews or the status of the reviews were used for  background purposes only and were not used to support our findings and  conclusions. As such, we obtained information from regulator staff and  the data administrator about how the data were obtained and compiled,  but we did not assess the reliability of the data.", "Statistical sampling can be a powerful tool for drawing inferences about  populations when a full census of cases is infeasible. Well designed and  executed samples allow researchers to make estimates of population  characteristics and to specify uncertainty due to sampling error  associated with those estimates. Parameter estimates and associated  measures of precision (such as confidence intervals or margins of error)  are developed from the sample data using estimation formulas consistent  with the sampling plan actually used. For example, if the sample design  were complex (such as using differing probabilities of selection for  different portions of the population) and if estimation formulas for simple  random sampling were used to produce estimates, those estimates and  the associated confidence intervals would likely be incorrect.  Additionally, estimates projected to a population of interest may be  subject to bias when a sample fails to cover the population of interest,  such as when the list used for sampling (the sampling frame) excludes  relevant units or when data from only a portion of the sample are  collected.", "The design of an appropriate sample is intricately linked with the goals of  the sample. These goals can include the importance of establishing the  estimate within a narrow confidence interval, the need to conduct  statistical testing against a threshold or for differences, the ability to make  estimates to subpopulations, and the desire to report specific results. A  sample that is designed to test against a specified tolerance level may  use different sample sizes and a different approach to statistical testing  than a sample that is designed to estimate the level of an attribute in the  population. Some uncertainty is implicit in sampling as a tradeoff for such  factors as the cost and time required to examine all of the data. However,  according to AICPA guidelines, sampling is inappropriate if there is no  tolerance for risk of possible erroneous decisions as a result of examining  only a sample of the data.", "For example, figure 2 demonstrates that these two consultants interpreted  the \u201cprecision\u201d requirement differently. Consultant A interpreted precision  as being the threshold for the tolerable error rate, whereas Consultant B  interpreted this as requiring a margin of error within plus or minus 3  percentage points of the estimate. Because Consultant A is testing  against a threshold using the methodology specified in the OCC  handbook on sampling methodologies (based on a Poisson distribution),  it uses the upper bound of its one-sided 95 percent confidence interval to  draw inferences about whether the population error rate is less than an  established threshold value. Consultant B, in contrast, uses a two-sided  95 percent confidence interval because it is developing point estimates.  Although both consultants achieve the 95 percent reliability and 3 percent  precision guidance from regulators, the consultants\u2019 different approaches  to sampling resulted in different sample sizes and different decision rules  for when additional sampling or full review of a population would be  required, even when the same number, or even proportion, of errors are  found in the sample. For example, if 2 errors were found in Consultant A\u2019s  sample, one could conclude with 95 percent confidence that the error rate  in the population was below 6.3 percent and that the 3 percent precision  threshold had not been met. Additional sampling would be required in this  case. If 2 errors were found in Consultant B\u2019s sample, one could conclude  with 95 percent confidence that the error rate in the population is between  0.1 and 1.9 percent and no additional sampling would be required. If the  proportion of errors in Consultant B\u2019s sample was similar to Consultant  A\u2019s at approximately 2 percent, or 8 errors, one could conclude with 95  percent confidence that the error rate in the population was between 1  and 4.3 percent, a much narrower estimate than that from Consultant A.", "Neither of the samples illustrated in figure 2 was designed with the goal of  estimating the number of harmed borrowers in the population. However,  had samples of this size been drawn with the purpose of estimating the  number of harmed borrowers, the width of the two-sided 95 percent  confidence intervals around each estimate would vary. Assuming a  population size of 100,000 cases and a binomial distribution, and that  each loan with an error corresponds to one harmed borrower, samples  similar to those in figure 2 would result in different ability to concisely  estimate the number of harmed borrowers. If two errors were found in a  sample of 100 files, a 95 percent confidence interval for the estimated  number of harmed borrowers in the population would run between  approximately 240 and 7,040 borrowers. For a sample of 370 cases, a  similar proportion of errors (8 errors in a sample of 370) would result in a  95 percent confidence interval around the estimated number of harmed  borrowers between approximately 940 and 4,220, a much narrower  confidence interval. To effectively use a baseline sample from the full  population of loans to monitor whether the foreclosure reviews have  identified the majority of harmed borrowers would require setting a  realistic expected error rate to calculate sample size and establishing  guidelines for an appropriate margin of error around the estimate to  ensure that sample estimates were sufficiently precise to meet regulators\u2019  goals.", "To assess the extent of transparency in the foreclosure review process,  we reviewed press releases and documents from regulators related to the  foreclosure review. In particular, we reviewed what documents related to  the consent orders were available on the regulators\u2019 websites, such as  speeches by agency officials, engagement letters, outreach materials,  and press releases, and analyzed the content of these documents. We  compared this documentation against agency policies on public  disclosure of enforcement action information and our previous work on  transparency in government programs, such as our work on TARP to  identify any similarities and differences. Further, we reviewed reports and  summary documentation from the National Mortgage Settlement and  interviewed the monitor of the settlement to provide the context of a  current example of a large-scale settlement involving similar stakeholders  and issues similar to those of the foreclosure review. We also conducted  interviews with regulator staff, selected third-party consultants, and  consumer groups.", "To identify lessons learned that might be useful for the activities under the  amended consent orders, we compared our findings from the first two  objectives with the processes and goals regulators outlined for the  activities under the amended consent orders and identified areas with  similar challenges. We reviewed press releases on the agreements and  amended consent orders from the regulators and interviewed regulator  staff about the goals and rationale for the agreements and their plans for  designing and implementing the activities under the amended consent  orders. We also reviewed our internal control standards, our prior work  identifying key practices during agency transformations, our prior work  covering TARP and other government programs and agencies, and  documents related to the National Mortgage Settlement. In particular, we  focused on information in these reports on project design, oversight of  progress, and communication with stakeholders. Although the foreclosure  review and the activities under the amended consent orders are not  government programs, we considered the steps identified in this work as  applicable because planning, monitoring, and communication are key  principles of any effective process.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2012 through March 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Karen Tremba (Assistant  Director), Bethany M.
