Multiple federal agencies share responsibility for managing freshwater resources, but consolidated information on the federal government's financial support of these activities is not readily accessible. GAO was asked to determine for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 how much financial support federal agencies provided for freshwater programs in the United States and abroad. For the purposes of this report, freshwater programs include desalination, drinking water supply, flood control, irrigation, navigation, wastewater treatment, water conservation, water dispute management, and watershed management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the over $52 billion in total financial support provided by federal agencies for freshwater programs during fiscal years 2000 through 2004, about $49 billion was directed to domestic programs and about $3 billion supported programs abroad. Domestic program activities involved 27 federal agencies, but 3 agencies--the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Agriculture's (Agriculture) Rural Utilities Service--accounted for over 70 percent of the financial support. Eighteen agencies supported domestic drinking water supply programs and 16 supported domestic wastewater treatment and watershed management programs. Grant programs of over $22 billion and direct federal spending of about $22 billion accounted for most of the domestic financial support. In addition to the about $49 billion that directly support freshwater activities in the United States, some agencies also have programs that may indirectly support such activities, but it is difficult to determine the dollar value of this indirect support. For example, Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program supports multiple activities, including irrigation, but information on each activity supported by the program is not readily available. Also included in the domestic program is about $175 million that the United States provided to three commissions that conduct freshwater activities along U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. Of the estimated $3 billion in total financial support directed toward freshwater programs abroad between fiscal years 2000 through 2004, about $1 billion was recently provided for freshwater projects in Afghanistan and Iraq. Most of the financial support for international freshwater programs was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Foreign wastewater treatment and watershed management programs were the ones that most of the agencies supported. The vast majority of the U.S. support for international programs was provided through grants. Not included in the $3 billion for international support are the contributions that the United States made to the general budgets of numerous international organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Bank. The international organizations used some portion of the U.S. contributions to support freshwater activities around the globe."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the world\u2019s population tripled during the past century, demand for  accessible freshwater\u2014which makes up less than 1 percent of the earth\u2019s  water\u2014increased six-fold, straining freshwater resources for many  countries, including the United States. In the United States, with increasing  demand for the finite amount of freshwater available, large portions of the  country could face water shortages in the next few decades. Freshwater  supply shortages\u2014already evident in the drought-ridden West\u2014pose  serious challenges and can have significant economic, social, and  environmental consequences. Water shortages reduce farmland and forest  productivity and damage plant and animal species, wildlife habitat, and air  and water quality. In addition, water shortages can create potential  disputes between various water users, managers, and government entities.  Ensuring future water supplies to meet these various and sometimes  competing needs may require significant investments. For example, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that utilities would  need to invest over $150 billion just to repair, replace, and upgrade the  nation\u2019s drinking water infrastructure over the next two decades.", "Freshwater supply issues are not unique to the United States\u2014by 2025,  one-third of the world\u2019s population is likely to live in countries facing  freshwater shortages. The United Nations highlighted these concerns when  it declared 2003 as the International Year of Freshwater. In addition, it  estimates that, worldwide, more than 1 billion people live without access to  clean drinking water, and that over 2.4 billion people lack the basic  sanitation needed for human health. Furthermore, the Secretary-General  notes that water-related diseases are responsible for 80 percent of all  illnesses and deaths in developing countries. Finally, the World Bank  estimates that countries will need to double the $70 billion to $80 billion  they currently invest annually to provide clean drinking water and basic  sanitation for the world\u2019s population. To help address these global  challenges, the United States contributes financial support to foreign  countries and international organizations for various freshwater projects.", "Multiple federal agencies share responsibility for managing freshwater  resources. Agencies provide services through direct federal spending or  financial assistance through grant, loan, and loan guarantee programs to  other parties. Direct federal spending includes payments that agencies  make for services provided by federal employees and federal contracts for  freshwater programs in the United States and abroad. Freshwater  programs include, among other things, desalination, drinking water supply,  flood control, irrigation, navigation, wastewater treatment, water  conservation, water dispute management, and watershed management  activities. Additionally, the United States makes financial contributions to  several binational commissions that support freshwater projects along U.S.  borders and to international organizations, such as the World Bank and the  United Nations, that support freshwater projects around the world.  However, consolidated information on the federal government\u2019s financial  support of freshwater programs in the United States and abroad does not  currently exist. This information is not readily accessible because  definitions of freshwater programs and the availability of financial data  vary across agencies.", "In this context, you asked us to determine for fiscal years 2000 through  2004 how much financial support federal agencies provided for freshwater  programs in the United States and abroad.", "To address these objectives, we identified federal agencies that support  freshwater programs in the United States and abroad by reviewing  Congressional Research Service, GAO, and United Nations reports and the  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. We conducted initial interviews  with officials from the agencies we identified to confirm that the agencies  provided financial support for these programs during fiscal years 2000  through 2004 and focused our efforts on those agencies responsible for the  majority of the federal financial support. We used a questionnaire to gather  detailed information from agencies that track freshwater expenditures. In  this report, we have only included data on the financial support that  agencies provided specifically for the following freshwater programs:  desalination, drinking water supply, flood control, irrigation, navigation,  wastewater treatment, water conservation, water dispute management,  and watershed management. We did not include financial support for  programs that may indirectly provide financial support for freshwater  projects because information on these programs\u2019 freshwater activities is  not tracked separately. As a result, the financial information in this report is  an estimate of the minimum amount of funds agencies provided for  freshwater programs. In addition, although we requested program-level  financial information, we opted to present this information at the  agency-level because agencies\u2019 definitions of freshwater programs vary. We  conducted follow-up interviews with respondents to confirm the  information and to clarify the information they provided, if necessary.

For the purposes of this report, direct federal spending is a  general term used to describe, among other things, work performed by  federal employees or through contracts with private and nongovernmental  entities on the federal government\u2019s behalf. For example, direct federal  spending includes the financial support spent by federal agencies for,  among other things, the construction of reservoirs for flood control and  irrigation. Grants, loans, and loan guarantees are different types of  financial assistance programs provided by federal agencies to help  communities with projects, such as construction of water and wastewater  treatment facilities. In addition to providing financial support on the direct  costs of freshwater programs, such as capital construction and operations  and maintenance costs, agencies also provide funds for technical  assistance and research and development efforts.", "Agencies rely on several sources of funding\u2014including annual  appropriations from the general fund and from dedicated funding sources,  such as trust funds\u2014to provide financial support for these programs.  Agencies obligate these funds for multiple purposes as they implement  their programs. Obligations represent amounts for orders placed, contracts  awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period  that will require payments during the same or a future period. Obligations  differ from expenditures in that an expenditure is the issuance of a check,  disbursement of cash, or electronic transfer of funds made to liquidate an  obligation. In addition, in some circumstances expenditures fulfilling an  obligation may occur during subsequent years. Consequently, obligations  provide the best estimate of what an agency plans to spend during a fiscal  year.", "The extent to which agencies track their freshwater efforts vary. Agencies  tend to track the financial support they provide to large freshwater  programs, such as EPA\u2019s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. Some  programs, such as Agriculture\u2019s Conservation Reserve Program, serve  multiple purposes and specific program components, such as irrigation  activities, are not specifically tracked. Similarly, freshwater projects (e.g., a  dam) can serve multiple purposes, providing benefits such as water  storage, flood control, and generation of hydroelectric power. The financial  support provided for the overall project cost is generally available, but the  costs for specific components of the project are not readily available. In  addition, definitions of freshwater programs can vary depending on the  agency\u2019s role. An agency that is responsible for maintaining portions of the  nation\u2019s waterways may include lock infrastructure and waterway  operations and maintenance activities in its navigation program; however,  other agencies, which are responsible for research and development of  freshwater resources, may include stream flow and sedimentation research  within their navigation programs. Because of these differences, agencies  may not be tracking their freshwater expenditures consistently across  agencies. As such, financial information reported by the agencies on the  federal government\u2019s financial support of freshwater programs in the  United States and abroad is an estimate of the minimum amount of funds  provided for these efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Provided an Estimated $49 Billion for Domestic Freshwater Programs during Fiscal Years 2000 through 2004", "paragraphs": ["Of the 27 agencies that provided about $49 billion in federal financial  support specifically for freshwater programs in the United States during  fiscal years 2000 through 2004, 3 agencies accounted for over 70 percent of  the total.

EPA\u2014as the agency responsible for  protecting the nation\u2019s waters through enforcing clean water and safe  drinking water laws, providing support for municipal wastewater treatment  plants, and protecting watersheds and sources of drinking water\u2014provides  substantial financial support for freshwater programs. On the other hand,  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (Health) Administration of  Children and Families\u2014an agency responsible for federal programs that  seek to promote economic and social well-being\u2014administers a grant  program dedicated to helping rural, low-income communities with their  water and wastewater systems and provides a relatively small amount of  financial support. In addition, agencies, such as Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities  Service, the Department of Commerce\u2019s (Commerce) Economic  Development Administration, Health\u2019s Indian Health Service, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (Housing) Office of  Community Planning and Development, and EPA, that assist communities  with the development of drinking water supply and wastewater treatment  facilities provide far more financial support than agencies, such as  Agriculture\u2019s Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension  Service and Defense\u2019s Army Material Command and Office of Naval  Research, that primarily support research and development efforts.", "Agencies generally receive annual appropriations from the general fund to  support their domestic freshwater programs. In addition to annual  appropriations, 4 agencies\u2014Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service, the Corps,  Defense\u2019s Office of Naval Research, and the Appalachian Regional  Commission\u2014received funds from supplemental appropriations. The  Department of Transportation\u2019s (Transportation) Federal Highway  Administration and Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation  received the majority of their annual budgets from dedicated funding  sources available subject to appropriations (the Highway Trust Fund and  the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, respectively). In addition, 4 other  agencies\u2014Agriculture\u2019s Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources  Conservation Service, the Corps, and Interior\u2019s  Reclamation\u2014supplemented their annual budgets with dedicated funding  sources available subject to appropriation. The Agriculture agencies  received funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, while the Corps  and Interior\u2019s Reclamation received funding from trust funds. Finally,  certain agencies, including Interior\u2019s Reclamation and Fish and Wildlife  Service and Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service, received funds from  dedicated funding sources available without further appropriation. For  example, Interior\u2019s Reclamation received funds from the Lower Colorado  River Basin Development Fund to finance the operation and maintenance  of freshwater infrastructure in the Colorado River Basin for, among other  things, drinking water supply, flood control, and irrigation efforts.", "Domestic drinking water supply and wastewater treatment programs were  supported by 18 and 16 agencies, respectively. Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities  Service, Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration, Health\u2019s  Indian Health Service, Housing\u2019s Office of Community Planning and  Development, and EPA primarily supported activities related to the  development of drinking water supply and wastewater treatment  infrastructure, and some of the other agencies mostly provided technical  assistance and/or research and development assistance, such as water  quality and water availability research. Sixteen agencies supported a  variety of watershed management programs. While 7 agencies provided  financial support for navigation programs, the Corps and Transportation\u2019s  Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation provided the majority of  the support for, among other things, operations and maintenance of the  nation\u2019s waterways.

Thirteen agencies used grant programs, and 2  agencies each used loan and loan guarantee programs. Many agencies used  a combination of funding mechanisms to provide financial support for  freshwater programs. See table 3 for more information on funding  mechanisms used by agencies to provide financial support for freshwater  programs in the United States.", "Grant programs and direct federal spending provided over $22 billion and  about $22 billion, respectively, for domestic freshwater programs. Loan  programs provided over $4 billion, and loan guarantee programs provided  over $90 million in initial obligations. Initial obligations are the amount  agencies obligated for the subsidy cost when a loan guarantee was made.  They do not include subsequent reestimates.

See table 4 for  examples of agencies that performed work on freshwater activities in the  United States using financial support provided to them by other agencies.", "We also identified domestic programs that may provide financial support  for freshwater activities, but are not included in the $49 billion because  supporting freshwater activities is not the programs\u2019 primary purpose and  activity-level data is not readily available. For example, Housing\u2019s Office of  Community Planning and Development administers a loan guarantee  program that may provide financial support for water infrastructure  projects, but aggregate information on the use of loan guarantee authority  for particular categories of activities is not readily available.
