SBLF was authorized to make up to $30 billion in capital investments to encourage banks and community development loan funds with assets of less than $10 billion to increase their small business lending. The act generally defined \"small business lending\" as loans not more than $10 million originally. Under the act, GAO is mandated to conduct an audit of SBLF annually. GAO's first and second reports were on the program's implementation and performance reporting and made recommendations on management oversight, program evaluation, and performance reporting. This third report examines (1) the growth in qualified small business lending and reasons for variations in the growth at SBLF banks and (2) actions Treasury has taken to evaluate participant lending patterns.

However, SBLF participants varied greatly in the extent to which they had increased small business lending. GAO analysis for the quarter ending June 30, 2013, showed that the median SBLF bank in the top (first) quartile had over a 100 percent increase over the baseline, compared to a 9.1 percent increase for the median SBLF bank in the bottom (fourth) quartile. Several factors GAO analyzed could help explain this variation. For example, the median bank in the bottom quartile had more troubled loans than banks in the top quartile, which could affect a bank's lending capacity. Also, a majority of banks in the bottom lending quartile used much of their SBLF funds to repay investments received from Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, leaving them with a much smaller net increase in available capital. Several banks GAO interviewed said that they have seen increased demand for credit as the economy improved. In addition, publicly reported surveys indicate that credit conditions have improved, but some small businesses continue to face challenges securing credit.", "Treasury has taken steps to assess SBLF participants' lending patterns, including conducting a peer-group analysis and collecting performance data through an annual survey of SBLF participants. However, these steps are not sufficient to isolate the net impact of SBLF on participants' lending. Treasury officials said that they are exploring evaluation approaches and have a firm under contract to help identify statistical analyses that could be used, but have not provided documentation of its evaluation plan committing to an approach. GAO guidance on program evaluation suggests that impact evaluations are usually required to assess the net impact of a program by comparing the observed outcomes to an estimate of what would have happened in the program's absence. By conducting an evaluation that includes methods to assess the net impact of SBLF, Treasury could more effectively inform the public and Congress on how SBLF has affected the participants' lending compared to other factors, such as economic conditions, and could better assist Congress in making future decisions about similar capital investment programs or alternative programs that support small business access to capital."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Treasury should follow through in conducting an impact evaluation that includes methods to isolate the effect of SBLF from other factors on participants' small business lending.

Among other things, the law aimed to stimulate job growth by establishing  the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to encourage financial  institutions with assets of less than $10 billion to increase their lending to  small businesses with up to $50 million in annual revenues. In 2011, 935  financial institutions applied to the program for a combined funding  request of $11.7 billion. By September 2011, Treasury had approved $4  billion for 332 institutions through Treasury purchases of preferred stock  or debt instruments. Of this $4 billion, $3.9 billion went to 281 banks and  $104 million to 51 community development loan funds (CDLF). No  additional SBLF funds will be awarded to financial institutions.", "The 2010 Small Business Jobs Act mandates us to conduct an annual  audit of the SBLF program. In our first and second reports, we reviewed  the implementation of SBLF and made recommendations to improve the  program\u2019s management oversight, program evaluation, and performance  reporting. This third report examines (1) the status of SBLF; (2) identified  reasons for variation in growth of qualified small business lending at  SBLF banks; and (3) actions Treasury has taken to evaluate SBLF  participant lending patterns.", "To examine program status, including participants\u2019 lending, and dividend  and interest payments, we reviewed Treasury data as of June 30, 2013,  and Treasury\u2019s July and October 2013 Lending Growth Reports. We also  interviewed Treasury officials. To examine the process for exiting the  program and participants\u2019 reasons for exiting, we collected documents  and interviewed officials from Treasury and three bank regulatory  agencies: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). We spoke to these bank  regulators to obtain information about their role in approving SBLF  redemptions. Sixteen participants had left the program as of July 1, 2013.  Six of these participants told Treasury the reasons why they were leaving  the program. We contacted the other 10 participants that had left the  program and had not shared their reasons for leaving with Treasury, and  obtained responses from 9. To determine what is known about the  reasons for variation in growth of small business lending at SBLF banks,  we relied on Treasury\u2019s Lending Growth Report to divide 265 banks into  four quartiles based on their level of qualified small business lending as of  June 30, 2013, and compared the four quartiles to one another using  financial and regulatory data, including Call Report data and CAMELS  composite ratings. We accessed Call Report data of SBLF banks using  SNL Financial\u2014a company that manages a financial database containing  publicly filed regulatory and financial reports\u2014and analyzed data such as  asset size, Texas Ratios, and net SBLF capital received, among other  variables, as a way to assess the factors associated with different lending  levels. We also analyzed CAMELS composite ratings from FDIC to  determine if there was variation across the quartiles of SBLF banks. In  addition, we performed a regression analysis to simultaneously control for  multiple aspects of SBLF banks\u2019 financial condition, as well as to attempt  to account for state-level economic conditions. To describe the reasons  why some SBLF banks were more or less successful in increasing  lending to small businesses, we also selected and attempted to contact a  nonprobability, judgmental sample of 12 banks based on geographic  distribution and participation in Treasury\u2019s Capital Purchase Program  (CPP), and we obtained responses from 10 of them. We also interviewed  Treasury officials responsible for the program and contacted  representatives of the National Federation of Independent Business,  because it regularly surveys small businesses, and the American Bankers  Association and Independent Community Bankers Association, because  they represent the interests of community banks. We also used a number  of other survey indicators that provide a variety of perspectives on small  business credit market conditions. We assessed the reliability of the data  used for our analyses by, for example, inspecting data for missing  observations and outliers and reviewing prior GAO work and updating  information as appropriate. We determined that the data collected by  Treasury, FDIC, and SNL Financial and the survey indicators we  reviewed were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of providing a high- level overview of the program status and variations of changes in SBLF  banks\u2019 qualified small business lending. To determine actions Treasury  has taken to evaluate SBLF participant lending patterns, we reviewed  Treasury\u2019s Lending Growth Reports issued in October 2012, and January,  April, July and October 2013, and its first annual lending survey  instrument and results report, as well as relevant supporting  documentation of these reports. We interviewed Treasury officials to  understand the agency\u2019s efforts to assess program performance. We also  reviewed our 2011 and 2012 reports on SBLF to document Treasury\u2019s  past efforts in assessing SBLF performance. Furthermore, we reviewed  GAO guidance on program evaluation and past GAO work on federal  government performance management, and compared them with  Treasury actions. In addition, we reviewed impact evaluations  conducted by GAO and other federal agencies to enhance our  understanding and provide examples of impact evaluations and statistical  techniques. See appendix I for a more detailed discussion of our scope  and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 to December  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 defines qualified small business  lending\u2014as defined by and reported in an institution\u2019s quarterly regulatory  filings, also known as Call Reports\u2014as one of the following: owner-occupied nonfarm, nonresidential real-estate loans; commercial and industrial loans;  loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers;  and  loans secured by farmland.", "In addition, qualifying small business loans cannot be for an original  amount of more than $10 million, and the business may not have more  than $50 million in revenue. The act specifically prohibits Treasury from  accepting applications from institutions that are on FDIC\u2019s problem bank  list or have been removed from that list during the previous 90 days. The  initial baseline small business lending amount for the SBLF program was  the average amount of qualified small business lending that was  outstanding for the four full quarters ending on June 30, 2010, and the  dividend or interest rates paid by an institution are adjusted by comparing  future lending against this baseline. Also, the institution is required to  report any loans resulting from purchases, mergers, and acquisitions so  that its qualified small business lending baseline is adjusted accordingly.", "Fewer institutions applied to SBLF than were initially anticipated, in part  because many banks did not anticipate that demand for small business  loans would increase. The institutions that applied to and were funded by  SBLF were primarily institutions with total assets of less than $500 million.  In addition, in our 2011 report, we found that the lack of clarity by  Treasury in explaining the program\u2019s requirements created confusion  among applicants and that Treasury faced multiple delays in  implementing the SBLF program and disbursing SBLF funds by the  statutory deadline of September 27, 2011. We recommended Treasury  apply lessons learned from the application review phase of SBLF to help  improve its communications with SBLF participants and other interested  stakeholders, such as Congress and bank regulators. In 2012, in  response to our recommendation, Treasury officials said that they had  enhanced their communication strategy with SBLF participants and  stakeholders and developed written communication guidelines to provide  for consistency, continuity, and validity.", "The amount of funding an institution received under the SBLF program  depended on its asset size as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar  year 2009. Specifically, if the qualifying financial institution had total  assets of $1 billion or less, it was eligible for SBLF funding that equaled  up to 5 percent of its risk-weighted assets. If the qualifying institution had  assets of more than $1 billion but less than $10 billion, it was eligible for  funding that equaled up to 3 percent of its risk-weighted assets. In the  case of bank or thrift holding companies, assets were to be measured  based on the total combined assets of the insured depository institution  subsidiaries and risk-weighted assets were to be measured based on the  combined risk-weighted assets of the insured depository institution  subsidiaries. The SBLF program provided an option for eligible institutions  to refinance preferred stock or subordinated debt issued to Treasury  through CPP. At the time of application, the institution was required to  submit a small business lending plan to its regulator describing how the  applicant\u2019s business strategy and operating goals will allow it to address  the needs of small businesses in the area it serves.", "Participating SBLF C-corporation banks and bank holding companies pay  dividends of up to 5 percent per year initially to Treasury, with reduced  rates available if they increase their small business lending. The initial  dividend rate is based on the difference between the baseline level and  the lending reported in the second calendar quarter preceding the SBLF  closing date. Additionally, the dividend rate payable decreases quarterly  as banks increase small business lending over their baselines. While the  dividend rate was no more than 5 percent for the first 9 quarters (a little  over 2 years), a bank could reduce the rate to 1 percent by generating a  10 percent increase in its lending to small businesses compared with its  baseline. After 9 quarters, the dividend rate on the capital became fixed at  the rate the participating banks were paying at that time if they had  increased their small business lending; otherwise, the dividend rate  increased to 7 percent if participating banks had not increased their small  business lending. After 4.5 years, the dividend rate on the capital  increases to 9 percent for all banks regardless of a bank\u2019s small business  lending. For S-corporations and mutual institutions, the initial interest rate  was at most 7.7 percent. The rate fell as low as 1.5 percent for the  institutions that increased their small business lending by 10 percent or  more from the previous quarter. For CDLFs, the initial dividend rate is 2  percent for the first 8 years. After 8 years, the rate increases to 9 percent  if the CDLF has not repaid the SBLF funding. This structure is designed  to encourage CDLFs to repay the capital investment by the end of the 8- year period. Treasury allows an SBLF participant to exit the program at  any time, with the approval of its regulator, by repaying the funding  provided along with dividends owed for that period.", "Under the act, Treasury has a number of reporting requirements to  Congress related to SBLF: (1) monthly reports describing all of the  transactions made under the program during the reporting period; (2) a  semiannual report (for the periods ending each March and September)  providing all projected costs and liabilities and all operating expenses;  and (3) a quarterly report, known as the Lending Growth Report, detailing  how participants have used the funds they have received under the  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBLF-Funded Participants Continue to Lend to Small Businesses and Some Participants Have Left the Program", "paragraphs": ["SBLF participants had increased lending over baseline levels as of June  30, 2013, according to Treasury\u2019s Lending Growth Report.

Bank participants increased their qualified small  business lending by about $10.1 billion over a baseline of about $35.7  billion. CDLFs increased their qualified small business lending by about  $256.3 million over a baseline of about $796.8 million. Of the 265  participating banks, 246 (93 percent) increased their qualified small  business lending, and 45 of the 50 CDLFs (90 percent) increased their  qualified small business lending.", "SBLF participants had made about $188 million in dividend or interest  payments to Treasury as of June 30, 2013\u2014$185 million from banks and  $3 million from CDLFs.

The structure of the  SBLF program is designed to encourage banks to repay the capital  investment by the end of 4.5 years and CDLFs to repay at the end of 8  years. However, Treasury allows an SBLF participant to exit the program  at any time. SBLF securities may be redeemed at any time subject to the  submission of a formal request to Treasury. Treasury reviews the notice  to determine whether it meets a number of conditions. The redemption  amount must equal at least 25 percent of the original funding balance.  The redemption date must be no more than 60 days and no fewer than 30  days from the date the notice is sent to Treasury. Payment of accrued  dividends or interest for the current dividend period must be made in  addition to the principal balance.", "Because exiting the SBLF program would affect a participant\u2019s capital,  banks that want to leave the program also need approval from their  appropriate federal banking regulator. If the SBLF participant is a bank or  thrift, upon receipt of a redemption notice, Treasury notifies the  appropriate federal banking regulator to determine if it has any objection.  The federal banking regulator then reviews the redemption request to  analyze the impact of the redemption of SBLF securities on capital levels.  The analysis bank regulators perform for SBLF redemptions is similar to  the analysis they would undertake for other banks and thrifts engaging in  activities that would reduce their capital. In general, federal banking  regulators assess whether banks will have sufficient capital after  redeeming their SBLF securities and whether the banks have the financial  ability or capital strength to exit the SBLF program. The decision is based  in part on the bank\u2019s condition and the bank\u2019s capital planning process,  including performance and leverage ratios, classified assets,  nonperforming loans, allowance for loan and lease losses, outstanding  enforcement actions, and other factors. If the federal banking regulator  does not object to the redemption, Treasury proceeds with the  redemption after verifying that they meet requirements for redemption.", "SBLF participants exited the program for a variety of reasons. Some  participants shared with Treasury the reasons for leaving the program,  though they are not required to do so. Four participants told Treasury that  they wanted to redeem their SBLF securities prior to an acquisition by  another bank. Another participant told Treasury it was redeeming SBLF  securities due to a difficult economic environment and the potential  impact of revised regulatory capital guidelines. Another participant said it  wanted to eliminate ongoing dividend expenses and compliance costs  associated with the SBLF program requirements. For those participants  that did not provide a reason to Treasury, we contacted 10 former  participants that fully repaid their SBLF funds to ask them their reasons  for leaving the program. We received responses from nine participants  and some gave multiple reasons for leaving. For example, eight  participants told us that they exited the program to avoid dividend  expenses and said that they could obtain less expensive funding  elsewhere. Two participants told us that reporting and compliance were  burdensome, and officials from two banks said that demand for small  business loans was not as strong as they had expected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Help Explain Variation in Small Business Lending Growth", "paragraphs": ["Factors that help to explain the variation in qualified small business  lending across SBLF banks include the condition of banks\u2019 loan portfolios,  amount of net capital received from SBLF, and demand for credit, among  others. In addition, our analysis of survey data indicates that credit is still  difficult to obtain, although it has eased some compared with 2009.  Further, while some banks confirmed to us that demand for credit has  improved, some also said they face several challenges in increasing their  qualified small business loan portfolios."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Certain Financial Conditions Affected Growth in Small Business Lending", "paragraphs": ["To determine reasons for variation in small business lending among  SBLF banks, we divided banks into four quartiles based on their level of  qualified small business lending. We then analyzed financial conditions  for each quartile to determine if differences in qualified small business  lending could be explained in part by differences in financial conditions  across the four quartiles. We also performed a regression analysis to  simultaneously control for multiple aspects of banks\u2019 financial condition,  as well as to attempt to account for state-level economic conditions. As  shown in figure 2, SBLF banks in the first quartile increased qualified  small business lending 114.1 percent over their baseline, compared to  47.6 percent for banks in the second quartile, 25 percent for banks in the  third quartile, and 9.1 percent for banks in the fourth quartile, as of June  30, 2013.", "Our analysis of the financial condition of SBLF banks found that banks in  the quartiles with lower levels of qualified small business lending had  more troubled loans compared to those in the quartiles with higher  lending levels, which may have negatively affected their ability to lend. As  illustrated in figure 3, as of June 30, 2013, the median Texas Ratios  increased across the four quartiles, with the first quartile having the  lowest median Texas Ratio. The Texas Ratio can indicate a bank\u2019s  likelihood of failure by comparing its troubled loans to its capital. The  higher the ratio, the more likely the institution is to fail because more of its  capital could be eroded by realized losses on these troubled loans. We  also found the Texas Ratio was higher for all banks prior to SBLF funding,  which is to be expected because capital received under SBLF would tend  to decrease the bank\u2019s Texas Ratio.", "In addition, we also reviewed CAMELS composite ratings for each  quartile as another factor that may have contributed to variation in lending  but found minimal differences across the quartiles. Institutions were  generally satisfactorily rated when approved for the program in 2011  because institutions with a CAMELS rating of either \u201c4\u201d or \u201c5\u201d were not  allowed to participate in the program. On average, banks across the four  quartiles as of March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2013, had similar median  and average CAMELS ratings, ranging from 1.81 to 2.0. See appendix I  for other indicators of financial health we analyzed, including measures of  equity, asset liquidity, reliance on wholesale funding, and troubled loans.", "Another factor associated with a bank\u2019s ability to increase qualified small  business lending in the program is the amount of net SBLF capital  received. Our analysis revealed that banks in the third and fourth quartiles  had the lowest amount of net SBLF capital received. This trend can be at  least partly explained by the fact that 67 percent of banks in the third  quartile and 60 percent of banks in the fourth quartile were CPP  participants and may have received only enough SBLF capital to repay  CPP funds (see fig. 4). We identified several cases where banks in the  third and fourth quartiles that converted through CPP either did not  receive enough SBLF capital to repay CPP or received just enough  funding to break even. Hence, these banks did not receive any net  SBLF capital to support increased qualified small business lending.", "For all banks, we found a significant difference among the quartiles in net  capital received as a percentage of assets, as of March 31, 2011 (see fig.  5). Specifically, for the median bank in the first quartile, SBLF net capital  represented 2.9 percent of total assets compared to 2.2 percent for the  median bank in the second quartile, 1.3 percent for the median bank in  the third quartile, and 0.87 percent for the median bank in the fourth  quartile. These differences may help explain the lower lending of banks in  the fourth quartile, which our analysis found to have the highest median  asset size. These banks had less net capital to support increased  qualified small business lending because they were more likely to have  converted through CPP. Although SBLF banks may not have received a  large amount of additional capital to increase lending, the capital these  institutions received through CPP was also intended to increase lending.", "Our regression analysis indicates that lower growth in qualified small  business lending was associated with more troubled loans, greater  leverage, less net capital received from SBLF, and lower reported  demand for small business loans. After controlling for net capital  received, CPP status was no longer a statistically significant determinant  of qualified small business lending growth. This result suggests that the  lower lending at CPP institutions was driven in part by lower net capital  rather than some other factor associated with prior CPP status that we did  not observe. Our measure of state-level economic conditions\u2014Gross  Domestic Product growth\u2014did not provide additional insight into any local  economic conditions that might be driving differences in qualified small  business lending. However, a participant-reported measure of demand for  small business loans that was included in Treasury\u2019s survey of SBLF  participants was a significant predictor of growth. The magnitude of  these various factors is summarized as follows:", "For every 14 percentage point increase in troubled loans (roughly one  standard deviation) relative to capital and reserves, qualified small  business lending growth decreased by 13 percentage points.", "For every 2 percentage points (roughly one standard deviation) more  capital relative to assets (less leverage) prior to receiving SBLF  capital, participants increased qualified small business lending by an  additional 13 percentage points.", "A participant that received net SBLF capital of 1.9 percent (the mean)  of assets relative to a participant that received no net capital (a  potential outcome for participants that converted through CPP)  increased qualified small business lending by an additional 18  percentage points.", "Participants that reported stronger demand for small business loans  relative to those that reported weaker demand for small business  loans increased qualified small business lending by an additional 24  percentage points."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Conditions and Other Factors Continue to Affect Banks\u2019 Ability to Lend", "paragraphs": ["The SBLF program was designed to improve small businesses\u2019 access to  credit, which had become difficult to obtain after the onset of the 2007- 2009 recession. Based on our review of survey data and interviews with  officials from 10 SBLF banks, factors that continue to affect small  business lending include credit conditions and demand for small business  loans, among others. Our analysis indicates that credit is still difficult to  obtain, confirming that the lending environment remains challenging,  although it has eased some compared with 2009. For example, according  to the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index, as of the third quarter of  2013, 25 percent of businesses reported difficulty obtaining credit when  they needed it compared to 33 percent in the third quarter of 2009.  Similarly, the Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices in July 2013 showed some large domestic banks  having eased their credit standards. Specifically, 90 percent of  respondents reported that credit standards to small firms remained  basically unchanged, and 10 percent reported that credit standards to  small firms had eased somewhat. Some banks surveyed cited more  aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as an  important reason for easing standards or terms on loans. The conditions  reported in the July 2013 survey improved from those reported in July  2009, when banks indicated they had continued to tighten standards on  all major loan types. Finally, the percentage of businesses whose  borrowing needs were not satisfied improved from 10 percent in June  2009 to 5 percent in June 2013, while the percentage of businesses  whose borrowing needs were satisfied was largely unchanged from June  2009 to June 2013 according to the Small Business Economic Trends  survey from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).", "Banks generally report stronger demand for credit from small businesses  compared to 2009 conditions, which could help explain why SBLF banks  could increase their lending, but weaknesses exist. For example, as of  July 2013, 61.4 percent of respondents of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion  Survey reported that demand for commercial and industrial loans for  small firms remained unchanged, and 30 percent reported moderately  stronger demand for these loans. Conversely, as of July 2009, 34 percent  of respondents reported that demand for commercial and industrial loans  for small firms remained unchanged, and 52.8 percent reported  moderately weaker demand (5.7 percent reported moderately stronger  demand). Based on our analysis of SBLF banks and the results of  Treasury\u2019s SBLF annual survey, banks with lower levels of qualified small  business lending were more likely to report weaker demand (see fig. 6).  Overall, 46 percent of respondents to Treasury\u2019s survey reported stronger  demand for credit compared to 14 percent reporting weaker demand.  Respondents also reported a net increase in the number of inquiries from  small business borrowers regarding the availability and terms of lending.  A recent Federal Reserve study noted many of the same factors have  affected small businesses\u2019 access to credit since the onset of the 2007- 2009 recession. Specifically, the study reflected that banks noted small  business owners are not expanding as a result of weak sales and  earnings, among other factors. However, banks also viewed small  businesses as less creditworthy because small businesses do not have  the necessary collateral or cash flows at the same time that banks have  increased their credit standards.", "We spoke with officials from 10 SBLF banks representing a range of  success in increasing qualified small business lending, and they cited  several reasons that they have had some success in increasing small  business lending, as well as some challenges. Officials from five banks  we interviewed across the quartiles attributed their lending growth to their  ability to expand into new markets and hire additional loan officers. In  addition, two banks cited strong loan growth in the agricultural, energy,  and commercial and industrial sectors. Further, officials from some banks  reported their customers are generally in better condition than they were  a few years ago, but are uncomfortable taking on additional debt given  the continued uncertainty around economic conditions and interest and  tax rates. Officials from other banks cited difficulties based on their  inability to compete with interest rates from larger banks and their local  counterparts. Specifically, officials from four banks told us that while there  are more creditworthy borrowers, there are more banks competing for  these same borrowers. We also heard from officials at one bank that  some small businesses in the area are less creditworthy than they used  to be as a result of highly leveraged owner-occupied commercial real  estate. Officials from the banks we interviewed that participated in CPP  told us that they did so to obtain better dividend rates on the equity they  received through SBLF.

However,  they explored additional analyses using the peer-group comparison to  review loan activity at the local level using census data but found this finer  segmentation of loan data not available.", "In addition, Treasury has collected additional performance information  through an annual lending survey of SBLF participants. In 2012, Treasury  initiated an annual survey of SBLF program participants and analyzed the  survey results to obtain additional quantitative and qualitative data on how  the program is performing. Treasury required that all active SBLF  participants respond to the survey as part of the agreement to participate  in the program. Treasury officials explained that while they collect  information on the dollar amount of qualified small business loans at the  end of each quarter, they intended to use the annual survey to  supplement the quarterly data\u2014such as by gathering additional  information on the volume of the loans originated over time\u2014and to  provide additional information on how the participants are using SBLF  funds. The survey covered several topics for the period from July 1, 2011,  to June 30, 2012:  changes in participants\u2019 small business lending standards and  demand; obstacles to increasing small business lending; actual increases in small business lending by industry sector, number, actions associated with use of SBLF funds, including projected total  increase in small business lending over 2 years; and  small business outreach activities required by the Small Business  Jobs Act of 2010.", "After receiving the survey responses from SBLF participants, Treasury  analyzed the results of the SBLF annual survey and reported the  aggregate results in June 2013. The survey results report (1) provides  Treasury\u2019s analysis of the aggregate survey results; (2) includes the  results of each survey question; (3) discusses the methods Treasury  followed to validate and review individual responses to each survey  question for completeness and reasonableness; and (4) discusses the  general methods Treasury used to review the aggregate survey results  for reasonableness, including describing examples of the specific  analyses for 9 of the 14 survey questions. For example, the report says  that Treasury compared aggregate responses to six questions to similar  questions related to credit standards and loan demand for commercial  and industrial loans that are included in the Federal Reserve July 2012  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey and concluded that the SBLF  aggregate results were reasonable. Treasury officials said they did not  perform this type of analysis for some of the survey questions that were  unique to SBLF, such as the question on participants\u2019 use of SBLF  funding and questions related to outreach activities, because there was  no appropriate data source to compare these aggregate responses.", "Treasury officials explained that they have identified areas for  improvement based on feedback obtained on the 2012 survey and made  adjustments to the design and administration of the 2013 survey. Based  on some questions from participants during the 2012 survey, Treasury  provided additional guidance in responding to certain survey questions. In  response to the questions and feedback, Treasury has refined some  questions and is considering deleting and adding some questions to the  2013 survey. Treasury officials said they expect to continue to make  adjustments to the survey in future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Is Exploring Evaluation Methods but Has Not Yet Provided a Plan to Evaluate and Isolate the Program\u2019s Impact", "paragraphs": ["Although Treasury has taken actions to improve its reporting and analysis  of SBLF program performance, Treasury officials told us they recently  started to review additional methods for evaluating the effectiveness of  the program and its impact on participants\u2019 small business lending, but  have not yet provided us with a plan to evaluate the program\u2019s impact or  selected an approach for conducting the evaluation. Treasury\u2019s peer- group analysis in the Lending Growth Reports and the annual survey of  program participants are valuable steps that contribute to an assessment  of SBLF program performance. However, these actions are not sufficient  to isolate the impact of SBLF on participants\u2019 lending compared to other  factors\u2014a component of performance measurement that we specifically  highlighted in our 2011 and 2012 reports\u2014which an impact evaluation  could help to achieve. While we did not specifically recommend that  Treasury conduct an impact evaluation in 2011, our recommendation that  Treasury finalize plans for assessing SBLF performance noted that such  plans should include measures that isolate the impact of the program.  During our review, Treasury officials told us that they have started  considering options to conduct a one-time evaluation of SBLF. For  example, in October 2013, Treasury officials told us that since August  2013 they have been working with an existing contractor with expertise in  statistical evaluation techniques to help plan and conduct the analysis,  and that the contractor has begun to test out various techniques using  available data. Treasury officials further explained that the evaluation will  use data from September 30, 2013, when the dividend rate for most  SBLF participants will become fixed, and the data will be available in  November 2013. Treasury officials stated that they intend to complete  the analysis and publish the results in fiscal year 2014, but they had not  yet provided us with a written plan for the evaluation committing to an  approach.", "According to GAO guidance on program evaluation, when a program is  influenced by outside factors, as is the SBLF program, impact evaluations  are usually required to assess the net effect of a program (or its actual  effectiveness) by comparing the observed outcomes to an estimate of  what would have happened in the program\u2019s absence. The guidance  further suggests that the design of an impact evaluation often includes  using comparison groups and statistical tools and identifying the most  important external influences on the desired program outcomes. GAO  and other federal agencies have conducted impact evaluations that have  employed techniques, such as statistical tools, to isolate the impact of  programs, and these could be useful examples for Treasury in designing  its impact evaluation of SBLF. All four evaluations included comparison  groups in their evaluation design, while three of the four evaluations used  a statistical tool known as propensity score matching\u2014just one potential  approach\u2014in addition to other methods to consider in designing an  impact evaluation of a program. GAO has acknowledged that  conducting program evaluations could be costly and time consuming\u2014 particularly collecting and ensuring the quality of data\u2014and GAO  guidance states that evaluators should aim to select the least  burdensome way to obtain the information necessary to address the  evaluation question. Treasury already has existing performance  information and has already demonstrated that it could readily obtain  financial data on SBLF participants and their peers that have been  regularly collected by third parties as it does for its peer analysis in the  Lending Growth Report. An impact evaluation would help Treasury more  effectively inform the public and Congress about how SBLF has affected  the participants\u2019 lending compared to other factors, such as economic  conditions.

Our guidance on program evaluation notes that  impact evaluations are usually required to assess the net impact of a  program by comparing the program outcomes to an estimate of what  would have happened in the program\u2019s absence, often using statistical  tools. Treasury officials have told us that they are exploring various  approaches to evaluating the program and have a firm under contract that  is helping to identify different statistical analyses that could be used.  These actions are important initial steps in conducting an impact  evaluation. Nevertheless, Treasury has not yet developed a written  evaluation plan committed to a specific approach that would show that  their evaluation assesses the net impact of SBLF apart from other factors.  Given that capital investment programs had been used to address an  immediate need during the recent financial crisis and policymakers may  face similar changing economic conditions in the future and need to make  quick decisions, it is important that Congress and other stakeholders have  information about the performance of SBLF and the extent to which it had  a meaningful impact on small business lending.

We did  not assess banks\u2019 individual financial condition; rather, we looked at the  medians of certain indicators to make comparisons between the four  quartiles. We analyzed the financial condition of the SBLF banks in each  of the four quartiles as of March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2013, to  determine if any differences were associated with the initial financial  condition of SBLF banks or changes in their financial condition that  occurred during the program. To analyze the financial condition of the  four quartiles, we accessed Call Report data using SNL Financial\u2014a  company that manages a financial database that contains publicly filed  regulatory and financial reports.

All models were estimated via linear least squares with White  heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. We used two alternative  measures of initial equity: the leverage ratio and the tier 1 risk-based  capital ratio. We found that the leverage ratio was a somewhat stronger  predictor (p-value =0.0009 vs. p-value = 0.0498) of growth in qualified  small business lending, so we used that measure of equity in subsequent  models. All other measures of financial conditions were statistically  significant predictors of qualified small business lending growth with the  exception of return on assets (a measure of profitability), which we  excluded from subsequent models.", "Next we added CPP conversion status to our model with financial  conditions. CPP conversion status was a statistically significant predictor  of qualified small business lending growth; however, once we add net  capital to the model, CPP status was no longer statistically significant,  while net capital was statistically significant (p-value =0.02). Because  CPP conversion status and net capital are strongly negatively correlated,  we excluded CPP status from subsequent models to avoid  multicollinearity and associated variance inflation. After excluding CPP  status from the model, the statistical significance of the net capital  coefficient increased dramatically (p-value < 0.0001). These results  suggest that net capital is driving differences between SBLF banks that  paid off CPP capital with SBLF capital and other SBLF banks that did not,  rather than an unobserved factor associated with CPP status.", "To attempt to capture local economic conditions, we added state Gross  Domestic Product (GDP) growth to the model with financial conditions  and net capital.

However, when we added a self-reported measure of demand for small  business loans from Treasury\u2019s survey of SBLF participants to the model  as an alternative, we found that this measure was a statistically significant  predictor. These results suggest that state-level economic growth is not a  precise measure of demand for loans at SBLF banks. We present the  regression results of this final model in table 2 below. Because demand  was self-reported, this variable could not be independently corroborated.  Participants with low growth in qualified small business lending may have  had an incentive to report low demand to avoid the perception that they  had underperformed.
