In May 2009, the President proposed spending $63 billion through 2014 on global health programs, including HIV/AIDS, under a new Global Health Initiative. The Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), at the Department of State (State), coordinates PEPFAR implementation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), among other agencies, implement PEPFAR as well as other global health-related assistance programs, such as maternal and child health, infectious disease prevention, and malaria control, among others. Responding to legislative directives, this report examines U.S. disbursements (referred to as spending) for global HIV/AIDS- and other health-related bilateral foreign assistance programs (including basic health and population and reproductive health programs) in fiscal years 2001-2008.

From 2001 to 2003--before the establishment of PEPFAR--U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS programs rose while spending on other health programs dropped slightly. From fiscal years 2004 to 2008, HIV/AIDS spending grew steadily; other health-related spending also rose overall, despite declines in 2006 and 2007. As would be expected, U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS spending showed the most increase in 15 countries--known as PEPFAR focus countries--relative to other countries receiving bilateral HIV/AIDS assistance from fiscal years 2004 through 2008. In addition, GAO's analysis showed that U.S. spending on other health-related bilateral foreign assistance also increased most for PEPFAR focus countries. Spending growth rates varied among three key regions--sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean--as did these regions' shares of HIV/AIDS and other health foreign assistance spending following establishment of PEPFAR. OGAC, USAID, and UNAIDS have adopted three different models to estimate and project antiretroviral therapy (ART) costs. The three models--respectively known as the PEPFAR ART Costing Project Model, the HIV/AIDS Program Sustainability Analysis Tool, and Spectrum--are intended to inform policy and program decisions related, in part, to expanding efforts to provide ART in developing countries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, approximately 2 million people worldwide died of HIV-related  causes, and an estimated 2.7 million people were newly infected with HIV.

Specifically, we examine disbursement levels and growth trends from  2001 to 2008 for bilateral HIV/AIDS and other health-related foreign  assistance programs by time period (pre-PEPFAR and first 5 years of  PEPFAR for all countries); countries grouped approximately by level of  PEPFAR focus and funding; and region (sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America  and the Caribbean, and Asia). We determined the FADB disbursement data  to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting them in this  manner. For this report, we defined U.S. spending for global HIV/AIDS  programs as foreign assistance for HIV/AIDS control, testing, prevention,  treatment, and care; we defined U.S. spending for other global health  programs as foreign assistance to support general and basic health and  population and reproductive health policies and programs (except those  related to HIV/AIDS). (See app. I for more information on these  categories.) We converted the spending amounts provided to 2010  constant dollars to account for inflation and allow the comparison of  levels of assistance in different time periods.

In addition, we interviewed State  Department, USAID, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) officials and representatives of research organizations. To describe  three key models used to estimate costs related to providing ART in  developing countries, we reviewed the models and examined reports on  the models.

We used USAID\u2019s deflator to convert nominal dollar amounts to  constant 2010 dollar amounts, which are appropriate for spending trend  analysis. As such, it is important to remember that the disbursement  figures for HIV/AIDS- and other health-related foreign assistance programs  presented in this report differ from appropriation or commitment data  which may be reported elsewhere. Because we focused on bilateral  disbursements, our analysis excludes U.S. contributions to the Global  Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. In addition, about $4.7  billion and $3.3 billion in disbursements for HIV/AIDS programs and other  health-related foreign assistance programs, respectively, from 2001 to  2008, were not specified for an individual country or region in the FADB.  As such, our analysis of bilateral spending levels and growth trends by  PEPFAR country status and geographical region excludes these  disbursements.", "We assessed the reliability of disbursement data from the FADB and  determined them to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting in  this manner. In assessing the data, we interviewed USAID officials in  charge of compiling and maintaining the FADB, reviewed the related  documentation, and compared data to published data from other sources.  We also determined that, in general, USAID takes steps to ensure the  consistency and accuracy of the disbursements data reported by U.S.  government agencies, including by verifying possible inconsistencies or  anomalies in the data received, providing guidance and other  communications to agencies about category definitions, and comparing  the data to other data sources. Although we did not assess the reliability of  the data for complex statistical analyses, we determined that the data did  not allow the identification of causal relationships between funding levels  over time or among relevant categories; as such, we did not attempt an  empirical analysis of the impact of PEPFAR on other health funding.", "To describe models used to estimate the cost of providing antiretroviral  therapy (ART), we interviewed State Office of the Global AIDS  Coordinator, USAID and CDC officials in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.  We also interviewed Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS) officials in Washington, D.C. and Geneva, Switzerland, as well  as developers of the costing models. We analyzed user manuals and guides  for these models, as well as spreadsheets and additional information and  technical comments provided by the U.S. agencies and model developers.  We reviewed relevant literature for information on ART costing models, as  well as the Leadership Act and previous GAO work regarding  requirements and importance of cost information for program decision  making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: U.S. Spending on Global HIV/AIDS and Other Health-Related Programs", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal years 2001 to 2008, U.S. bilateral foreign assistance spending for  HIV/AIDS-related health programs varied significantly by country for both  the 15 PEPFAR focus countries and the 16 countries and three regions  with PEPFAR operational plans.", "Table 6 presents U.S. bilateral foreign assistance spending in constant  dollars, by country, on HIV/AIDS programs, for fiscal years 2001-2008.
