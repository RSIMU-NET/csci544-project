For DHS to effectively leverage these systems as mission enablers and transformation tools, it needs to employ a number of institutional acquisition and IT management controls and capabilities, such as using an operational and technological blueprint to guide and constrain system investments (enterprise architecture) and following institutional policies, practices, and structures for acquiring and investing in these systems. Other institutional controls and capabilities include employing rigorous and disciplined system life cycle management processes and having capable acquisition and IT management workforces. As GAO has reported, it is critical for the department to implement these controls and capabilities on each of its system acquisition programs. GAO has issued a series of reports on DHS institutional controls for acquiring and managing IT systems, and its implementation of these controls on large-scale systems. GAO was asked to testify on how far the department has come on both of these fronts, including its implementation of GAO's recommendations. To do this, GAO drew from its issued reports on institutional IT controls and IT systems, as well as our recurring work to follow up on the status of our open recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception, DHS has made uneven progress in its efforts to institutionalize a framework of interrelated management controls and capabilities associated with effectively and efficiently acquiring large-scale IT systems. To its credit, it has continued to issue annual updates to its enterprise architecture that have added previously missing scope and depth, and further improvements are planned to incorporate the level of content, referred to as segment architectures, needed to effectively introduce new systems and modify existing ones. Also, it has redefined its acquisition and investment management policies, practices, and structures, including establishing a system life cycle management methodology, and it has increased its acquisition workforce. Nevertheless, challenges remain relative to, for example, implementing the department's plan for strengthening its IT human capital, and fully defining key system investment and acquisition management policies and procedures. Moreover, the extent to which DHS has actually implemented these investment and acquisition management policies and practices on major programs has been at best inconsistent, and in many cases, quite limited. For example, recent reviews by GAO show that major acquisition programs have not been subjected to executive level acquisition and investment management reviews at key milestones and have not, among other things, employed reliable cost and schedule estimating practices, effective requirements development and test management practices, meaningful performance measurement, strategic workforce management, proactive identification and mitigation of program risks, and effective contract tracking and oversight, among other things. Because of these weaknesses, major IT programs aimed at delivering important mission capabilities have not lived up to expectations. For example, full deployment of the Rescue 21 \"search and rescue\" system had to be extended from 2006 to 2017; development and deployment of an \"exit\" capability under the US-VISIT program has yet to occur; and the timing and scope of an SBInet \"virtual border fence\" initial operating capability has been delayed and reduced from the entire southwest border to 28 miles of the border. To assist the department in addressing its institutional and system-specific challenges, GAO has made a range of recommendations. While DHS and its components have acted on many of these recommendations, and as a result have arguably made progress and improved the prospects for success on ongoing and future programs, more needs to be done by DHS's new leadership team before the department can ensure that all system acquisitions are managed with the rigor and discipline needed to consistently deliver promised capabilities and benefits on time and on budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) efforts to manage its sizeable  investment in large-scale information technology (IT) programs, such as  the Secure Border Initiative Network (SBInet) and the U.S. Visitor and  Immigrant Status Indicator Technology Program (US-VISIT).

Specifically, we  reported in November 2003 that DHS\u2019s initial version of its EA was not  sufficiently mature to guide and constrain investments. For example, while  the department had established the management foundation for  developing, maintaining, and implementing its EA and had issued an initial  version of its target architecture, it had yet to develop products that fully  described its current and target architectural environments, as well as a  plan for transitioning from the current to the target environment.", "In August 2004, we reported that the initial version of the department\u2019s  architecture provided a useful foundation on which to build a more  complete architecture, but that it was still missing important content that  limited its utility. For example, the content of this version was not  systematically derived from a DHS or national corporate business strategy;  rather it was an amalgamation of the existing architectures of the DHS  predecessor agencies, along with their portfolios of systems investment  projects. To assist DHS in evolving its architecture, we made 41  recommendations aimed at adding needed content.", "In May 2007, we reported on the third version of DHS\u2019s EA, concluding  that while this version partially addressed each of our prior  recommendations, it did not fully address them, and thus important  content was still missing. Further, we reported that DHS organizational  components were not adequately involved in its development.  Accordingly, we made additional recommendations.", "To the department\u2019s credit, recent versions of its EA largely address our  prior recommendations aimed at adding needed architectural depth and  breadth. For example, in response to our prior recommendation that the  architecture include a technical reference model (TRM) that describes,  among other things, the technical standards to be implemented for each  enterprise service, the 2008 version of the EA included a TRM that  identified such standards. It also adopted an approach for extending the  architecture through segments, which is a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach  to architecture development advocated by OMB. To implement this  approach, OMB guidance states that agencies should define and prioritize  enterprise segments, focusing first on those segments that will help it  perform its mission most effectively, and that they should first focus on  developing architectures for high priority segments. However, while the  2008 EA identified 22 segments, it did not prioritize the segments.", "DHS recently issued the latest version of its EA, and this version continues  to improve on the prior version.

It also updates the transition strategy for  migrating to the target architecture by including planned 2010 investments.  However, this version still does not contain prioritized segments and does  not include OMB required architecture information for each segment (e.g.,  information exchanges between the critical business processes,  conceptual solution architecture for each segment). Instead, the EA states  that future versions will include revised segmented architectures within  the context of its newly developed functional areas. As we have previously  reported, segment architectures serve as a bridge between the corporate  frame of reference captured in the EA and each individual system  investment.

Specifically,  in August 2004, we reported that DHS had established an investment  management process that provided for departmental oversight of major IT  programs at key milestones, but that most programs (about 75 percent)  had not undergone defined milestone reviews in a timely manner. At that  time, DHS attributed this to the newness of the process. Based on our  findings, we made recommendations aimed at strengthening the process.", "In March 2005, we again reported on the department\u2019s acquisition and  investment review process, noting that while it incorporated some best  practices and provided for senior management having information  required to make well-informed investment decisions at key points in the  acquisition life cycle, the process did not require senior management  attention and oversight at all key decision points. For example,  management reviews were not required prior to investment in a prototype  or prior to passing a key acquisition milestone. Accordingly, we made  further recommendations to improve the process.", "In April 2007, we assessed DHS\u2019s investment management structures,  policies, and procedures against our ITIM framework, and concluded that  while DHS had established investment decisionmaking bodies (e.g.,  investment review board) to oversee its IT investments, it had yet to fully  define 8 of 11 key policies and procedures associated with selecting  investments and controlling their acquisition. For example, procedures for  selecting among competing investment options did not cite either the  specific criteria or the steps for prioritizing and selecting investments at  either the individual program level or the portfolio of programs level. In  addition, the department had yet to document a methodology, with  explicit criteria, for determining a given investment\u2019s alignment to the EA.  Instead, it relied on the undocumented and subjective determinations of  individuals. We also reported that DHS had not fully implemented the key  practices needed to control programs and portfolios of programs. For  example, DHS investment review boards were not conducting regular  investment reviews, and while program-specific control activities were  sometimes performed, they were not performed consistently and  thoroughly across investments.. Accordingly, we made recommendations  aimed at establishing and implementing mature investment management  processes.", "In November 2008, we again reported that DHS was not effectively  implementing its acquisition and investment review process. Specifically,  while DHS\u2019s review process called for its decision-making bodies to  review investments at key points in their life cycles\u2014including program  authorization\u201445 of the 48 major investments that we examined were not  reviewed in accordance with this process. In addition, DHS was unable to  enforce decisions made by these investment bodies because it did not  track whether its component organizations took actions called for in the  decisions. Further, many of these major investments lacked basic  acquisition documents necessary to inform the investment review process,  such as program baselines; and two of nine components\u2014which managed  a total of 8 major investments\u2014did not have required component-level  investment management processes in place. Moreover, almost a third of  the 48 major investments received funding without having validated  mission needs and requirements, and two-thirds did not have life cycle  cost estimates. Finally, DHS had not conducted regular reviews of its  investment portfolios to ensure effective performance and minimize  unintended duplication of effort. We concluded that without validated  requirements, life cycle cost estimates, and regular portfolio reviews, DHS  could not ensure that its investment decisions were appropriate and would  ultimately address capability gaps. To address these weaknesses, we made  a number of recommendations.", "To strengthen its institutional approach to acquisition and IT investment  management, DHS established the Acquisition Program Management  Division (APMD) within the Office of the CPO, and assigned it  responsibility for developing and maintaining the department\u2019s acquisition  policy and providing support and assistance to the department\u2019s  acquisition workforce. To that end, DHS issued a new departmental  directive and related guidance in November 2008, which together  provide the framework for departmental management, support, review,  and approval of programs, including IT acquisitions.", "The directive established a revised acquisition review process, including  roles and responsibilities of DHS approving authorities, threshold levels  for acquisitions, and acquisition decision events and the corresponding  documentation required. Specifically, it established the Acquisition Review  Board as the department\u2019s highest review body and charged it with  reviewing and approving all programs at key milestone decision points  that are above $300 million in life cycle costs. It also described working  groups and other boards, such as the Enterprise Architecture Board, and  Program Review Board, to provide subject matter expertise to the  Acquisition Review Board and DHS executives, and to review and approve  investments that meet lower dollar thresholds. Recently established,  according to a DHS official, was the DHS Asset Board (to provide lead  technical authority on acquisition of real property and acquisition of  vehicles). Finally, it is establishing the Joint Requirements Council (to  validate the results of the strategic requirements planning process).", "DHS has also reinstated regular acquisition review board meetings and  acquisition decision memorandums. Specifically, DHS\u2019s acquisition review  board reports that it completed 14 acquisition reviews in 2008, and has  thus far completed 18 reviews in 2009, including reviews of SBInet, US- VISIT, and Secure Flight. DHS also reports that 7 additional reviews are  scheduled to occur by the end of the fiscal year. In addition, DHS  components have designated Component Acquisition Executives (CAEs)  to serve as the senior acquisition officials within the components and to be  responsible for implementation of management and oversight of all  component acquisition processes. DHS has also begun to make use of a  new system to track program cost, schedule, and performance  information, as well as action items that result from acquisition oversight  board decisions. To support acquisition oversight, the CPO has identified a  need for 58 additional positions. As an initial step, DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010  budget request included 10 additional full time equivalent positions for  acquisition oversight support.", "Notwithstanding these actions, the department\u2019s acquisition and  investment management processes still do not meet some of the program-  and portfolio-level management practices in our ITIM framework, which  are based on the investment management requirements in the Clinger- Cohen Act. With respect to program-level practices, DHS has not defined  specific criteria for selecting and prioritizing new programs or for  reselecting and reprioritizing existing ones. Without such criteria, it is  unlikely that investment selection and prioritization decisions will be  made consistently and will best support mission needs. Without proper  management controls in place, it is unlikely that investment oversight  decisions will be made consistently and will best support mission needs.", "In addition, DHS has yet to adequately address how it determines and  ensures that an investment is aligned with its EA. Specifically, while it has  recently chartered its Enterprise Architecture Board and assigned it  responsibility for ensuring that each investment is architecturally aligned  throughout its life cycle, and while its new acquisition guidance specifies  the architecture products that investments are to be aligned with (e.g., the  business functions within the EA business model, the data objects in the  conceptual data model, and the technical standards in the reference  model), it has yet to define a methodology, including explicit criteria, for  making a risk-based alignment determination. Also, the new directive and  other DHS guidance do not provide for development of action plans for  addressing areas of misalignment. DHS, in its comments, stated that they  do not believe a methodology for alignment determinations is needed and  that having subject matter experts involved in each determination is  preferable given the wide range of IT programs at DHS; however, we  believe that without such a methodology, it is not possible for the  department to ensure that such alignment determinations are made  consistently and repeatably. Without such acquisition and investment  management controls, architecture alignment assessments will continue to  largely be based on subjective and unverifiable judgments, and thus will  not provide a sufficient basis for ensuring that systems are not duplicative  and are interoperable.", "With respect to portfolio-level practices, DHS does not have policies and  procedures for evaluating or controlling its investment portfolios. Further,  while post-implementation reviews are mentioned in DHS guidance, the  guidance lacks specific procedures that would, for example, define roles  and responsibilities for conducting these reviews and specify how the  lessons learned and results of such reviews would be shared and used.

In other words, the quality of IT  systems and services is greatly influenced by the quality of the  management processes involved in developing and acquiring them.  According to leading practices, institutional system engineering maturity  requires life cycle management processes that are clearly defined and  applied on a repeatable basis across an organization.", "A system life cycle management process normally begins with initial  concept development and continues through requirements definition to  design, development, various phases of testing, implementation, and  maintenance. More specifically, during requirements definition, functional  requirements are delineated in terms of system functionality (what the  system is to do), performance (how well the system is to execute  functions), data (what data are needed by what functions, when, and in  what form), interfaces (what interactions with related and dependent  systems are needed), and security (what controls are needed to address  the assessed level of risk).

In 2008, DHS issued an interim  life cycle management guide to introduce a standard system development  methodology that can be tailored to specific projects. To the  department\u2019s credit, this guide addresses important aspects of effective  system acquisition and development. For example, the guide requires that  business objectives and systems requirements, as well as baseline  performance goals, be defined and used as the measures of success for  each program, and it requires that all programs be aligned with the HLS  EA. Further, it requires acquisition management oversight and defines the  roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, including component CIOs  and DHS IT portfolio managers, and to accomplish this it requires  checkpoint reviews (i.e., stage reviews) throughout the program\u2019s life  cycle. In addition, it specifies key activities associated with each life cycle  stage (planning, requirements definition, design, development, integration  and test, implementation, operation and maintenance, and disposition).", "However, the interim guide does not address all key activities for each life  cycle phase. For example, it does not address key practices associated  with acquiring commercial products or services, such as evaluating  commercial product and supplier viability and assessing commercial  product dependencies/interoperability before purchasing the products.  Also, while it does identify a list of work products that are to be created  and updated to record the results of the activities performed for each life  cycle stage, it does not address the content of all of these work products.  For example, it does not provide a sample document or content template  for a quality assurance plan, a configuration management plan, or a service  reuse plan.

They include:  Involving top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing a strategic workforce plan;   Determining the critical skills and competencies needed to achieve current  and future programmatic results;   Developing strategies tailored to address gaps between the current  workforce and future needs;   Building the capability to support workforce strategies; and    Monitoring and evaluating an agency\u2019s progress toward its human capital  goals and the contribution that human capital results have made to  achieving programmatic goals.", "As is summarized below, DHS has yet to address either its acquisition or IT  workforce needs in a manner that is fully consistent with these practices.  Until DHS does so, it will continue to be at risk of not having sufficient  people with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to effectively and  efficiently acquire key system investments.", "In November 2008, we reported that DHS had not developed a  comprehensive strategic acquisition workforce plan to direct the  department\u2019s future acquisition workforce efforts, and that the department  lacked several elements that are key to developing such a plan. More  specifically, we reported that DHS  lacked an overall direction for acquisition workforce planning, and  notwithstanding some recent actions, had not fully involved key  stakeholders, such as the CHCO and component procurement and  program offices, both of which have been shown to increase the likelihood  of success for workforce planning;   excluded some acquisition-related career fields from its definition of  acquisition workforce, thus limiting the scope of its planning efforts, and  while it intended to expand its definition, it had yet to identify which  positions should be included; lacked sufficient data to fully assess its acquisition workforce needs,  including the gaps in the number of employees needed or the skills of  these employees; and lacked sufficient insight into the number of contractors supporting its  acquisition function or the types of tasks that contractors were  performing.", "DHS has undertaken several initiatives to begin addressing its acquisition  workforce challenges. For example, its recruiting, hiring, and training  initiatives have allowed it to hire new contract specialists and expand  workforce access to acquisition-related training. Specifically, in January  2008, the CPO implemented the Acquisition Professional Career Program,  and as of September 2008, had hired 49 contract specialist interns. In  addition, CPO established an Acquisition Training Program in 2008 that  included DHS-specific training for program managers, and it formed a  council to coordinate acquisition workforce training opportunities across  components.", "In November 2008, we reported on several challenges that DHS faced in  managing these initiatives. For example, most initiatives aimed at  defining and identifying the acquisition workforce and assessing  acquisition workforce needs had yet to produce results, and in some cases  were progressing more slowly than originally projected. DHS\u2019s initiatives  also primarily focused on contract specialists despite other identified  acquisition workforce shortages, and DHS had not determined how it  would expand the initiatives. Further, DHS generally lacked documented  performance goals and implementation steps\u2014such as actions to be taken,  needed resources, and milestones\u2014for these initiatives.", "Since that time, DHS has taken steps to expand two of its recruiting and  hiring initiatives to additional acquisition-related career fields. Specifically,  DHS developed plans to include career fields such as program  management and engineering in its fall 2009 Acquisition Professional  Career Program cohort. According to a CPO representative, DHS also  plans to add acquisition career fields to its centralized hiring program and  has recently hired a recruitment coordinator to carry out this expansion.", "In June 2004, we reported that DHS had begun strategic planning for IT  human capital at the headquarters level, but it had not yet systematically  gathered baseline data about its existing IT workforce across the  department. Moreover, the DHS CIO had expressed concern at that time  about staffing and acknowledged that progress in this area had been slow.  In our report, we recommended that the department analyze whether it  had appropriately allocated and deployed IT staff with the relevant skills  to obtain its institutional and program-related goals. In response, the CIO  established an IT human capital Center of Excellence to deliver, plans,  processes, and procedures to execute an IT human capital strategy and to  conduct an analysis of the skill sets of DHS IT professionals.", "In September 2007, we reported that DHS had developed a IT human  capital plan and related documents that were largely consistent with  federal guidance and associated best practices. For example, they  provided for developing a complete inventory of existing IT staff skills,  identifying IT skills needed to achieve agency goals, determining skill  gaps, and developing plans to address such gaps. They also provided for  involving key stakeholders\u2014such as the CIO, Chief Human Capital Officer  (CHCO), and component agency CIOs and human capital directors\u2014in  carrying out the skill gap analyses and follow on workforce planning.", "However, we also reported that the plan did not fully address twelve key  practices. For example, although the plan and supporting documents  described the department\u2019s IT human capital goals and steps necessary to  implement them, most steps did not include associated milestones. In  addition, although the plan and supporting documents provided for  involving key stakeholders, they did not assign those stakeholders specific  responsibilities against which to hold them accountable for results. We  also reported at that time that DHS had made limited progress in  implementing its IT human capital plan. In particular, DHS CIO and CHCO  officials, as well as officials from the three DHS agencies that we  examined (CBP, FEMA, and the Coast Guard), all told us that they had yet  to begin implementing the plan. Accordingly, we made recommendations  aimed at strengthening and implementing the plan.", "DHS has made limited progress in addressing our recommendations. For  example it has not established implementation milestones, assigned  stakeholder responsibilities and accountability, or begun to track,  document, and report on human capital risks. Also, while DHS reported in  2007 that it intended to analyze its IT workforce makeup every 2 years,  CIO and CHCO officials told us that this will not be done until after a  planned 2010 Federal CIO Council-sponsored survey of the  governmentwide IT workforce. Further, these officials stated that  implementation of the 2007 IT human capital plan has been limited  because the department\u2019s focus has been on strengthening its executive  leadership team and its acquisition workforce, and that it only recently  became engaged on departmentwide IT workforce issues. However, they  added that DHS component organizations have been working to  strengthen staff core competencies in four IT disciplines\u2014Project  Management, Security/Information Assurance, Enterprise Architecture,  and Solutions Architecture.", "According to officials from CBP, FEMA, and the Coast Guard, none of  these component organizations have taken specific actions to implement  the 2005 DHS IT human capital plan because they have not received any  departmental instruction or guidance for doing so. Moreover, the extent to  which they are each proactively and strategically addressing their  respective human capital needs varies. For example, CBP\u2019s Office of  Information Technology Workforce Management Group has a strategic IT  human capital plan that defines goals (e.g., creating and enabling a team of  leaders who have both the technical expertise and skills to manage and  motivate employees, and providing education, training and development  opportunities to allow employees to grow in their jobs and their careers),  and the group has taken actions to achieve the goals (i.e., identifying  employees with leadership potential, developing a leadership curriculum  for them, establishing an internship program, and creating a skills  inventory). In contrast, FEMA\u2019s Office of Information Technology does not  have a strategic IT human capital plan, although officials report that one is  to be completed in fiscal year 2010, and in the interim, this office is  assessing its workforce competency gaps, among other things. Further,  while the Coast Guard has an IT strategic human capital plan, this plan is  more than a decade old, as officials report that they have no immediate  plans to update it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Large-Scale IT Investments Exposed to Risk Because Key Acquisition and IT Management Controls Have Not Always Been Effectively Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The success of a major IT program can be judged by the extent to which it  delivers promised system capabilities and mission benefits on time and  within schedule. As our research and evaluations show, a key determinant  of program success is the extent to which the earlier discussed  institutional acquisition and IT management controls are appropriately  employed in managing each and every IT investment.", "In this regard, our reviews of a number of large-scale DHS IT investments  have disclosed a range of program management control weaknesses that  have increased the risk of cost, schedule, and performance shortfalls. In  many cases, DHS has since taken steps to address the weaknesses that we  identified. However, some weaknesses have lingered, and we continue to  identify issues on other programs. Moreover, these weaknesses are  contributing to programs falling short of their capability, benefit, cost, and  schedule expectations. To illustrate the prevalence and significance of  these acquisition and IT management weaknesses, as well as DHS\u2019s  progress in addressing them, we discuss work related to five large-scale  programs\u2014ACE, US-VISIT, Rescue 21, Secure Flight, and SBInet.", "ACE is a multi-billion dollar program to incrementally modernize trade  processing and support border security. Since 1999, we have issued a  series of reports that have disclosed a number of acquisition and  investment management weaknesses that have contributed to ACE  performance shortfalls, including program costs increasing from $1 billion  to about $3.1 billion, and ACE schedule slipping from fiscal year 2007 to  fiscal year 2010. To address the weaknesses, we have made a number of  recommendations. CBP has largely agreed with our recommendations, and  continues to work to implement many of them. Below we provide a brief  summary of ACE-related efforts to implement effective acquisition and IT  management controls.", "Beginning in May 1999, we reported that ACE was not being defined in  the context of an enterprise architecture, and that its life cycle cost  estimates and cost/benefit analysis were inadequate. Further, ACE was not  being acquired in accordance with disciplined investment management  processes. As a result, CBP was not positioned to know that it was  pursuing the right system solution for its needs and to deliver a defined a  solution on time and schedule. Subsequently, CBP adopted an incremental  approach to acquiring ACE, which we supported as a proven risk  reduction measure for acquiring large-scale systems, but as we reported in  June 2001, ACE was being pursued separate from another trade-related  system (known as the International Trade Data System), which was  duplicative of and not aligned with ACE. Subsequently, this related system  was merged with ACE.", "Between May 2002 and February 2003, we continued to report on ACE  challenges and weaknesses. Specifically, we reported that ACE was risky  for a variety of reasons, including cost overruns, implications for changing  how trade processing was performed, and known key acquisition and IT  management control weaknesses associated with, for example, program  office human capital and software management processes. Subsequently,  we reported that CBP was working to implement our previous  recommendations aimed at addressing acquisition and IT management  control weaknesses, but that problems continued. For example, ACE  cost estimates were not reliable because they were not derived in  accordance with estimating best practices. The next year we again  reported that ACE was not following rigorous and disciplined acquisition  and IT management controls, such as those related to managing the  program office human capital, risks, and contract management. For  example, while initial ACE test results were positive, CBP had not taken  steps to independently oversee the contractor\u2019s testing.", "In May 2004, we reported that the first two ACE system increments were  operating, but that CBP\u2019s approach to incrementally acquiring and  deploying ACE involved excessive overlap among increments. Moreover,  the scheduling of increments had allowed for considerable overlap and  concurrency among them, and this had produced a pattern of having to  borrow resources from later increments to complete earlier increments.  We concluded that this pattern had and would continue to result in ACE  cost overruns and schedule delays. The next year, we reported that while  CBP had revised its cost baselines in light of ACE overruns, this was not  sufficient because the number of ACE increments had increased and  system quality standards had been relaxed to allow increments to proceed  through key milestones despite the presence of material system defects.  We concluded that this practice, combined with the concurrency of  increments, would exacerbate the program\u2019s cost and schedule shortfalls.", "We also reported that previously identified management control  weaknesses remained, such as in system testing and in cost estimation,  and that progress in addressing our recommendations had been slow.", "In May 2006, we reported that CBP had begun to make progress in  addressing our recommendations through the establishment and use of a  program-wide performance and accountability framework, as we had also  recommended. However, control weaknesses remained. For example,  considerable concurrency still remained among increments, thus  increasing the risk of continued cost and schedule overruns. Also, while  earned value management was an OMB requirement, CBP discontinued  its use on two ACE increments, thus limiting its ability to measure  performance and progress.", "In October 2007, we reported that CBP had continued to take steps to  establish an accountability framework grounded in measuring and  disclosing progress against program performance measures and targets.  However, ACE costs were likely to increase further because prior  limitations in how system requirements were defined had resulted in an  increase requirements and the need to replace a key software product,  even though the new product may reduce user productivity. In addition,  the inventory of ACE-related risks was incomplete and that information  needed to make informed decisions on these risks was not being  maintained.", "We plan to continue to monitor CBP\u2019s progress in implementing our ACE- related recommendations.", "US-VISIT is a multi-billion dollar program to collect and maintain  biographic and biometric information on certain foreign nationals who  enter and exit the United States through over 300 air, sea, and land ports  of entry.

To the department\u2019s  credit, it has addressed many of the recommendations that we have made  for addressing these weaknesses, and as a result the program is better  positioned today for success than it has been in the past. However, these  weaknesses have contributed to instances of the program not living up to  expectations, and some weaknesses still remain that pose future risks.  Below we provide a brief summary of US-VISIT-related efforts to  implement effective acquisition and IT management controls.", "We first reported on US-VISIT in June 2003, finding that program plans  did not sufficiently define what specific system capabilities and benefits  would be delivered, by when, and at what cost, and how US-VISIT  intended to manage the acquisition to provide reasonable assurance that it  would meet their commitments. Without defining such commitments, it  was not possible to measure program performance and promote  accountability for results. Shortly thereafter, in September 2003, we  concluded that the program was high risk because, among other things, its  size, complexity, mission criticality, and enormous potential costs,  coupled with a range of program management control weaknesses,  including an immature governance structure, lack of clarity about its  operational environment, facility implications, and mission value. In May  2004, we reported that US-VISIT did not have a current life-cycle cost  estimate or a cost benefit analysis, and that testing of an initial increment  of system capabilities was not well-managed, and was not completed until  after the increment became operational. Moreover, the test plan used was  not completed until after testing was concluded.", "In February 2005, we reported that DHS had hired a prime integration  contractor to augment its ability to deliver US-VISIT, but that acquisition  management weaknesses continued. For example, we found that an effort  to pilot alternative system solutions for delivering the capability to track  persons exiting the U.S. was faced with a compressed time line, missed  milestones, and a reduced scope that limited its value.", "In February 2006, we reported that the DHS\u2019s progress in implementing  18 GAO recommendations made in previous reports was mixed, but  overall slow in critical areas, including completing cost-benefit analyses  for increments, determining whether proposed increments would produce  mission value consistent with costs and risks, developing well-defined and  traceable test plans prior to testing, and assessing workforce and facility  needs for new functionality.", "In February 2007, we reported that DHS had not adequately defined and  justified its proposed investment in planned and ongoing exit pilot and  demonstration projects, and that it continued to invest in US-VISIT  without a clearly defined operational context (enterprise architecture)  that included explicit relationships with related border security and  immigration enforcement initiatives. At the same time, program  management costs had risen sharply, while costs for development had  decreased, without any accompanying explanation of the reasons. We also  reiterated our prior findings concerning a lack of program transparency  and accountability due to inadequate definition and disclosure of planned  expenditures, timelines, capabilities, and benefits, as well as limited  measurement and reporting on progress against each.", "In August 2007, we reported that while US-VISIT entry capabilities were  operating at over 300 ports of entry, exit capabilities were not, and that  DHS did not have a comprehensive plan or a complete schedule for  delivering a biometric exit solution. In addition, DHS continued to invest  heavily in program management activities without adequate justification  for doing so, and it continued to propose spending tens of millions of  dollars on US-VISIT exit projects that were not well-defined, planned, or  justified on the basis of costs, benefits, and risks.", "In February 2008, we reported that while DHS had partially defined a  strategic solution for meeting US-VISIT goals, including defining and  beginning development of a key capability known as \u201cUnique Identity,\u201d  which was to establish a single identity for all individuals at their earliest  possible interaction with any U.S. immigration and border management  organization by capturing the individual\u2019s biometrics, including 10  fingerprints and a digital image. However it had not defined and  economically justified a comprehensive strategic solution for controlling  and monitoring the exit of foreign visitors, which was critical to  accomplishing the program\u2019s goals. DHS was also taking a range of  evolving actions, partially at the department level, to coordinate  relationships among US-VISIT and other immigration and border control  programs; however, this evolution had yet to progress to the point of  reflecting the full scope of key practices that GAO previously identified as  essential to enhancing and sustaining collaborative efforts that span  multiple organizations.
