Our specific objective was to identify practices  that federal agencies have used to effectively implement the provisions of  the act.", "To address this objective, we first identified the specific provisions of the  act to include in our review. To do so, we (1) reviewed our previously  issued reports that have examined various aspects of the act; (2) met  with relevant officials from the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  Office of Electronic Government and Information Technology; and (3)  reviewed data contained on the IT Dashboard, as well as other relevant  information supporting the House of Representatives Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform\u2019s biannual scorecards on the 24  covered agencies\u2019 progress in addressing the act\u2019s requirements.", "As a result of these activities, combined with our professional judgment,  we identified five FITARA provisions that were most relevant to enabling  agencies\u2019 IT management improvements. These provisions were: Chief  Information Officer (CIO) authority enhancements, enhanced  transparency and improved risk management in IT investments, portfolio  review, the federal data center consolidation initiative, and the  government-wide software purchasing program.", "We then identified nine agencies that had implemented at least one of the  five FITARA provisions we included in our review. Our identification of the  nine agencies was based on information in our previous reports that  indicated each agency had realized an IT management improvement or  cost savings with respect to one or more of the five selected FITARA  provisions. Additionally, we considered other relevant information  supporting the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform\u2019s scorecards that indicated an agency had  effectively implemented FITARA. These nine agencies were the  Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce (Commerce), Health and  Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (Justice), and  Veterans Affairs (VA); and the Agency for International Development  (USAID); the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA);  and the General Services Administration (GSA).

These officials included a FITARA Program Manager, a Director  of FITARA Operations, and staff within department-level CIO offices  responsible for implementing the provisions of the act.", "We compiled practices where at least one agency had taken action to  implement one of the five selected provisions that led to an IT  management improvement or cost savings. We then compiled  descriptions of the actions that the nine agencies had taken. Additionally,  we reviewed actions the agencies have taken in response to our previous  recommendations to corroborate the IT management improvements and  cost savings. Agencies also identified overarching practices that were not  unique to a specific provision but, instead, better positioned agencies to  implement one or more of the five provisions. Further, we shared the  practices with the nine agencies\u2019 Inspectors General to provide additional  assurance that the practices were consistent with the agencies\u2019 activities  to address FITARA.

These investments often  suffered from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as  project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and  governance. As a result of these failures, we added Improving the  Management of IT Acquisitions and Operations to our biennial high-risk  list in 2015.", "With its enactment in 2014, FITARA was also intended to improve  agencies\u2019 acquisitions of IT and facilitate Congress\u2019 efforts to monitor  agencies\u2019 progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication  and achieving cost savings. The act included specific provisions related  to seven areas, including the five areas selected for our review:", "CIO authority enhancements\u2014Covered agencies\u2019 CIOs are  required to (1) approve the IT budget requests of their respective  agencies, (2) certify that agencies\u2019 IT investments are adequately  implementing OMB\u2019s incremental development guidance, (3) review  and approve contracts for IT, and (4) approve the appointment of  other agency employees with the title of CIO (e.g., component agency  CIOs).", "Enhanced transparency and improved risk management in IT  investments\u2014OMB and covered agencies are to make detailed  information on federal IT investments publicly available, and  department-level CIOs are to categorize their major IT investments by  risk.

Officials from 21 of the 24  agencies in our review reported that challenges had hindered their CIOs\u2019  ability to implement incremental development. These challenges included:  (1) inefficient governance processes; (2) procurement delays; and (3)  organizational changes associated with transitioning from a traditional  software methodology that takes years to deliver a product, to  incremental development, which delivers products in shorter time frames.  We made recommendations to department-level CIOs to improve  reporting accuracy and update or establish certification policies. As of  February 2019, agencies had taken steps to address eight of the 19  recommendations.", "Additionally, our August 2018 report on department-level CIOs noted that  none of the 24 agencies had policies that fully addressed the role of their  CIOs consistent with federal laws and guidance, including FITARA. In  addition, the majority of the agencies had not fully addressed the roles of  their CIOs for any of six key areas that we identified. Although officials  from most agencies stated that their CIOs were implementing the  responsibilities even when not addressed in policy, the 24 CIOs  acknowledged in a survey that they were not always very effective in  implementing all of their responsibilities.", "Further, the shortcomings in agencies\u2019 policies were attributable, at least  in part, to incomplete guidance from OMB. We noted that, until OMB  improved its guidance to clearly address all CIO responsibilities, and  agencies fully addressed the role of CIOs in their policies, CIOs would be  limited in effectively managing IT and addressing long-standing  management challenges. We made 27 recommendations for agencies to  improve the effectiveness of CIOs\u2019 implementation of their  responsibilities. Most agencies agreed with the recommendations and  described actions they planned to take to address them.", "Enhanced transparency and improved risk management  In June 2016, we reported on rating the risk of IT investments and noted  that agencies underreported the risk of almost two-thirds of the  investments their CIOs reviewed. All 17 selected agencies incorporated  at least two of OMB\u2019s factors into their risk rating processes and nine  used all of the factors, interpreted differently, less often than on a monthly  basis. Our assessments generally showed more risk than the associated  CIO ratings.", "We also issued a series of reports about the IT Dashboard that noted  concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data on the Dashboard.  In total, we have made 25 recommendations to OMB and federal  agencies to help improve the accuracy and reliability of the information on  the Dashboard and to increase its availability. Most agencies agreed with  the recommendations or had no comments. As of February 2019, 11 of  these recommendations remained open.", "In April 2015, we reported on actions needed by 26 federal agencies to  ensure portfolio savings were realized and tracked. We noted that these  agencies had decreased their planned PortfolioStat savings by at least  68 percent from what they reported to us in 2013. Specifically, while the  agencies initially had planned to save at least $5.8 billion between fiscal  years 2013 and 2015, these estimates were decreased to approximately  $2 billion. We made recommendations to OMB and the Department of  Defense aimed at improving the reporting of achieved savings,  documenting how savings are reinvested, and establishing time frames  for PortfolioStat action items. As of February 2019, OMB had addressed  one of the five recommendations.", "Our September 2016 report on application inventories noted that most of  the 24 agencies in the review fully met at least three of the four practices  we identified to determine if agencies had complete software application  inventories. Additionally, six of the agencies relied on their investment  management processes and, in some cases, supplemental processes to  rationalize their applications to varying degrees. However, five of the six  agencies acknowledged that their processes did not always allow for  collecting or reviewing the information needed to effectively rationalize all  their applications. We made recommendations that 20 agencies improve  their inventories and five of the agencies take actions to improve their  processes to rationalize their applications more completely.

This support was demonstrated, for example, by  senior officials highlighting the act\u2019s importance during key executive-level  meetings and in their key memorandums and other communications to  the agencies\u2019 workforce. We have previously reported that having senior  leadership support is critical to the success of major programs.", "According to USDA\u2019s Director of FITARA Operations, the agency made a  decision to raise the topic of FITARA implementation at each monthly  executive leadership meeting that is attended by the Deputy Secretary,  Chief Operating Officer, and Assistant Secretary for Administration, in  order to keep attention focused on the act\u2019s implementation. In addition,  the agency\u2019s October 2016, Concept of Operations for The Oversight,  Management, and Operations of FITARA document, which is the primary  document used by the agency to assist with the implementation and  execution of the act, was signed by the Deputy Secretary, CIO, and  Deputy CIO. The officials reported that obtaining support from senior  leadership had helped ensure buy-in to changes resulting from  implementing provisions of the act.", "NASA officials also highlighted senior leadership support as being  essential to their actions to implement FITARA. For example, the NASA  Deputy Administrator and Associate Administrator for Mission Support  signed and distributed a memorandum in August 2010 that emphasized  the agency\u2019s commitment to the data center consolidation effort. The  memorandum stated that Mission Directorate Associate Administrators  and Center Directors shall direct their staff to cooperate fully and openly  with NASA\u2019s data center consolidation plan. An official in the Office of the  CIO stated that the memorandum was evidence of the support the  agency had from senior leadership to close data centers.", "Further, a Commerce official stated that FITARA implementation activities  at the agency have had support from agency leadership, including the  Deputy Secretary and the CIO. For example, according to the official, the  Deputy Secretary provided each of the component agency FITARA  sponsors with a signed memorandum asking for assistance from the  components. This action resulted in increased cooperation throughout the  agency when components were asked to respond to FITARA-related  requests for information.", "Treat implementation of FITARA as a program  Commerce and USDA reported that treating FITARA implementation as if  it were an IT program was important to implementing the requirements of  the act. The two agencies demonstrated this practice by assigning staff to  manage implementation of FITARA and regularly discussing  implementation of the act at meetings with senior-level officials.", "According to a Commerce lessons learned document, the agency has  managed FITARA like a program by reporting regularly on its  implementation status to internal agency stakeholders. In addition, the  agency has assigned a program manager to assist with implementation of  the act and to track progress on implementing the act\u2019s provisions. As a  result, Commerce officials reported that the importance of FITARA has  been regularly discussed throughout the agency in bi-weekly meetings  within the Office of the Secretary. These meetings led to an increased  sense of cooperation between different disciplines (e.g., IT, budget,  acquisition, legal, and human resources) and reduced the impression that  FITARA was solely focused on the department-level CIO office.", "Further, USDA created the position of Executive Director for FITARA  Operations within the department-level CIO office. This position has  responsibility for, among other things, establishing the processes and  procedures to bring the agency into compliance with the act and IT  management controls that meet the FITARA requirements. The Director  stated that treating the implementation of FITARA as if it were an IT  program has led the agency to develop key documentation that has  assisted in the implementation of the act, including its Concept of  Operations for the Oversight, Management, and Operations of FITARA  and Data Center Closure Process.", "Establish FITARA performance measures for component agencies  HHS established internal FITARA performance measures for its  component agencies that officials believe have led to increased  effectiveness in implementing the act. Specifically, the agency undertook  an effort to increase its FITARA scorecard grades\u2014called \u201cA by May\u201d\u2014 with a goal to attain an \u2018A\u2019 on the May 2018 FITARA 6.0 scorecard. As  part of this effort, HHS created its own internal scorecard for each of its  component agencies that mirrored the agency\u2019s FITARA scorecard.", "According to an HHS lessons learned document, aligning the FITARA  metrics to component agency performance resulted in greater  transparency between the department-level CIO and component agency  CIOs.

The  officials added that the site visits also showed data center staff that they  were valued as partners in the consolidation effort.", "Transition to a virtual or cloud-based environment  USDA, GSA, NASA, and USAID have taken actions to transition to a  virtual or cloud-based environment as a way to effectively implement the  data center consolidation provision of the act. The agencies\u2019 actions  consisted of moving data from agency-owned data centers to cloud- based environments, which helped the agencies make progress toward  meeting the cost savings and data center optimization requirements of  FITARA.", "USDA officials reported that the agency has been successful in having its  components use cloud technology to reduce the number of data centers.  For example, the USDA Forest Service developed a migration strategy to  move all of the Forest Service production systems and applications from  its data centers to USDA\u2019s Enterprise Data Center and Cloud  Infrastructure as a Service located at the National Information Technology  Center in Kansas City, Missouri. As a result of moving its production  systems and applications, the Forest Service increased virtualization,  resolved many long-term security vulnerabilities, and reduced the number  of duplicative and stand-alone applications by 70 percent. The Forest  Service reported that it had identified cost savings of up to $6.1 million  annually as a result of these efforts.", "In addition, GSA developed a data center consolidation strategy which  included migrating services from agency-owned data centers to more  flexible and optimized cloud computing environments, shared service and  co-location centers, and more optimized data centers within their own  inventory. For example, the agency migrated numerous systems to  provisioned services via cloud computing services. GSA officials reported  that their agency has encouraged virtualization and cloud computing as  preferred options above new physical implementations. The agency also  continues to migrate away from hardware-dependent operating systems  and to utilize, build upon, and mature its enterprise service virtualization  platform offerings and capabilities. As a result of these actions, the  agency has been able to more effectively retire older systems in order to  shift them to newer, virtualized technologies.", "NASA officials stated that their agency is transitioning to a cloud-based  environment to close its data centers. For example, NASA moved all of  the data from the Earth Observing System to a new commercial cloud- based model that hosts all the data in one location. The Earth Observing  System was designed over a decade ago and its data were held at  different partner locations based on science discipline (e.g., land, oceans,  and atmosphere) and provided data that were used by the public in  various capacities. The agency funded data center hardware at each of  the locations and transported data between the locations, as necessary,  to create integrated data products. According to NASA officials,  transitioning to a cloud-based environment has resulted in easier access  to NASA data by the public, elimination of recurring capital investments in  data center hardware, and improved IT security.", "USAID reported that it saved money and increased efficiency by  consolidating all of its data centers into a single data center in 2012 and  then transitioning its single data center to a cloud-based environment.  USAID completed the migration of its data center to the cloud in June  2018. According to the agency, moving to the cloud is expected to result  in $36 million in future cost avoidance for the agency.", "Incentivize component agencies to accelerate the pace of data  center consolidation  Data center consolidation activities can be costly, requiring agencies to  use resources to, for example, analyze the need for IT equipment (e.g.,  servers, processors, networking, and other hardware) and to move such  equipment between locations. Our May 2018 report on the results of  agencies\u2019 efforts to consolidate data centers noted mixed progress toward  achieving OMB\u2019s goals for closing data centers.", "Justice incentivized a component agency to accelerate its participation in  data center consolidation by providing supplemental funding for costs  associated with consolidation. For example, the agency\u2019s CIO office  provided funding for a component agency to offset the cost to move  servers and data center equipment to another location. Justice officials  noted that the agency has seen increased cooperation from component  agencies as a result of offering supplemental funding to participate in its  data center consolidation effort.", "Utilize data centers with excess capacity  A part of GSA\u2019s strategy for consolidating data centers was to move  existing data to other government data centers that had the capacity to  store its data. To do so, GSA established shared service agreements with  the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Computer Center and  NASA\u2019s Stennis Space Center data centers. As a result of moving its  data to other government data centers with excess capacity, GSA was  able to consolidate numerous data centers, resulting in increased  efficiency and cost savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Software Purchasing", "paragraphs": ["USDA, VA, GSA, NASA, and USAID identified the practice of centralizing  the management of software licenses as essential to their effective  implementation of the software purchasing provision of FITARA. These  five agencies did this by, for example, establishing a software  management team, creating contracts with vendors to centrally manage  licenses, and establishing governance processes for software license  management.", "USDA employed a centralized software license management approach by  establishing a Category Management Team. This team was responsible  for the oversight of all software license enterprise agreements, which  included collecting, reviewing, consolidating, and reporting on all software  procurements. The agency also created Enterprise IT Category  Management guidance that supported the central oversight authority for  managing enterprise software license agreements. Further, according to  USDA officials, management has been supportive in ensuring that all  organizations and components join existing enterprise contracts that are  already in place.", "USDA\u2019s actions to centralize the management of its software licenses  have led to effective agency-wide decisions regarding software purchases  that the agency reported have yielded cost savings. For example, the  agency identified instances where multiple software contracts at different  price points among component agencies could be consolidated into one  contract at the lowest price. This resulted in reducing the cost per license  for a software product from $250 to $15.75, saving the agency  approximately $85,000 between 2016 and 2017, according to USDA  documentation.", "VA established an Enterprise Software License Management Team to  centralize the management of its efforts to purchase software. According  to officials in VA\u2019s Office of Information and Technology, this team  consisted of knowledgeable staff that had experience with software  management and development, and was familiar with software that was  deployed across the entire agency. These officials also stated that the  Enterprise Software License Management Team conducted weekly  meetings with GSA to discuss software licensing and category  management to ensure they were aware of other opportunities for cost  savings. VA also established an Enterprise Software Asset  Management Technical Working Group that was formed to define and  document a framework that employed a centralized software license  management approach.", "By centralizing the management of its software licenses, VA has been  able to make effective agency-wide decisions regarding the purchase of  software products and reported that it has realized cost savings.  Specifically, VA provided documentation showing that it had implemented  a solution to analyze agency-wide software license data, including usage  and costs. The agency identified approximately $65 million in cost  savings between 2017 and 2020 due to analyzing one of their software  licenses.", "We previously reported that GSA and USAID had centralized the  management of their software licenses. We reported that GSA\u2019s server- based and enterprise-wide licenses were managed centrally, whereas  non-enterprise-wide workstation software licenses were generally  managed regionally. GSA also issued a policy that established  procedures for the management of all software licenses, including  analyzing software licenses to identify opportunities for consolidation.", "Centralizing the management of its purchase of software licenses has led  GSA to make effective agency-wide decisions regarding its software  licenses and avoid future costs, according to agency documentation. For  example, in fiscal year 2015, the agency consolidated licenses for one of  its software products, saving the agency over $400,000 and avoiding over  $3 million in future costs.", "For its part, USAID had a contract in place with a vendor for centrally  managing licenses for all of its operating units. Further, according to  officials within USAID\u2019s Office of the CIO, the agency established a  governance process to manage the introduction of new software. As part  of this governance process, USAID\u2019s Software and Hardware Approval  Request Panel was responsible for reviewing requests to procure new  software.", "USAID\u2019s actions on centralizing the management of its software licenses  have led to effective agency-wide decisions regarding software purchases  that the agency reported have yielded cost savings. For example, USAID  identified opportunities to reduce costs on its software licenses through  consolidation or elimination of software. This resulted in the agency  reporting a cumulative savings from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2018 of  over $2.5 million on software licenses.", "NASA issued a software license management policy that included the  roles and responsibilities for central management of the agency\u2019s  software licenses.
