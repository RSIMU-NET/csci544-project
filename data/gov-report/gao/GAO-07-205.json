Small businesses received 66 percent of the $1.9 billion awarded in these states. Required information on small business subcontracting is not consistently available in official procurement data systems for the four agencies. The systems had no information on whether DHS or GSA required subcontracting plans for 70 percent or more of their contracting funds. In addition, when data showed agencies determined that the plans were not required, the four agencies often did not document a reason for their determinations, even though federal rules require such documentation when prime contracts meet criteria for having these plans. Incomplete information about subcontracting limits determining the extent to which agencies complied with contracting rules and gave small businesses maximum opportunities to win subcontracts. DBEs were awarded about 4 percent, or about $53 million, of the almost $1.3 billion the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration funded for Katrina-related contracts in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi between August 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006.

The agencies were to use the funds  to, among other things, award contracts for a range of services related to  hurricane relief and recovery. Some in Congress have raised concerns  about how much access small businesses had to these contracting  opportunities, especially small businesses in the areas that were affected  by the hurricane. In addition, because of substantial damage to the  region\u2019s transportation networks and the role of the Department of  Transportation (DOT) in assisting the states with their rebuilding, there  has been congressional interest regarding the extent to which  Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) received funds from DOT for  projects related to Hurricane Katrina.", "We have prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative as part of a continuing effort to  assist Congress in reviewing federal activities related to Hurricane Katrina.

Our  analysis included contract data from the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), the governmentwide database of  contracting activity, and DD-350, the Department of Defense database that  contains data on individual contracting actions. Although we could not  independently verify the reliability of these data, we reviewed system  documentation, conducted electronic data testing for inconsistency errors  and completeness and compared it with supporting documentation when  available, and interviewed agency officials about each of the systems. On  the basis of these efforts, we determined the data on amounts received  directly from federal contracts to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report. To describe the extent to which prime contractors  subcontracted with small businesses, we identified contracts that were  awarded or used between August 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, for activities  related to Hurricane Katrina and that required subcontracting plans. We  obtained and analyzed documentation of subcontracting awards for  selected DOD and Corps contractors that received the most dollars from  Katrina-related contracts from August 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006.

The  act sets a governmentwide goal for small business participation of not less  than 23 percent of the total value of all prime contract awards\u2014contracts  that are awarded directly by an agency\u2014for each fiscal year. The Small  Business Administration (SBA) is responsible for reporting annually to the  President and Congress on agencies\u2019 achievements relative to the goals.", "Because some agencies\u2019 activities lend themselves to contracting  opportunities more than others, SBA negotiates goals in annual  procurement with federal executive agencies to achieve the 23 percent  governmentwide goal for contract dollars awarded directly by a federal  agency. As a result, some agencies have goals higher than 23 percent,  while others may have goals that are lower than or just at 23 percent. For  example, the agencies we reviewed had different goals for awarding  contract dollars directly to small businesses in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.  DHS\u2019s goals were 23 and 30 percent for 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Table 5 also  shows that DHS did not require subcontracting plans for $1.4 billion of the  funds it awarded. DHS officials indicated $545 million of these funds were  miscoded and should have been entered in FPDS-NG as having \u201cno  subcontracting possibilities.\u201d DHS officials were unable to explain why the  remaining $861 million were not required to have subcontracting plans.", "According to GSA officials, contracting officers did not require  subcontracting plans for the Katrina-related contracts awarded to large  businesses for over $500,000 in some cases because of a temporary  increase (to $10 million) in the threshold for requiring these plans and in  other cases because the emergency nature of the situation required a  faster response than normal contracting procedures would have allowed.  Table 5 shows that GSA awarded a total of almost $114 million through  acquisitions that were coded in FPDS-NG as either not requiring a  subcontracting plan or for which there was no information on whether a  subcontracting plan was required (columns 5 and 6 of table 5, which round  to $114 million); of this amount, GSA officials indicated that $72 million  was awarded at amounts below the $10 million threshold. Of the  remaining $42 million, GSA determined that a subcontracting plan was not  required for a $26 million contract for ice because the urgent nature of the  situation required procuring and delivering the ice faster than normal  contracting procedures would have allowed. According to GSA officials,  contracts such as this and others for which GSA did not require  subcontracting plans, such as one for ambulance services to transport  people from nursing homes, illustrate their point about the need to  expedite contracting in an emergency situation. The ambulance services  contract they cited was valued high enough that they ordinarily would  have had to include a subcontracting plan which, in the normal course of  operations, would require review by the SBA\u2019s Procurement Center  Representatives for advisory purposes as well as a certain amount of  market research to determine if subcontracting possibilities existed for  potential prime contractors. In the judgment of the GSA contracting  officials, the urgency of the situation requiring the ambulances was  sufficient justification for forgoing the subcontracting plan requirements  and procedures. GSA officials were unable to explain the lack of  information on subcontracting plan requirements associated with the  remaining $16 million.", "Table 5 shows that DOD\u2019s data system, DD-350, had no information at all  on subcontracting plan requirements for $6.2 million of its Katrina-related  contracts. Based on our queries, DOD officials determined that these  contracts actually did require such plans. The system lacked this  information because the DFARS instructions do not require this  information for orders under a supply schedule contract. Of the $483.6  million that table 5 shows as not requiring a subcontracting plan, based on  our inquiries, DOD officials determined that $475.9 million of these  contract actions represented data entry errors and did, in fact, require  such plans or should have been coded as having \u201cno subcontracting  possibilities.\u201d Moreover, DOD officials stated that about $4.4 million in  contract actions were correctly coded as not requiring subcontracting  plans because they were awarded as blanket purchase agreements,  purchase orders, or were awarded to a small business. DOD officials were  unable to explain why the remaining $3.3 million in contracting dollars  coded as not requiring subcontracting plans were not required to have  such plans.", "For the Corps, table 5 shows $14 million for which DD-350 contained no  information on subcontracting plan requirements. Corps officials  determined that these were orders against existing GSA federal supply  schedule contracts and for which, according to these officials, the FAR  does not require subcontracting plans. Table 5 also shows $574.5 million  for which the Corps determined that subcontracting plans were not  required; according to Corps officials, data entry errors explain $437.2  million of these funds\u2014some small businesses (which do not have to have  subcontracting plans) were miscoded as large, some contracts were  miscoded as not requiring a subcontracting plan when they actually did,  and some should have been coded as having \u201cno subcontracting  possibilities.\u201d Corps officials were unable to explain why subcontracting  plans were not required for the remaining $102 million in contracting  dollars that were coded as not requiring a subcontracting plan.", "More than 1 year after Hurricane Katrina, key information about  subcontracting plan requirements remains incomplete, as we show in table  5.

Additionally,  officials from GSA and DOD stated that in the emergency situation that  Hurricane Katrina presented, they placed priority on awarding contracts  for vital supplies with the expectation that data entry would be completed  at a later time. However, as we noted, these agencies were still unable to  explain why data were missing on subcontracting plan requirements, or  why subcontracting plans were not required for from $3.3 million to $861  million in contract dollars.

We recognize that the response to Katrina was unprecedented for most  agencies and that complying with certain requirements, such as  negotiating subcontracting plans and documenting compliance with  subcontracting requirements, may have understandably been deferred to a  later time, as GSA and DOD officials said was the case. Nonetheless, a  substantial amount of information about the four agencies\u2019 subcontracting  requirements remains incomplete over a year after the hurricane.  Conclusively demonstrating compliance with the rules about  subcontracting plans is important for reasons beyond just documentation.  By requiring these plans, agencies commit prime contractors to specific  goals for providing opportunities to small businesses and give themselves  tools\u2014incentives as well as sanctions\u2014that they can use to ensure the  contractors engage in good faith efforts to meet their small business  subcontracting goals. In doing so, the agencies ensure compliance with  federal procurement regulations and that small businesses have all of the  practical opportunities to participate in federal contracts that they are  supposed to have. Because so much key information about subcontracting  plans was incomplete in federal procurement data systems and, at the  conclusion of our review, remains unresolved, we cannot tell the extent to  which the agencies are complying with the regulations. Furthermore, the  lack of transparency surrounding much of the agencies\u2019 subcontracting  data\u2014missing information on plans when contracts appear to meet the  criteria for having them\u2014may lead to unwarranted perceptions about how  the federal procurement system is working, particularly in terms of the  government\u2019s stated preference for contracting with small businesses.", "For their Katrina-related relief contracts, until DHS, GSA, DOD, and the  Corps improve documentation of (1) the status of whether subcontracting  plan requirements are in place and (2) their decisions on whether  subcontracting plans were required, the agencies will lack the ability to  provide assurance they offered small businesses the maximum practical  opportunity to do business with them. However, it is questionable whether  the benefit from clearing up the agencies\u2019 incomplete subcontracting  information would outweigh the costs of doing so for Katrina-related  contracts. Consequently, the agencies\u2019 best course of action in response to  what we found may be to improve documentation for all future contracts  and reinforce to all of its contracting officers and others involved in the  procurement process the importance of adhering to subcontracting plan  requirements and ensuring that publicly available information\u2014such as  what the agencies report in FPDS-NG\u2014accurately reflects the extent to  which the agency made subcontracting opportunities available to small  businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure compliance with federal contracting regulations and to more  transparently disclose the extent to which subcontracting opportunities  are available to small businesses, we recommend that the Secretaries of  Homeland Security and Defense and the Administrator of General Services  take the following two actions:  Issue guidance to the appropriate procurement offices and personnel  reinforcing (1) the reasons for subcontracting plan requirements and the  importance of complying with them; (2) the necessity for documenting in  publicly available sources the agencies\u2019 decisions, particularly in instances  when they determine not to require subcontracting plans; and (3) where  subcontracting plans are in place, the need to adhere to the requirement  for all prime contractors to report on their small business subcontracting  accomplishments.", "Consider asking their respective Inspectors General to conduct a review at  an appropriate future date to ensure that this guidance and related  requirements are being followed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS, GSA, DOD, DOT, and the SBA  for their review and comment.

Their comments are reprinted in appendixes II, III, and IV.", "In written comments from the Director of DHS\u2019s Departmental GAO/OIG  Liaison Office (app. II), DHS noted actions that it plans to take to  implement the recommendations within the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (which was responsible for the vast majority of the  agency\u2019s Katrina-related contracting) and stated that it plans to apply them  as best practices across all of the department. Specifically, the agency  plans to:  issue guidance to all acquisition offices reinforcing previously issued  guidance regarding the importance of awarding all appropriate contracts  to small businesses and encouraging large businesses to subcontract all  appropriate work to small businesses;   have an acquisition oversight team within the agency\u2019s Office of the Chief  Procurement Officer review DHS acquisition offices\u2019 compliance with  federal and DHS acquisition regulations, policies, and procedures; and,   pursue a review by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) to  benchmark the agency\u2019s contract administration efforts, including its  subcontracting plan administration, against DCMA practices and  procedures.", "In commenting on our presentation of subcontracting accomplishments,  DHS stated that many of the DHS contracts did not require contractors to  enter subcontracting accomplishment data into the electronic  subcontracting reporting system (eSRS), and that inputting subcontracting  accomplishment information into eSRS was voluntary in fiscal year 2006.   However, we note that according to a November 2005 memo to Chief  Acquisition Officers from the Office of Management and Budget, all  contractors for civilian agencies were required to use eSRS as of fiscal  year 2005.", "DHS also stated that we could have emphasized the agency\u2019s  administration of four key contracts with large businesses that had  subcontracting plans, noting that these businesses provided  subcontracting information weekly. While we were aware that DHS was  obtaining weekly subcontracting accomplishment information from  selected contractors, our methodology for DHS (and the other agencies)  was to obtain and analyze the subcontracting accomplishment information  that federal regulations required the agency to collect and report  (semiannually, in this case, as of March 31, 2006).", "DHS also offered comments regarding the report\u2019s presentation of  contracts awarded directly to small businesses. Specifically, DHS stated  that work under two contracts that were awarded directly to large  businesses was transferred to multiple small businesses. As we note in the  report, DHS awarded $1.6 billion in Katrina-related contracting dollars  directly to small businesses. To the extent that DHS accurately indicated  in FPDS-NG that the contracting dollars were awarded directly to small  and not large businesses, our report reflects this activity.", "GSA\u2019s Administrator generally concurred with our recommendations (see  app. III). The agency\u2019s Office of the Chief Acquisition Officer will, among  other things, take steps such as:    distribute an acquisition alert reminding the acquisition community of the  importance of subcontracting plan requirements, and the need to  document decisions, including those regarding subcontracting plan  requirements; remind contracting officers of their responsibility to ensure that  contractors properly report their subcontracting accomplishments as  required; and, include compliance with the guidance about subcontracting plan  requirements in its regularly scheduled Procurement Management  Reviews as well as the special reviews it conducts during major  catastrophes in order to ensure procurement statutes, regulations, and  guidance are being met; when appropriate, GSA indicated it will seek the  assistance of the agency\u2019s Inspector General to support these reviews.", "GSA emphasized\u2014during the course of our review as well as in its  comments on our draft report\u2014that during catastrophic situations, time is  of the essence in getting goods and services to a disaster area immediately.  While its contracting officers and personnel worked to comply with all  contracting requirements, including the subcontracting plan requirement,  GSA stated that the latter proved to be impossible given the urgency of the  needs resulting from the hurricane. GSA also noted that the  subcontracting plan requirement is one it did not address when it waived  certain procurement rules in early September 2005 during the emergency  response. One reason GSA did not extend these waivers to the  requirement for subcontracting plans is that, in the judgment of GSA  procurement officials, there are no provisions or flexibility in the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that would have given them the authority,  even in an emergency situation such as the response to Hurricane Katrina,  to deviate from subcontracting plan requirements. We agree with GSA\u2019s  conclusion that the FAR currently does not specifically permit agencies to  waive the requirement for an approved subcontracting plan prior to  contract award. This is because the FAR requirement is based on the Small  Business Act, which does not provide for an agency to waive the  subcontracting plan requirement or allow deferral of it until after the  agency has awarded a contract. As a result of our findings and the lack of  flexibility GSA determined the FAR has on subcontracting plan  requirements, GSA plans to raise the issue of emergency processes with  the FAR Council.", "DOD\u2019s Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, in the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics, concurred with our recommendations (see app. IV) and noted  that the department plans to issue a policy memorandum in 2007  containing the guidance we recommend. Additionally, DOD indicated it  would direct review officials for each of its military departments and other  defense agencies to include subcontracting guidance and compliance as a  special interest item in the periodic oversight reviews they conduct of the  organizations within each department or agency.

Specifically, we obtained data on contracts  awarded through funds from two of the three operating administrations of  the DBE program\u2014the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The third operating  administration, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), did not provide  us with any data since FTA funds were not used to award contracts related  to Katrina reconstruction or recovery projects during the time frame that  we examined. For contracts awarded with FHWA funds, we obtained  contract data from each state department of transportation. For contracts  awarded with FAA funds, we obtained contract data from FAA\u2019s Southern  and Southwestern regional offices, which compiled data from the various  airports in the three states. The contract data we obtained for contracts  funded with FHWA and FAA funds included information on DBE  participation as either prime contractors or subcontractors, and the  amounts awarded to DBEs, among other data fields.
