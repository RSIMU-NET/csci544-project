The proposed request is expected to fund 101,080 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff years, an increase of 1,179 FTEs over 2002. In addition to the increase of 1,179 FTEs, IRS identified internal savings that it expects will allow 2,287 FTEs to be redirected to higher- priority areas. To identify these savings, IRS used its recently implemented strategic planning, budgeting, and performance management process. This process is designed to reconcile competing priorities and initiatives with the realities of available resources. We commend IRS for using this process to reassess the allocation of resources in its base budget for 2003. With respect to IRS\u2019s request, our statement makes the following points: IRS\u2019s plans for hiring and redirecting staff depend on several assumptions that could be optimistic\u2014a natural result, to some extent, of the fact that budgets are prepared so far in advance of the fiscal year involved. These assumptions include (1) labor and nonlabor savings of 2,287 staff years and $157.5 million identified by IRS operating units and (2) additional savings of $38.5 million resulting from better business practices that have not yet been identified. Also, IRS may face some unanticipated expenses, such as a larger civilian pay raise than proposed by the administration, that could, if not funded, affect IRS\u2019s financial plan for 2003. Unrealized savings or unexpected expenses could lead to cutbacks in planned hiring\u2014cutbacks that historically have hit IRS\u2019s enforcement programs the hardest.", "IRS\u2019s congressional justification does not always provide an adequate link between the resources being requested and IRS\u2019s performance goals.

The Subcommittee may want to pursue these issues with IRS.", "Although IRS provided adequate support to justify the $450 million request for its multiyear capital account for business systems modernization, it did not adequately support $1.63 billion of the $1.68 billion requested for its information systems. The $1.63 billion is for the operation and maintenance of existing (legacy) systems. We are recommending to IRS that it prepare its fiscal year 2004 information systems budget request in accordance with the practices of leading private and public sector organizations.", "Our testimony on the 2002 filing season presents interim data on IRS\u2019s performance in processing returns and helping taxpayers who call IRS or walk into an IRS office. The following two themes predominate:   So far this filing season, IRS has processed returns smoothly, with one major exception, and seen continued growth in electronic filing. The one exception to smooth processing has been the large number of errors taxpayers are making related to the rate reduction credit. IRS has had to correct millions of returns with errors related to the credit, and taxpayers\u2019 calls about the credit have greatly increased the demand on IRS\u2019s toll-free assistance lines, likely causing IRS\u2019s overall level of telephone service to dip significantly for a few weeks during the filing season. Some of these errors may have been avoided if the instructions for the income tax forms had been clearer.", "IRS\u2019s performance measures provide useful information on which both IRS and we rely to assess its success in assisting taxpayers.

These include the 1,179 additional staff years requested in the budget and the 2,287 staff years that IRS determined could be redirected elsewhere in the organization due to projected savings from several improvement projects and workload decreases. These 3,400 staff years can make a real impact on IRS\u2019s performance if they are targeted to selected areas. However, the availability of these staff years depends on the projected savings being realized and no significant unanticipated expenses. In addition, it is difficult to evaluate the effect that these additional and redirected staff years will have on IRS\u2019s operations because the budget is not well-linked to performance goals in some important areas.", "With respect to that part of the budget request for information technology, IRS (1) did not adequately support the $1.63 billion requested for operation and maintenance of its information systems but (2) did adequately support its $450 million request for business systems modernization."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Budget Request Is Based on Several Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget request is based on several assumptions that could prove optimistic.

Also, IRS may face some unanticipated expenses that, if not funded, could cause it to revise its financial plan for fiscal year 2003. In many respects, this kind of uncertainty is the natural result of a process that requires the development of budget estimates many months before the fiscal year in question.

Examples include (1) saving over $67 million from re-engineering and quality improvement efforts, such as consolidating form printing and distribution operations and updating an antiquated workload selection system to reduce or eliminate the substantial number of tax returns that are ordered but never audited, and (2) reducing the resources used for the innocent spouse program by $13.8 million due to an expected decrease in caseload.", "We commend IRS for taking the initiative to reassess the allocation of resources in its base budget. However, the congressional justification submitted by IRS in support of its budget request does not explain how IRS developed the labor and nonlabor savings. IRS provided us with information on the overall method used to develop the savings and explained that, in a change from IRS\u2019s previously used top-down process, operating units determined the resource increases and decreases their programs needed. However, IRS did not provide details on how specific savings were computed, such as information on any assumptions used in developing specific estimates.", "In response to the secretary of the Treasury\u2019s challenge for each Treasury bureau to review all programmatic efforts and reduce or remove those producing little or no value, IRS officials estimated that such a review could save $38.5 million.

Accordingly, the congressional justification provides no details on how the $38.5 million will be achieved.", "Any shortfall in the estimated labor and nonlabor savings or in savings from efforts to reduce or eliminate programs will only be exacerbated if IRS has to absorb unanticipated budget increases. For example, IRS officials estimated that it would cost an additional $69 million if the civilian pay raise included in this budget was increased to achieve parity with the proposed pay raise for the military. In fiscal year 2002, IRS faced unbudgeted cost increases related to rent, pay raises, security, and postage rate increases. As a result, IRS had to delay hiring revenue agents and officers, tax compliance officers, and tax specialists. According to IRS, \u201cthe lack of full funding for non-labor inflation over the years has greatly reduced the IRS ability to cover pay raise costs and other legitimate cost increases by reducing non-labor costs, leaving the IRS with the sole alternative of reducing staff.\u201d IRS noted that \u201cthese budget constraints forced the IRS to reduce 1,364 FTEs in the  2002 plan.\u201d Although we do not have specific evidence of how this FTE reduction affected IRS\u2019s operations, IRS data does indicate that the number of revenue agent FTEs in its current financial plan for fiscal year 2002 (11,836) is 691 fewer than the actual revenue agent FTEs in fiscal year 2000 (12,527)\u2014despite funding of an initiative in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 that, among other things, was to increase the number of revenue agent FTEs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Justification Not Always Well-Linked to Performance Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to establish linkages between resources and results.

In February 2002, the commissioner of Internal Revenue identified four such areas: (1) misuse of devices, such as trusts and passthroughs, to hide income; (2) use of complex and abusive corporate tax shelters to reduce taxes improperly; (3) failure to file and pay large accumulations of employment taxes; and (4) erroneous refund claims, which include claims made under the Earned Income Credit (EIC) program. The budget request includes increased resources for compliance but, except for the EIC program, it is unclear from IRS\u2019s congressional justification how many resources IRS intends to devote to each of these problems. And, for none of these areas, including the EIC program, does the congressional justification include performance measures and goals that Congress can use to assess IRS\u2019s progress in addressing these major compliance problems.", "IRS\u2019s congressional justification is clear about the amount of resources IRS plans to devote to EIC compliance efforts because the budget request calls for the continuation of a separate appropriation for that program. If approved, it will be the sixth year of targeted funding for the EIC program. IRS\u2019s compliance efforts under this program have prevented the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of improper EIC claims. However, the most recent IRS information shows that the rate of EIC noncompliance is still very high. According to IRS\u2019s report on its analysis of EIC compliance rates on tax year 1999 returns filed in 2000, (1) about one-half of the 18.8 million returns on which taxpayers claimed the EIC involved overclaims and (2) of the estimated $31.3 billion in EIC claims made by taxpayers who filed returns in 2000, between $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion should not have been paid.", "Audit coverage is another area where performance goals would help Congress assess IRS\u2019s progress. IRS states in its congressional justification that it will increase the resources for stabilizing audit rates by 368 FTEs and $24 million.

Some of those inconsistencies might suggest that additional resources beyond those identified by IRS are available for redirection. Specific examples of inconsistencies include the following:   A requested increase of 476 staff years and $20.7 million for \u201cincreased Offer-in-Compromise cases\u201d is inconsistent with IRS\u2019s performance goal for that program, which shows that the number of cases processed is expected to decrease from 185,000 in 2002 to 104,600 in fiscal year 2003. This requested increase also conflicts with our recent evaluation of the program that shows that IRS projected that the number of staff years needed would decrease from 1,818 in fiscal year 2002 to 1,224 in fiscal year 2003. In response to our question about this, IRS officials said that the staff year increase is to replace revenue officers who currently handle the cases so there is not a net increase in staff years for the offer program. This does not help explain why IRS is asking for an increase in resources when the workload is expected to decline and IRS had projected a decreased need for staff in the program.", "According to IRS\u2019s budget request, the field and electronic/correspondence exam units will receive about the same number of staff years as the year before, while in terms of dollars, the field exam unit will receive an increase of less than 3 percent and the electronic/correspondence unit will receive an increase of about 7 percent. However, IRS\u2019s performance measures show the field exam unit is expected to examine 33 percent more individual returns and almost 35 percent more business returns while the electronic/correspondence unit is expected to increase the number of correspondence examinations by 32 percent. It is not clear from the congressional justification how IRS expects to do so much more work with just a small increase in resources. IRS told us that one reason for the apparent inconsistency is that correspondence audits run on a 2- year cycle, with a high number of case starts in one year and a large number of case closures in the next year.", "IRS\u2019 budget request includes an additional 197 staff years and $8.3 million for processing a projected growth in the total number of primary returns filed from about 225.9 million returns in fiscal year 2202 to about 230.0 returns in fiscal year 2003. However, according to IRS\u2019s performance measures, that projected growth is the net of an increase of about 7.6 million returns filed electronically and a decrease of about 3.4 million returns filed on paper. That decline in the more costly to process paper returns would seem to argue against the need for additional processing resources. In response to our question about this, IRS acknowledged that the number of paper returns was expected to decline but said, nonetheless, that its computation of the number of additional FTEs needed was \u201cbased on an estimate of direct hours needed to process expected paper returns.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue for Congressional Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Because the congressional justification provides inadequate information to explain the apparent inconsistencies discussed in the preceding section and because, in some respects, those inconsistencies suggest that additional resources might be available for redirection to other purposes, the Subcommittee may want to ask IRS for additional information in support of those parts of its budget request."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Justification for Information Technology Budget Request Needs Improvement", "paragraphs": ["IRS is requesting $2.13 billion and 7,449 staff years in information technology (IT) resources for fiscal year 2003.

This justification should reasonably demonstrate how proposed investments support agency mission operations and provide positive business value in terms of expected costs, benefits, and risks.", "Since the BSM appropriation was established in fiscal year 1998, we have consistently reported that IRS has not developed adequate justification for its budget requests, and we have proposed that Congress consider reducing them. During this same time, we have repeatedly recommendedthat IRS put in place an enterprise architecture (modernization blueprint) to guide and constrain its business system investments. Use of such a blueprint is a practice of leading public and private sector organizations. Simply stated, this architecture provides a high-level roadmap for business and technological change from which agencies can logically and justifiably derive their budget requests and capital investment plans. In response, IRS has developed various versions of an enterprise architecture, which we have continued to review and make recommendations for improvement in. IRS recently approved a new version of this architecture (version 2.0), which, based on a briefing to us and others, appears to provide robust descriptions of IRS\u2019s current and target business and technology environments. IRS has also drafted, and executive management is reviewing, the associated high-level transition plan that identifies and conceptually justifies needed investments to guide the agency\u2019s transition over many years from its current to its target architectural state.", "IRS\u2019s $450 million request is based on its enterprise architecture as well as related life cycle management and investment management process disciplines for its ongoing project investments. As such, this request is grounded in analyses that meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for requesting multiyear capital investment funding.", "Pursuant to statute, funds from the BSM account are not available for obligation until IRS submits to the congressional appropriations committees for approval an expenditure plan that meets certain conditions. In November 2001, IRS submitted its fifth expenditure plan seeking approval to obligate the $391 million remaining in the BSM account at that time. In briefings to the relevant appropriations subcommittees and IRS, we reported our concerns about the escalating risk that IRS will be unable to deliver promised BSM system capabilities on time and within budget due to the number and complexity of ongoing and planned systems acquisition projects and the continued lack of certain key modernization management controls and capabilities.", "In approving the expenditure plan, the appropriations subcommittees directed IRS to reconsider the scope and pace specified in the November 2001 expenditure plan to ensure that the number and complexity of modernization projects underway is commensurate with IRS\u2019s management capacity and fully establish and implement all process controls needed to effectively manage the modernization effort prior to the submission of IRS\u2019s next expenditure plan.", "In response to these and other concerns raised by the appropriations committees and us, IRS has committed to aligning the pace of the BSM program with the maturity of the organization\u2019s management controls and management capacity and is currently conducting a reassessment of the projects it plans to deploy during fiscal year 2002.

By using these proven investment management approaches for budget formulation, agencies have a systematic method, based on risk and return on investment, to justify what are typically very substantial operations and maintenance budget requests. These approaches also provide a way to hold IT managers accountable for operations and maintenance spending and the ongoing efficiency and efficacy of existing systems.", "IRS did not develop its information systems request in accordance with these best practices of leading organizations. In particular, the largest elements of IRS\u2019s budget request are not projects or systems. Rather, they are requests for staffing levels or other services. For example, IRS is requesting $240 million for staff and equipment supporting operations and maintenance of desktop computers agencywide, as well as $111 million for staff and equipment supporting its major computing centers\u2019 operations. Further, it is requesting $266 million for telecommunications services contracts. Taken together, these three initiatives constitute about 38 percent of the total $1.63 billion being requested for operations and maintenance, but the budget request gives no indication regarding how these initiatives are allocated to systems. In addition, in developing these requests, IRS did not identify and assess the relative costs, benefits, and risks of specific projects or systems in these areas. Instead, according to IRS officials, they simply took what was spent last year in the categories and added the money to fund cost-of-living and salary increases.", "IRS officials responsible for developing the IT operations and maintenance budget attributed the differences between IRS practices and those followed by leading organizations to the lack of an adequate cost accounting system, cultural resistance to change, and a previous lack of management priority. To better justify future budget requests, these officials said that they have assessed the strengths and weaknesses of IRS\u2019s budgeting and investment management processes against our IT investment management framework and found significant weaknesses in 15 critical areas. To address the weaknesses, IRS is currently developing capital planning guidance based on our IT investment management framework. This guidance is to be issued by late summer 2002, but a schedule for implementing it has yet to be determined. In addition, IRS has adopted and is in the process of implementing a cost model that is to enable it to account for the full costs of operations and maintenance projects and determine how effectively IRS projects are achieving program goals and mission needs. IRS plans to have the cost model in place and operational by June 30 of this year so that it can validate its fiscal year 2003 information systems appropriation request and begin using it to develop the fiscal year 2004 request.", "The key to making these plans reality is overcoming the very reasons that have allowed this budgetary formulation and justification weakness to continue unabated\u2014accounting system limitations, cultural resistance, and low management priority. Although IRS has initiated actions to address these weaknesses, we are concerned whether they will be implemented in time to have meaningful impact on formulation of the fiscal year 2004 budget request. For example, IRS has not yet developed a plan and schedule for implementing its IT capital planning guidance. In addition, IRS officials told us that they are already beginning the process to develop the fiscal year 2004 budget.

In that regard, the instructions indicate that if a taxpayer received\u2014 before any offset\u2014an amount equal to either $600, $500, or $300 based on his or her filing status, the taxpayer is not entitled to a rate reduction credit. There is no further explanation of the term \u201cbefore any offset\u201d\u2014a term that may be unclear to many taxpayers. However, IRS\u2019s Web site spells out more clearly what is meant by this term, explaining that if taxpayers had their advance payment offset to pay back taxes, other government debts, or past due child support, they cannot claim the rate reduction credit for the amount that was offset. Although the Web site includes this more descriptive information, there is no guarantee that a given taxpayer either has access to or will use the Web site. In retrospect, including the same explanation of \u201cbefore any offset\u201d in the instructions would have made the instructions clearer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Electronic Filing Continues to Grow, but not at a Pace to Achieve IRS\u2019s Long- Range Goal", "paragraphs": ["Another step IRS took that has reduced its error-correction workload due to the rate reduction credit was to begin rejecting electronic submissions that involved certain types of errors related to the credit. By doing so, IRS required the taxpayer or return preparer to correct the error before IRS would accept the electronic return. This is consistent with IRS\u2019s traditional practice of rejecting electronic submissions that contain other errors, such as incorrect Social Security numbers. IRS began rejecting electronic submissions with errors involving the rate reduction credit around the beginning of February. As of March 24, 2002, IRS had rejected about 226,000 such submissions.", "We do not know whether these rejected submissions caused potential electronic filers to file instead on paper. However, as shown in table 2, the number of individual income tax returns filed electronically as of March 29, 2002, has grown by 14.0 percent\u2014an increase over the rate of growth at the same time last year. While this kind of increase is not insignificant, IRS will need larger increases in the future if it is to achieve its goal of having 80 percent of all individual income tax returns filed electronically by 2007.", "To encourage more electronic filing in 2002, IRS, among other things   mailed letters to about 250,000 tax professionals, asking those who had been filing electronically to continue supporting the program and encouraging others to file electronically;   mailed about 23 million postcards to certain taxpayers, such as those who had received TeleFile packages in the past 2 years but did not file their tax returns via TeleFile, alerting them to the benefits of electronic filing; and   made changes to one program that enabled electronic filers to sign their returns using a personal identification number (PIN) and reinstituted another PIN-based signature program.", "IRS also redirected its marketing efforts to encourage persons who have been preparing tax returns on a computer but filing on paper to file electronically. Considering that about 40 million computer-prepared returns were filed on paper in 2001, conversion of those returns to electronic filings could go a long way toward helping IRS achieve its 80- percent goal. In our report on the 2001 filing season, we recommended that IRS directly survey tax professionals and taxpayers who file computer-prepared returns on paper to get more specific information on why they are not filing electronically. We have been told that IRS will be undertaking such a survey in the near future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Experienced Some Improvements in Telephone Service, but the Rate Reduction Credit Is Likely Affecting Taxpayers\u2019 Access", "paragraphs": ["So far this filing season, taxpayers in the queue for telephone assistance are spending less time waiting to talk with an assistor and are getting accurate answers to their tax law questions more often than last year. At the same time, however, the overall rate at which callers are reaching an assistor is lower because many callers are unable to get into the queue for assistance.", "Telephone assistance is a significant part of IRS\u2019s work. This fiscal year, IRS expects to answer about 108 million telephone calls, about 72 million to be answered via automated services and about 34 million to be answered by about 10,000 full-and part-time telephone assistors, called customer service representatives. Accordingly, the ease with which taxpayers reach IRS by telephone and the accuracy of the assistance they receive are important indicators of how well IRS is performing. IRS\u2019s performance in providing this service has been a perennial problem, and its struggles to improve service have been a topic at hearings held by this Subcommittee for many years.

IRS has established a set of measures to focus efforts on enhancing taxpayers\u2019 access to accurate assistance. As shown in table 3, some of these measures indicate significant improvements in taxpayer service when compared to the same period last year. For example, during the first 11 weeks of the 2002 filing season, taxpayers, on average, waited a minute-and-a-half less to speak to an assistor, there was an 18 percentage point improvement in taxpayers reaching assistors in 30 seconds or less, and the quality of tax law assistance, which involves following IRS procedures and providing accurate responses, improved about 11 percentage points.", "However, there was a 5-point decline in the percentage of callers that attempted to reach an assistor and actually got through and received service (referred to as the customer service representive (CSR) level of service). According to IRS officials, an increased demand for assistance related to the rate reduction credit has been a key factor affecting taxpayer access to assistors. (See appendix I for more detail on the level of access this filing season compared to last and the likely impact of the rate reduction credit.) The increased call volume was not allowed to lengthen the queue. Instead, taxpayers were provided access to automated services, which often results in callers hanging up, or were advised by a recorded message that IRS could not provide assistance.", "According to IRS officials, several IRS efforts have contributed to improvements in telephone performance. For example, IRS implemented a strategy to improve tax law accuracy that included hiring and training assistors earlier than in past years and putting them on the telephones in December to help hone their skills before the filing season began. IRS also required assistors to be certified that they successfully completed necessary training and could accurately answer calls in their assigned topics and used its computer-based call routing system to help ensure that assistors answered calls only in those topics for which they had been certified.", "Some officials opined that improvements in accessibility may be linked to IRS\u2019s efforts to establish new performance measures and goals for the call sites this year. For example, each site has a goal for the total number of calls its assistors are to answer in a fiscal year. IRS officials say the new measures have led to improved performance by giving the call sites a clearer understanding of what they are expected to achieve and how their performance helps IRS achieve its goals. IRS executives in the Wage and Investment and Small Business/Self-Employed divisions said that they believe that IRS has been successful in getting employees at all levels of the telephone service organizations to understand and accept the measures and contribute to achieving the goals.", "IRS officials cited several other service improvement efforts as potentially boosting performance, including initiatives to bring more highly skilled employees on board, increased specialization at the assistor and call site levels, and reduced hours of service to increase the number of assistors available to answer phone calls during the hours when most taxpayers call IRS. We will monitor these and other factors that may have affected IRS\u2019s telephone service as we continue to assess the 2002 filing season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Performance Measures Provide Useful Information on Some Aspects of Its Telephone Service but Not on Others", "paragraphs": ["Although IRS\u2019s telephone performance measures provide useful information on some aspects of service to taxpayers, the measures miss other aspects.

For example, as of March 16, 2002, according to IRS data, over 7.2 million callers had hung up when listening to the menu this filing season\u2014almost three times greater than the number that hung up last year. IRS officials said it is unclear why more taxpayers were hanging up.
