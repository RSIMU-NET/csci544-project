For example, from 1995 through 2005, delinquency caseloads for girls in juvenile justice courts nationwide increased 15 percent while boys' caseloads decreased by 12 percent. More recently, in 2007, 29 percent of juvenile arrests--about 641,000 arrests--involved girls, who accounted for 17 percent of juvenile violent crime arrests and 35 percent of juvenile property crime arrests. Further, research on girls has highlighted that delinquent girls have higher rates of mental health problems than delinquent boys, receive fewer special services, and are more likely to abandon treatment programs. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) is the Department of Justice (DOJ) office charged with providing national leadership, coordination, and resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization. OJJDP supports states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective programs to, among other things, prevent delinquency and intervene after a juvenile has offended. For example, from fiscal years 2007 through 2009, Congress provided OJJDP almost $1.1 billion to use for grants to states, localities, and organizations for a variety of juvenile justice programs, including programs for girls. Also, in support of this mission, the office funds research and program evaluations related to a variety of juvenile justice issues. As programs have been developed at the state and local levels in recent years that specifically target preventing girls' delinquency or intervening after girls have become involved in the juvenile justice system, it is important that agencies providing grants and practitioners operating the programs have information about which of these programs are effective. In this way, agencies can help to ensure that limited federal, state, and local funds are well spent. In general, effectiveness is determined through program evaluations, which are systematic studies conducted to assess how well a program is working--that is, whether a program produced its intended effects. To help ensure that grant funds are being used effectively, you asked us to review OJJDP's efforts related to studying and promoting effective girls' delinquency programs. We issued a report on the results of that review on July 24, 2009.

For our report, we reviewed documentation about OJJDP\u2019s  establishment of a study group to assess the effectiveness of girl\u2019s  delinquency programs, analyzed the groups\u2019 activities and findings, and  interviewed OJJDP research and program officials and the current and  former principal investigators of the study group. Specifically, we  reviewed the criteria the study group used to assess studies of girls\u2019  delinquency programs and whether the group\u2019s application of those  criteria was consistent with generally accepted social science standards  for evaluation research. We also compared OJJDP\u2019s efforts with criteria in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, specifically  that agency management should ensure that there are adequate means of  obtaining information from and communicating with external stakeholders  who may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals, such  as practitioners operating programs or researchers assessing programs. In  addition, we conducted interviews with 18 girls\u2019 delinquency subject  matter experts, that is, researchers and practitioners, whom we selected  on the basis of their knowledge and experience with girls\u2019 delinquency  issues. While their comments cannot be generalized to all girls\u2019  delinquency experts, we nonetheless believe that their views gave us  useful insights on issues related to girls\u2019 delinquency and OJJDP\u2019s efforts  to assess girls\u2019 programs.

To meet  OJJDP\u2019s objectives, among other activities, the Study Group identified  studies of delinquency programs that specifically targeted girls by  reviewing over 1,000 documents in relevant research areas. These included  criminological and feminist explanations for girls\u2019 delinquency, patterns of  delinquency, and the justice system\u2019s response to girls\u2019 delinquency. As a  result, the group identified 61 programs that specifically targeted  preventing or responding to girls\u2019 delinquency. Then, the group assessed  the methodological quality of the studies of the programs that had been  evaluated using a set of criteria developed by DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice  Programs (OJP) called What Works to determine whether the studies  provided credible evidence that the programs were effective at preventing  or responding to girls\u2019 delinquency.

In addition, OJJDP\u2019s efforts to involve practitioners in Study Group  activities and disseminate findings were also consistent with the internal  control standard to communicate with external stakeholders, such as  practitioners operating programs.", "According to OJJDP research and program officials, they formed the Study  Group rather than funding individual studies of programs because study  groups provide a cost-effective method of gaining an overview of the  available research in an issue area. As part of its work, the group  collected, reviewed, and analyzed the methodological quality of research  on girls\u2019 delinquency programs. The use of such a group, including its  review, is an acceptable approach for systematically identifying and  reviewing research conducted in a field of study. This review helped  consolidate the research and provide information to OJJDP for  determining evaluation priorities. Further, we reviewed the criteria the  group used to assess the studies and found that they adhere to generally  accepted social science standards for evaluation research. We also  generally concurred with the group\u2019s assessments of the programs based  on these criteria. According to the group\u2019s former principal investigator,  the Study Group decided to use OJP\u2019s What Works criteria to ensure that  its assessment of program effectiveness would be based on highly rigorous  evaluation standards, thus eliminating the potential that a program that  may do harm would be endorsed by the group. However, 8 of the 18  experts we interviewed said that the criteria created an unrealistically high  standard, which caused the group to overlook potentially promising  programs. OJJDP officials stated that despite such concerns, they  approved the group\u2019s use of the criteria because of the methodological  rigor of the framework and their goal for the group to identify effective  programs.", "In accordance with the internal control standard to communicate with  external stakeholders, OJJDP sought to ensure a range of stakeholder  perspectives related to girls\u2019 delinquency by requiring that Study Group  members possess knowledge and experience with girls\u2019 delinquency and  demonstrate expertise in relevant social science disciplines. The initial  Study Group, which was convened by the research institute and approved  by OJJDP, included 12 academic researchers and 1 practitioner; someone  with experience implementing girls\u2019 delinquency programs. However, 11 of  the 18 experts we interviewed stated that this composition was  imbalanced in favor of academic researchers. In addition, 6 of the 11 said  that the composition led the group to focus its efforts on researching  theories of girls\u2019 delinquency rather than gathering and disseminating  actionable information for practitioners. According to OJJDP research  and program officials, they acted to address this issue by adding a second  practitioner as a member and involving two other practitioners in study  group activities. OJJDP officials stated that they plan to more fully involve  practitioners from the beginning when they organize study groups in the  future and to include practitioners in the remaining activities of the Study  Group, such as presenting successful girls\u2019 delinquency program practices  at a national conference. Also, in accordance with the internal control  standard, OJJDP and the Study Group have disseminated findings to the  research community, practitioners in the girls\u2019 delinquency field, and the  public through conference presentations, Web site postings, and published  bulletins.

For the 17 programs that had been studied, the Study Group  reported that none of the studies provided conclusive evidence with which  to determine whether the programs were effective at preventing or  reducing girls\u2019 delinquency. For example, according to the Study Group,  the studies provided insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of 11 of the  17 programs because, for instance, the studies involved research designs  that could not demonstrate whether any positive outcomes, such as  reduced delinquency, were due to program participation rather than other  factors. Based on the results of this review, the Study Group reported that  among other things, there is a need for additional, methodologically  rigorous evaluations of girls\u2019 delinquency programs; training and technical  assistance to help programs prepare for evaluations; and funding to  support girls\u2019 delinquency programs found to be promising.", "According to OJJDP officials, in response to the Study Group\u2019s finding  about the need to better prepare programs for evaluation, the office plans  to work with the group and use the remaining funding from the effort\u2014 approximately $300,000\u2014to provide a technical assistance workshop by  the end of October 2009. The workshop is intended to help approximately  10 girls\u2019 delinquency programs prepare for evaluation by providing  information about how evaluations are designed and conducted and how  to collect data that will be useful for program evaluators in assessing  outcomes, among other things. In addition, OJJDP officials stated that as a  result of the Study Group\u2019s findings, along with feedback they received  from members of the girls\u2019 delinquency field, OJJDP plans to issue a  solicitation in fiscal year 2010 for funding to support evaluations of girls\u2019  delinquency programs.", "OJJDP has also reported that the Study Group\u2019s findings are to provide a  foundation for moving ahead on a comprehensive program related to girls\u2019  delinquency. However, OJJDP has not developed a plan that is  documented, is shared with key stakeholders, and includes specific  funding requirements and commitments and time frames for meeting its  girls\u2019 delinquency goals. Standard practices for program and project  management state that specific desired outcomes or results should be  conceptualized, defined, and documented in the planning process as part  of a road map, along with the appropriate projects needed to achieve those  results, supporting resources, and milestones. In addition, government  internal control standards call for policies and procedures that establish  adequate communication with stakeholders as essential for achieving  desired program goals. According to OJJDP officials, they have not  developed a plan for meeting their girls\u2019 delinquency goals because the  office is in transition and is in the process of developing a plan for its  juvenile justice programs, but the office is taking steps to address its  girls\u2019 delinquency goals, for example, through the technical assistance  workshop. Developing a plan for girls\u2019 delinquency would help OJJDP to  demonstrate leadership to the girls\u2019 delinquency field by clearly  articulating the actions it intends to take to meet its goals and would also  help the office to ensure that the goals are met.", "In our July report, we recommended that to help ensure that OJJDP meets  its goals to identify effective or promising girls\u2019 delinquency programs and  supports the development of program models, the Administrator of OJJDP  develop and document a plan that (1) articulates how the office intends to  respond to the findings of the Study Group, (2) includes time frames and  specific funding requirements and commitments, and (3) is shared with  key stakeholders. OJP agreed with our recommendation and outlined  efforts that OJJDP plans to undertake in response to these findings. For  example, OJJDP stated that it anticipates publishing its proposed juvenile  justice program plan, which is to include how it plans to address girls\u2019  delinquency issues, in the Federal Register to solicit public feedback and  comments, which will enable the office to publish a final plan in the  Federal Register by the end of the year (December 31, 2009).", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
