The amended compacts provide the countries with a combined total of $3.6 billion from 2004 to 2023, with the annual grants declining gradually. The assistance, targeting six sectors, is aimed at assisting the countries' efforts to promote economic advancement and budgetary self-reliance. The Department of the Interior (Interior) administers and oversees the assistance. Complying with a legislative requirement, GAO examined, for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, (1) the FSM's and the RMI's use of compact funds, (2) their efforts to assess progress toward development goals, (3) their monitoring of sector grants and accountability for compact funds, and (4) Interior's administrative oversight of the assistance. GAO visited the FSM and the RMI; reviewed reports; and interviewed officials from the FSM, RMI, and U.S. governments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For 2004 through 2006, compact assistance to the FSM and the RMI was allocated largely to the education, infrastructure, and health sectors, but various factors limited the countries' use of compact funds. Deterrents to the FSM's use of infrastructure funds included constraints on land use and disagreement on project implementation processes. Land use issues also hindered the RMI's use of infrastructure funds. In addition, the FSM's distribution of the grants among its four states resulted in significant differences in per-student education and per-capita health funding. Neither country has planned for long-term sustainability of the grant programs, taking into account the annual decreases in grant funding. To assess progress toward development goals, the FSM and the RMI established goals and objectives for each sector and are collecting performance data for education and health. However, a lack of complete and reliable baseline data prevents the countries from gauging progress in these sectors. Also, both countries' required quarterly performance reports contained incomplete and unreliable information, limiting the reports' utility for tracking progress. The countries' ability to measure progress is further challenged by a lack of technical capacity to collect, assemble, and analyze baseline and performance data. Although the FSM and the RMI are required to monitor day-to-day sector grant operations, their ability to meet this requirement for 2004 through 2006 was limited. According to officials in the respective governments, the responsible offices have insufficient staff, budgets, and time to monitor grant operations. In addition, both countries' single audit reports for 2004 and 2005 indicated weaknesses in their ability to account for the use of compact funds. For instance, the FSM's audit report for 2005 contained 57 findings of material weaknesses and reportable conditions in the national and state governments' financial statements for sector grants, and the RMI's report contained 2 such findings. Furthermore, both countries' single audit reports indicated noncompliance with requirements of major federal programs. For example, the FSM's audit report for 2005 contained 45 findings of noncompliance, while the RMI's audit report contained 11 findings. Interior's Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) has conducted administrative oversight of the sector grants by monitoring the countries' sector grant performance and spending, assessing their compliance with sector grant conditions, and monitoring the audit process. In response to shortcomings that it identified, OIA took several actions, such as withholding or suspending grant funding and ensuring the provision of technical assistance. However, OIA's oversight has been limited by the need to deal with challenges facing the FSM, such as its difficulty in preparing budgets, as well as by its own staffing challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From 1987 through 2003, the United States provided $2.1 billion in  economic assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the  Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) through a Compact of Free  Association. In 2000, we reported that the U.S., FSM, and RMI governments  had provided limited accountability over spending, and that U.S. assistance  had resulted in little economic development in both countries. In 2003, the  U.S. government approved amended compacts with the FSM and the RMI.

The  first and second goals were met; the FSM and the RMI are independent  nations, and the three countries established key defense rights, including  securing U.S. access to military facilities on Kwajalein Atoll in the RMI  through 2016. The compact\u2019s third goal was to be accomplished primarily  through U.S. direct financial assistance to the FSM and the RMI. For the  15-year period covering 1987 to 2001, funding was provided at levels that  decreased every 5 years, with an extension for 2002 and 2003 during  negotiations to renew expiring compact provisions. For 1987 through 2003,  the FSM and the RMI are estimated to have received about $2.1 billion in  compact financial assistance. As we previously reported, economic  self-sufficiency was not achieved under the first compact.", "Under the original compact, the FSM and the RMI used funds for general  government operations; capital projects, such as building roads and  investing in businesses; debt payments; and targeted sectors, such as  energy and communications. The FSM concentrated much of its spending  on government activities, while the RMI emphasized capital spending.  Compact funds to the FSM were divided among the FSM\u2019s national  government and four states, according to a distribution agreement first  agreed to by the five governments in 1984. In 2000, we reported that  compact funds spent on general government operations maintained high  government wages and a high level of public sector employment,  discouraging private sector growth, and that compact funds used to create  and improve infrastructure likewise did not contribute to significant economic growth. Furthermore, many of the projects undertaken by the  FSM and the RMI experienced problems because of poor planning and  management, inadequate construction and maintenance, or misuse of  funds. While the compact set out specific obligations for reporting and  consultations regarding the use of compact funds, the FSM, RMI, and U.S.  governments provided little accountability over compact expenditures and  did not ensure that funds were spent effectively or efficiently. The \u201cfull  faith and credit\u201d provision made withholding funds impracticable. In  addition, under the original compact, both nations also benefited from  numerous U.S. federal programs, while citizens of both nations exercised  their right under the compact to live and work in the United States as  \u201cnonimmigrants\u201d and to stay for long periods of time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amended Compacts of Free Association: 2004 through 2023", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, the United States approved separate amended compacts with the  FSM and the RMI that went into effect on June 25, 2004, and May 1, 2004,  respectively.

JEMCO approved allocations for the education sector  amounting to $79 million, or 34 percent of compact funds in 2004  through 2006. U.S. assistance is the main source of revenue for the FSM  education system. At the FSM national government level, compact  funding supports, among other things, the College of Micronesia, the  development of national education standards, the national standardized  testing program, and the college admissions test. At the state level, the  funding is principally targeted to primary and secondary education.  Compact funding levels vary among the FSM states, with Chuuk  receiving the least funding per student (approximately $500) and Yap  receiving the most (approximately $1,300). The difference in the funding  levels for these two states is directly reflected in student-to-teacher  ratios, with Chuuk having a higher student-to-teacher ratio (19:1) than  Yap (8:1). Overall, we found the condition of school facilities and the  adequacy of their supplies and equipment to be poorer in Chuuk than in  the other FSM states. The FSM is making efforts to improve teacher  qualifications through a grant from Education. Despite some progress,  FSM educational outcomes remain poor. For example, according to an  official from the FSM\u2019s Department of Health, Education, and Social  Affairs, graduates of FSM high schools often are not qualified to take  college-level courses.", "Health. JEMCO approved allocations amounting to $49 million, or 21  percent of compact funds in 2004 through 2006, for health care activities  such as medical and nursing services, dispensary services, and public  health services. According to health officials in Chuuk and Pohnpei,  funding under the amended compact provided for increased budgets for  pharmaceuticals and supplies. However, a 2005 FSM Department of  Health, Education, and Social Affairs assessment of primary care  reported that most facilities lacked an appropriate range and quantity of  medicine and supplies in each of the four FSM states. We found that  each of the states\u2019 hospitals and primary care facilities lacked some or  all of the following: maintenance, adequately trained staff, functional  equipment, and medical and pharmaceutical supplies. In addition, health  sector allocations varied considerably across the four FSM state  governments. For example, in 2006 Yap received more than twice as  much health sector funding per person as Chuuk.

In addition, the FSM has not completed any  infrastructure projects. As of November 2006, OIA had approved 14 of  the FSM\u2019s priority projects, including several schools, a wastewater  treatment facility, power and water distribution systems, and road and  airport improvements.

About 12 percent of these  funds supported the operations of the public auditors\u2019 offices in three of  the four states and the FSM national government. OIA found that this  use of the funds met the grant\u2019s purpose. However, according to OIA,  most of the remaining funds were to be used to support basic  government operations, rather than for the grant\u2019s intended purpose of  developing the internal expertise needed to build an effective,  accountable, and transparent government. In 2004, JEMCO required that  the FSM develop a plan to eliminate funding for such nonconforming  purposes by 2009. The FSM submitted a plan to OIA that illustrates an  annual reduction of such funding, but the plan does not detail how the  nonconforming activities, such as those supporting public safety and the  judiciary, will otherwise be funded.

Officials from the Department of  Education told us that, because most of the direct grant funding to the FSM  has been subsumed by the Special Education Grant, which is administered  by Interior, Education now has an even smaller share of the U.S. funds in  the FSM, and therefore Interior would be in the best position to invoke a  high-risk designation if warranted for a particular grant.

As we noted in both our June 2006 report and this report, the FSM\u2019s  efforts to address the decrement to date have not yielded the financial  changes, including significant tax reforms, required to address the  decrement. Therefore, we reiterate our position that the FSM needs to  develop a plan to address the decrement. If the FSM fails to address the  decrement, the federal and states\u2019 budgets will likely be reduced,  making it difficult to maintain current personnel levels. 2. We recognize that the FSM established its 70:30 formula according to its  stated goal of providing for certain needs common to each state,  regardless of population size, such as the need for airports and  seaports. However, the differences in per-capita funding resulting from  use of the formula may have contributed to disparate conditions among  the FSM states, especially in health and education, that cannot be  ignored. These differences have also been identified by a Department of  Health and Human Services official and in the FSM\u2019s own development  plans as well as in a study by the Asian Development Bank. We believe  that the formula\u2019s impact on each state\u2019s performance and development  should be continuously evaluated and the allocation of funds revised as  necessary. As we observe in this report, such an assessment requires  the full development of the mechanism for measuring sector grant  performance and collecting complete baseline data. 3.
