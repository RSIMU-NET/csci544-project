Moreover, the exchanges have not sought to verify that overseas factories comply with labor laws and regulations. A single industrywide standard for working conditions at overseas factories was not considered practical by the 10 retailers GAO contacted. However, these retailers have taken the following three steps to ensure that goods are not produced by child or forced labor: (1) developing workplace codes of conduct that reflect their expectations of suppliers; (2) disseminating information on fair and safe labor conditions and educating their employees, suppliers, and factory workers on them; and (3) using their own employees or contractors to regularly inspect factories to ensure that their codes of conduct are upheld."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The military exchanges operate retail stores similar to department stores  at 1,552 locations worldwide, selling apparel, footwear, household  appliances, jewelry, cosmetics, food, and other merchandise. Their  mission is to (1) provide quality merchandise and services for active duty  military personnel and certain other persons affiliated with U.S. armed  forces at uniformly low cost and (2) generate reasonable earnings for the  support of the Department of Defense\u2019s morale, welfare, and recreation  programs. With sales of $9 billion a year, the military exchanges, as a  group, are comparable to some of the largest general retail chains in the  nation. The military exchanges sell name brand items (such as Nike, Levi\u2019s,  and Liz Claiborne), as well as apparel and other merchandise under their  own private labels.", "Like leading retailers in the private sector, the exchanges do not  manufacture the merchandise they sell but, instead, rely on independent  suppliers, including national name brand companies, brokers and  importers, and overseas companies. With globalization, U.S. businesses  have increased their reliance on the latter\u2014importers and overseas  companies\u2014and, at the same time, have encountered a growing number of  allegations that overseas factories manufacture merchandise under  sweatshop conditions. In various countries, there are reports of worker  rights abuses (such as child labor, forced overtime work, and workplace  health and safety hazards) and of antilabor practices. Such issues have led  human rights organizations and the news media to scrutinize working  conditions at overseas factories. Because of this situation, you requested  that we examine the overseas buying practices of the Army and Air Force  Exchange. On June 20 and 21, 2001, we briefed the staff of Representatives  Cynthia McKinney and Sherrod Brown and the Morale, Welfare, and  Recreation oversight panel of the House Armed Services Committee,  respectively, on the progress of our work. As a result of our briefings, the  House Armed Services Committee Report for the Fiscal Year 2002  National Defense Authorization Act directed the Secretary of Defense to  ensure that the military exchanges implement a program to assure that  their private label merchandise is not produced by child or forced labor.", "As agreed with your office, we continued with our work to identify  industry practices that might provide a framework for or prove beneficial  to the Navy, Marine Corps, and Army and Air Force exchanges in  establishing their program. In this report, we (1) compare military  exchanges with the private sector in terms of the methods used to identify  working conditions at the overseas factories used by their private label  suppliers and (2) address whether a single industry standard exists to  promote adequate working conditions at such factories, identify the steps  the private sector has taken to promote adequate working conditions at  overseas factories that could serve as a framework for the exchanges\u2019  efforts, and identify assistance available to the exchanges to initiate steps  similar to those of the private sector.", "In conducting this review, we analyzed 10 leading private sector  companies\u2019 efforts to identify working conditions in overseas factories. We  chose seven of the companies from the National Retail Federation\u2019s list of  the 2001 Top 100 Retailers (in terms of sales) in the United States. The  retailers and their ranking on the Federation\u2019s list are Federated  Department Stores, Inc. (15); JCPenney (8); Kohl\u2019s (36); Kmart (5); The  Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (64); Sears, Roebuck and Co. (4); and Wal- Mart (1). The remaining three companies\u2014The Walt Disney Company,  Levi Strauss & Co., and Liz Claiborne, Inc.\u2014were chosen on the basis of  recommendations from government agencies, nongovernmental  organizations, and industry associations as being among the leaders in  efforts to address working conditions in overseas factories. In addition,  we interviewed officials and reviewed documents from the Departments of  State and Labor, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and  the International Labor Organization, which provided perspective on  government and industrywide efforts to address working conditions in  overseas factories. We also interviewed industry associations and labor  and human rights groups. We did not independently evaluate the private  sector programs to determine their effectiveness or to independently  verify specific allegations of worker rights abuses. Instead, our results rely  on independent analyses (such as reports from the State and Labor  Departments and the International Labor Organization), interviews with  industry associations and labor and human rights groups, and statements  made by and documentation provided by the retailers\u2019 officials.

Since 1938, the act has been amended several times, but the  essentials remain. For many years, the act (combined with federal and  state legislation regarding worker health and safety) was thought to have  played a major role in eliminating sweatshops in the United States.  However, we reported on the \u201cwidespread existence\u201d of sweatshops  within the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. Subsequent to our work,  in August 1995, the Department of Labor and the California Department of  Industrial Relations raided a garment factory in El Monte, California, and  found sweatshop working conditions\u2014workers were confined behind  razor wire fences and forced to work 20 hours a day for 70 cents an hour.  Leading retailers were found to have sold clothes made at this factory.  According to the National Retail Federation, an industry trade association,  the El Monte raid provoked a public outcry and galvanized the U.S.  government\u2019s efforts against sweatshops.", "Concern in the United States about sweatshops has spread from its shores  to the overseas factories that supply goods for U.S. businesses and the  military exchanges. With globalization, certain labor-intensive activities,  such as clothing assembly, have migrated to low-wage countries that not  only provide needed employment in those countries but also provide an  opportunity for U.S. businesses to profit from manufacturing goods abroad  and for consumers to benefit from an increasing array of quality products  at low cost. Various labor issues (such as child labor, forced overtime  work, workplace health and safety, and unionization) have emerged at  these factories. In May 2000, for example, the Chentex factory in  Nicaragua\u2014which produces much of the Army and Air Force exchange\u2019s  private label jeans and denim product\u2014interfered in a wage dispute  involving two labor groups, firing the union leaders of one of the groups.  Subsequently, much publicity ensued over working conditions at this  factory.", "International labor rights were defined in the Trade Act of 1974 as the right  of association; the right to organize and bargain collectively; a prohibition  on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; a minimum age for  the employment of children; and acceptable conditions of work with  respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and  health. As globalization progressed, U.S. government agencies,  nongovernmental organizations, industry associations, retailers, and other  private organizations began addressing worker rights issues in overseas  factories. For example, the International Labor Organization, a United  Nations specialized agency that formulates international policies and  programs to help improve working and living conditions, has endorsed  four international labor principles: (1) freedom of association and the  effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, (2) the  elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor, (3) the effective  abolition of child labor, and (4) the elimination of discrimination in  employment.

The  Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation supplement, and component supplements do not apply to the  merchandise purchased by the exchanges and sold in their retail stores,  since the purchases are not made with appropriated funds. The Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Force Management Policy) is responsible for  establishing uniform policies for the military exchanges\u2019 operations. The  exchanges are managed by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service  (AAFES), the largest exchange, and by the Navy Exchange Service  Command (Navy Exchange) and Marine Corps Community Services  (Marine Corps Exchange). The exchanges operate retail stores similar to  department stores selling apparel, footwear, household appliances,  jewelry, cosmetics, food, and other merchandise. For the past several  years, about 70 percent of the exchanges\u2019 earnings from these sales  revenues were allocated to morale, welfare, and recreation activities\u2014  libraries, sports programs, swimming pools, youth activities, tickets and  tour services, bowling centers, hobby shops, music programs, outdoor  facilities, and other quality of life improvements for military personnel and  their families\u2014and about 30 percent to new exchange facilities and  related capital projects.", "The number of retail locations and the annual revenues and earnings  reported by the exchange services for 1999 and 2000 are shown in table 1.", "The exchanges have created private label products, which generally carry  their own name or a name created exclusively for the exchange. The  exchanges began creating private labels in the mid-1980s to provide lower  prices for customers, to obtain higher earnings margins for the exchanges,  and to remain competitive with major discount retailers. Private labels are  profitable for retailers because their costs do not include marketing,  product development, or advertising, which are used by companies to  position national brands in the marketplace and to maintain the market  share. In 2000, AAFES reported purchases of $44.8 million in private label  merchandise from overseas companies, and the Navy Exchange reported  purchases of $11.6 million in private label merchandise from importers.The Marine Corps Exchange only recently created its private label and did  not purchase any private label merchandise from importers or overseas  companies in 2000, but it reported purchases of about $350,000 of AAFES\u2019  and the Navy Exchange\u2019s private label merchandise for resale in its stores.

These retailers periodically requested that overseas  suppliers provide a list of factories and subcontractors that they used to  make the retailers\u2019 private label merchandise. Some retailers we contacted  terminated a business relationship with suppliers that used a factory  without disclosing it to the retailers. For example, JCPenney\u2019s purchase  contracts stipulate that failure by a supplier or one of its contractors to  identify its factories and subcontractors may result in JCPenney\u2019s taking  the following actions: seeking compensation for any resulting expense or  loss, suspending current business activity, canceling outstanding orders,  prohibiting the supplier\u2019s subsequent use of the factory, or terminating the  relationship with the supplier. JCPenney officials told us that they have  terminated suppliers for using unauthorized subcontractors. Some  retailers that we interviewed, such as The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.,  JCPenney, and Liz Claiborne, Inc., developed a company questionnaire,  which they had factory management complete. The questionnaire  addressed health and safety issues and whether U.S. or foreign  government agencies had investigated the factory. The retailers used the  questionnaire to provide factories with feedback on their compliance with  the retailers\u2019 standards and for the retailer to provide the factory an  opportunity to make improvements in working conditions before an  inspection. The representatives of these retailers told us that they visited  factories to verify the accuracy of the factories\u2019 answers to the  questionnaire before ordering merchandise.", "Each of the 10 retailers we contacted told us they also used information on  human rights issues that was either developed internally or was available  from government agencies and nongovernmental organizations to assess  labor issues in the countries where the factories are located. This included  the Department of State\u2019s annual Country Reports on Human Rights  Practices (a legislatively mandated report to Congress that covers worker  rights issues in 194 countries), which the retailers frequently cited as a  source for identifying labor issues in a particular country. Most retailers  also used information obtained from the United Nations; U.S. Department  of State; U.S. Customs Service; U.S. Department of Labor; and  nongovernmental organizations, such as Amnesty International. The  retailers we contacted used this information in their assessments of  suppliers to avoid business arrangements with factories in areas with a  higher risk of labor abuses. In addition, some of the retailers told us that  their decisions to buy merchandise made in a particular country  sometimes depended on whether they could improve factory conditions in  a country. For example, companies such as Levi Strauss & Co. used only  those Chinese factories that corrected problem conditions, an approach  supported by the officials we met at the Departments of State and Labor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exchanges Are Less Proactive in Identifying Factories\u2019 Working Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The military exchanges\u2019 methods for identifying working conditions in  overseas factories that manufacture their private label merchandise are  not as proactive as the methods employed by companies in the private  sector. Only the Army and Air Force Exchange knew the identity of the  factories that manufactured its private label merchandise, and none of the  exchanges knew the nature of working conditions in these factories.  Instead, they assumed that their suppliers and other government agencies  ensured good working conditions. While the exchanges have sent letters to  some suppliers describing their expectations of compliance with labor  laws and regulations that address working conditions and minimum wages  in individual countries, they have not taken steps to verify that overseas  factories are in compliance or otherwise acted to determine the status of  employee working conditions; instead, they assumed that their suppliers  and other government agencies ensured good working conditions. For  example, the Navy Exchange and the Marine Corps Exchange do not  routinely maintain the name and location of the overseas factories that  manufactured their merchandise because they rely on brokers and  importers to acquire the merchandise from the overseas factories. The  AAFES Retail Business Agreement requires suppliers to promptly provide  subcontractors\u2019 name and manufacturing sites upon request. But because  it had no program to address working conditions in overseas factories,  AAFES has not requested this information, except for the suppliers it used  for its private label apparel, and then only to check on the quality of the  merchandise being manufactured. AAFES\u2019 records show that in fiscal year  2000, its private label apparel was manufactured in 70 factories in 18  countries and territories, as shown in table 3.", "In some cases, the exchanges\u2019 private label merchandise was  manufactured in countries that have been condemned internationally for  their human rights and worker rights violations. For example, at 9 of the  10 retailers we contacted, officials told us that they had ceased purchasing  from Myanmar (formerly Burma) in the 1990s because of reports of human  rights abuses documented by governmental bodies, nongovernmental  organizations, and the news media; at one retailer we contacted, officials  told us that they had ceased purchasing from Myanmar in 2000 for the  same reasons. In contrast, during 2001, each exchange purchased private  label apparel made in Myanmar.", "For the most part, the exchanges assume compliance with laws and  regulations that address child or forced labor in the countries where their  factories are located instead of determining compliance. In 1996, for  example, following the much publicized El Monte, California, sweatshop  incident, the Navy Exchange notified all of its suppliers by letter that it  expected its merchandise to be manufactured without child or forced  labor and under safe conditions in the workplace, but it did not attempt to  determine whether these suppliers and their overseas factories were  willing and able to meet these expectations. The Navy Exchange and  Marine Corps Exchange relied solely on their suppliers to address working  conditions in the factories. Similarly, AAFES\u2019 management officials told us  that they assumed that their suppliers were in compliance with applicable  laws and regulations by virtue of their having accepted an AAFES  purchase order. According to these management officials, when suppliers  accept a purchase order, they certify that they are complying with their  Retail Business Agreement. This agreement, distributed by letter to all  suppliers in 1997, states that by supplying merchandise to AAFES, the  supplier guarantees that it\u2014along with its subcontractors\u2014has complied  with all labor laws and regulations governing the manufacture, sale,  packing, shipment, and delivery of merchandise in the countries where the  factories are located. According to AAFES officials, an AAFES  contracting officer and a representative of the supplier are to sign the  agreement. We reviewed the contracting arrangements between AAFES  and nine of its suppliers of private label merchandise. Only four of the nine  suppliers had signed the AAFES Business Agreement.", "AAFES management officials also told us that they rely on the reputation  of their suppliers for assurance that overseas factories are in compliance  with its business agreements. For example, these officials told us that they  use only the overseas suppliers that have existing business relationships  with other major U.S. retailers. The officials also stated that since many of  these private retailers have developed and are using their own program to  address working conditions in their overseas factories, the use of the same  suppliers provided some degree of confidence that the suppliers are  working within the laws of the host nation. However, some retailers we  contacted said their programs addressed factory conditions only for the  period that the factories were manufacturing the retailer\u2019s merchandise  and that the factories did not have to follow their program when they were  manufacturing merchandise for another company. AAFES management  officials also told us that they rely on the U.S. Customs Service to catch  imported products that are manufactured under abusive working  conditions. However, the Customs officials we interviewed told us that  their agency encourages companies to be aware of the working conditions  in supplier factories to further reduce their risk of becoming engaged in an  import transaction involving merchandise produced with forced or  indentured child labor. According to the Customs\u2019 officials, the military  exchanges\u2014like retailers\u2014are responsible for assuring that their  merchandise is not produced with child or forced labor."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Single Industry Standard Not Considered Practical, but Industry Practices and Other Assistance Could Be Useful to Military Exchanges", "paragraphs": ["A single industry standard for adequate working conditions does not exist,  and the retailers we contacted did not believe that such a standard was  practical because each company must address different needs, depending  on the size of its operations, the various locations where its merchandise  is produced, and the labor laws that apply in different countries. However,  each of the retailers that we contacted had taken three key steps that  could serve as a framework for the exchanges in promoting compliance  with local labor laws and regulations in overseas factories. They involve  (1) developing codes of conduct for overseas suppliers; (2) implementing  their codes of conduct by disseminating expectations to their purchasing  staff, suppliers, and factory employees; and (3) monitoring to better  ensure compliance. The three steps taken by the retailers vary in scope  and rigor, and they are evolving. We did not independently evaluate the  effectiveness of these retailers\u2019 efforts, but the retailers\u2019 representatives  told us that although situations could occur in which their codes of  conduct are not followed, they believed that these steps provided an  important framework for ensuring due diligence and helped to better  assure fair and safe working conditions.

For example, officials at Levi Strauss & Co. told us that  after they refused to do business with a prospective supplier in India  because the supplier\u2019s factory had wage violations and health and safety  conditions that did not meet Levi Strauss & Co.\u2019s guidelines, the supplier  made improvements and requested a reassessment 4 months later.

In  addition, allegations that a company\u2019s operations exploit children or  violate other labor standards put sales\u2014which depend heavily on brand  image and consumer goodwill\u2014at risk and could nullify the hundreds of  millions of dollars a company spends on advertising. According to  Business for Social Responsibility, a nongovernmental organization that  provides assistance for companies developing and implementing corporate  codes of conduct, adopting and enforcing a code of conduct can be  beneficial for retailers because it can strengthen legal compliance in  foreign countries, enhance corporate reputation/brand image, reduce the  risk of negative publicity, increase quality and productivity, and improve  business relationships. \u201cwhen notified by the U.S. Department of Labor or any state or foreign government, or after  determining upon its own inspection that a supplier or its subcontractor has committed a  serious violation of law relating to child or forced labor or unsafe working conditions,  Federated will immediately suspend all shipments of merchandise from that factory and  will discontinue further business with the supplier.\u201d", "An official from Federated Department Stores, Inc., said that the company  would demand that the supplier factory institute the monitoring programs  necessary to ensure compliance with its code of conduct prior to the  resumption of any business dealings with that supplier.", "A variety of monitoring organizations, colleges, universities, and  nongovernmental organizations have codes of conduct, and codes of  conduct have now been widely adopted by the private sector. The  International Labor Organization\u2019s Business and Social Initiatives  Database includes codes of conduct for about 600 companies. While the  military exchanges\u2019 core values oppose the use of child or forced labor to  manufacture their merchandise, the military exchanges do not have codes  of conduct articulating their views. Examples of Internet Web sites with  codes of conduct are included in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Codes of Conduct", "paragraphs": ["Although retailers in the private sector implement their codes of conduct  in various ways, officials of the retailers we contacted told us that they  generally train their buying agents and quality assurance employees on  their codes of conduct to ensure that staff at all stages in the purchasing  process are aware of their company\u2019s code. For example, an official at Levi  Strauss & Co. stated that his company continually educates its employees,  including merchandisers, contract managers, general managers in source  countries, and other personnel at every level of the organization during the  year. Officials of the retailers we contacted told us they also have  distributed copies of their codes of conduct to their domestic and  international suppliers and provided them with training on how to comply  with the code. In addition, some retailers required suppliers to post codes  of conduct and other sources of labor information in their factories in the  workers\u2019 native language. For example, The Walt Disney Company has  translated its code of conduct into 50 different languages and requires  each of its suppliers to post the codes in factories in the appropriate local  language. Retailers such as Liz Claiborne, Inc., and Levi Strauss & Co. also  work with local human rights organizations to make sure that workers  understand and are familiar with their codes of conduct.", "Some retailers dedicate staff solely to implementing a code of conduct,  while other retailers assign these duties to various departments\u2014such as  compliance, quality assurance, legal affairs, purchasing agents, and  government affairs\u2014as a collateral responsibility. Executives and officials  from the retailers we contacted stated that the successful implementation  of a code of conduct requires the involvement of departments throughout  the supply chain, both internally and externally (including supplier and  subcontractor factories).

The various forms of monitoring  involve the visual inspection of factories for health and safety violations;  interviewing management to understand workplace policies; reviewing  wage, hour, age, and other records for completeness and accuracy; and  interviewing workers to verify workplace policies and practices. The 10  retail companies we contacted did not provide a precise cost for their  internal and external monitoring programs, but a representative of  Business for Social Responsibility estimated that monitoring costs ranged  from $250,000 to $15 million a year. Some retailers suggested that the  military exchanges could minimize costs by joining together to conduct  monitoring, particularly in situations where the exchanges are purchasing  merchandise manufactured at the same factories.", "Companies that rely on internal monitoring use their own staff to monitor  the extent to which supplier factories adhere to company policies and  standards. According to an official with the National Retail Federation, the  world\u2019s largest retail trade association, retailers generally prefer internal  monitoring because it provides them with first-hand knowledge of their  overseas facilities. At the same time, representatives of the  nongovernmental organizations we visited expressed their opinion that  inspections performed by internal staff may not be perceived as  sufficiently independent. According to information we obtained from the  retailers we contacted, nearly all of them had an internal monitoring  program to inspect all or some supplier factories; their internal monitoring  staff ranged from 5 to 100 auditors located in domestic and international  offices. Some retailers said they perform prescreening audits before  entering into a contractual agreement, followed by announced and  unannounced inspections at a later time. The frequency of audits  performed at supplier factories depends on various factors, such as the  rigor and size of the corporation\u2019s monitoring plan, the location of supplier  factories, and complaints from workers or nongovernmental  organizations.", "Some retailers\u2014along with colleges, universities, and factories\u2014are also  using external monitoring organizations that provide specially trained  auditors to verify compliance with workplace codes of conduct. We visited  four of these monitoring organizations\u2014Fair Labor Association, Social  Accountability International, Worker Rights Consortium, and Worldwide  Responsible Apparel Production. More information on these monitoring  organizations appears in appendix II. Each organization has different  guidelines for its monitoring program, but typically, a program involves  (1) a code of conduct that all participating corporations must implement  and (2) the inspection of workplaces at supplier factories participating in  the program by audit firms accredited by the organization. External  monitoring organizations\u2019 activities differ in scope. For example, under the  Fair Labor Association\u2019s program, companies use external monitors  accredited by the Fair Labor Association for periodic inspections of  factories.

However, developing a program  that is understood throughout the supply chain, lives up to expectations  over time, and is cost-effective will be a challenge.
