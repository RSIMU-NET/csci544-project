OFHEO\u2019s mission is to ensure the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises), the major participants in the secondary mortgage market. For reasons relating to the federal charter and structure of the enterprises, investors and rating agencies perceive the enterprises\u2019 securities as implicitly guaranteed by the federal government, despite there being no statutory obligation. In December 1994, the enterprises held combined assets and mortgage-backed securities of more than $1.3 trillion.", "The act requires us to audit the operations of OFHEO annually during the first 2 fiscal years following the date of enactment and as appropriate after that. Because the act\u2019s requirement is broad, the objective of this initial report was to review the status of OFHEO\u2019s development, focusing on the progress made in designing and instituting key management systems.", "These include OFHEO\u2019s administrative infrastructure systems\u2014the human resources and accounting and financial management systems\u2014and the major mission-related systems\u2014examinations and capital adequacy. The report also provides an overview of OFHEO\u2019s compliance with other operational and reporting requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Responding to the massive and expensive failure of federally insured savings and loans in the mid-1980s, Congress and the administration examined government-sponsored enterprises to ensure that they were operating in a manner that protected the taxpayers\u2019 interest and minimized the risk that these entities would fail. Prior GAO reports noted that the enterprises\u2019 ties to the government had weakened private market discipline to the point that creditors believed the government would likely assist an enterprise through financial difficulties, even though the government has no legal obligation to do so. This expectation is not without foundation; in 1987, Congress approved $4 billion to help the ailing Farm Credit System.", "According to a report from the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, this perception is based on the structure and privileges of the enterprises and the special treatment of their securities. The enterprises were created by statute, are exempt from state and local income taxes, and each has a line of credit with the Treasury of $2.25 billion. Their securities are issued and paid through the facilities of the Federal Reserve Banks and are eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve, for unlimited investment by Federal Reserve member banks and federally insured thrifts and as collateral for public deposits of the U.S. government and most state and local governments. As a result, the enterprises\u2019 debt trades at yields only marginally above those on Treasury debt of comparable maturity. This implicit credit enhancement allows the enterprises to operate with relatively little capital.", "The enterprises\u2019 federally established charters set out specific purposes that they are to address. They are to provide stability in the secondary market of residential mortgages, respond appropriately to the private capital market, and provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages. They are also to promote access to mortgage credit throughout the nation by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing.", "For these reasons, the government has an interest in seeing that these enterprises are managed and operated in a prudent and financially sound manner. Both enterprises have been highly profitable for several years,but Congress recognized that both may not always remain as profitable and well managed as they are today. Consequently, Congress reformed the enterprises\u2019 regulatory structure and established capital requirements by passing the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. According to the Senate report accompanying the bill, the capital provisions are designed to ensure that the enterprises are financially sound. The primary emphasis of these provisions is on a risk-based capital standard that reflects risks the enterprises assume. The new regulatory structure was designed to address concerns over HUD\u2019s inadequate regulation and supervision of the enterprises.", "The act established OFHEO as an independent entity within HUD. The act reserved for the Secretary of HUD certain authorities relating to HUD\u2019s responsibility to oversee the enterprises\u2019 efforts to meet housing goals.But the act also clarified that the duty to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are adequately capitalized and operate in a safe and sound manner, consistent with the achievement of their public purposes, belongs to OFHEO. Consequently, the act specifically delegated other responsibilities and authorities to the Director of OFHEO. OFHEO was intended to operate separately from HUD and be staffed with experts in financial management or financial institution oversight.", "OFHEO is under the management of a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed Director. The act provided the Director with numerous exclusive authorities (i.e., without the review and approval of the Secretary of HUD), such as powers to examine the operations of the enterprises, determine capital levels, assign the enterprises capital classifications, and take certain enforcement actions. The act also gave the Director exclusive authority to manage OFHEO, including establishing and implementing annual budgets and hiring personnel. Thus, the Director leads and directs OFHEO\u2019s activities by setting internal and external policy, managing overall operations, and serving as the chief spokesperson for the organization. As of February 1995, OFHEO\u2019s six components reported to the Director and Deputy Director. Figure 1 illustrates OFHEO\u2019s organizational structure.", "Three line functions are directly responsible for carrying out OFHEO\u2019s mission:", "The Office of Examination and Oversight (OEO) is responsible for designing and conducting annual on-site examinations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as required by law, and performing additional examinations as determined by the Director.", "Research, Analysis and Capital Standards (RACS) is responsible for developing and implementing financial \u201cstress tests,\u201d which use interest rate and credit risk scenarios prescribed in the act to determine the enterprises\u2019 risk-based capital requirements.

This unit is to provide human resources management, budget formulation and execution, financial and strategic planning, contracting and purchasing, office automation, travel, records and document security, and related administrative support services. Finance and Administration is also responsible for developing annual budgets and serving as the liaison with the Office of Management and Budget.", "The Office of Chief Economist is responsible for providing and coordinating economic and policy advice to the Director on all issues related to the regulation and supervision of the enterprises. This office is also to direct and conduct research to assess the impact of issues and trends in the housing and mortgage markets on OFHEO\u2019s regulatory responsibilities.", "The Office of Congressional and Public Affairs is responsible for handling public and press inquiries, briefing Members of Congress and staff on matters relating to OFHEO, monitoring legislative development, and bringing congressional concerns to the attention of the Director.", "OFHEO\u2019s staffing has grown slowly but steadily since the Director, its first employee, was sworn in on June 1, 1993. At the end of fiscal year 1993, five other employees were on board. According to testimony from the Director in October 1993, recruiting specialized staff was slowed somewhat by OFHEO\u2019s need to first do such fundamental things as obtain hiring authority, develop procedures, and obtain office space. By September 1994, however, OFHEO had 37 staff on board. And in February 1995, OFHEO\u2019s staff had grown to 53. OFHEO\u2019s budget projects filling 69 positions in fiscal year 1996. Table 1 compares the distribution of positions among OFHEO\u2019s different units at the end of fiscal year 1994 with that projected for fiscal year 1996.", "Relative to other federal financial regulatory agencies, OFHEO is a small organization. In testimony before the House Banking Committee in October 1993, OFHEO\u2019s Director spoke about the unique challenge facing OFHEO in regulating two entities as large, complex, and sophisticated as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. She compared OFHEO\u2019s regulatory task with that of other federal financial regulatory agencies. For example, OFHEO\u2019s fiscal year 1994 budget funded 45 positions to oversee the enterprises (1 employee for every $23.1 billion in regulated assets). As a point of comparison, 2,500 Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) employees oversaw institutions with $800 billion in assets (1 employee per $0.3 billion in assets). To address that challenge, OFHEO\u2019s philosophy was to create a lean and flat organization that would attract and retain a highly qualified, diverse staff with sophisticated financial, legal, and supervisory expertise.", "Most OFHEO expenses cover personnel and contractor services. For fiscal year 1996, OFHEO estimates that it will spend $7.9 million (53.3 percent of its $14.9 million total) on personnel services (i.e., expenses related to personnel compensation and benefits, but exclusive of contractors).", "According to OFHEO, it bases salaries and benefits on market rates for the required technical expertise comparably with those of other federal banking regulatory agencies. The second largest category of expenses (\u201cOther services\u201d) generally covers OFHEO\u2019s contractor services. In fiscal year 1996, OFHEO expects to spend $4.4 million (29.7 percent) on specialized technical services associated with developing and maintaining its research capability and computer models, examination services, and specialized legal services. All other expenses constitute a smaller, but growing, proportion of OFHEO\u2019s total obligations. These expenses cover such fundamental but crucial items as computer acquisition, travel, and rent, which fluctuate with changing numbers of staff and contractors on location.", "Table 2 shows actual and estimated OFHEO obligations for fiscal years 1994 through 1996. Although OFHEO\u2019s financial plans and forecasts are to be included in the budget of the United States and in HUD\u2019s congressional justifications, it is not funded with tax dollars through the congressional appropriations process. Rather, the act requires the enterprises to pay annual assessments to cover OFHEO\u2019s costs. OFHEO\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget estimated that it would obligate nearly $0.6 million less than was estimated for operations in fiscal year 1995. That estimate reflects a diminished reliance on other contractor services, especially in support areas, partially offset by increases in rent associated with the need for additional space and in personnel expenditures associated with four additional OFHEO positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Because OFHEO continues to develop its major management systems, we limited the scope of our work for this report to the planning and initial implementation of those systems. As of February 1995, none of OFHEO\u2019s major management systems had been completely implemented. Consequently, we did not evaluate their ultimate implementation or effectiveness.", "To develop our information, we interviewed OFHEO\u2019s senior management and HUD officials and reviewed OFHEO management systems documentation, focusing on the policies and procedures relating to OFHEO\u2019s human resource management and accounting and financial control systems. We reviewed changes in these plans and systems that OFHEO made over time. We also reviewed OFHEO\u2019s plans for its organizational development, particularly its examinations and capital adequacy functions, along with its completed examinations of the enterprises and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the risk-based capital regulation.", "OFHEO provided written comments on a draft of this report. The comments are summarized on page 22 and reprinted in appendix I.", "We did our work at OFHEO and HUD in Washington, D.C., between September 1994 and February 1995.

Much has changed since then. OFHEO has made steady progress toward establishing administrative and financial management systems and controls designed to enable it to operate independently of HUD. OFHEO has nearly finished designing its human resource management system, worked with HUD to meet its initial financial and accounting needs, and begun exploring alternative arrangements for \u201ccross-servicing,\u201d through which OFHEO would contract with another agency to provide administrative and financial management services. According to its September 1994 operational workplan, OFHEO is basically on schedule developing and installing its infrastructure. OFHEO now faces the challenge of implementing its systems and resolving unforeseen difficulties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Human Resource Management System Nearing Initial Implementation", "paragraphs": ["By February 1995, OFHEO had substantially completed the design of its human resource management system (called the Performance Evaluation Management System, or PEMS) and established milestones for pilot testing the system. OFHEO anticipates full implementation of PEMS at the beginning of fiscal year 1996.", "Rather than adopting HUD\u2019s or another agency\u2019s human resource management system, OFHEO developed its own. Based on recommendations of two consulting firms, OFHEO\u2019s performance management system is intended to enable it to respond to changing regulatory needs and ease its developmental operations. PEMS\u2019 broad pay band structure reflects three general design elements: (1) salaries to help OFHEO recruit technical expertise, (2) pay ranges to provide management flexibility to make pay decisions that reflect labor market pay while providing internal equity, and (3) occupational levels to be significantly and recognizably different.", "OFHEO classifies personnel by occupation and assigns them to one of seven pay bands. Occupations are based in part on the type of work done relative to OFHEO\u2019s mission, the nature and subject matter of the work, and the fundamental qualifications required. Pay levels and ranges are based on comparisons with similar occupations in other federal financial regulatory agencies. An individual\u2019s pay also depends on the complexity of the work, scope of responsibility, and supervisory content of the job. Changes in pay are to occur once a year, at the end of the review cycle. Individuals may receive pay increases within each pay band, unless they are at the band\u2019s ceiling. Those staff meeting qualifications for other occupations and demonstrating the ability to perform the relevant duties and responsibilities may also be promoted. In 1994, pay could range from $15,000 to $135,000.", "In March 1995, OFHEO was preparing to implement PEMS. Having obtained official approval of PEMS from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on February 23, 1995, OFHEO planned to implement PEMS in April 1995. OFHEO will abbreviate PEMS\u2019 initial performance cycle and begin regular, full-year cycles in fiscal year 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Establish OFHEO\u2019s Accounting and Financial Systems Have Proven More Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Compared to the progress made with PEMS, OFHEO has experienced greater difficulty in establishing its accounting and financial systems and controls. OFHEO has worked with HUD to meet its immediate needs, but OFHEO is still uncertain as to whether HUD can meet its accounting and financial systems requirements. As of February 1995, OFHEO was still considering either establishing its own systems or arranging for cross-servicing with another federal agency.", "OFHEO has established general requirements for its accounting and financial management system. According to OFHEO, the system must support all personnel and procurement components within an integrated automated accounting system and accommodate its classification and compensation system. In addition, the system must produce auditable financial statements. The system must maintain accounting records that accurately reflect expenses and income; provide monthly budget, accounting, and exception reports; and pay approved invoices.", "OFHEO has used HUD\u2019s accounting and financial systems since its inception but experienced various difficulties. In the procurement area, for example, OFHEO used the services of HUD\u2019s Office of Procurement and Contracts. According to OFHEO, HUD\u2019s office was not staffed to provide the expedited procurement processing OFHEO\u2019s start-up mode of operation required. OFHEO eventually hired its own procurement contracting officer and exercised independent contracting authority. To date, HUD has handled OFHEO\u2019s payroll and other personnel processing actions. OFHEO inputs its time and attendance data directly but uses HUD\u2019s contract with the National Finance Center in New Orleans to process its payroll. HUD has serviced OFHEO\u2019s other personnel processing needs (such as processing tax forms, health benefits enrollments, and direct deposit forms), but not, according to OFHEO, without problems. During OFHEO\u2019s early months of existence, HUD did not understand or appreciate the significance of OFHEO\u2019s Schedule A hiring authority and its authority to make independent appointments. This added considerable time to the processing of personnel actions, since individuals unfamiliar with OFHEO\u2019s exemptions subjected those actions to HUD\u2019s own internal review procedures. According to OFHEO, this processing relationship smoothed out over time.", "Senior OFHEO officials expressed dissatisfaction with HUD\u2019s accounting and financial management systems. For example, OFHEO experienced substantial delays in how HUD recorded OFHEO obligations and expenses. Additionally, HUD restricted access to its accounting system, limiting the ability of OFHEO\u2019s finance and administration staff to retrieve their data to support budget formulation and financial management activities. HUD staff also confused OFHEO with another HUD agency, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO), causing them to confuse financial transactions and misdirect financial reports.", "OFHEO had procedures and controls in place that enabled it to detect such problems. Consequently, HUD\u2019s errors were corrected and OFHEO ultimately was able to reconcile its fiscal year 1994 accounts. However, the lack of current accurate data during the year made it difficult for OFHEO to determine its unobligated balances on a monthly basis. In turn, this hampered OFHEO\u2019s ability to notify the enterprises with certainty what the next semiannual assessment would be.", "Over time, OFHEO has recognized improvements in the data provided by HUD\u2019s accounting system. Senior OFHEO officials told us that they have noted fewer errors and that HUD has been able to provide information in a more timely manner. According to the Director of Finance and Administration, OFHEO had a great degree of confidence in the accounting data on which it based its March 1, 1995, assessment of the enterprises.", "HUD officials acknowledged that some problems existed with the accounting system that processed OFHEO\u2019s financial data. They told us that HUD is replacing the system that generated many of the problems, and OFHEO is to be switched to the new system later in fiscal year 1995. According to those officials, the new system should fully meet OFHEO\u2019s needs and requirements, allowing OFHEO to access its financial data and generate its own unique reports.", "As of February 1995, OFHEO had not yet decided how it would meet its future administrative and accounting needs. OFHEO has not determined whether to continue using HUD systems, create and maintain its own, or contract those functions out to another federal agency. Initially, OFHEO had decided against devoting its own staff to these functions, believing that it would not be a cost-effective use of its limited resources. It approached nine other federal agencies, focusing on financial regulators because they have similar missions and compensation systems. OFHEO eventually determined that none of them would fully meet its needs. In some cases, OFHEO questioned the agencies\u2019 capacity. In other cases, the agencies responded that entering into a cross-servicing arrangement would not be practicable or cost-effective. According to a senior OFHEO official, the biggest problem involved the particular systems OFHEO had implemented because of exemptions in its statute, such as that exempting OFHEO from certain provisions of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates.", "Resolving the cross-servicing issue is a priority for OFHEO\u2019s Director of Finance and Administration. Because OFHEO has been unable to identify another agency that has the resources to meet its unique accounting system needs, and because the quality of the accounting information from HUD has improved significantly, OFHEO is considering continued use of HUD accounting and financial management systems. OFHEO officials have also been encouraged by HUD\u2019s willingness to work with them to ensure that the new accounting system meets OFHEO\u2019s requirements and needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Examinations and Capital Adequacy Functions: Approaches to Meeting Key Legislative Mandates Taking Longer Than Envisioned", "paragraphs": ["OFHEO has made considerable progress in establishing its key functions\u2014examining the enterprises\u2019 financial condition to ensure their financial safety and soundness as well as developing and implementing the required risk-based test to determine how much capital the enterprises need (the \u201cstress test\u201d). After having hired its key professional staff and establishing working relationships with the enterprises, OFHEO conducted its first examinations, purchased and installed the computer system needed to run the stress test, and obtained the data needed for the financial modeling and research that underlie the test. Additionally, OFHEO established plans to guide its work at least through the end of fiscal year 1995. OFHEO has met most of its legislated requirements, including making determinations of the enterprises\u2019 capital adequacy during the transition period prior to the release of the risk-based capital standards.", "Despite this progress, OFHEO has experienced delays, causing some important activities to fall behind schedule. For example, OFHEO did not meet the legislatively mandated deadline for issuing final regulations establishing the risk-based test of the enterprises\u2019 capital adequacy.OFHEO has established intermediate milestones and now expects to publish proposed stress test regulations in late 1995 and final regulations in 1996.

This approach has three levels. First, OFHEO examiners are to meet and evaluate senior management, analyze strategic and business plans, determine the quality of internal and external audits, and verify records and control systems. Second, the examiners are to expand the examination to include further testing, statistical sampling, and analyses of the enterprises\u2019 systems. If the second-level review raises any questions, a team of examiners is to do a detailed third-level review of these concerns.", "By September 1994, OEO had planned its activities through calendar year 1995. According to this schedule, OEO would have seven or more projects ongoing at all times\u2014at least two examinations at each of the enterprises, along with at least three supervisory monitoring projects.

It shows, for example, that during the first half of 1995, OEO staff are to complete \u201cgeneral,\u201d \u201cspecialty,\u201d and books and records examinations of both enterprises. In the general examination, OEO staff will (1) examine each enterprise\u2019s risk management by assessing the adequacy of management processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk exposure of the enterprise; (2) examine a functional area of each enterprise\u2019s secondary market operations, such as its marketing or mortgage securitization; or (3) assess the adequacy of some aspect of each enterprise\u2019s business or product lines, such as its single- or multifamily guarantee programs. The specialty examination is to cover the enterprises\u2019 electronic data processing (EDP). The objective of these examinations is to ensure that EDP systems used by the enterprises are adequate, reliable, accurate, and operated within a secure environment. OFHEO plans to test major systems to verify the data and report integrity. In the books and records examination, OEO staff are to evaluate the accounting and auditing to determine the reliability of the enterprises\u2019 financial information.", "OEO\u2019s small staff has not been able to keep up with its workplan. OFHEO completed its first on-site examinations, focusing on the enterprises\u2019 use of off-balance sheet financial derivatives, in November 1994. OFHEO reported that the enterprises used derivatives for sound business purposes and that derivatives activities were consistent with the enterprises\u2019 objectives. OEO began its second examination of both enterprises, the corporate examinations, in October 1994 and anticipates completing those reports in April 1995, 4 months behind its original schedule.

All activities planned for 1995 are also behind schedule.", "The reasons OFHEO has fallen behind seem related to complications in establishing a new organization. First, according to the director of OEO, OFHEO had trouble hiring qualified examination staff. Occasionally, OFHEO found it hard to attract qualified candidates, because it was new and not well known. According to OFHEO\u2019s Director, there are a limited number of individuals with the particular skills that OFHEO needs, forcing it to compete with other financial regulators for qualified staff. OFHEO also noted that it had difficulty competing with private salary offers. In addition, some employees who accepted employment with OFHEO were unable to begin as early as OFHEO management wanted.", "Second, OFHEO needed to establish its internal review processes to help ensure quality reporting. Upon completing its first examinations, the draft report was reviewed by key OFHEO management officials while developing a review procedure. OFHEO hopes to streamline its review process in the future. Finally, senior OFHEO officials told us that the amount of information from the enterprises that its staff needs to review is voluminous. OFHEO may have underestimated the time needed for its small examination staff (five staff examiners and regulatory specialists at the end of the calendar year) to review and understand such large amounts of information.

For example, OFHEO submitted annual written reports to the Senate and House Banking Committees as required by the act, covering such topics as actions taken by OFHEO and descriptions of the financial safety and soundness of each enterprise. In addition, OFHEO submitted its annual report to the President and Congress, as required by the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FIA), on December 20, 1994. The report noted that OFHEO as a whole complied with FIA. Perhaps most important, OFHEO made quarterly determinations of the enterprises\u2019 capital adequacy. During the 18-month period following enactment (i.e., from October 28, 1992, through April 27, 1994), OFHEO was to classify the enterprises as \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d if they maintained an amount of core capital that equaled or exceeded certain minimum capital levels that were to apply only during that \u201ctransition\u201d period. OFHEO determined the enterprises to be adequately capitalized for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1993 and for the first quarter of 1994, applying those transitional minimum capital standards. For the second and third quarters of 1994, OFHEO determined the enterprises to be adequately capitalized, applying other minimum capital standards contained in the act.
