There is concern that if these efforts are not implemented securely, the electric grid could become more vulnerable to attacks and loss of services. To address this concern, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provided the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with responsibilities related to coordinating the development and adoption of smart grid guidelines and standards. GAO was asked to (1) assess the extent to which NIST has developed smart grid cybersecurity guidelines; (2) evaluate FERC's approach for adopting and monitoring smart grid cybersecurity and other standards; and (3) identify challenges associated with smart grid cybersecurity. To do so, GAO analyzed agency documentation, interviewed responsible officials, and hosted an expert panel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NIST has developed, and issued in August 2010, a first version of its smart grid cybersecurity guidelines. The agency developed the guidelines--for entities such as electric companies involved in implementing smart grid systems--to provide guidance on how to securely implement such systems. In doing this, NIST largely addressed key cybersecurity elements that it had planned to include in the guidelines, such as an assessment of the cybersecurity risks associated with smart grid systems and the identification of security requirements (i.e., controls) essential to securing such systems. This notwithstanding, NIST did not address an important element essential to securing smart grid systems that it had planned to include--addressing the risk of attacks that use both cyber and physical means. NIST also identified other key elements that surfaced during its development of the guidelines that need to be addressed in future guideline updates. NIST officials said that they intend to update the guidelines to address the missing elements, and have drafted a plan to do so. While a positive step, the plan and schedule are still in draft form. Until the missing elements are addressed, there is an increased risk that smart grid implementations will not be secure as otherwise possible. In 2010, FERC began a process to consider an initial set of smart grid interoperability and cybersecurity standards for adoption, but has not developed a coordinated approach to monitor the extent to which industry is following these standards. While EISA gives FERC authority to adopt smart grid standards, it does not provide FERC with specific enforcement authority. This means that standards will remain voluntary unless regulators are able to use other authorities--such as the ability to oversee the rates electricity providers charge customers--to enforce them. Additionally, although regulatory fragmentation--the divided regulation over aspects of the industry between federal, state, and local entities--complicates oversight of smart grid interoperability and cybersecurity, FERC has not developed an approach coordinated with other regulators to monitor whether industry is following the voluntary smart grid standards it adopts. FERC officials said they have not yet determined whether or how to do so. Nonetheless, adherence to standards is an important step toward achieving an interoperable and secure electricity system and establishing an approach for coordinating on standards adoption could help address gaps, if they arise. With respect to challenges to securing smart grid systems, GAO identified the following six key challenges: (1) Aspects of the regulatory environment may make it difficult to ensure smart grid systems' cybersecurity. (2) Utilities are focusing on regulatory compliance instead of comprehensive security. (3) The electric industry does not have an effective mechanism for sharing information on cybersecurity. (4) Consumers are not adequately informed about the benefits, costs, and risks associated with smart grid systems. (5) There is a lack of security features being built into certain smart grid systems. (6) The electricity industry does not have metrics for evaluating cybersecurity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NIST finalize its plan and schedule for updating its cybersecurity guidelines to incorporate missing elements, and that FERC develop a coordinated approach to monitor voluntary standards and address any gaps in compliance.

Once there, electricity is  transformed into a lower voltage and sent through local distribution lines  for consumption by industrial plants, commercial businesses, and  residential consumers.

These  efforts are designed to, among other things, improve transmission of  electricity from power plants to consumers, provide grid operators with  more information about conditions on the electricity system, integrate new  and improved technologies into the grid, and allow consumers to receive  more information about electricity prices and availability from the  electricity system. Smart grid modernization is an ongoing process and  initiatives have commonly involved installing advanced metering  infrastructure (smart meters) on homes and commercial buildings that  enable two-way communication between the utility and the customer. For  example, FERC estimated advanced metering use in the United States at  4.7 percent in 2008, compared to 0.7 percent in 2006. Initiatives have also  involved adding \u201csmart\u201d components to provide the system operator with  more detailed data on the conditions of the transmission and distribution  systems and better tools to observe the overall condition of the grid  (called wide-area situational awareness). These include advanced, \u201csmart\u201d  switches on the distribution system that communicate with each other to  reroute electricity around a troubled line; and high-resolution, time  synchronized monitors\u2013\u2013called phasor measurement units\u2013\u2013on the  transmission system.

It could also help consumers make more informed choices about  when to use electricity; for example, how much to use when demand and  prices are high.

Such regulatory fragmentation can  make it difficult for individual regulators to develop an industry-wide  understanding of whether utilities and manufacturers are following  voluntary standards.

According to FERC officials  and others representing municipal and cooperative utilities, FERC also has  not coordinated in such a way with groups representing public power and  cooperative utilities\u2014utilities not routinely subject to FERC\u2019s or the  states\u2019 jurisdiction for rate-setting purposes. Such groups include the  American Public Power Association, which represents municipally owned  utilities, and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which  represents cooperatively owned utilities. FERC has not developed such an  approach, because, according to officials, it has not yet determined  whether or how to conduct high-level monitoring of compliance with  smart grid standards it adopts under EISA.", "Adherence to standards is an important step toward achieving an  interoperable and secure electricity system. Unless FERC and other  regulators have a good understanding of whether utilities and  manufacturers are following smart grid standards, it will be difficult to  know whether a voluntary approach to standards setting is effective or if  changes are needed. According to federal internal control guidance,  managers need to compare actual performance\u2014in this case, the extent to  which manufacturers and utilities follow voluntary standards\u2014to planned  or expected results throughout the organization and analyze significant  differences. Given the fragmented nature of electricity regulation, it may  not be possible for FERC to perform such a review alone, and the agency  may have to collaborate with other regulators. Past GAO work highlights  that when carrying out activities to enhance interagency collaboration, it is  critical to involve nonfederal partners\u2014in this case, state and other  regulators with responsibility for overseeing key components of the  electricity industry\u2014in decision making. Without a documented  approach established in advance to coordinate with state and other  regulators on this issue, FERC will not be well positioned to promptly  begin monitoring the results of any standards it adopts\u2014including a high- level assessment of whether industry follows them\u2014and quickly respond  if gaps arise. Such a delay could result in a patchwork of approaches  across the United States and lead to incompatibilities between systems,  higher costs, and a less secure electricity grid.", "A number of activities are under way that may result in information to  inform a FERC assessment of the extent to which voluntary standards are  followed, but these efforts are not coordinated or complete. According to  DOE officials, as a part of DOE\u2019s broader effort to publish a smart grid  system report every 2 years as required by EISA, the department expects  to report some information about the progress and effectiveness of smart  grid interoperability and cybersecurity standards. Additionally, NIST has  efforts under way to establish a process for vendors to certify their smart  grid products as complying with standards and coordinate industry  development of additional standards as needed. However, it is unclear to  what extent these planned activities will specifically focus on assessing  industry compliance with voluntary standards across regulatory  jurisdictions and options to address any gaps that exist. Moreover, unlike  FERC, the state PUCs, and other electricity regulators, neither DOE nor  NIST has the authority to routinely require industry to follow standards  should gaps exist."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Electricity Industry Faces Key Challenges to Securing Smart Grid Systems and Networks", "paragraphs": ["Leveraging the views of experts (by means of panel discussions), we  identified the following six challenges that are key to ensuring the  cybersecurity of the systems and networks that support our nation\u2019s  electricity grid.", "Aspects of the current regulatory environment make it difficult to ensure  the cybersecurity of smart grid systems. In particular, jurisdictional  issues and the difficulties associated with responding to continually  evolving cyber threats are a key regulatory challenge to ensuring the  cybersecurity of smart grid systems as they are deployed. Regarding  jurisdiction, our experts expressed concern that there was a lack of clarity  about the division of responsibility between federal and state regulators,  particularly regarding cybersecurity. While jurisdictional responsibility has  historically been determined by whether a technology is located on the  transmission or distribution system, experts raised concerns that smart  grid technology may blur these lines. For example, devices such as smart  meters deployed on parts of the grid traditionally subject to state  jurisdiction could, in the aggregate, have an impact on those parts of the  grid that federal regulators are responsible for\u2014namely the reliability of  the transmission system.", "There is also concern about the ability of regulatory bodies to respond to  evolving cybersecurity threats. For example, one expert questioned the  ability of government agencies to adapt to rapidly evolving threats, while  another highlighted the need for regulations to be capable of responding to  the evolving cybersecurity issues. In addition, our experts expressed  concern with agencies developing regulations in the future that are overly  specific in their requirements, such as those specifying the use of a  particular product or technology. Consequently, unless steps are taken to  mitigate these challenges, regulations may not be fully effective in  protecting smart grid technology from cybersecurity threats.", "Consumers are not adequately informed about the benefits, costs, and  risks associated with smart grid systems. Specifically, there is concern  that consumers are not aware of the benefits, costs, and risks associated  with smart grid systems. This lack of awareness may limit the extent to  which consumers are willing to pay for secure and reliable systems, which  may cause regulators to be reluctant to approve rate increases associated  with cybersecurity. As a result, until consumers are more informed about  the benefits, costs, and risks of smart grid systems, utilities may not invest  in, or get approval for, comprehensive security for smart grid systems,  which may increase the risk of attacks succeeding.", "Utilities are focusing on regulatory compliance instead of  comprehensive security. The existing federal and state regulatory  environment creates a culture within the utility industry of focusing on  compliance with cybersecurity requirements, instead of a culture focused  on achieving comprehensive and effective cybersecurity. Specifically,  experts told us that utilities focus on achieving minimum regulatory  requirements rather than designing a comprehensive approach to system  security. In addition, one expert stated that security requirements are  inherently incomplete, and having a culture that views the security  problem as being solved once those requirements are met will leave an  organization vulnerable to cyber attack. Consequently, without a  comprehensive approach to security, utilities leave themselves open to  unnecessary risk.", "There is a lack of security features being built into smart grid systems.", "Security features are not consistently built into smart grid devices. For  example, our experts told us that certain currently available smart meters  have not been designed with a strong security architecture and lack  important security features, including event logging and forensics  capabilities which are needed to detect and analyze attacks. In addition,  our experts stated that smart grid home area networks\u2014used for  managing the electricity usage of appliances and other devices in the  home\u2014do not have adequate security built in, thus increasing their  vulnerability to attack. Without securely designed smart grid systems,  utilities will be at risk of not having the capacity to detect and analyze  attacks, which increases the risk that attacks will succeed and utilities will  be unable to prevent them from recurring.", "The electricity industry does not have an effective mechanism for  sharing information on cybersecurity and other issues. The electricity  industry lacks an effective mechanism to disclose information about smart  grid cybersecurity vulnerabilities, incidents, threats, lessons learned, and  best practices in the industry. For example, our experts stated that while  the electricity industry has an information sharing center, it does not fully  address these information needs. In addition, President Obama\u2019s  cyberspace policy review, released in May 2009, also identified challenges  related to cybersecurity information sharing within the electric and other  critical infrastructure sectors and issued recommendations to address the  areas. According to our experts, information regarding incidents such as  both unsuccessful and successful attacks must be able to be shared in a  safe and secure way to avoid publicly revealing the reported organization  and penalizing entities actively engaged in corrective action. Such  information sharing across the industry could provide important  information regarding the level of attempted cyber attacks and their  methods, which could help grid operators better defend against them. If  the industry pursued this end, it could draw upon the practices and  approaches of other industries when designing an industry-led approach to  cybersecurity information sharing. Without quality processes for  information sharing, utilities will not have the information needed to  adequately protect their assets against attackers.", "The electricity industry does not have metrics for evaluating  cybersecurity. The electricity industry is also challenged by a lack of  cybersecurity metrics, making it difficult to measure the extent to which  investments in cybersecurity improve the security of smart grid systems.  Experts noted that while such metrics are difficult to develop, they could  help compare the effectiveness of competing solutions and determine  what mix of solutions combine to make the most secure system.  Furthermore, our experts said that having metrics would help utilities  develop a business case for cybersecurity by helping to show the return on  a particular investment. Until such metrics are developed, there is  increased risk that utilities will not invest in security in a cost-effective  manner, or have the information needed to make informed decisions on  their cybersecurity investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The electricity industry is in the midst of a major transformation as a  result of smart grid initiatives, and this transformation has led to  significant financial investment by many entities, including utilities, private  companies, and the federal government. For their part, NIST and FERC  have efforts planned and under way to carry out their smart grid roles and  responsibilities, although limitations exist in the planning and  coordination efforts of these two key agencies. Specifically, NIST does not  have a definitive plan and schedule, including specific milestones, for  updating and maintaining its cybersecurity guidelines to address key  missing elements. Furthermore, FERC has not established an approach  coordinated with other regulators to monitor the extent to which industry  is following the smart grid standards it adopts.", "The voluntary standards and guidelines developed through the NIST and  FERC processes offer promise. However, a voluntary approach poses  some risks when applied to smart grid investments, particularly given the  fragmented nature of regulatory authority over the electricity industry.  Currently, NIST and FERC\u2019s efforts are hindered by their lack of an  approach to (1) updating voluntary cybersecurity guidelines and (2)  monitoring whether voluntary standards are being followed by  manufacturers and utilities and periodically reporting to Congress on  whether additional authorities are needed. Not having such an approach  could result in gaps being recognized too late to avoid incompatibilities  between systems, costly equipment replacements, or unnecessarily long  periods of vulnerability to cyber attack. The lack of an approach to  monitoring compliance with standards also limits the information  available to Congress on how widely the smart grid standards are being  followed and whether additional regulatory authorities are needed to  address any gaps.", "In addition to the challenges being faced by NIST and FERC, the electricity  industry faces its own set of challenges that are critical to ensuring smart  grid systems and networks are implemented securely. Addressing these  challenges will involve participation by private sector organizations and  government agencies, including NIST and FERC.

We also  recommend that NIST, as a part of finalizing the plan, assess whether any  cybersecurity challenges identified in this report should be addressed in  the guidelines.", "To improve coordination among regulators and help Congress better  assess the effectiveness of the voluntary smart grid standards process, we  recommend that the Chairman of FERC, making use of existing smart grid  information, develop an approach to    coordinate with state regulators to (1) periodically evaluate the extent to  which utilities and manufacturers are following voluntary interoperability  and cybersecurity standards and (2) develop strategies for addressing any  gaps in compliance with standards that are identified as a result of this  evaluation. To the extent that FERC determines it lacks authority to  address any gaps in compliance that cannot be addressed through this  coordinated approach with other regulators, the Chairman should report  this information to Congress.    coordinate with groups that represent utilities subject to less FERC and  state regulation (such as municipal and cooperative utilities) to (1)  periodically evaluate the extent to which utilities and manufacturers are  following voluntary interoperability and cybersecurity standards and (2)  develop strategies for addressing any gaps in compliance with standards  that are identified as a result of this evaluation.

Specifically, in the first two comments, the department wanted  to replace wording we used in the report (i.e., replacing \u201cmissing key  elements\u201d with \u201cNIST\u2019s follow-on cyber-physical activity\u201d) and delete two  report sentences which, in its view, incorrectly implied that NIST planned  to complete its cyber-physical activity and report its work results in the  issuance of the August 2010 guidelines. In its third comment, Commerce  agreed that the risk of combined cyber-physical attacks needs to be  addressed in the guidelines, but reiterated its disagreement with our report  statement that NIST was planning to cover this in the August 2010  guidelines. Based on these comments, the department suggested wording  changes to part of our recommendations to reflect its view. However, our  review of drafts of the guidelines, including one issued by NIST to the  public in February 2010, coupled with discussions with NIST officials  responsible for developing the guidelines, show that that the agency had  planned to address this topic in the August 2010 version of the guidelines.  Based on this evidence, we did not make any changes to our report.", "In addition to agreeing to our recommendations, FERC also (1)  commended the draft report\u2019s discussion of cybersecurity for the electric  industry, (2) said it appreciated the report\u2019s conclusions, and (3) described  steps it intended to take to implement the recommendations. Specifically,  with regard to our recommendation to improve coordination among  regulators, FERC stated that it intends to direct commission staff to  evaluate possible approaches to improving coordination among regulators.  In addition, FERC stated that if the commission finds that it lacks  authority to address gaps in electric industry compliance with voluntary  interoperability and cybersecurity standards, it intends to report this  information to Congress as our report recommends. Further, in response  to our recommendation to assess whether any of the challenges identified  in our report should be addressed in commission cybersecurity efforts,  FERC said it had directed commission staff to develop procedures to  perform such an assessment.", "In addition to the above comments, FERC also presented two general  issues with the report. The first is that while FERC agreed with the  challenge associated with the lack of cybersecurity metrics, identified in  the draft, it commented that developing valid metrics also presents a  separate challenge of its own. We agree with this view and believe it is  consistent with our report findings. The second issue is that according to  FERC, our report appeared to assume that all relevant manufacturers and  utilities are to comply with the voluntary standards being developed  through the process specified in EISA. To clarify, we neither stated this  assumption in our report nor was it our intent to imply such an  assumption. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the findings  described in our report show it is critical for FERC to determine the extent  to which these standards are being followed, and that is why we included  a recommendation for the agency to coordinate with state regulators and  others to achieve this goal.", "We also provided a copy of the draft report for review and comment to  DOE.

Then we analyzed agency  plans and related documentation and interviewed responsible officials to  determine the steps NIST was planning to take or had taken to meet those  responsibilities. Specifically, we analyzed NIST\u2019s plans for developing  smart grid cybersecurity guidelines, and compared them with the issued  guidelines to identify any differences. Where there was a difference  between NIST\u2019s plans and what had been completed, we analyzed the  impact of the difference and its cause.", "For the second objective, we analyzed FERC documentation, including  their interim and final Smart Grid Policy Statement, and reviewed  relevant laws and regulations. We interviewed FERC staff to better  understand their authority with respect to smart grid standards, expected  approach to standards adoption, and the extent of coordination with other regulators. We also interviewed state electricity regulators to understand  their regulatory approach and perspectives on smart grid standards being  identified and developed through the NIST process. The state regulators  we sought the views of included the Alabama Public Service Commission,  California Public Utilities Commission, Colorado Public Utilities  Commission, Nebraska Power Review Board, Public Utilities Commission  of Ohio, Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and the Public Utility  Commission of Texas. These states were selected because they had smart  grid activities of interest and were generally varied in terms of location,  size, and regulatory structure. As part of this work, we identified the steps  taken by these states to oversee interoperability and cybersecurity of  smart grid investments, although we did not evaluate their adequacy. In  Nebraska, because all utilities are consumer-owned, state electricity  regulators do not have authority to oversee whether smart grid  investments are interoperable or cyber secure. As a result, we excluded  Nebraska from any summaries of state responses presented in the body of  this report. We also met with staff from two groups representing public  and cooperatively owned utilities: the American Public Power Association  and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. Additionally, we  reached out to various electricity experts, including representatives of  standards development organizations, participants in the NIST standards  development process, and others, to gather their opinions on the strengths  and limitations of the NIST approach and standards setting.", "For our third objective, we convened a panel of experts in coordination  with the National Academy of Sciences.
