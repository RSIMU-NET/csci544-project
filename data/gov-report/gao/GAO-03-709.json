The system includes a strategic plan with goals, strategies, and objectives; a balanced scorecard to monitor progress; and a business plan that contains 97 initiatives. Of these initiatives, DLA identified 24 as linked to spare parts shortages. The DLA strategic system incorporates attributes of strategic planning outlined in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The 24 initiatives, if fully implemented, could help mitigate critical spare parts shortages and improve supply readiness because, in part, they address causes for the shortages. Of the 24 DLA-identified initiatives, 18 should improve availability of parts identified by the services as critical to readiness; and 6 should indirectly improve parts availability through modernized logistics systems and business processes. A $500-million DOD-directed aviation investment initiative, not part of DLA's strategic system, increased critical parts availability and likely supply readiness. It improved the aggregate, or total average, availability of three critical groups of DLA-managed parts in the first 3 fiscal years--2000-2002--of the 4-year initiative. However, DLA's aggregate 85-percent goal does not clearly reveal that many parts are still far below 85 percent. For example, at the end of fiscal year 2002, of the 10,291 critical aviation parts selected for investment, about 4,900 met or exceeded the aggregate measure, but over 5,400 did not. Of these, about 2,900 parts were available under 35 percent of the time. A DOD regulation, since revised to allow waivers, caused 3,342 parts to be below the 85-percent availability goal. DLA can estimate the impact of increased funding on supply availability. Investment costs, however, will be significant--DLA estimated $748 million to obtain an 85-percent minimum availability of the 219,071 most critical parts. Also, necessary inventory levels may take years to build, and increases in unit readiness are not assured because supply is only one readiness factor."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) manages about 4.6 million  consumable items, including weapon systems spare parts, with sales of  over $20 billion in fiscal year 2002.

DLA  began to strategically address ways to mitigate spare parts shortages  and improve its logistics infrastructure and operations as early as 1988.  However, managing to mitigate critical spare parts shortages is a  continuing challenge for DLA and defense managers, even though over  $1.9 billion was devoted to increasing the availability of spare parts in the  fiscal years 1999-2002 period. Concerns remain about DOD\u2019s continuing  shortages of critical spare parts for aircraft, ships, vehicles, and weapons  systems and their resulting detrimental effect on military readiness.  Also, since 1990, we have repeatedly reported that DOD\u2019s inventory  management systems and procedures were ineffective and wasteful,  putting DOD at high risk for unnecessary spending that, through good  stewardship, could be directed to higher priorities such as modernization  or readiness. In our January 2003 High Risk Series report, we wrote that  DOD was experiencing equipment readiness problems because of a lack  of key spare parts; and we recommended that DOD act to address these  shortages. While recognizing that spare parts shortages will never be  eliminated, it is reasonable to expect DOD and DLA to place a high priority  on mitigating, or reducing, the shortages that adversely impact readiness.  Such priority would be inherent in the overall stewardship of funds and  accountability for making spare parts investment decisions that provide a good readiness return.

During its first 3 fiscal years, 2000-2002, the initiative, called the  Aviation Investment Strategy, significantly improved critical aviation parts.  Shortages, however, will continue, in part, because the 85-percent  aggregate goal does not reveal that while 47 percent of the critical aviation  spare parts were raised to this level, many\u20145,414 (53 percent) as of the  end of fiscal year 2002\u2014are below the goal. Of that number, 2,904 parts,  or over half, were available less than 35 percent of the time. In addition,  DLA officials informed us that DLA\u2019s progress in buying these critical  spare parts was impeded by a DOD regulation that has since been revised  on May 23, 2003, to allow a waiver for such purchases.", "DOD transferred $500 million from the services\u2019 operations and  maintenance funds to support the initiative. The low availability of critical  aviation parts had occurred because of (1) steady declines in inventory  levels during the 1990s and (2) inventory models that optimized total  stock availability, while constrained by total cost, and did not favor  investing in low-demand, high-cost parts regardless of readiness impact.  These conditions prompted the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 1999  to direct DLA\u2019s investment of $500 million, through the initiative, in safety  level inventories of selected aviation critical parts to achieve the aggregate  85-percent goal. Our analysis of over 10,000, out of a total of over 15,000,  critical aviation parts before and after investment indicates that their  availability significantly improved over the fiscal years 2000-2002 period.  Also, additional improvement could result as DLA invests the initiative\u2019s  remaining $119 million in fiscal year 2004\u2014the fourth and last year of  investment allocation\u2014in the initiative\u2019s remaining parts. However,  5,414 of these critical aviation parts were below DLA\u2019s 85-percent goal as of  the end of fiscal year 2002.", "DLA measures its supply support effectiveness by its ability to provide  customers the parts they need based on meeting an aggregate 85-percent  availability rate. This means that the first time a customer requisitions a  part, it will be available for delivery, on average, 85 percent of the time.  Using an aggregate measure means that the actual supply availability for  individual parts will vary\u2014some items will be above 85 percent and some  well below 85 percent. But DLA targets the average availability of the group  at 85 percent.", "Our analysis shows significant improvement in the availability of critical  aviation spare parts resulting from investments made during fiscal years  2000 to 2002. It also shows that many critical aviation parts will continue to  be available well below 85 percent of the time. This occurred, in part,  because of DLA\u2019s 85-percent aggregate measure of supply support  effectiveness that was applied to each of three critical part groups, and  not individual parts, and a DOD regulation that until recently limited the  safety level inventory investment. Thus, many parts in the initiative will  have availability rates at 85 percent or higher after they receive investment  allocation, but other parts will continue to experience low availability until  further investment is made. For example, of the 10,291 parts that received  investment through fiscal year 2002, 1,397 had supply rates greater than or  equal to 85 percent before the initiative\u2019s investment. After investment  through the initiative for 3 years, that number increased to 4,877\u2014about a  250-percent increase. However, 5,414 parts still had availability rates less  than the DLA 85-percent aggregate goal; and 2,904, or 54 percent, of  these parts\u2014such as engine mount fittings for the B-52 bomber,  shoulder bolts for the F-14 Tomcat, and landing gear axles for the UH-60A  helicopter\u2014were available below 35 percent of the time. Nearly 2,400 of  these were tier 1, or the most critical, spare parts.", "Tables 5 through 8 illustrate that this trend holds true, not only for all parts  in the Aviation Investment Strategy initiative as a whole, but also for each  of the three critical part groups. Table 5 shows the aggregate improvement  for 10,291 DLA-managed critical aviation parts through investment year  2002 by various availability percent stratifications. Table 6 shows the same  information for the 8,300 Tier 1 parts, the most critical group; table 7  reflects the results of the 1,415 parts in the Tier 2 critical part group, and  table 8 shows the results of the 576 parts in the Tier 3 least critical part  group. Furthermore, similar improvement occurred in each of the military  services over the same period.", "Furthermore, our analysis of information provided by DLA revealed  that 3,342 of the 15,708 critical aviation parts in the Aviation Investment  Strategy initiative as of December 2002 could remain below DLA\u2019s  85 percent aggregate availability rate, regardless of funds available for  investment. According to DOD officials, this is because DOD Supply Chain  Materiel Management Regulation 4140.1-R limits safety level investments  by requiring they meet a specific demand limit unless that limit is waived in  cases where application of the limit significantly impairs weapon system  support. Without such a waiver, these spare parts could continually be  below DLA\u2019s availability goal, adversely affect readiness, and increase  DLA backorders. Furthermore, DLA\u2019s supply support effectiveness and  critical aviation spare parts availability to customers could continue to  be limited.", "DLA is planning another investment strategy, scheduled to begin in fiscal  year 2004 called Weapon System Readiness Improvement, subsequent to  the conclusion of the Aviation Investment Strategy initiative that could  also improve supply readiness. It is expected to target critical aviation,  land, and maritime weapon systems spare parts for investment to achieve  a minimum availability of 80 percent for each part. However, the same  lead-time constraints contained in DOD\u2019s Supply Chain Materiel  Management Regulation 4140.1-R could also prevent some of these critical  spare parts from reaching the 80-percent availability goal, meaning they  will not be available to customers when needed.", "An Office of the Secretary of Defense Inventory Management Study  conducted in August 2002 addressed a need for a focused investment in  critical spare parts that affect supply readiness. The study concluded  that low stockage levels for high-cost, low-demand consumable parts  were the predominate cause of supply-related Not Mission Capable rates  in the Air Force and Navy. Furthermore, it stated that DLA\u2019s optimization  requirements models favor the procurement of the higher-demand,  lower-cost parts, continuing the low availability trend for critical spare  parts. The Comptroller, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense,  recommended in the August 2002 DOD management study that DLA and  the services should continue efforts to ensure that high-cost, low-demand  items that would improve weapon system readiness are available when  needed\u2014an effort that might require DLA to prioritize its funding to  increase appropriate weapon system inventories to meet higher availability  of critical parts.", "The August 2002 Office of the Secretary of Defense Inventory Management  Study stated that additional efforts are required to improve the supply  managers ability to make purchase decisions based on readiness impacts  instead of aggregate availability goals. It recommended long and short-term  actions intended to more closely align supply management accountability  with readiness. The long-term recommendation was to ensure that the  department\u2019s logistics systems provide the data needed to link readiness  and supply management decisions supporting readiness based sparing  models. It noted that the Army, Navy and DLA are in the process of  changing their supply management functions from legacy systems to new  commercial systems, but this change to new commercial systems  introduces an interoperability risk because the department does not have  an overarching enterprise architecture defining the interoperability  requirements. Therefore, the study also recommended that in the interim  time remaining before the new systems are implemented the military  departments should continue to apply higher supply targets to the  inventory items associated with weapons systems that report readiness  rates below established goals. It specified that these supply targets should  be measured by several factors including supply availability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Can Estimate the Impact of Additional Investment on Supply Availability, Which Contributes to Supply Readiness", "paragraphs": ["DLA can estimate that added investment in safety level inventories of  critical readiness-related spare parts will increase parts availability and  will likely improve supply readiness of the military services. However,  there is no assurance that increased investments would affect overall  unit readiness.", "At our request, the DLA Office of Operations Research and Resource  Analysis provided investment estimates as of November 2002 to indicate  what it would cost to achieve supply availability rates of 85, 90, and  95 percent for over 219,000 of the spare parts most critical to readiness.  Part criticality was determined by the military services. Estimates  disregard DOD\u2019s limiting regulatory requirement and are based on a  minimum availability rate for each part instead of an aggregate. Because  DLA maintains some parts at rates higher than 85 percent, the overall rate  for the group will generally be higher than the minimum. Table 9 shows the  investment cost estimates at the various supply availability rates and the  effective overall availability rate for 219,071 of the military services\u2019 most  critical aviation, land, and maritime parts. For example, an investment of  $748 million was estimated to achieve a minimum supply availability rate of  85 percent for the most critical parts. When all parts that exceed the  minimum rate are considered, the overall supply availability rate is  estimated at 92 percent. As indicated in table 9, investment costs increase  considerably to achieve the 5 percent increments at the higher minimum  availability rates with little effect on the overall rate.", "Inventory quantities needed to achieve these supply levels could take  years to acquire and affect a part\u2019s availability rate. It takes up to 3 years  in some cases to procure certain critical parts; and when delivered, the  purchased quantities do not necessarily have an immediate impact on  supply availability rates. Some parts, particularly aviation parts, have  several years of acquisition lead time. For example, 351 critical aviation  parts contained in the Aviation Investment Strategy initiative have  acquisition lead times of 2 years or greater. Several parts even exceeded  3 years. In addition to this acquisition lead time, an initiative official told us  that it generally takes about 2 years before parts received from vendors  actually affect or increase supply availability rates because initial  investment dollars are used to fill an item\u2019s backorders before increasing  the part\u2019s safety level quantities. Thus, it could take as long as 5 years in  total to improve the supply availability of long acquisition lead-time parts.", "Increasing safety levels of critical spare parts inventories will likely  increase supply availability and therefore supply support readiness.  However, because of the multiple factors that affect a unit\u2019s readiness\u2014 including supply, equipment, training, and personnel\u2014investment in  critical parts does not necessarily mean that a unit\u2019s overall readiness  posture will improve. For example, an operating unit having sufficient  spare parts could still have impaired readiness due to maintenance,  training, and personnel problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["It is important for DLA, the procurer and manager of most spare parts  for the military services, to have effective supply acquisition, inventory  management, and distribution systems to ensure DOD\u2019s readiness. The  agency\u2019s strategy for its logistics planning system and its initiatives have  the attributes that, if fully implemented, could help resolve causes for  shortages and improve supply support. The strategy and initiatives also  provide a baseline for measuring progress. However, three things\u2014DOD\u2019s  Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation 4140.1-R, DLA\u2019s aggregate  measurement goal for assessing supply effectiveness, DLA\u2019s requirements  models that do not prioritize high-cost, low-demand critical spare parts\u2014 could significantly lessen DLA\u2019s potential to mitigate critical spare parts  shortages and increase military readiness. Unless waivers to the lead-time  demand limits are requested and approved as appropriate under the  current regulation, the availability of certain critical spare parts for  customers could continue to be less than 85 percent\u2014many even below  35 percent. Thus, DLA\u2019s follow-on investment initiative scheduled to begin  in fiscal year 2004 will not be as effective as it could be in increasing the  availability of critical parts that, in turn, may increase military readiness.  Continuing to manage critical spare parts based on an 85-percent aggregate  availability goal also contributes to the disparity in the availability of these  parts. Absent a minimum availability goal for buying and stocking critical  spare parts and annual performance targets for assessing progress toward  that goal, many critical spare parts shortages that impede readiness could  continue. Furthermore, prioritizing investments in spare parts is important.  Had DOD not directed DLA to focus $500 million on critical aviation parts  in the Aviation Investment Strategy, DLA would likely have continued using  quantitative models that prioritized buying and stocking low-cost, high- demand parts and not those high-cost, low-demand parts that most impact  readiness. The success of the DOD-directed initiative has shown that  prioritizing funding for critical spare parts can improve their availability  over several years and likely enhance supply readiness. Such a focused  investment is also consistent with the recommendation of the Comptroller,  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, to invest in those high-cost,  low-demand items that are critical to supply readiness.

Such waivers  would allow DLA to buy sufficient critical spare parts that affect  readiness of service weapon systems to attain an 85-percent minimum  availability goal;  change the agency\u2019s current aggregate 85-percent supply availability  goal for critical spare parts that affect readiness, to a minimum 85- percent supply availability goal for each critical spare part, and because  of the long lead times in acquiring certain critical parts, establish annual  performance targets for achieving the 85-percent minimum goal; and  prioritize funding as necessary to achieve the annual performance  targets and ultimately the 85-percent minimum supply availability goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on this report, DOD generally concurred with the  draft report and the intent of the recommendations, but not all of the  specified actions we recommended.

We agree with that action.", "Although DOD concurred with the intent of our second and third  recommendations, DOD did not agree with the need to replace the  aggregate 85-percent supply availability goal with a minimum 85-percent  supply availability goal for critical spare parts, establish annual  performance targets for achieving the minimum goal, or prioritize funding  to achieve it. Instead, DOD said DLA is working toward a readiness-based  sparing concept of tailoring different support level goals by item with a link  between an item\u2019s availability and desired inventory levels rather than one  standard level of support for all critical items. Additionally, DOD stated that  setting an 85-percent minimum goal across the universe of critical items  would undermine the efficiencies of optimization that may be achieved by  working toward different supply availability goals for different parts based  on readiness impact. It cited that its Customer Relationship Management  initiative, which is scheduled to start in fiscal year 2005 and be fully  operational in fiscal year 2009, will use service level agreements to provide  this type of tailored support. It stated that funding would then be  prioritized accordingly in concert with the implementation of the new  tailored approach.", "We disagree that the actions DOD prescribes will be sufficient, particularly  in the near term, to address the need for DLA to increase critical spare  parts availability. As our report notes, DLA is responsible for managing  hundreds of thousands of critical parts that the services have identified  as crucial to weapons systems readiness. However, many of these parts are  not available to meet service needs. DLA has been using the same 85- percent aggregate goal for stocking these critical parts as it has for  non-critical parts. Based on our work, DLA was not managing its inventory  by developing individual item supply availability targets tailored to desired  readiness levels. Although DLA has started using service level agreements,  which are a component of DLA\u2019s Customer Relationship Management  initiative, as our report notes, these agreements have a limited scope and  are considered a work in progress. DLA plans to execute 11 agreements by  the end of fiscal year 2003 and as noted, full implementation for the  Customer Relationship Management initiative is scheduled for fiscal year  2009. Furthermore, managing to an 85-percent aggregate goal does not  reveal the significant shortages in availability of many individual critical  parts. For example, after 3 years of focused investment to increase the  availability of over 10,000 critical aviation parts, 53 percent were not  available at the 85-percent aggregate goal and over half of these parts were  available below 35 percent of the time.", "DOD\u2019s response proposes, what we agree is, an optimum approach that is  consistent with the desire expressed in the August 2002 Office of Secretary  of Defense Inventory Management Study for supply managers to make  purchase decisions based on readiness impacts instead of aggregate  availability goals. However, according to the August report, implementing  this approach is a long-term effort dependent on DLA and the services\u2019  logistics systems providing the data needed to link readiness and supply  management decisions that has interoperability risks because the  department does not have an overarching architecture for integrating such  systems. The August report, therefore, recommended that until these new  systems are implemented to provide more visibility into the relationship  between inventory levels and weapon system readiness, DLA and the  military departments should continue to apply higher supply availability  targets to the inventory items associated with weapon systems where  readiness is below established goals.", "As DLA plans another investment strategy, subsequent to the conclusion of  the Aviation Investment Strategy initiative, that will expand the number of  critical parts that are targeted for investment by including land and  maritime items, it needs a clear minimum goal for the availability of these  parts, annual performance targets for measuring progress, and focused  funding. Therefore, until the systems, initiatives, and agreements are in  place to support the department\u2019s prescribed approach for optimizing  efficiencies of supply availability and investment, we continue to believe  our recommendations to set a minimum goal of 85 percent for each critical  spare part, establish annual performance targets for achieving the goal, and  prioritize funding accordingly are reasonable interim actions to meet the  services\u2019 readiness goals for parts they have identified as critical  to readiness.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Director, Defense Logistics Agency; the Director, Office of Management  and Budget; and other interested congressional committees and parties.

All order fulfillment, planning, and financial management activities will  be supported by the new software that impacts DLA\u2019s financial, material  management, and sales and distribution logistics operations. DOD  approved the initiative on December 21, 1999, and DLA began a concept  demonstration test phase, also referred to as \u201cRelease 1,\u201d of the new  initiative software on July 31, 2002. DLA transferred about 170,000 items  for the initial test phase from its legacy systems among its three inventory  supply centers at Columbus, Ohio; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and  Richmond, Virginia. About 2.5 million customer orders have been made  using the new BSM technology involving around $500 million in sales. A  follow-on test phase, or \u201cRelease 2,\u201d of the initiative is scheduled to begin in  July 2004, and it will include 50 percent of the remaining items that DLA  manages.

The initiative supports DLA\u2019s plan to structure internal processes to  (1) deliver customer outcomes effectively and efficiently, (2) design and  implement a best value enterprise information technology environment,  and (3) improve distribution responsiveness and reduce costs. By  improving the supply process by which spare parts are provided to  customers, as well as reducing wait time, the Distribution Planning and  Management System initiative could contribute to the improvement of  spare parts shortages and potentially the readiness of the military services.  The initiative seeks to meet assigned objectives for weapon systems  readiness support. According to DLA, additional benefits include cost  reductions for transportation and overall distribution; greater use of DOD  negotiated rates, more consolidated shipments, and increased productivity  of distribution and transportation operations.

A reduction in customer wait time could improve spare parts shortages by  providing items to the customer faster than if the items had to be delivered  from more distant distribution points. An additional benefit could be  reduced shipping costs because strategic distribution emphasizes the use  of other shipping methods, such as dedicated trucks for deliveries within  the United States and surface transports for overseas shipping, to replace  air transport, which has a higher material shipping cost.
