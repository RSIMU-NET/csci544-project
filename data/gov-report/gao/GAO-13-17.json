FTA does receive some assurance that agencies are complying with federal statutes and regulations, including ADA paratransit requirements, because transit agencies that receive FTA funding are required to self-certify and assure that they are complying with the Department of Transportation's ADA regulations. Additionally, FTA conducts specialized ADA paratransit compliance reviews that examine multiple aspects of an agency's paratransit services; however, few transit agencies are selected for review each year. FTA generally relies on complaints, media reports, experience with an agency, and other information to select agencies for review, but does not have documented criteria for selecting agencies. This informal selection process does not align with federal guidance on internal controls related to communication, documentation, and monitoring. Lastly, according to FTA officials, all finalized ADA paratransit compliance review reports are to be available on FTA's website, but GAO identified nine final review reports--conducted from 2004 to 2010--that have not been posted to FTA's website.", "Based on GAO's survey, the demand for ADA paratransit trips increased, since 2007 for some transit agencies, and costs for providing the trips remain high. The average number of annual ADA paratransit trips provided by a transit agency increased 7 percent from 2007 to 2010; from 172,481 trips in 2007 to 184,856 trips in 2010. Increases in demand for ADA paratransit services were driven by the 10 largest transit agencies, measured according to the population size of their service areas. Also, ADA paratransit trips are much more costly to provide than fixed-route trips. Similarly, the average cost of providing an ADA paratransit trip in 2010 was $29.30, an estimated three and a half times more expensive than the average cost of $8.15 to provide a fixed-route trip. The average cost of providing an ADA paratransit trip increased 10 percent from 2007 to 2010. GAO's analysis of ADA paratransit data available in FTA's National Transit Database (NTD) found that, according to GAO standards for data reliability, the data are not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of assessing changes in ADA paratransit demand and costs. For example, GAO found discrepancies, such as incomplete data, that may understate or overstate the number of ADA trips and amount of ADA expenses. According to FTA officials, some transit agencies fail to report these data, while others misunderstand the data fields and make reporting errors as a result.", "Transit agencies are taking actions such as coordinating with other transportation providers, offering travel training, and improving accessibility to address changes in ADA paratransit demand and costs. According to GAO's survey, about 59 percent of transit agencies are coordinating with health and human services providers to improve ADA paratransit services or address the costs of providing such services. About 44 percent of transit agencies are coordinating with other local transportation providers.

The findings of  non-compliance in the reports discussed above are not generalizable to  the 628 urbanized area fixed-route transit agencies, both because of the  low number of reviews conducted and because the reviews were not  conducted on a generalizable sample of transit agencies. Rather, FTA  officials told us that the transit agencies that receive the specialized  compliance reviews are specifically selected by FTA for review because  FTA has reason to believe those agencies may be experiencing ADA  paratransit compliance issues.", "Although FTA uses a risk-based approach to determine which transit  agencies are selected for compliance reviews, FTA does not have a  formalized or transparent selection process. According to FTA officials,  transit agencies may be selected for an ADA paratransit compliance  review for any number of reasons including rider complaints, which,  according to FTA officials, are the best indicators available for making the  most effective use of compliance resources, media coverage, findings  from triennial reviews, legal actions that do not involve FTA, information  from the transportation industry, congressional interest, and input from  FTA regional offices. In selecting an agency for review, FTA may also  consider the burden to a transit agency if it were to receive multiple  oversight reviews, such as triennial reviews or state compliance reviews,  in the same fiscal year. In those cases, FTA officials said they take steps  to focus contractor and oversight resources to decrease burden on the  transit agency, while still addressing possible compliance issues. FTA  officials, however, could not provide documentation that outlines the  compliance review selection criteria, and stated that there are no  formalized criteria to guide the selection of transit agencies for review. As  discussed above, the ADA paratransit compliance review process is  documented, so the lack of documented selection criteria is notable.

Based on our literature review, one of  the most effective and long-lasting techniques that can be employed to  reduce the demand for ADA paratransit is transitioning paratransit  passengers to fixed-route service through travel training and offering  incentives to encourage existing paratransit passengers to use the fixed- route transit service, where possible, which we explain more fully below.  One source described this as a \u201cwin-win\u201d proposition for both the transit  agency and the individual. The transit agency is able to use excess  capacity on its fixed-route system at minimal cost to the agency. By using  the fixed-route system, the passenger may be able to access a wider  variety of services and destinations, does not have to pre-schedule travel  on paratransit vehicles, and could save money by paying lower fares for  fixed-route trips.", "To assist ADA paratransit riders in transitioning to fixed-route service,  several transit agencies are using travel-training programs that help show  riders on how they can use the fixed-route system. Our survey results  show that about 55 percent of transit agencies use travel training as a  demand management and cost containment strategy. Some transit  agency officials stated that travel training may reduce costs. For example,  King County Metro (Seattle, Washington) reported spending about  $573,000 in 2011 to provide travel training to over 300 individuals, but  estimated it saved about $1,290,000 in paratransit costs by successfully  transitioning paratransit patrons to the fixed-route system. Similarly,  officials from New Jersey Transit (Newark, New Jersey) told us that they  have been successful in getting riders to use the fixed-route system by  offering travel training. They have not quantified how many trips are being  diverted from paratransit, but told us that surveys of those who have  taken travel training show that many are using the fixed-route system.", "Some transit agencies offer financial incentives to ADA paratransit eligible  individuals to use fixed-route transit services. These incentives are also  sometimes extended to persons accompanying the ADA paratransit  eligible rider, which may encourage use of the fixe-route system by  persons who cannot use it independently. Some (5 of the 20) transit  agencies we interviewed said that they offer fixed-route fare incentives.  For example, Access Services (Los Angeles County, California) offers  paratransit riders free fixed-route trips on fixed-route systems throughout  the county. According to Access Services, in July 2012, ADA paratransit  registrants took 2.1 million trips on Los Angeles County fixed-route  systems. On an annual basis\u2014assuming that over 25 million trips will be  taken per year at a cost of $20 per trip\u2014this represents a cost savings of  $500 million, according to Access Services.

However, according to FTA officials, one of the  biggest challenges to using fixed route is the inaccessibility (or  nonexistence) of sidewalks and pedestrian infrastructure. For example,  lack of sidewalks may prevent persons with disabilities from traveling to  fixed-route bus stops, thereby increasing the need for ADA paratransit  services. However, such pedestrian improvements rarely fall under the  transit system\u2019s direct influence or control. To assist transit agencies in  addressing these improvements, FTA issued a policy in 2011 that  simplifies the process for grantees to qualify for FTA funding for  pedestrian improvements that are related to transit service.
