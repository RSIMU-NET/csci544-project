GAO found, for example, that, following Board procedures, Board staff evaluating the notifications collected and considered comments from the general public, industry specialists, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection and recommended to the Board whether to authorize companies' proposed activities. Of the 59 notifications GAO reviewed for seven industry categories, 49 notifications either were approved or were approved with restrictions\u2014for example, the proposed activity was authorized for a limited time period or certain duty benefits were denied for one or more foreign components. Ten notifications were denied for reasons such as new or complex policy issues that required further review.", "The Board also has procedures that generally align with its regulations for evaluating production applications and followed these procedures for the three applications GAO reviewed. The applications were submitted by three of the companies whose notifications were denied. According to Board staff, if a notification is not approved or is approved with restrictions, a company may submit an application with additional details. Following Board procedures, Board staff, for example, collected and considered comments and recommended to the Board whether to authorize the proposed activities. Two of the applications were approved with restrictions, and the third was not approved. While the regulations require consideration of a number of criteria\u2014for example, consistency with U.S. trade and tariff law\u2014Board staff did not document consideration of all required criteria for two of the three applications, and the procedures do not require such documentation. Board staff said they document only the most relevant criteria in their reports. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should document its rationale for determining a criterion is not relevant and make this documentation readily available for examination.

Companies authorized to  operate in FTZs are able to import foreign-source components for use in  manufacturing finished goods without paying customs duties or fees until  the goods are transferred from the FTZs into U.S. commerce.  Under the  program, authorized companies operating in FTZs may be allowed, in  certain circumstances, to reduce, eliminate, or defer payment of customs  duties or fees for goods manufactured or stored in FTZs and pay no  duties or fees for goods exported directly from the FTZs to other  countries. In 2016, the value of foreign- and domestic-source components  admitted into FTZs exceeded $610 billion, of which $108 billion\u2014almost  18 percent\u2014represented foreign components to be used in the  production of finished goods in the zone.

In reviewing production notifications and  applications, the Board is responsible for taking into account a range of  criteria that include the net economic effect on the U.S. economy, such as  U.S employment. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for oversight and enforcement in  FTZs, including collecting revenue and assessing risk of noncompliance  with U.S. laws and regulations.

Duty  rates for those components generally range  from 0 percent to approximately 10 percent.   As a result, the company would pay lower  custom duties to manufacture automobiles in  an FTZ than it would pay outside the FTZ.", "To encourage companies to maintain and expand their operations in the  United States, the FTZ program offers a range of benefits, including the  possible reduction or elimination of duties on certain imported goods. For  example, a company operating in an FTZ that manufactures products  using foreign materials or components can pay lower overall duties by  electing to pay the duty rate for the finished product rather than for the  product\u2019s imported foreign component parts, which may have a higher  duty rate (see sidebar). This benefit provides an incentive to companies  to manufacture in the United States rather than move their manufacturing  operations overseas to avoid paying U.S. duties. We reported in July  2017 that, while FTZs were created to provide benefits to the American  public, little is known about their overall economic impact.

Board staff said that the  2012 regulations allow the Board to approve notifications and applications  with restrictions. For example, the Board may decide to, among other  things, (1) authorize the exemption of duty payments on some, but not all,  components named in the notification for the proposed production activity;  (2) authorize the activity for a limited time period; or (3) authorize the  activity for a specified quantity of the component to be brought into the  FTZ.", "The following describes the notification and application processes under  the 2012 regulations.", "Notification process. A company must first submit a production  notification\u2014which requires less information from companies than a  production application\u2014requesting production authority in an FTZ. If  the Board approves a company\u2019s notification, the company can begin  the production activity. For example, in a 2013 notification, a company  requested authority to produce printing plates used in the newspaper  industry and to pay duties at the duty rate applicable to the final  product (i.e., printing plates) instead of the duty rates applicable to the  five individual foreign-source components (e.g., aluminum coils). The  Board approved the notification without restrictions, allowing the  company to begin conducting the authorized activity. If a notification is  approved with restrictions, the company may begin the production  activity while adhering to the specified restrictions. For example, in  another 2013 notification, a company requested authority to produce  sports safety helmets, bicycle baby seats, and bicycle car-carrier  racks and pay duties on the final products instead of paying individual  duties on some foreign-source components (e.g., helmet and baby  seat parts). The Board approved the notification with a restriction,  authorizing the company to begin the production activity but requiring  it to pay duty on one foreign-source component (textile bags).", "Application process. According to Board staff, if a notification is  approved with restrictions or denied, the company may file a more  detailed production application to continue seeking authority for the  activity that was restricted or denied. If the Board does not  unanimously decide to authorize the application with or without  restrictions, the production authority is denied. For example, in 2012,  the Board determined that a notification requesting that a company\u2019s  existing authority to produce plastic adhesive bandages in an FTZ be  expanded to include production of fabric adhesive bandages using  foreign-source textile components warranted further review and  denied the notification. The company subsequently filed an application  for the expanded authority, providing additional information to support  its request, which the Board also denied.

If the Board identifies any concerns that it  deems significant enough to deny a notification, the application process  allows the Board to collect more information to inform further analysis.  Board staff stated that examples of concerns related to production  notifications and applications might include objections from domestic  producers of component materials, such as textiles, who believe they  would be negatively affected by duty reduction on foreign-source  components used in the proposed production activity.", "According to the Board, of the 293 production notifications submitted from  April 2012 through September 2017 for which it rendered decisions, 218  notifications were approved without restrictions, 62 were approved with  restrictions, and 13 were not approved (see fig. 3).

To select our  sample of 59 notifications, we first selected 10 of the 13 notifications  submitted during the selected time period that were not approved by the  Board. We did not select the remaining 3 notifications that were not  approved, because the companies that submitted those notifications  subsequently submitted production applications and the Board\u2019s  decisions about the applications were pending when we made our  selection. The notifications that were not approved were submitted by  companies in seven industry categories\u2014silicones/polysilicon,  textiles/footwear, oil refineries/petrochemical facilities, other energy,  chemicals, medical supplies and devices and miscellaneous. For each of  these seven categories, our sample of 59 notifications includes all  notifications for which the Board had rendered decisions at the time of our  selection and excludes any for which decisions were pending. Our  sample does not include six production notifications submitted by  companies in the textiles/footwear industry category that the Board did  not approve or approved with restrictions, because those companies  subsequently submitted applications. Our final sample of 59 notifications  includes all three types of Board decisions (34 approved, 15 approved  with restrictions, and 10 not approved). However, because of its size, our  final sample is not generalizable to all notifications submitted from April  2012 through September 2017. We also selected and analyzed three  production applications, respectively submitted by three companies that  submitted 3 of the 59 notifications we analyzed. These three applications  were the only applications that the Board reviewed and rendered final  decisions on from April 2012 through September 2017.", "We analyzed case records containing documents that companies  submitted when they filed their production notifications and applications;  information collected by Board staff from public comments in response to  Federal Register notices; comments from industry specialists at  Commerce, CBP, and the Department of Justice; and reports prepared by  Board staff, documenting their analyses and recommendations for each  notification and application. To conduct a systematic assessment of the  case records, we created a data collection instrument to determine,  among other things, whether the applicant submitted all required  information for each notification and application. In addition, at least two  analysts, including an economist, independently reviewed each case  record; any resulting disagreements were resolved through discussion  among team members and, as appropriate, with Board staff. Further, we  collected and analyzed data for these cases on the types of Board  decisions (approved, approved with restrictions, and not approved); the  extent of public comments received for both notifications and applications;  the extent of industry specialists\u2019 and CBP\u2019s comments; the types and  amount of notification restrictions; and whether the duration of the Board\u2019s  evaluations was within the time frames detailed in the Board\u2019s regulations  and procedures. We also determined the extent to which the  recommendations of the Board\u2019s analysts, Commerce\u2019s industry  specialists, the Board\u2019s Executive Secretary, and Board members were in  agreement. We determined that the case records data we reviewed,  which we obtained from the Board\u2019s case tracking system, were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes of understanding the universe of  notifications and applications submitted for production authority and  reviewing a sample from that universe. To make this determination, we  took steps that included reviewing related documentation guidance for the  Board\u2019s case records tracking system; interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials; and reviewing a sample of cases with our data collection  instrument, which confirmed information included in the case tracking  system data.", "Further, we analyzed the extent to which Board staff considered all  required threshold and economic factors and any significant public  benefits for the three applications in our sample.
