These schools provide a range of educational services including programs for students with disabilities and those who struggle to read, some of whom may have a condition referred to as dyslexia. To determine how DOD supports students with dyslexia and how it used $3.2 million in funds designated to support them, GAO was asked to examine: (1) what professional development DOD provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and how the fiscal year 2004-to-2006 funds designated for this purpose were used, (2) what identification and instructional services DOD provides to students who may have dyslexia, and (3) how DOD assesses the academic achievement of students with disabilities, including dyslexia. To address these objectives, GAO conducted a survey of all school principals and interviewed agency officials, school personnel, and parents in six school districts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD provides a mix of online and classroom training to teachers who work with students who struggle to read, and DOD used 2004-to-2006 funds designated for professional development on dyslexia, in particular, to supplement these efforts. Most of the online and classroom professional development prepares teachers and specialists to assess student literacy and provides them with strategies to teach students who have particular difficulties. For the 2004-to-2006 funding for professional development on dyslexia, DOD supplemented its existing training with online courses that include specific modules on dyslexia and tools to assess students' literacy skills. DOD identifies students who struggle to read--some of who may have dyslexia--through standardized tests and provides them with supplemental reading instruction. DOD uses standardized tests to screen its students and identify those who need additional reading instruction, but these schools do not generally label them as dyslexic. To teach students they identify as struggling readers, DOD schools primarily employ an intensive multimedia reading program that is highly regarded by the principals, teachers, and parents GAO interviewed. Those students whose performance does not improve through their enrollment in supplemental reading programs or who have profound reading difficulties may be eligible to receive special education services. DOD is subject to many of the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 on the education of students with disabilities. Students with dyslexia may qualify for these services, but they must meet program eligibility requirements. DOD uses the same standardized tests it uses for all students to assess the academic achievement of students with disabilities, including those who may have dyslexia, but does not report specifically on the outcomes for students with disabilities. A primary goal of DOD's strategic plan is for all students to meet or exceed challenging academic standards. To measure progress towards this goal, DOD assesses all students' academic achievement and school performance by comparing test scores to a national norm or to a national proficiency level. Overall, students perform well in reading compared to U.S. public school students. DOD disaggregates test scores for students with disabilities but does not report such information publicly. In contrast, U.S. public school systems under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 must report such data. Without this information, it is difficult for parents, policy makers, and others to measure the academic achievement of students with disabilities relative to all other students in the DOD school system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The children of many of our nation\u2019s military and civilian personnel  overseas and on certain military bases in the United States depend on the  Department of Defense (DOD) schools to meet their educational needs\u2014 from prekindergarten through 12th grade.

In  response to these questions, we examined: (1) what professional  development DOD provides its staff to support students with dyslexia and  how the fiscal years 2004-to-2006 funds designated for this purpose were  used, (2) what identification and instructional services DOD provides to  students who may have dyslexia, and (3) how DOD assesses the academic  achievement of students with disabilities, including dyslexia.", "To meet these objectives, we obtained documentation from DOD,  conducted a Web-based survey of all 208 DOD school principals, visited or  interviewed by phone officials and parents in six school districts, and  interviewed agency officials and representatives of education  organizations. We obtained several agency reports including: a 2007 report  to Congress on DOD\u2019s efforts to assist students with dyslexia and a 2005  survey of DOD special education personnel. We reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and agency guidance and also obtained information on  DOD\u2019s obligation and disbursement of funds designated for professional  development on dyslexia.

The Department of Defense Education Activity  (DODEA) administers schools both within the United States and overseas.  In school year 2006-07, DODEA had schools within 7 states, Puerto Rico,  Guam, and in 13 foreign countries. DOD has organized its 208 schools into  three areas: the Americas (65), Europe (98), and Pacific (45). Almost all of  the domestic schools are located in the southern United States. The  overseas schools are mostly concentrated in Germany and Japan, where  the U.S. built military bases after World War II. Given the transient nature  of military assignments, these schools must adapt to a high rate of  students transferring into and out of their schools. According to DOD,  about 30 percent of its students move from one school to another each  year. These students may transfer between DOD schools or between one  DOD school and a U.S. public school.", "Although DOD is not subject to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  (NCLBA), it has its own assessment and accountability framework. Unlike  public schools, DOD schools receive funding primarily from DOD  appropriations rather than through state and local governments or  Department of Education grants. U.S. public schools that receive grants  through the NCLBA must comply with testing and reporting requirements  designed to hold schools accountable for educating their students and  making adequate yearly progress. DOD has adopted its own accountability  framework that includes a 5-year strategic plan, an annual report that  measures the overall school system\u2019s progress, and data requirements for  school improvement plans. The strategic plan sets the strategic direction  for the school system and outlines goals and performance measures to  determine progress. In annual reports, DOD provides a broad overview of  its students\u2019 overall progress, including the results of standardized tests.  On DOD\u2019s Web site, DOD publishes more detailed test score results for  each school at each grade level. DOD also requires each school to develop  its own improvement plan that identifies specific goals and methods to  measure progress. School officials have the flexibility to decide what goals  to pursue but must identify separate sources of data to measure their  progress in order to provide a more complete assessment. For example, if  a school chooses to focus on improving its reading scores, it must identify  separate assessment tests or other ways of measuring the progress of its  students.", "DOD is subject to many of the major provisions of IDEIA and must include  students with disabilities in its standardized testing. However, unlike  states and districts subject to NCLBA, DOD is not required to report  publicly on the academic achievement of these students. States and public  school districts that receive funding through IDEIA must comply with  various substantive, procedural, and reporting requirements for students  with disabilities. For example, they must have a program in place for  evaluating and identifying children with disabilities, developing an  individualized education program (IEP) for such students, and periodically  monitoring each student\u2019s academic progress under his or her IEP. Under  IDEIA, children with disabilities must be taught, to the extent possible,  with non-disabled students in the least restrictive environment, such as the  general education classroom, and must be included in standardized testing  unless appropriate accommodations or alternate assessments are required  by their IEPs. Although DOD schools do not receive funding through  IDEIA, they generally are subject to the same requirements concerning the  education of children with disabilities. However, unlike states and  districts that are subject to NCLBA, DOD schools are not required to  report publicly on the performance of children with disabilities on regular  and alternate assessments.", "Definitions of dyslexia vary from broad definitions that encompass almost  all struggling readers to narrow definitions that only apply to severe cases  of reading difficulty. However, DOD and others have adopted a definition  developed by dyslexia researchers and accepted by the International  Dyslexia Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping  individuals with dyslexia. This definition describes dyslexics as typically  having a deficit in the phonological component of language, the individual  speech sounds that make up words, which typically causes difficulty with  accurate or fluent word recognition, poor spelling ability, and problems in  reading comprehension that can impede growth of vocabulary. Recent  research has identified a gene that may be associated with dyslexia and  has found that dyslexia often coincides with behavior disorders or speech  and language disabilities and can range from mild to severe. Nevertheless,  the percentage of people who have dyslexia is unknown with estimates  varying from 3 to 20 percent, depending on the definition and  identification method used.

These courses  are DOD\u2019s primary professional development on literacy for general  education teachers. According to DOD, the department began offering the  courses during the 2003-04 school year. DOD officials told us that since  that time about half of the nearly 8,700 teachers in DOD schools have  taken at least one Scholastic RED online course. Of the school principals  who responded to our survey, almost all indicated that some of their staff  members, including administrators and general and special education  teachers, had participated in Scholastic RED training. Beyond Scholastic  RED courses, DOD officials we interviewed told us that general education  teachers also receive literacy development through instructional training  in subject areas other than reading. For example, professional  development on teaching at the middle school level may include guidance  on how to enhance students\u2019 reading skills through the study of a  particular science.", "Most professional development for staff working with struggling readers  focuses on the assessment of student literacy skills and presents strategies  for instructing students who struggle to read, some of whom may have  dyslexia. Scholastic RED online courses train teachers in five basic  elements of reading instruction: phonemic awareness, comprehension,  phonics, fluency, and vocabulary. Research suggests that both phonics and  phonemic awareness pose significant challenges to people who have  dyslexia. According to course implementation materials, the training is  designed to move beyond online course content and allow participants the  opportunity to apply new skills in site-based study groups as well as in the  classroom. Some principals and teachers indicated their schools follow  this model with groups of teachers meeting to discuss best practices for  applying Scholastic RED knowledge and resources in their classrooms.", "DOD districts and schools sometimes offer their own literacy training  through a localized effort or initiative. Professional development unique to  a DOD district or school may be offered by a district\u2019s special education  coordinator. For example, the special education coordinator in a domestic  district told us she offers literacy training to all staff, explaining that she  tries to create a broader base of professionals who can more accurately  identify and instruct students who are struggling readers. Regarding  overseas schools, administrators in Korea told us they offer in-service  workshops to help teachers improve student literacy, reading  comprehension, and writing.", "DOD designed and provided additional training on literacy instruction for  most special education teachers and other specialists under a special  education initiative. The training provided these staff members with  courses on how students develop literacy skills and how to teach reading  across all grade levels. According to a 2004-05 DOD survey on the  initiative, over half of special educators and other specialists said they had  completed this training. Since the 2003-04 school year, special education  teachers and other specialists have received training on topics such as the  evaluation of young children\u2019s literacy skills and adjusting instruction  based on student performance. The department also provided speech and  language pathologists specialized training to help them assist struggling  readers, including guidance on basic elements of literacy instruction and  development, such as phonological awareness and vocabulary  development.", "DOD offers another literacy professional development program for special  education teachers and other specialists known as Language Essentials for  Teachers of Reading and Spelling (LETRS). According to the department,  LETRS is designed to give teachers a better understanding of how students  learn to read and write, showing instructors how to use such knowledge to  improve targeted instruction for every type of reader. According to our  survey results, about 10 percent of schools had staff who had taken this  course. The LETRS course is based on the concept that once teachers  understand the manner in which students approach reading and spelling  tasks, they can make more informed decisions on instructional  approaches for all readers. Much like the other literacy training DOD  offers, LETRS modules contain reading instruction approaches on areas  that may present challenges for those who have dyslexia: phonemic  awareness, vocabulary, and reading comprehension.", "Overall, DOD staff told us the literacy training the department offered was  useful for them, with some indicating they wanted additional training. In  responding to our survey, more than 80 percent of the principals who said  their staff used Scholastic RED courses rated them as very useful for  specialized instruction. Principals we interviewed told us their teachers  characterize Scholastic RED concepts as practical and easy to apply in the  classroom. While teachers we interviewed told us Scholastic RED training  is helpful, some special education teachers indicated the course material is  basic and better-suited to meet the developmental needs of general  education teachers than special education teachers. For example, one  special education teacher we spoke to said Scholastic RED courses do  little to enhance the professional skills of special education teachers  because many of these teachers have already received advanced training  on reading interventions. Special education teachers did indicate,  however, that training offered through the department\u2019s special education  initiative has provided them with identification strategies and intervention  tools to support struggling readers. Regarding the impact of the initiative\u2019s  training, a DOD survey of special education teachers and other specialists  found that over half of respondents said they had seen evidence of  professional development designed to maximize the quality of special  education services, and most had completed some professional  development. The department did report, however, that respondents  working with elementary school students frequently requested more  training in areas such as phonemic awareness, while respondents working  with high school students requested more professional development in a  specific supplemental reading program used at DOD schools: Read 180.  Moreover, teachers we interviewed in both foreign and domestic locations  said they would like additional training on identifying and teaching  students with specific types of reading challenges, including dyslexia.

According to DOD, this  course was designed to present teachers with strategies for instructing  struggling readers in the early K-2 grade levels and contains six modules  on the components of reading, including a specific module on dyslexia.  The K-2 course was first made available in January 2006 to teachers who  participated in a pilot project.  DOD then opened the course to all teachers  in February 2007.  According to our survey results, 29 percent of the  schools serving grades K-2 had used the course by the end of the school  year. Nearly half of those school principals who indicated their staff used  the course, however, did not indicate the extent to which it had been  helpful in supporting struggling readers.

DOD  reported obligating about one-third of the designated funds for the  Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment  tool. The DIBELS assessment allows a teacher to evaluate a student\u2019s  literacy skills in a one-on-one setting through a series of one-minute  exercises that can be administered via pen and paper or through the use of  a hand-held electronic device. By using the exercises, teachers can  measure and monitor these students\u2019 skill levels in concepts such as  phoneme segmentation fluency, a reading component that often gives  dyslexics significant difficulty. DIBELS was used to help identify  struggling readers in at least half of the schools serving grades K-2,  according to our survey results, and DOD plans to begin use of the  assessment in additional locations during the 2007-08 school year.", "However, school officials and teachers had mixed reactions regarding the  ease and effectiveness of using DIBELS to help identify struggling readers.  In responding to our survey, about 40 percent of principals whose schools  used DIBELS to help identify struggling readers indicated it was very or  extremely useful, about 30 percent indicated it was moderately useful, and  about 20 percent indicated it was either slightly or not at all useful.  Several principals we surveyed indicated that they liked the instant results  provided by the DIBELS assessment. For example, one principal called the  assessment a quick and easy way to assess reading skills, saying it  provides teachers with immediate feedback to help inform decisions about  instruction. Others indicated the assessment is time-consuming for  teachers. One kindergarten teacher we interviewed said that it is  challenging to find the time to administer the test because it must be  individually administered. Another principal expressed concern about the  difficulty in using the electronic hand-held devices, saying the technology  poses the greatest challenge to teachers in using the DIBELS assessment.  According to DOD officials, the agency is currently evaluating its use of  DIBELS, searching for other assessment tools, and will use the results to  determine whether to continue using DIBELS or replace it with another  tool. DOD purchased four other instruments to aid teachers in the  evaluation of literacy skills; however, the tools are targeted to specific  reading problems.

The 2007 NAEP reading  test results ranked the DOD school system among the top for all school  systems. Specifically, on the eighth grade test, DOD tied for first place  with two states among all states and jurisdictions and on the fourth grade  test, tied with one state for third place.", "All students, including those with disabilities, participate in DOD\u2019s  systemwide assessments using either the standard DOD assessment or  alternate assessments. In some cases, students who require  accommodations to complete the standard assessment may need to take  the test in a small group setting, get extended time for taking the test, or  have directions read aloud to them. Some students with severe disabilities  may take an alternate assessment if required by the student\u2019s  individualized education program. An alternate assessment determines  academic achievement by compiling and assessing certain documentation,  such as a student\u2019s work products, interviews, photographs, and videos.  According to an official from DODEA\u2019s Office of System Accountability  and Research, DOD provides an alternate assessment to fewer than 200 of  its roughly 90,000 students each year.", "For use within the department and in some districts and schools, DOD  disaggregates TerraNova test scores for students with disabilities. DOD  officials reported that they disaggregate scores for the entire school  system, each area, and each district, in order to gauge the academic  performance of students with disabilities. DOD\u2019s policy states that DOD  shall internally report on the performance of children with disabilities  participating in its systemwide assessments. According to DOD officials,  they use the data to determine progress toward goals and to guide  program and subject area planning. According to our survey results, over  90 percent of DOD schools disaggregate their test scores by gender and  race and about 85 percent disaggregate for students with disabilities for  internal purposes. Some school officials told us they use test data in order  to track students\u2019 progress, assess the effectiveness of services they offer  students, identify areas of improvement, and assess school performance.  For example, one Superintendent who shared her disaggregated data with  us showed how third-grade students with disabilities made up over half of  those who read below grade level in her district.", "DOD does not generally report disaggregated test scores for students with  disabilities. DOD\u2019s annual report provides data at each grade level, and  test scores posted on its Web site provide data for each school. DOD also  reports some results by race and ethnicity for the NAEP test.  However,  DOD does not disaggregate its TerraNova test data for students with  disabilities or other subgroups. A primary goal of its strategic plan is for all  students to meet or exceed challenging academic content standards, and  DOD uses standardized test score data to determine progress towards this  goal. Disaggregating these data provides a mechanism for determining  whether groups of students, such as those with disabilities, are meeting  academic proficiency goals. However, unlike U.S. public school systems  that are subject to the No Child Left Behind Act, DOD is not required to  report test scores of designated student groups. According to DOD  officials, they do not report test results for groups of fewer than 20  students with disabilities because doing so may violate their privacy by  making it easier to identify individual students. Where there are groups of  20 or more students with disabilities, DOD officials said they do not report  it publicly because it might invite comparisons between one school and  another when all of them do well compared to U.S. public schools. DOD  officials did not comment on any negative implications of such  comparisons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["On the whole, DOD students perform well in reading compared with  public school students in the United States, and in some cases DOD ranks  near the top of all school systems, as measured by students\u2019 performance  on standardized tests. DOD has programs and resources in place to  provide supplemental instruction to students who have low scores on  standardized tests or who otherwise qualify for special education services,  some of whom may have dyslexia. The department generally includes  these students when administering national tests. Nevertheless, by not  reporting specifically on the achievement of students with disabilities,  including those who may have dyslexia, DOD may be overlooking an area  that might require attention and thereby reducing its accountability.  Without these publicly reported data, parents, policymakers, and others  are not able to determine whether students with disabilities as a whole are  meeting academic proficiency goals in the same way as all other students  in the school system. For example, high performance on the part of most  DOD students could mask low performance for students with disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD\u2019s accountability for the academic achievement of its  students with disabilities, including certain students who may have  dyslexia, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense instruct the  Director of the Department of Defense Education Activity to publish  separate data on the academic achievement of students with disabilities at  the systemwide, area, district, and school levels when there are sufficient  numbers of students with disabilities to avoid violating students\u2019 privacy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

We included steps in developing the survey, and  collecting, editing, and analyzing survey data to minimize such  nonsampling error.  In developing the web survey, we pretested draft  versions of the instrument with principals at various American and  European elementary, middle, and high schools to check the clarity of the  questions and the flow and layout of the survey.  On the basis of the  pretests, we made slight to moderate revisions of the survey.  Using a web- based survey also helped remove error in our data collection effort.  By  allowing school principals to enter their responses directly into an  electronic instrument, this method automatically created a record for each  principal in a data file and eliminated the need for and the errors (and  costs) associated with a manual data entry process.
