The restructuring was intended to boost competition and expand consumer choice, increase efficiency, and lower prices. Of the three states GAO studied, Texas had the greatest need for additional electric power, and it added the most new capacity from 1995 through 2001. In contrast, California added 25 percent of the forecasted need for capacity over this period. Although Pennsylvania added less than half of its forecasted need for capacity, the state continues to be a net exporter of electricity to nearby states. The three states have similar processes for approving applications to build and operate new power plants. In all three states, state and local agencies must review the applications to ensure that the developer complies with environmental, land use, and other requirements before issuing the permits necessary to build and operate a power plant. California also has a state energy commission that reviews each power plant application to determine whether the benefits of additional electricity outweigh its likely negative environmental or other effects. Texas' rules for connecting new power plants to the electricity transmission system are less costly for independent developers and are administratively simpler than the approaches used in California and Pennsylvania. In deciding where to build new power plants, independent developers said they weigh a market's risks, including uncertainty about changes in a state's market rules, against expected profits. Higher risks require higher expected profits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 24 states, and Washington, D.C., restructured electricity markets by shifting from service provided through a regulated monopoly\u2014the local electric utility\u2014to service provided through open competition among the local utility and its competitors. The 24 states and Washington, D.C., accounted for about 55 percent of total U.S. electricity retail sales in 1999. The restructuring was intended to increase competition and expand consumer choice in order to lead to increased efficiency and lower prices. In states that have restructured, decisions about whether to build new power plants to add to a region\u2019s generating capacity are made by independent developers\u2014private companies not regulated by state utility commissions. Previously, the utilities and states\u2019 utility regulators made these decisions. To evaluate the adequacy of supplies of electricity, the North American Electricity Reliability Council\u2014 a voluntary organization of utilities\u2014forecasts the generating capacity needed to meet future electricity demand.", "Federal and state environmental laws have historically made the fossil fueled electric power generation industry, which relies on coal, oil, and natural gas, one of the most highly regulated industries, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These large plants emit pollutants into the air and may also discharge pollutants into water systems. In addition, these power plants can occupy large areas of land, in some cases about 30 acres, and as a result, could harm wildlife and ecosystems. Consequently, power plant developers generally have to address air and water quality, and may also have to address endangered species issues when obtaining pre-construction and operating permits. EPA has delegated responsibility to many states for enforcing compliance with both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The developer, state agencies, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are responsible for ensuring that a power plant project does not adversely affect any endangered or threatened species. State and local agencies review developers\u2019 applications for environmental and other permits needed to build new power plants in restructured markets, as they did before restructuring.", "Restructuring issues gained national visibility in May 2000, when California\u2019s electricity prices rose dramatically, with average costs rising four-fold. This increase in prices occurred, in part, because the total demand for electricity was too close to the total electricity supplies. Industry experts cited the limited development of new power plants within California as one contributor to the crisis. While prices subsequently fell, experts remain concerned that the planned development of new power plants may not be sufficient to meet future needs in California. In response to California\u2019s experience, some states have delayed or suspended their plans to open their markets to competition, while other states have decided against restructuring their electricity markets at this time.", "Citing the importance of quickly adding new power plants when needed as a key factor in balancing the supply and demand for electricity in restructured markets, you asked us to compare the experience of California in adding new power plants with the experiences of two other restructured states\u2014Pennsylvania, which operates as part of an innovative regional electricity market, and Texas, which has successfully added new plants. In response, we agreed to (1) compare the need for electric power in California, Pennsylvania, and Texas, as well as the extent to which these states have added new generating capacity; (2) compare the states\u2019 regulatory processes for approving new power plants; (3) compare the states\u2019 rules for connecting new power plants with local electricity transmission systems; and (4) identify the key factors that independent developers consider in deciding where to propose new power plant projects. In 1999, power plants in California, Pennsylvania, and Texas accounted for 21 percent of the generating capacity in the United States\u2014 about 166,000 megawatts of power. One megawatt is sufficient to meet the demand of 750 households.", "To compare California\u2019s experience with those of Pennsylvania and Texas, we analyzed state and industry data on power generation needs and developers\u2019 proposals to build power plants and visited each state to interview cognizant state and federal officials. To identify the factors that power plant developers consider in making investment decisions, we met with six independent private developers\u2014three of these were among the largest and the other three were smaller; a manufacturer of large turbines used to generate electricity; and representatives from the financial community, including two investment ratings companies and four investment banks that help finance power plants. Our detailed scope and methodology is presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Before restructuring, electric service was provided primarily by federal- and state-regulated investor-owned electric utilities. A utility typically owned the power plants, transmission system, and local distribution lines that supplied electricity to all of the consumers in a geographic area. Under this system, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulated, among other things, sales of electricity for resale and the transmission of electricity over high-voltage power lines in interstate commerce. The states regulated retail markets by participating with utilities in forecasting growth in demand, planning and building new power plants, reviewing and approving utility costs, and establishing rates of return.", "In response to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, FERC has opened wholesale electricity markets across the country, and many states have also opened their retail markets to competition. In these competitive markets, consumers will eventually pay market-based electricity prices, and power plant developers are no longer guaranteed that construction costs will be repaid or that the electricity produced will be sold profitably. In these markets, it was expected that independent developers would individually assess the need for new generation and its potential profitability. These assessments would be made on the basis of market signals, such as the prices of electricity and other related products and forecasts of the generation required to meet growing demand.", "As shown in figure 1, the U.S. electricity transmission system consists of three connected, but independently operating systems: the western interconnect, the eastern interconnect, and the Texas interconnect. Each of these systems must maintain a constant balance between the amount of electricity supplied by power plants and the amount of electricity being used at homes and businesses. While little electricity moves from one system to another, electricity produced within each system can move throughout the system, subject to transmission system constraints that can limit or prevent the flow of electricity within certain regions of the system. The level of electricity demand varies considerably throughout the day, with the highest levels only reached during a small percentage of the hours during a year. In addition, unlike other commodities, electricity cannot easily or inexpensively be stored and must be instantly available whenever demand increases. Because these systems are interconnected, a change in the supply or demand in one part of the system can affect producers and consumers elsewhere. To ensure that supply exceeds the demand for electricity, utility systems have historically maintained additional power plants, as part of a reserve margin, above the amount needed to meet the highest level of expected demand. This reserve margin has enabled utilities to meet demand when a power plant was taken out of service or when demand rose more than expected.", "As part of the western interconnect, California has historically imported about 20 percent of the electricity that it consumes. While California\u2019s utilities had owned power plants located in California and other states as part of their supply mix before restructuring, they have since sold most of these plants to private companies not regulated by California. In contrast, in recent years, Pennsylvania has exported more electricity than it has imported. Although some of the power plants owned by the state\u2019s former utilities were sold as a result of restructuring, the plants have long-term contracts to sell electricity in Pennsylvania. Power plants in Texas generate nearly all of the electricity that the state consumes. The state\u2019s utilities have leased access to generating capacity at some of their plants and some have been sold; however, the utility plants that are leased are operated by subsidiaries of the former utilities.", "As part of its efforts to restructure the industry, FERC issued regulatory orders that require transmission system owners to allow all parties, including new power plant developers, to transmit electricity under comparable terms and conditions. FERC has approved the formation of independent organizations to operate the transmission system in California and other states. An example of this new type of organization is the PJM Interconnect, which operates the transmission system in all or parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. FERC also directed transmission system owners to create multistate regional transmission organizations to operate the systems independently of the transmission owners.", "To maintain the reliability of the transmission system, transmission owners and operators participate in the North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) through 10 regional reliability councils. These regions cooperate in planning and integrating the transmission system and study trends in long-term supply and demand.", "U.S. electricity markets have attracted significant planned investment to the nearly 770,000 megawatts of generating capacity already on-line at the end of 1995. Through the end of 2001, developers had proposed or added about 690,000 megawatts of new electricity generating capacity, of which about 114,000 megawatts were already built and another 123,000 megawatts were under construction. Industry data indicate that about 104,000 megawatts of proposed plants had been either tabled or cancelled\u2014with the remainder in various stages of planning or development. About 40 percent of the proposed generating capacity was planned for states identified as active in implementing restructured electricity markets, and 20 percent for states that have actively pursued electricity restructuring but have either delayed or suspended further actions.", "While coal, nuclear power, water (hydroelectric dams), and oil are the primary fuels for older power plants, natural gas-fueled power plants accounted for over 80 percent of the generating capacity added from 1995 through 2001 and a similar percentage of the plants proposed for construction through the end of 2001. About 62 percent of the gas-fired plant capacity proposed through 2001 would use highly energy-efficient combined-cycle technologies, and 35 percent would use simple-cycle technologies. Both types of power plants rely on large gas turbines, also called combustion turbines, with combined-cycle units adding a steam generator and a steam turbine to convert waste heat in the exhaust stream to electricity. In general, both types of plants are more fuel efficient, less costly to operate, and less polluting than many existing power plants. Because of their higher efficiency and relatively low operating costs, combined-cycle power plants are often used to generate electricity through large portions of the day. In contrast, simple-cycle power plants typically are used to generate electricity only during periods of high demand because they cost more to operate. These plants are useful in meeting sudden changes in demand because they can reach full output in as little as 10 minutes. In general, simple-cycle power plants can be constructed in about 6 to 9 months after regulatory approvals, while combined-cycle power plants need from 18 to 28 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Three States Had Different Needs for Additional Electric Power and Added Different Amounts", "paragraphs": ["Electricity demand in Texas, California, and Pennsylvania grew faster from 1995 through 2001 than NERC had forecast in 1995.

In contrast, in California, developers added about 4,600 megawatts, or 25 percent of the forecasted need for capacity through 2004, and in Pennsylvania, developers added about 2,100 megawatts, or less than half of its forecasted need through 2004. More recently, each state has seen significant cancellations and postponements of projects, with California experiencing the greatest drop. Developers and investment firms noted that events in the past year\u2014the economic downturn, the terrorists\u2019 attacks on September 11, and the collapse of the Enron Corporation\u2014 contributed to the cancellation of many proposed projects in the United States and the world."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The States Had Different Needs for New Power Plants", "paragraphs": ["In 1995, when U.S. electricity markets were beginning to restructure, NERC forecast that already planned new plant construction would adequately meet the needs of the regional markets that include each of the three states through 2004.

Specifically, in 2001, the data for the three reliability regions reflected the following annual average growth: 4.7 percent for California, 2.1 percent for Pennsylvania, and 4.9 percent for Texas.

Specifically, 69 percent of the new power plant projects that began the regulatory process in Texas were proposed to regulators before 2000, while 75 percent of the projects in California and Pennsylvania were proposed to regulators in 2000 and 2001. This early interest in entering the electricity market in Texas led to earlier consideration by regulatory agencies involved in the siting approval process.", "Partly because developers had proposed new power plants earlier, they had built more generating capacity in Texas than in the other two states by the end of 2001. In total, Texas accounted for about 71 percent, or 16,000 megawatts, of the 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity built in the three states from 1995 through 2001.

Local governments review the applications for compliance with land use and zoning requirements. If applicable, state and federal agencies review the application for compliance with the Endangered Species Act. In addition to these reviews, CEC must approve new power plant projects above 50 megawatts before they can be built, adding another layer of review. According to the state, CEC exists to ensure that needed energy facilities are authorized in an expeditious, safe, and environmentally acceptable manner. As part of its role, CEC oversees compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, which requires an evaluation of the environmental impact of state-approved projects planned for the state. CEC decisions can overturn the permitting decisions of other state and local agencies. In one case, for example, CEC approved a power plant even though the local community had refused to grant a land-use zoning permit. CEC also analyzes other aspects of the project, which may not be examined by other agencies, including the plant\u2019s technical design, fuel use and efficiency, transmission equipment, and socioeconomic impacts.

To control these emissions, air pollution control requirements for these power plants vary according to the planned location and the amount of the plants\u2019 emissions, as well as whether a state has stricter standards than the federal standards. In general, large power plants planned for an area that does not meet federal air quality standards\u2014known as non-attainment areas\u2014must obtain a Non-Attainment New Source Review permit. This permit requires a new power plant to install the most advanced pollution control equipment and offset the new plant\u2019s emission of pollutants by reducing emissions elsewhere in the area. The new power plant could, for example, buy emission reduction credits, called offsets, from another industrial facility that has closed or adopted less polluting technology beyond what is required under regulations. The advanced pollution control equipment and the purchase of these offsets from another company can add substantially to a power plant\u2019s costs compared with the requirements in an attainment area. In attainment areas\u2014areas that meet federal air quality standards\u2014 plants can obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit, which requires less stringent technologies to control emissions.", "As shown in figure 3, all three states have non-attainment areas for EPA\u2019s ozone standard. Substantial portions of California and Pennsylvania are non-attainment areas with many areas of either extreme or severe air quality impairment. In addition, because Pennsylvania is part of a regional ozone transport area, the entire state must be treated as a non-attainment area. In contrast, only the Dallas, Houston, Beaumont, and El Paso metropolitan areas are non-attainment areas for ozone in Texas. Overall, 65 percent of the approved plants in California and about 60 percent of the approved plants in Pennsylvania were required to obtain air permits requiring more stringent controls, primarily because power plant projects for California and Pennsylvania generally were proposed for sites in non-attainment areas for ozone. In contrast, in Texas, only 18 percent of the approved plants had to use more stringent controls, partly because 64 percent of the approved plants were located in attainment areas.", "California has led other states in requiring pollution reduction beyond what is federally required. Specifically, California has a 1-hour ozone standard of 0.09 parts per million, as compared with EPA\u2019s 0.12 parts per million standard\u2014which causes more areas of the state to be judged as having poor air quality. With this standard, power plants in almost all areas of the state must install some pollution controls. California requires that smaller gas-fired power plants must limit their emissions\u2014even those with significantly lower quantities of emissions. Plants emitting more than 10 pounds per day of pollutants, or approximately 1.8 tons per year, must evaluate pollution controls. In contrast, EPA has a minimum threshold of 10 tons per year for plants located in areas with the worst air quality. Because California\u2019s standards are more stringent than EPA\u2019s, 9 of the 31 power plant projects approved in California since 1995 had to install pollution control equipment to lower their emissions, which EPA would not have required.", "Furthermore, while EPA\u2019s standards for new plants apply in all states, the approved emissions level for a plant depends on how the state applies EPA\u2019s regulations.

In Texas, interconnection costs can be significantly lower for developers because consumers directly pay, through a charge on their electricity bills, for upgrades to the electric transmission system that are required with the addition of the new plant. In California and Pennsylvania, under current FERC-approved rules, developers pay for the system upgrades with the expectation that they will recoup these costs through electricity sales. Furthermore, in Texas, developers of new power plants sign standard interconnection agreements that specify the terms and conditions of connecting the new plant to the transmission system, which speeds up the negotiation process; California and Pennsylvania do not have such agreements.

Lack of clear definitions, it concluded, could lead to conflicts and delays, and discourage the development of new privately owned power plants.", "The Texas PUC has addressed cost allocation issues through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) by clarifying the rules for allocating system upgrade costs. Under these rules, PUC allocates the annual cost of the transmission costs including these transmission system upgrades and related maintenance to the entities selling directly to consumers, on the basis of their total electric demand and passes these costs on to consumers through a per-kilowatt-hour fee. As a result of these cost allocation rules, interconnection costs to developers are well defined and known early in the development process.", "To connect a power plant project to the transmission system, developers must (1) request an interconnection from ERCOT, (2) pay for two ERCOT studies on the proposed plant\u2019s potential impact on the transmission system, and (3) provide a security deposit for any costs incurred by the transmission service provider. ERCOT representatives said that they conduct these studies in the order received and completion times vary depending on the application. Generally, the first screening study is completed within 90 days and the more detailed analysis in another 60 days. Developers said that because they do not pay for transmission upgrades, they can locate plants outside of areas with congested transmission systems, such as Dallas. As a result, power plants in Texas generally have been located outside non-attainment areas. According to Texas PUC and ERCOT officials, substantial upgrades to the transmission system were underway because many new power plants are being located in areas in which the existing transmission system could not adequately transmit the added capacity. PUC officials believe that transmission improvements will lead to improved competition in the long-term and noted that ERCOT has given priority to addressing bottlenecks in the transmission system to ensure that all the markets in the state have access to these new supplies of electricity.", "In contrast, developers in Pennsylvania pay for both the transmission system upgrades and the direct interconnection costs. Requiring developers to pay for system upgrades acts as an incentive for proposing plants in locations that do not require substantial transmission system improvements or the addition of new power lines, according to staff at PJM Interconnect, Pennsylvania\u2019s transmission system operator. Developers must also pay a deposit for PJM Interconnect to complete interconnection studies\u2014as much as $7.5 million in one case for one of the three studies. PJM Interconnect conducts transmission studies for power plant projects as a group\u2014all proposals received within a specific time period are analyzed together. According to PJM Interconnect staff, they need to study the system impacts of all the applications received to accurately assess the interactive implications of multiple new power plants, even though some of the power plants in several of the groups may never be built.", "Similarly, developers in California pay for both the direct interconnection costs and upgrades. However, in California, the local transmission system owner determines the cost of the system upgrades, with limited oversight by California\u2019s transmission system operator. To connect to the local system, a developer submits an interconnection request to the transmission system owner and the operator. To assess the work and associated costs for the interconnection, the transmission system owner studies the impact of the proposed plant on the transmission system to identify potential reliability problems. If this study identifies reliability problems, the developer may request the transmission system owner to perform a detailed facilities study to determine the measures needed to mitigate those impacts and to identify their associated costs.

Developers then review information about potential competitors in a given market, including the type and age of existing plants and their estimated production costs, as well as economic growth projections that affect demand increases. Finally, developers estimate the overall profitability of selling electricity in a market by comparing the estimated future electricity prices with the estimated cost to generate electricity, based on fuel cost estimates in the area and other variable production costs.

Other developers said that they will invest in riskier projects if expected profits are higher.", "Developers also told us that regulatory risks, such as lengthy and uncertain state approval processes and stringent environmental compliance requirements, were not, by themselves, obstacles to building a power plant in a state. Rather, they said, these factors can increase a project\u2019s risk because it is more costly to build and operate and because long-term projections about market conditions are less reliable. For example, plants subject to more stringent environmental standards need more costly emissions-reduction equipment and have less operating flexibility to respond to changes in demand, according to a turbine manufacturer.

Often, developers can reduce their exposure to this risk by (1) buying natural gas at fixed prices through long-term contracts and/or (2) selling the plant\u2019s future output through long-term contracts that generally set a future sales price. Several developers told us that they seek to commit at least 50 percent of a new plant\u2019s output to long-term sales contracts. Lenders and staff at investment ratings companies also told us that long-term contracts with financially sound purchasers are important tools to lower risks when financing new power plants.

The market rules limiting the use of long-term contracts in California effectively increased the risk of building power plants in that state. One power plant developer told us that because California did not have a robust and predictable market for long-term electricity sales, it could evaluate only the prices in the short-term electricity market, which exposed the developer to more risk without the expectation of higher profits. However, developers told us that once prices began to rise, they began to propose building more power plants in the state. From May 2000 through June 2001, electricity prices increased fourfold, on average, to 13.4 cents per kilowatt-hour.", "In response to the electricity crisis during 2000 and 2001, California took several actions that increased its involvement in its electricity markets. First, in January 2001, the state replaced the governing board of its transmission system operator with members appointed by the Governor. Second, the state created the California Power Authority, which can, among other things, finance up to $5 billion for power plants. Senior state officials have said that the electricity market would not be sufficiently competitive until an excess capacity of 15 percent was located in the state and that state financing provided one way to increase in-state generating capacity. However, according to investment analysts and developers, the potential that the state might build up to 15 percent excess generating capacity increases the risk and uncertainty for investing in California\u2019s electricity market. Third, California entered into long-term contracts to buy electricity and bought electricity day-to-day in short-term markets because the state\u2019s two largest utilities faced severe financial problems and difficulty purchasing electricity.", "Taken together, these actions have created concerns among developers about whether the operator of the California transmission system will provide equal treatment for market participants.

Audits of the transmission system\u2019s operations identified several other violations of the rules. Although FERC ordered state staff to leave the operations room, developers remain concerned that the state may receive special treatment from the transmission operator.

The lack of stable market rules presents uncertainty regarding the eventual market in the state. In addition, the perception that the state is seeking to abrogate the long-term contracts it signed last year has raised concerns about the finances of some projects.

These long-term contracts enable developers to manage their risk by providing fixed prices and terms for electricity sales. However, electricity prices were too low to attract investment. Low-cost existing generating capacity was available because the state\u2019s industrial base has declined as many steel plants and other industries that consumed substantial quantities of electricity closed or moved out of state, according to Pennsylvania PUC officials. However, developers said that Pennsylvania has attracted some investment because of its access to other markets such as those in northeastern electricity systems in New York State and New England, which have had relatively high prices.", "In Texas, risks were manageable and profits were attractive. As discussed earlier, the market rules in Texas reduced risk through its (1) relatively faster regulatory approval process and (2) interconnection rules, which lowered development costs and simplified the administrative process.

Furthermore, developers invested in Texas during the initial operation of its wholesale electricity market because the market appeared to be profitable.

FERC\u2019s decisions on market rules and the states\u2019 decisions on regulatory rules can affect the balance of profitability and risk in a state. The experiences of California, Pennsylvania, and Texas show how these considerations have played out. The high levels of perceived risk and low levels of estimated profitability in California appear to have resulted in lower levels of early investment in new power plants in that state. On the other hand, the experience in Texas illustrates that the ability to manage risk and higher levels of estimated profitability combined to attract significant investment into new power plants from 1995 through 2001. The experience in Pennsylvania illustrates that while risk may be manageable, estimated profits also have to be high enough to attract investment.", "Developers can be deterred from building a power plant if the market has lengthy delays between making the proposal and selling electricity. These delays increase a developer\u2019s uncertainty whether the proposed project will be approved and whether additional costs will be incurred that reduce the plant\u2019s profitability. In this context, interconnection agreements are critical in assessing profit and risk. Lengthy negotiations over interconnection terms and conditions can increase the risk of developing a new power plant because forecasts of market conditions in the more distant future are less reliable than near-term forecasts. Texas was able to reduce delays in negotiating these agreements, in part because the Texas PUC\u2019s standard agreement already specified many of the parties\u2019 responsibilities. In contrast, under rules approved by FERC, California and Pennsylvania allowed developers and transmission system owners to negotiate their responsibilities, which has resulted in a lengthy process\u2014 more than twice as long as in Texas.
