Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-123, Management Accountability and Control, emphasizes the importance of having clearly documented and readily available procedures as a means to ensure that programs achieve their intended results.", "Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/14, Personnel Security Standards and Procedures Governing Eligibility for Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information, lays out the governmentwide eligibility standards and procedures for access to SCI by all U.S. citizens, including government civilian and military personnel, contractors, and employees of contractors. The directive requires (1) the employing agency to determine that the individual has a need to know; (2) the cognizant Senior Official of the Intelligence Community to review the individual\u2019s background investigation and reach a favorable suitability determination; and (3) the individual, once approved by the Senior Official of the Intelligence Community for SCI access, to sign a SCI nondisclosure agreement.Additional guidance concerning SCI eligibility is contained in Executive Order 12968, the U.S. Security Policy Board investigative standards and adjudicative guidelines implementing Executive Order 12968, and Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/19.", "Governmentwide standards and procedures for safeguarding SCI material are contained in Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/19, Security Policy for Sensitive Compartmented Information and Security Policy Manual.", "The EOP Security Office is part of the Office of Administration. The Director of the Office of Administration reports to the Assistant to the President for Management and Administration. The EOP Security Officer is responsible for formulating and directing the execution of security policy, reviewing and evaluating EOP security programs, and conducting security indoctrinations and debriefings for agencies of the EOP. Additionally, each of the nine EOP offices we reviewed has a security officer who is responsible for that specific office\u2019s security program.", "As discussed with your office, we reviewed EOP procedures but did not verify whether the procedures were followed in granting SCI access to EOP employees, review EOP physical security practices for safeguarding classified material, conduct classified document control and accountability inspections, or perform other control tests of classified material over which the EOP has custody.

He added that there had been no written procedures for acquiring SCI access within the EOP since he became the EOP Security Officer in 1986. In contrast, we noted that two of the nine EOP offices we reviewed issued office-specific procedures that make reference to acquiring access to SCI\u2014the Office of Science and Technology Policy in July 1996 and the Office of the Vice President in February 1997.", "According to the EOP Security Officer, draft EOP-wide written procedures for acquiring access to SCI were completed in June 1996 at the time the White House and EOP Security Offices merged. These draft procedures, entitled Security Procedures for the EOP Security Office, were not finalized until March 1998. While the procedures discuss the issuance of EOP building passes, they do not describe in detail the procedures EOP offices must follow to acquire SCI access; the roles and responsibilities of the EOP Security Office, security staffs of the individual EOP offices, and the CIA and others in the process; or the forms and essential documentation required before the CIA can adjudicate a request for SCI access. Moreover, the procedures do not address the practices that National Security Council security personnel follow to acquire SCI access for their personnel. For example, unlike the process for acquiring SCI access in the other eight EOP offices we reviewed, National Security Council security personnel (rather than the personnel in the EOP Security Office) conduct the employee pre-employment security interview; deal directly with the CIA to request SCI access; and, once the CIA approves an employee for access, conduct the SCI security indoctrination and oversee the individual\u2019s signing of the SCI nondisclosure agreement.", "Director of Central Intelligence Directives 1/14 and 1/19 require that access to SCI be controlled under the strictest application of the need-to-know principle and in accordance with applicable personnel security standards and procedures. In exceptional cases, the Senior Official of the Intelligence Community or his designee (the CIA in the case of EOP employees) may, when it is in the national interest, authorize an individual access to SCI prior to completion of the individual\u2019s security background investigation.", "At least since July 1996, according to the National Security Council\u2019s security officer, his office has granted temporary SCI access to government employees and individuals from private industry and academia\u2014before completion of the individual\u2019s security background investigation and without notifying the CIA. He added, however, that this practice has occurred only on rare occasions to meet urgent needs. He said that this practice was also followed prior to July 1996 but that no records exist documenting the number of instances and the parties the National Security Council may have granted temporary SCI access to prior to this date. CIA officials responsible for adjudicating and granting EOP requests for SCI access told us that the CIA did not know about the National Security Council\u2019s practice of granting temporary SCI access until our review.", "A senior EOP official told us that from July 1996 through July 1998, the National Security Council security officer granted 35 temporary SCI clearances.

In contrast, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of the Vice President had issued office-specific security procedures that deal with safeguarding SCI material. The Office of Science and Technology Policy procedures, issued in July 1996, were very comprehensive. They require that new employees be thoroughly briefed on their security responsibilities, advise staff on their responsibilities for implementing the security aspects of Executive Order 12958, and provide staff specific guidance on document accountability and other safeguard practices involving classified information.

Neither the EOP Security Office nor the security staff of the nine EOP offices we reviewed have conducted security self-inspections as described in the order.", "EOP officials pointed out that security personnel routinely conduct daily desk, safe, and other security checks to ensure that SCI and other classified information is properly safeguarded. These same officials also emphasized the importance and security value in having within each EOP office experienced security staff responsible for safeguarding classified information. While these EOP security practices are important, the security self-inspection program as described in Executive Order 12958 provides for a review of security procedures and an assessment of security controls beyond EOP daily security practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Security Oversight Office Has Not Conducted Security Inspections of EOP Activities", "paragraphs": ["Executive Order 12958 gives the Director, Information Security Oversight Office, authority to conduct on-site reviews of each agency\u2019s classified programs.

This official added that the procedures for regulating personnel access to classified information are Executive  Order 12968 and applicable Security Policy Board guidelines and Executive Order 12968 and Executive Order 12958 for safeguarding such information. The Assistant to the President also stated that the report suggests that the EOP operated in a vacuum because the EOP written security procedures implementing Executive Order 12968 were not issued until March 1998. The official noted that EOP carefully followed the President\u2019s executive orders, Security Policy Board guidelines and applicable Director of Central Intelligence Directives during this time period. While the EOP disagreed with the basis for our recommendation, the Assistant to the President stated that EOP plans to supplement its security procedures with additional guidance.", "We agree that the executive orders, Security Policy Board guidelines, and applicable Director of Central Intelligence Directives clearly lay out governmentwide standards and procedures for access to and safeguarding of SCI. However, they are not a substitute for local operating procedures that provide agency personnel guidance on how to implement the governmentwide procedures. We believe that EOP\u2019s plan to issue supplemental guidance could strengthen existing procedures.", "The Assistant to the President also stated that it is not accurate to say that the EOP has not conducted security self-inspections. This official stated that our draft report acknowledges that \u201csecurity personnel conduct daily desk, safe, and other security checks to ensure that SCI and other classified material is properly safeguarded.\u201d The Assistant to the President is correct to point out the importance of daily physical security checks as an effective means to help ensure that classified material is properly safeguarded. However, such self-inspection practices are not meant to substitute for a security self-inspection program as described in Executive Order 12958. Self-inspections as discussed in the order are much broader in scope than routine daily safe checks. The order\u2019s guidelines discuss reviewing relevant security directives and classified material access and control records and procedures, monitoring agency adherence to established safeguard standards, assessing compliance with controls for access to classified information, verifying whether agency special access programs (such as SCI) provide for the conduct of internal oversight, and assessing whether controls to prevent unauthorized access to classified information are effective. Our report recommends that the EOP establish a self-inspection program.", "In commenting on our recommendation, the Assistant to the President said that to enhance EOP security practices, the skilled assistance of the EOP Security Office staff are being made available to all EOP organizations to coordinate and assist where appropriate in agency efforts to enhance self-inspection. We believe EOP security practices would be enhanced if this action were part of a security self-inspection program as described in Executive Order 12958.", "The Director, Information Security Oversight Office noted that our report addresses important elements of the SCI program in place within the EOP and provides helpful insights for the security community as a whole. The Director believes that we overemphasize the need to create EOP specific procedures for handling SCI programs. He observed that the Director of Central Intelligence has issued governmentwide procedures on these matters and that for the EOP to prepare local procedures would result in unnecessary additional rules and expenditure of resources and could result in local procedures contrary to Director of Central Intelligence Directives. As we discussed above, we agree that the executive orders, Security Policy Board guidelines, and applicable Director of Central Intelligence Directives clearly lay out governmentwide standards and procedures for access to and safeguarding of SCI. However, they are not a substitute for local operating procedures that provide agency personnel guidance on how to implement the governmentwide procedures.", "The Director agreed that his office needs to conduct on-site security inspections and hopes to begin the inspections during fiscal year 1999.
