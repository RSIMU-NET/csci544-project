CMS's criteria focus on beneficiaries who (1) receive prescriptions of high doses of opioids, (2) receive prescriptions from four or more providers, and (3) fill the prescriptions at four or more pharmacies. According to CMS officials, this approach allows plan sponsors to focus their actions on those beneficiaries it determined to have the highest risk of harm from opioid use.", "CMS\u2019s criteria, including recent revisions, do not provide sufficient information about the larger population of potentially at-risk beneficiaries. CMS estimates that while 33,223 beneficiaries would have met the revised criteria in 2015, 727,016 would have received high doses of opioids regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies. In 2016, CMS began to collect information on some of these beneficiaries using a higher dosage threshold for opioid use.

Further, in January 2017, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the HHS agency that administers Medicare,  issued its Opioid Misuse Strategy for the Medicaid and Medicare  programs, including Part D. One of the four priority areas outlined in the  strategy is implementing activities to reduce the risk of opioid use  disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion. For  this priority, the strategy includes the agency\u2019s plans to address concerns  about beneficiary use of opioids and the prescribing of opioids by  providers, such as educating and providing feedback to beneficiaries and providers concerning effective pain management and appropriate opioid  prescribing, as well as use of evidence-based prescribing guidelines. The  strategy also outlines attempts to identify providers with a high risk of  fraud, waste, and abuse in prescribing opioids and other drugs.

According  to the guidelines, most experts agreed that long-term opioid dosage of 50  milligrams (mg) morphine equivalent dose (MED) per day or more  generally increases overdose risk without necessarily adding benefits for  pain control or function. Experts also noted that daily opioid dosages  close to or greater than 100 mg MED per day are associated with  significant risks. The guidelines therefore recommended that providers  use caution when prescribing opioids at any dose, carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when increasing the dosage to  50 mg MED per day or more, and either avoid or carefully justify dosage  at 90 mg MED or more. In making these recommendations, CDC noted  that there is not a dosage threshold below which the risk of overdose is  eliminated, but found that dosages less than 50 mg MED would reduce  the risk for a large portion of patients.

The agency  includes this guidance in its annual letters to plan sponsors, known as call  letters; it also provided a supplemental memo to plan sponsors in 2012.  Among other things, these guidance documents instructed plan sponsors  to implement a retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) system to  monitor beneficiary utilization starting in 2013. As part of the DUR  systems, CMS requires plan sponsors to have methods to identify  beneficiaries who are potentially overusing specific drugs or groups of  drugs, including opioids.", "Also in 2013, CMS created the Overutilization Monitoring System (OMS),  which outlines criteria to identify beneficiaries with high-risk use of opioids  and to oversee sponsors\u2019 compliance with CMS\u2019s opioid overutilization  policy. Plan sponsors may use the OMS criteria for their DUR systems,  but they have some flexibility to develop their own targeting criteria, within  CMS guidance. The OMS considers beneficiaries to be at a high risk of  opioid overuse when they meet all three of the following criteria: (1)  receive a total daily MED greater than 120 mg for 90 consecutive days,  (2) receive opioids prescriptions from four or more providers in the  previous 12 months, and (3) receive opioids from four or more  pharmacies in the previous 12 months. The criteria exclude  beneficiaries with a cancer diagnosis and those in hospice care, for whom  higher doses of opioids may be appropriate.", "Officials from all six plan sponsors we interviewed confirmed they have a  DUR system that specifically looks at opioids. In addition, to be consistent  with CMS, all of the plan sponsors adopted criteria similar to the OMS,  with some minor modifications\u2014typically involving the number of months  in which they measured beneficiaries\u2019 opioid prescriptions.", "Through the OMS, CMS generates quarterly reports that list beneficiaries  who meet all of the criteria and who are identified as high-risk and then  distributes the reports to the plan sponsors. Plan sponsors are expected  to review the list of identified beneficiaries, determine appropriate action,  and then respond to CMS with information on their actions within 30 days.  According to CMS officials, the agency also expects that plan sponsors  will share any information with CMS on beneficiaries that they identify  through their own DUR systems. Some actions plan sponsors may take  include", "Case management. After plan sponsors identify beneficiaries with  patterns of inappropriate opioid use and possible coordination of care  issues through their DUR analysis, they may conduct case  management. Case management may include an attempt to improve  coordination issues, and often involves provider outreach, whereby  the plan sponsor will contact the providers associated with the  beneficiary to let them know that the beneficiary is receiving high  levels of opioids and may be at risk of harm. In addition to outreach,  officials from two of the six plan sponsors we interviewed told us they  focus on provider education and one plan sponsor said they may  direct the providers to the CDC guidelines or other information to help  reduce overutilization. Officials from two plan sponsors reported that  they also reach out to beneficiaries to let them know they are  receiving high levels of opioids and may be at risk of harm.", "Beneficiary-specific point-of-sale (POS) edits. When plan sponsors  determine that a beneficiary is at risk for opioid harm, they may  choose to implement a beneficiary-specific POS edit to prevent  overutilization. Beneficiary-specific POS edits are restrictions that limit  these beneficiaries to certain opioids and amounts. Pharmacists  receive a message when a beneficiary attempts to fill a prescription  that exceeds the limit in place for that beneficiary. CMS expects plan  sponsors to report on the POS edits they use through CMS\u2019s  Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug System for information  sharing and monitoring purposes. That way, if a beneficiary changes  plans, the new plan sponsor will receive an alert about the  beneficiary\u2019s record of POS edits. From February 2014 through March  10, 2016, there were 2,693 POS edits reported in that system for  2,520 beneficiaries.", "Formulary-level POS edits.

From calendar  years 2011 through 2016, there was a 61 percent decrease in the number  of beneficiaries meeting the OMS criteria. (See table 1.)", "In addition to using the OMS as a monitoring tool to oversee plan  sponsors\u2019 compliance with their DUR system requirements, CMS relies  on patient safety measures to assess how well Part D plan sponsors are  monitoring beneficiaries and taking appropriate actions. Specifically, CMS  tracks data on plan sponsors\u2019 performance for 15 measures related to  Part D patient safety that are developed and maintained by the Pharmacy  Quality Alliance, and CMS communicates with plan sponsors about their  performance. In 2016, CMS started tracking plan sponsors\u2019  performance on three Pharmacy Quality Alliance-approved patient safety  measures that are directly related to opioids, which were  1.  The proportion of beneficiaries that use opioids at high dosages (more  than 120 mg MED for 90 days or longer) in persons without cancer or  not in hospice care.  2.  The proportion of beneficiaries that use opioids from multiple  providers (four or more providers and four or more pharmacies) in  persons without cancer or not in hospice care.  3.  The proportion of beneficiaries that use opioids at high dosage and  from multiple providers in persons without cancer or not in hospice  care, and that meet both of the other measures.", "The three measures are similar to the OMS criteria in that they identify  beneficiaries with high dosages of opioids (120 mg MED) from multiple  providers and pharmacies (four or more of each). However, there are a  number of differences between these measures and the OMS. For  example, the OMS counts actual beneficiaries, while the patient safety  measures report member-years, which are adjusted to account for  beneficiaries who are enrolled in a plan for only part of a year. In  addition, these measures separately identify beneficiaries who fulfill each  of those criteria individually. For example, data gathered on the first  measure indicate that about 285,119 beneficiaries, counted as member- years across all Part D plans, received high doses (more than 120 mg  MED) of opioids for 90 days or longer during calendar year 2016. CMS  also uses these data in different ways from how it uses OMS data. The  OMS criteria were developed and maintained by CMS to identify patients  at risk for harm who may warrant case management and to examine  opioid use trends across the Part D program, including progress toward  its goal of decreasing opioid use disorder. In contrast, CMS officials told  us that the agency uses the patient safety measures to assess plan  sponsor performance. The patient safety measures also serve as a tool  for Part D sponsors to compare their performance to overall averages,  and to track progress in improving these measures over time. CMS also  tracks sponsors\u2019 progress in improving the measures, according to  agency officials. Each quarter, CMS contacts plan sponsors who have the  lowest performance on each measure and expects them to respond about  actions they take to improve performance. Beginning in April 2017, the  agency began distributing to plan sponsors the beneficiary-level files for  the patient safety measures. CMS officials said that these files provide a  complete list of beneficiaries included in each of the measures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Does Not Have Sufficient Information on Most Beneficiaries Potentially at Risk for Harm", "paragraphs": ["While CMS tracks the total number of beneficiaries who meet all three  OMS criteria as part of its opioid overutilization oversight across the Part  D program, it does not have comparable information on most  beneficiaries who may be at risk for harm. CMS has goals to reduce the  risk of opioid use disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and  drug diversion in its Opioid Misuse Strategy, but OMS does not track the  number of beneficiaries with prescriptions for high doses of opioids unless  those beneficiaries are also receiving them both from four or more  providers and from four or more pharmacies; and agency officials told us  that CMS has no plans for OMS to begin doing so. According to CDC  guidelines, long-term use of high opioid dosages\u2014those above a MED of  90 mg per day\u2014are associated with significant risk of harm and should  be avoided if possible.", "Based on the CDC guidelines, outreach to Part D plan sponsors, and  CMS analyses of Part D data, CMS has revised its current OMS criteria to  include more at-risk beneficiaries beginning in 2018. The new OMS  criteria define a high user as having an average daily MED greater than  90 mg for any duration, and who receives opioids from four or more  providers and four or more pharmacies, or from six or more providers  regardless of the number of pharmacies, for the prior 6 months.  According to CMS officials, the revised OMS criteria, like the current  criteria, are intended to identify the beneficiaries it determined are at the  greatest risk of harm: those who may lack coordinated care as a result of  using multiple pharmacies and providers. CMS officials also noted that  the revised criteria are intended to limit the increase in the number of  beneficiaries for whom plan sponsors are expected to take action, such  as case management, to avoid overburdening plan sponsors with  unreasonable workload levels.", "While the revised criteria will help identify beneficiaries who CMS  determined are at the highest risk of opioid misuse and therefore may  need case management by plan sponsors, they will not provide  information on most Part D beneficiaries who may also be at risk of harm.  In developing the revised criteria, CMS conducted a one-time analysis  that estimated there were 727,016 beneficiaries with an average MED of  90 mg or more, for any length of time during a 6 month measurement  period in 2015, regardless of the number of providers or pharmacies  used. These beneficiaries may be at risk of harm from opioids, according  to CDC guidelines, and therefore tracking the number of these  beneficiaries over time could help CMS to determine whether it is making  progress toward meeting the goals specified in its Opioid Misuse  Strategy. However, CMS officials told us that the agency does not keep  track of these beneficiaries, and does not have plans to do so as part of  OMS. Instead, CMS uses the number of beneficiaries who meet the OMS  criteria as an indicator of progress toward its goals. CMS estimated that  33,223 beneficiaries would have met its revised criteria based on 2015  data, which is a much smaller number than the estimated 727,016  beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioids.

However, this information does not include all  at-risk beneficiaries, because the threshold is more lenient than indicated  in CDC guidelines and CMS\u2019s new criteria for OMS. Specifically, CMS\u2019s  one-time analysis of 2015 data indicated that 727,016 beneficiaries  received prescriptions with an average MED of 90 mg or more for any  length of time during a 6-month measurement period. In contrast, the  2016 patient safety measures reports identified significantly fewer  beneficiaries, 285,119, in its most comparable measure\u2014member years  for opioid prescriptions at 120 mg MED for 90 consecutive days or longer.", "According to CMS officials, CMS shared feedback with the Pharmacy  Quality Alliance to consider updating the threshold to 90 mg MED to align  with CDC guidelines and the revised OMS criteria. CMS officials said the  agency will consider adopting these updates once complete. In addition,  while CMS monitors the patient safety measure data, these data are  relatively new. CMS officials told us that, as a result, the agency does not  yet have enough data to report changes over time toward its goals to  reduce the risk of opioid use disorders, overdoses, and inappropriate  prescribing.", "Neither the data gathered as part of OMS, nor patient safety measures  gathered so far are adequate to provide CMS with the information  necessary to track progress toward meeting its goal of reducing harm  from opioids.

Doing so would also be consistent with federal internal  control standards, which require agencies to use quality information to  achieve objectives and address risks.

While CMS receives some  information from plan sponsors who voluntarily report their actions, it does  not know the full extent to which plan sponsors have identified providers  who have prescribed high amounts of opioids and taken action to reduce  overprescribing. Without this information, CMS cannot determine the  extent to which plan sponsors are taking action to reduce overprescribing,  making it difficult to assess progress in this area. CMS officials told us  that they receive reports on what information plan sponsors enter into  PLATO.

CMS  recently expanded the number of beneficiaries for whom it expects plan  sponsors to conduct intervention efforts, such as case management, and  has begun to collect additional patient safety measure data on  beneficiaries at risk of harm from opioids. However, these efforts have not  yet provided CMS with sufficient data to track how many beneficiaries are  receiving large doses of opioids, and therefore are at risk of harm.  Without expanding and enhancing its data collection efforts to include  information on more at-risk beneficiaries, CMS cannot fully assess  whether it is making sufficient progress toward its goals of reducing opioid  use disorders, overdoses, inappropriate prescribing, and drug diversion.", "CMS\u2019s efforts to oversee opioid prescribing specifically are also  inadequate.

HHS noted that these efforts include a medication  safety approach to improve care coordination for high-risk beneficiaries  using opioids, quality metrics for plan sponsors, and data analysis of  prescribing patterns to target potential fraud, waste, and abuse. For  example, HHS noted that CMS adopted a Medicare Part D opioid  overutilization policy in 2013 that provided specific guidance to Part D  plans on effective drug utilization review programs to reduce  overutilization of opioids. As described in our report, CMS\u2019s opioid  overutilization policy requires sponsors to implement retrospective drug  utilization review programs to identify beneficiaries who are potentially  overusing opioids. Among other things, sponsors may choose to  implement beneficiary-specific edits that limit high-risk beneficiaries to  certain opioids and amounts, and CMS expects them to use formulary- level edits to alert providers when their patients are receiving high levels  of opioids from other doctors.", "HHS also concurred with two of our three recommendations.", "HHS concurred with our recommendation that CMS gather  information over time on the number of beneficiaries at risk of harm  from opioids, as part of assessing progress toward agency goals.  HHS commented that CMS tracks beneficiaries who meet these  criteria through the patient safety measures.

HHS  also stated that it seeks to balance requirements on plan sponsors  when considering new regulatory requirements.
