Moreover, there is no clear time line for acquiring English proficiency. Local decisions about the amount of time needed to attain proficiency and the amount of language support that should be provided may differ. Of the two main instructional approaches, English-based instruction is more common than instruction in a student's native language. Most students spent four or less years in these programs. School districts are required to ensure that English-language instruction is adequate and to provide these children with equal educational opportunities. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has adopted procedural requirements for criteria for judging the adequacy of local English-language instruction programs in meeting those needs. In three policy documents, OCR set forth requirements that school districts must meet to pass a three-pronged test established by the courts. When the adequacy of local English-language instruction programs is questioned, OCR investigates and, if problems are found, enters into agreement with the district specifying how the district will address the issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 3.4 million children with limited proficiency in English were in U.S.  elementary and secondary schools in school year 1996-97. These children  face a double challenge: learning to speak, read, and write English as well  as learning the content of academic subjects. America\u2019s schools have  achieved limited success in meeting the needs of these students, who have  four times the dropout rate of their peers who are fluent in English, as well  as higher grade repetition rates. Moreover, because schools often do not  know what these students have achieved in subjects other than English,  they may be overlooked for programs and educational services that may be  appropriate for some of them, such as gifted and talented programs.  Attempts to create policy and effective curricula to help solve these  problems have been hampered by the continuing controversy about which  approach can better meet the needs of these children\u2014English-based or  bilingual\u2014and about how long special help should be given to these  students.", "Although educating children is primarily a state and local responsibility, the  federal government has a substantial role in ensuring that the educational  needs of children with limited English proficiency are met\u2014a role that is  based on title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and court decisions  interpreting it. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in the Department of  Education has been tasked with enforcing the rights of these students  under title VI. Questions have been raised about whether the federal  government is achieving the right balance between ensuring that states and  local education agencies meet the needs of these children as defined by the  courts and giving local districts the flexibility they need to implement  programs that respond to their own unique circumstances. The Congress  has provided oversight on this issue. In February 1998, April 1998, and June  1999, two separate subcommittees of the House Committee on Education  and the Workforce held hearings on bilingual education and oversight of  the Department of Education\u2019s OCR. During these hearings, questions were  raised about whether OCR had pressured school districts it had  investigated to implement bilingual approaches\u2014teaching students in  native-language-based programs\u2014to educate students with limited English  proficiency. As a result of your long-standing concerns and issues raised at  these hearings, you asked us to answer the following questions:  How long do children with limited English proficiency need to become  proficient in English?", "What approaches are used to teach children with limited English  proficiency, and how long do students remain in language assistance  programs?", "What are the requirements for children with limited English proficiency  that OCR expects school districts to meet, how are they set forth, and  what has been the nature of the interactions between OCR and school  districts in those instances in which OCR has entered into an agreement  with the school district concerning language assistance programs?", "To answer the first question, we reviewed available studies on second- language learning and talked to experts in the field. To answer the second  question, we reviewed the literature, spoke to experts, and reviewed  Education\u2019s survey data. In addition, we contacted 12 states with  substantial concentrations of students with limited English proficiency, 6 of  which\u2014Arizona, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington\u2014had  information on the length of time students spent in language assistance  programs. We also conducted site visits in 10 school districts (2 in each  state) in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas to obtain  information on teaching approaches used. These states have large or  growing populations of children with limited English proficiency. To  answer the third question, we interviewed OCR officials; reviewed case law  and OCR memos regarding students with limited English proficiency;  reviewed one case related to students with limited English proficiency in  each of five states: Colorado, California, Massachusetts, Michigan, and  Texas; and surveyed all 293 school districts that had entered into  corrective action agreements with OCR from 1992 through 1998 to provide  services to students with limited English proficiency. Of these, 245 (84  percent) responded. Appendix I provides additional information about our  methodology.

According to a November 1997 report (the latest available) by the  Institute for Research in English Acquisition and Development, 39 states  have some form of regulations targeting these students, ranging from a  mandate in Texas that school districts provide bilingual instruction in at  least some grades to a mandate in California that school districts provide  instruction only in English.", "For the past 30 years, the federal government has served students with  limited English proficiency primarily through title I of the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act. The Bilingual Education Act, enacted in 1968,  also serves a small percentage of these students under a supplemental  grant program that assists local school districts in teaching students who  do not know English. Other programs that may address, at least in part, the  educational needs of children with limited English proficiency include the  Emergency Immigrant Education Program, the Migrant Education  Program, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education  Act programs, and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act  programs (see table 1). The only programs that serve primarily children  with limited English proficiency are those associated with the Bilingual  Education Act.", "Federal policy for ensuring equal educational opportunity for children with  limited English proficiency has been largely shaped by title VI of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Educational Opportunities Act (EEOA), and  related court decisions. Title VI bans discrimination on the basis of race,  color, or national origin in any program or activity receiving federal  financial assistance. In Lau v. Nichols, the Supreme Court held that a  school district\u2019s failure to provide English-language instruction to non- English-speakers violated title VI. Like title VI, the EEOA also protects the  civil rights of students with limited English proficiency. Under the EEOA, it  is unlawful for an educational agency to fail to take \u201cappropriate action to  overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students  in instructional programs.\u201d In 1981, a federal court of appeals decision,  Castaneda v. Pickard, created a test for evaluating the adequacy of a  school district\u2019s approach to addressing the needs of its non-English- speaking students and limited-English-speaking students. The  Department of Education uses the test set forth in the Castaneda decision  as the basis for determining whether a school district program for serving  students with limited English proficiency is complying with title VI.", "Headquartered in Washington, D.C., Education\u2019s OCR has 12 regional  offices that enforce title VI and other civil rights statutes. In the five cases  we reviewed, OCR initiated investigations independently or after deciding  that a complaint brought by an individual or group met certain criteria. To  determine which school districts had potential problems with their  programs and therefore warranted a compliance review, OCR gathered and  analyzed statistical data and other information from state education  agencies, advocacy groups, parents, and OCR surveys. Once OCR selected  a school district for review, it requested data from the school district and, if  necessary, conducted on-site visits to schools in the district. If OCR found a  school district was not in compliance with civil rights laws, it worked with  the district to negotiate an agreement on the problems and the steps  required to address those problems (the corrective action plan). During the  period in which OCR monitored the implementation of the corrective  action plan, school districts periodically submitted information to OCR  regarding their programs for children with limited English proficiency.  Figure 1 shows the title VI investigative process used by OCR in the five  cases we reviewed in depth.", "In November 1994, OCR changed the procedural guidance it followed from  the Investigation Procedures Manual to the Case Resolution Manual. OCR  officials told us that since about 1995 they have implemented a more  cooperative approach to their reviews. Under this approach, OCR has  focused on finding early resolutions to problems and working  cooperatively throughout the process with school district and state  officials.

One uses English and makes little use of a student\u2019s native language  (English-based approach), while the other makes much more extensive use  of a student\u2019s native language, often for a number of years (bilingual  approach). Proponents of an English-based approach expect children to  learn English fairly quickly, in 2 to 3 years. For example, in Monroe County,  Florida, one of the districts we visited, elementary school children with  limited English proficiency receive all formal content area instruction in  English, alongside their English-fluent peers. District officials told us they  chose this English-based approach in part because they believe children  learn English more quickly when they are immersed in it. On average,  elementary school students enrolled in the district\u2019s English-language  acquisition programs receive services for 3 years.", "The bilingual approach is designed to take much longer\u2014often 5 years or  more. While bilingual programs vary in both their goals and length, those  programs that promote native-language literacy as well as English-language  literacy may take 5 to 7 years to complete. For example, the San Antonio  School District develops early literacy in Spanish, beginning with  prekindergarten instruction. The program is designed to simultaneously  develop English literacy, with a full transition to English-only instruction by  the sixth grade. District officials said they believe it is important to develop  bilingual citizens in a city that has a long bilingual tradition. Most of the  city\u2019s population is Hispanic, and a large proportion of the city\u2019s residents  speak both Spanish and English.", "The National Research Council has determined that there is \u201clittle value in  conducting evaluations to conclude which type of program is best. The key  issue is not finding a program that works for all children and all localities,  but rather finding a set of program components that works for the children  in the community of interest, given that community\u2019s goals, demographics,  and resources.\u201d", "Whether a school district chooses an English-based or bilingual approach  to teaching students with limited English proficiency, instructional quality  will ultimately affect children\u2019s academic achievement. Characteristics that  contribute to high-quality programs, according to some educators, include  adequately trained teachers, clearly articulated goals, systematic  assessments, and opportunities for children to practice their English. In  our site visits, for example, we visited one classroom in Cicero, Illinois, in  which a bilingual education teacher who had been recruited from a  Spanish-speaking country was using audiotapes to teach students English  during the daily period dedicated to learning English. The students listened  and followed along in their workbooks as a speaker on the tape read them  a children\u2019s story in English. There was no interaction between the teacher  and the students. In contrast, in a Key West, Florida, classroom we visited,  the bilingual education classroom teacher did not use audiotapes but  instead read aloud a children\u2019s story to his students. This teacher paused  frequently to quiz the students on what they had heard. This activity not  only gave the teacher an opportunity to see what his students understood  of the story but also gave the students an opportunity to speak and practice  English."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Define Proficiency Differently", "paragraphs": ["No clear consensus exists about how proficiency should be defined or  measured.

Broader \u201cacademic proficiency,\u201d such as the reading and  communicating of abstract ideas required for grade-level academic  performance, can take several more years to acquire.", "Little agreement exists on an appropriate standard against which English  proficiency should be measured. Some educators and language experts  believe that a child should perform at age- or grade-appropriate levels in  reading and other core academic subjects on standardized tests performed  in English before the child can be considered English-proficient. This  means that the child should score at or above the 50th percentile on a  standardized achievement test. In contrast, some states consider students  English-proficient when they score at the 40th percentile or even at the  32nd. Some critics question the validity of using these types of standardized  achievement tests to measure whether a student\u2019s achievement in English  is better than, the same as, or worse than that of other children in his or her  age group. These critics argue that a student\u2019s performance on these tests  does not necessarily reflect mastery or lack of mastery of certain English  skills because the tests are designed to assess a student\u2019s mastery of other  subjects.", "Performance on standardized achievement tests is just one of several  criteria states and districts may use to determine if a child is proficient in  English. We found that in Rockford, Illinois, officials combined the results  of an academic achievement test, English proficiency tests, and an  academic review conducted by school and district officials to determine a  child\u2019s English proficiency level. In contrast, we found that in Texas  students could be considered proficient by scoring at or above the 40th  percentile on both the English reading and language arts sections of a state- approved norm-referenced academic assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Time Needed to Attain Proficiency Can Vary With Student Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["Research indicates that the length of time needed to become proficient in  English can vary from child to child. It can be affected by such factors as  the child\u2019s age, socioeconomic background, and amount of formal  schooling already received in another language. For example, a 1997 study  concluded that the most striking feature about learning a second language  is the variability in outcomes. A frequently cited factor is a child\u2019s age.  Older children generally make faster initial progress than very young  children do. For example, a study of students with limited English  proficiency attending school in Fairfax County, Virginia, found that  students who arrived in this country between ages 8 and 11 needed 5 to 7  years to compete with native speakers in all subject areas, while children  who arrived when they were aged 4 to 7 needed 7 to 10 years. Researchers  have proposed that this difference perhaps reflects the fact that older  learners have developed more sophisticated language and thinking skills  before beginning to learn English. Educators have also observed that  students with prior formal schooling and higher socioeconomic  backgrounds tend to learn a second language more easily. Other  characteristics tied to differences in success rates include the amount of  exposure students have already had to English; the level of parental  support they have at home; and their classroom, school, and community  environments.

Two of these studies were carried out  in Canada and one in the United States (see table 2). The students in each  of these studies were schooled primarily in English. In general, the studies  concluded that children with limited English proficiency need 4 years or  more to develop the language skills needed to perform in academic subject  areas on a par with native English-speakers. However, with so few studies  available, the results should not be viewed as definitive, and other  researchers in the field have challenged some of the results.", "The three studies we identified examined students\u2019 progress in English  with respect to two different sets of skills. The two Canadian studies  focused on language skills alone, examining the point at which students\u2019  scores on tests of vocabulary, auditory perception, and other language  skills approached those of native English-speakers. The Fairfax County  study focused on students\u2019 academic achievement in English, measuring  the point at which students\u2019 performance on tests in reading, mathematics,  and other subjects, given in English, began to approach that of native- English-speaking students. The Fairfax study showed that children took  longer to reach grade norms in reading than in other subjects. For example,  even among the highest performing subgroup of children (those who  arrived in this county between ages 8 and 11), the performance in different  subject areas varied widely, averaging 2 years to reach national norms in  mathematics, 3 years in language arts, and 5 years or more in reading."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "English-Based Approaches Predominate; In the Six States Reviewed, Most Children Receive Services for 4 Years or Less", "paragraphs": ["English-based instruction is more commonly found in the nation\u2019s public  schools than bilingual instruction is.

About 76 percent of  students with limited proficiency in English receive English-based  instruction (such as English as a second language ); 40 percent  receive bilingual instruction aimed at teaching subject matter in the  student\u2019s home language (such as teaching math in Spanish); and slightly  fewer, 37 percent, receive instruction aimed at maintaining or improving  fluency in their home language (such as Spanish language lessons for  Spanish speakers.)", "The Education survey, which covered the 1993-94 school year, also asked  schools about the types of instructional programs they offer and found that  more schools offer English-based programs than bilingual programs. For  example, about 85 percent of schools enrolling students with limited  English proficiency offer ESL programs, and about 36 percent offer  bilingual programs in which the student\u2019s native language is used to varying  degrees. Nearly three-fourths of all children with limited English  proficiency attend schools with both types of programs. We visited 10  school districts in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas and  found that 6 of the 10 used both English-based and bilingual instruction.", "The survey also found that students often receive more than one type of  instruction during a school day. For example, ESL is often a component of  programs classified as bilingual education programs\u2014that is, although  explanations and some content areas may be taught in the student\u2019s native  language, ESL techniques may be used to teach English. However, the  study\u2019s data were not collected in a way that would allow accurate  estimates of the proportion of students who received a combination of  services.", "Determining the type of instruction students actually receive is more  complicated than these results would indicate for two reasons. First, the  instructional approaches used to teach children with limited English  proficiency are far more varied than the categories typically used to  capture this information. For example, a program model called \u201cstructured  immersion\u201d uses simplified English to teach subject matter and sometimes  allows for the teacher\u2019s use of students\u2019 native language for clarification.  While clearly not a bilingual approach, some might classify this approach  with English-based approaches, such as ESL; others might classify it as a  distinct third approach that makes limited use of students\u2019 native language.  Second, the broad program labels used by educators may not reflect actual  classroom practices. For example, in the Monroe School District, Florida,  we observed a language arts class designed to teach ESL to Spanish- speaking students. Normally, such an approach would involve little or no  use of Spanish. In this case, however, the teacher was not only specially  trained to teach English language arts to speakers of other languages, but  also fluent in Spanish. She provided instruction first in English and then  translated much of that instruction into Spanish."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Children in the Six States Reviewed Spend 4 Years or Less in Programs Aimed at Increasing English Proficiency", "paragraphs": ["We found no national data on the length of time children with limited  English proficiency actually spend in programs aimed at helping them  become proficient in English.

Differences in the way these states and school districts define proficiency  for exiting such programs, as well as the types of tests used to measure  proficiency, make direct comparisons across states and districts nearly  impossible. In addition, districts may also decide on their own whether to  apply additional criteria beyond the requirements set by their states.  Moreover, in June 1998, California passed Proposition 227, mandating  English-based instruction in California public schools (although waivers  have been granted under this system, and bilingual programs still operate  in some California public schools).

Several of the problems reported in the survey comments also  surfaced in our case investigations.", "Some districts suggested that OCR could address some of these issues by  ensuring that communications were timely, providing more feedback in  response to submitted reports, understanding the constraints within which  districts have to operate, attempting to minimize paperwork requirements,  including educators on OCR\u2019s investigative teams, and being clear about  when the monitoring period would end and the case would be closed. In  addition, some districts suggested that OCR should work more closely with  state education agencies and involve the state in the early stages of the  investigations to deal with situations in which state guidance differs from  federal guidance on meeting the needs of students with limited English  proficiency.", "We asked OCR headquarters officials to respond to the problems school  districts identified.

Moreover,  there is no clear time line for acquiring English proficiency. Even though  different approaches to English language instruction may be effective,  many variables may influence the choice of program used by a school, such  as the percentage of students with limited English proficiency, the number  of languages spoken by students, and students\u2019 family backgrounds. As a  result, local decisions about the amount of time needed to attain  proficiency and the amount of language support that should be provided  may differ.", "Available research does not definitively indicate the best teaching methods  to use or the amount of time support should be provided. However,  guidance from OCR provides the framework and standards that school  districts must meet to ensure that students with limited English proficiency  have a meaningful opportunity to participate in public education. School  districts have the flexibility to select methods of instruction that they deem  will produce the best results for their students, so long as they meet OCR  requirements.", "We found that when OCR followed up on complaints or engaged in  compliance reviews, for the most part, it worked effectively with districts.  Moreover, few districts changed their approach to teaching students with  limited English proficiency after OCR investigations.

We obtained state-level  data from the six states that had such data: Arizona, Florida, Illinois, New  Jersey, Texas, and Washington.
