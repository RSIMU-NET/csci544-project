In January 2009, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), implemented the Importer Security Filing (ISF) and Additional Carrier Requirements, collectively known as the 10+2 rule. Collection of cargo information (10 data elements for importers, such as country of origin, and 2 data elements for vessel carriers), in addition to that already collected under other CBP rules, is intended to enhance CBP's ability to identify high-risk shipments. As requested, GAO assessed, among other things, (1) the extent to which CBP conducted the 10+2 regulatory assessment in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, (2) how CBP used information it collected and assessed to inform its efforts to implement the 10+2 rule since January 2009, and (3) the extent to which CBP has used the additional 10+2 data to identify high-risk cargo. GAO analyzed relevant laws, OMB guidance, and CBP's 10+2 regulatory assessment, and interviewed CBP officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CBP's 10+2 regulatory assessment generally adheres to OMB guidance, although greater transparency regarding the selection of alternatives analyzed and a more complete analysis could have improved CBP's assessment. CBP's regulatory assessment addresses some elements of a good regulatory assessment, as required by OMB, such as the need for the proposed action and evaluation of the benefits and costs. However, the assessment lacks transparency in that it does not explain how the four alternatives considered for the rule--variations in what and how many data elements are to be collected--were selected or how the preferred alternative was chosen. OMB guidance states that regulatory analyses should clearly explain the assumptions used in the analysis. If, as CBP officials stated, an update might be published in the future, greater transparency could help justify the scope of alternatives analyzed in the regulatory assessment and provide insight into CBP's decision making. Further, a more complete analysis of the uncertainty involved in estimating key variables used to evaluate costs and benefits could have improved CBP's regulatory assessment by providing better information about the circumstances under which benefits justify costs. CBP officials said that to the extent that data are available, this information could be added to an updated regulatory assessment to improve its completeness. CBP is using information it has collected, assessed, and shared with the trade industry to monitor and help improve compliance with and implementation of the 10+2 rule. For example, CBP collects daily information on the ISF compliance of importers' shipments at each U.S. port to monitor the status of ISF implementation, as well as data on vessels arriving in U.S. ports for which carriers did not supply information such as the position of each cargo container (stow plans). CBP data indicate that in July 2010, approximately 80 percent of shipments were ISF compliant, and CBP officials said that most carriers had submitted stow plans. CBP publishes answers to frequently asked questions on its Web site and has conducted outreach sessions with the trade industry to discuss errors in ISF submissions and help improve compliance. The 10+2 rule data elements are available for identifying high-risk cargo, but CBP has not yet finalized its national security targeting criteria to include these additional data elements to support high-risk targeting. CBP has assessed the submitted 10+2 data elements for risk factors, and according to CBP officials, access to information on stow plans has enabled CBP to identify more than 1,000 unmanifested containers--containers that are inherently high risk because their contents are not listed on a ship's manifest. CBP has conducted a preliminary analysis that indicates that the collection of the additional 10+2 data elements could help determine risk earlier in the supply chain, but CBP has not yet finalized its national security targeting criteria for identifying high-risk cargo containers or established project time frames and milestones--best practices in project management--for doing so. Such efforts could help provide CBP with goals for finishing this project, thus better positioning it to improve its targeting of high-risk cargo."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP should, if it updates its regulatory assessment, include information to improve transparency and completeness, and set time frames and milestones for updating its national security targeting criteria.

The extensiveness of the transportation system, as well as the sheer  volume of passengers and freight moved, makes it both an attractive target  and challenging to secure. Ports, waterways, and vessels are part of an  economic engine handling more than $1 trillion in merchandise annually,  and an attack on this system could have a widespread impact on global  shipping, international trade, and the global economy.  Cargo containers  present significant security concerns, as individuals have exploited  vulnerabilities associated with the world\u2019s supply chain\u2014the flow of  goods from manufacturers to retailers\u2014by using cargo containers to  smuggle narcotics, stowaways, and other contraband.  Given these  vulnerabilities, there is a threat that terrorists could use a cargo container  to transport a weapon of mass destruction into the United States.  Within  the federal government, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part  of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for  administering container security and reducing the vulnerabilities  associated with the supply chain.  Balancing security concerns with the  need to facilitate the free flow of people and commerce, part of CBP\u2019s  mission, remains an ongoing challenge for the public and private sectors  alike.", "In response to a requirement in the Security and Accountability for Every  Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) that DHS collect additional data to  identify high-risk cargo for inspection, in January 2009 CBP implemented  the Importer Security Filing (ISF) and Additional Carrier Requirements,  collectively known as the \u201c10+2 rule.\u201d The rule mandates that importers  (who order containerized and break bulk goods to be shipped from  foreign sources to the United States via oceangoing vessel) and vessel  carriers (who physically transport international goods from foreign ports  to the United States) submit additional cargo information, such as country  of origin, to CBP before the cargo is loaded onto a U.S.-bound vessel.  Collection of the additional cargo information (10 data elements for  importers and 2 data elements for vessel carriers) and their incorporation  into CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System (ATS) are intended to enhance  CBP\u2019s ability to identify high-risk shipments and prevent the  transportation of potential terrorist weapons into the United States. CBP  estimates that about 250,000 importers and 1,000 vessel carriers could be  affected by the rule.", "The provisions in the rule are final, with the exception of certain interim  provisions that apply to the timing and content for submitting certain data  elements, such as allowing information on the location where a container  is packed with cargo to be provided after the initial submission of the data  elements but at least 24 hours prior to arrival at a U.S. port.  These interim  provisions are known as \u201cflexibilities,\u201d or the \u201cflexible filing\u201d options, and  they were included in the 10+2 interim final rule to allow DHS to conduct a  review of compliance difficulties and limit the burden on the trade  industry.  CBP\u2019s final regulatory assessment estimates that annualized  costs of the rule\u2019s implementation could range from $890 million to   $7 billion.  These estimates include costs incurred by importers and  carriers to collect, coordinate, and electronically transmit the required  data to CBP; losses to U.S. importers arising from potential delays in the  supply chain; and U.S. government implementation costs.", "CBP is conducting a review to analyze, for those data elements subject to  flexibilities: (1) compliance costs for various trade industry entities;   (2) the impact of the flexibilities provided for in the rule, based on data on  the extent to which importers have used the flexibilities and trade industry  comments; (3) the challenges to submitting the additional data elements  24 hours prior to loading; and (4) the benefits of collecting the additional  data elements.  The corresponding analysis is intended to inform the  decision to eliminate, modify, or maintain the requirements subject to  flexibilities under the interim final rule.  CBP expects to complete its  review in the fall of 2010, at which point DHS plans to review CBP\u2019s  analysis before making any changes to the flexibilities in the publication of  the final rule.", "In response to your request, we reviewed certain aspects of the 10+2  regulatory assessment and the 10+2 rule.  Specifically, this report  addresses the following objectives:    To what extent did CBP conduct the 10+2 regulatory assessment in  accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance?", "How has CBP used information it collected and assessed to inform its  efforts to implement the 10+2 rule since January 2009?", "To what extent have importers used the flexibilities when submitting  their Importer Security Filings since January 2009?", "To what extent has CBP used 10+2 data to identify high-risk cargo for  inspection and enhance cargo security while minimizing the impact on  trade flow?", "To answer these four objectives, we reviewed legal documentation,  including the 10+2 rule and the SAFE Port Act, which requires DHS to  consider the cost, benefit, and feasibility of the rule and consult with  stakeholders.  Additionally, to address the second, third, and fourth  objectives, we interviewed CBP officials from CBP\u2019s 10+2 program office,  which is responsible for overseeing implementation of the 10+2 rule; the  National Targeting Center-Cargo, which is responsible for targeting high- risk shipments for inspection; and the Office of Intelligence and  Operations Coordination, which is responsible for adjustments to ATS to  incorporate the 10+2 data.  We interviewed officials from these offices to  discuss the status of CBP\u2019s efforts to integrate the 10+2 data elements into  its targeting strategy.", "We also interviewed representatives of four industry associations that CBP  identified as involved in 10+2 outreach\u2014the American Association of  Exporters and Importers (AAEI), the National Association of  Manufacturers (NAM), the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders  Association of America (NCBFAA), and the World Shipping Council  (WSC). Further, we interviewed representatives from 30 importers and 2  carriers, as referred to us by the industry associations we met with and the  trade co-chair of CBP\u2019s Commercial Operations Advisory Committee  (COAC) ISF Subcommittee.  Our interviews with trade industry  associations, importers, and carriers solicited views on the flexibilities in  the 10+2 rule and CBP\u2019s consultation with the trade industry in developing  and implementing the 10+2 rule.  The AAEI and NAM representatives we  met with identified representatives of 27 importer member companies who  were knowledgeable about their companies\u2019 policies and procedures for  filing ISFs.  For the purposes of this report, we refer to these individuals as  importers.  We conducted interviews with these importers in group  settings.  This interview format allowed us to determine consensus and  also identify and examine instances where viewpoints differed among  importers.  As a result of the group settings, we do not explicitly identify  the number of importers who expressed particular views.  Rather, we  express these views as those of some of the importers we interviewed.   The trade co-chair of COAC\u2019s ISF Subcommittee referred us to  representatives of 3 importers, whom we interviewed individually.  These  interviews specifically addressed the importers\u2019 use of the flexibilities  when filing ISFs and whether their companies have experienced any trade  flow delays as a result of CBP\u2019s use of the additional data elements,  including CBP\u2019s use of the data to identify high-risk containers and use of  enforcement measures for noncompliance with the 10+2 rule.  We selected  2 carriers to interview based on a recommendation from the World  Shipping Council.  Our interviews with representatives of trade industry  associations, importers, and carriers were based on a nonprobability  sample, so while they are not generalizable to the maritime trade industry  as a whole, they provide insights into the ongoing implementation of the  10+2 rule, including reasons for using or not using the flexibilities, and the  impact of the 10+2 rule on the trade industry, including any trade delays  resulting from CBP enforcement of compliance with the 10+2 rule.", "In addition to the above steps, which involved multiple objectives, we also  performed audit work specific to each of the four objectives.  To evaluate  the extent to which CBP\u2019s regulatory assessment adhered to OMB  guidance, we analyzed CBP\u2019s Regulatory Assessment and Final  Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the Interim Final Rule, and  compared it to criteria in OMB Circular No. A-4, which provides guidance  to federal agencies on the development of regulatory analyses, as required  under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review).  To  determine how CBP has used information it collected and assessed, we  reviewed CBP reports and analyses for monitoring ongoing  implementation of the 10+2 rule since January 2009, such as daily  compliance reports, and information regarding CBP\u2019s consultation with  and outreach to the trade community, including presentations to importers  and the program\u2019s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document.  To  determine the extent to which importers have used the flexibilities, we  analyzed CBP data from September 13, 2009\u2014the date on which CBP  implemented a capability to collect data\u2014through   June 14, 2010, on importers\u2019 election to use the flexibilities when filing  their ISFs.  We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing CBP\u2019s  data management practices and determined that the data are sufficiently  reliable to demonstrate overall trends in use and improper use of  flexibilities.  To determine how CBP has used the additional 10+2 data  elements to identify high-risk cargo for inspection while minimizing the  impact on trade flow, we reviewed CBP analysis from 2006 of the potential  impact of new data on targeting efforts.  We also visited the National  Targeting Center-Cargo to observe a demonstration of ATS and how it  incorporates the 10+2 data elements into the targeting process.  To assess  the extent to which CBP has enhanced cargo security based on the  additional 10+2 information, we compared CBP\u2019s progress in integrating  the 10+2 data elements into its targeting strategy to best practices for  project management.  For the purposes of this objective, we limit our  discussion of the impact on trade flow to the impacts resulting from CBP\u2019s  use of the data elements, specifically targeting and compliance  enforcement.  We did not explore how the requirement to provide the  additional data elements to CBP in advance of container loading may have  impacted trade flow because CBP has separately addressed this issue in its  regulatory assessment of the impacts of the regulation.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2010 to September 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The sensitivity analysis analyzes the effects of variables\u2019  uncertainty on the results of the analysis and concludes that the  uncertainty associated with the initial, up-front costs to importers has the  greatest effect on the results of the analysis.

According to CBP officials, CBP selected the alternatives that the  contractor analyzed in the regulatory assessment.  However, based on our  review, there is little variation in the alternatives analyzed.  Each of the  alternatives is a combination of including or excluding three  components\u2014the 10 ISF data elements, an exemption for bulk cargo  shipments from filing the ISF, and the two data elements for the Additional  Carrier Requirements\u2014and the regulatory assessment does not discuss  whether other alternatives may have met the requirements of the SAFE  Port Act.  Moreover, the regulatory assessment does not discuss other  potential alternatives with additional or fewer data elements or why such  other alternatives were not included in the analysis.  For example, it does  not discuss a range of other alternatives, such as requiring 15 data  elements for the ISF or only one of the two carrier data elements.   According to CBP officials, the regulatory assessment does not discuss  other alternatives because CBP identified the current 10+2 data  elements\u2014in consultation with trade industry stakeholders, as data  elements that would significantly increase CBP\u2019s ability to make better  informed targeting decisions\u2014prior to the SAFE Port Act requirement to  collect such data.", "Greater transparency regarding the selection of alternatives could have  improved the assessment by justifying the limited scope of the alternatives  analyzed in the regulatory assessment and providing insight into CBP\u2019s  decision making.  According to OMB guidance, regulatory analysis  provides a way of organizing the evidence on the key effects\u2014good and  bad\u2014of the various alternatives that should be considered in developing  regulations. The motivation is either to learn if the benefits of an action are  likely to justify the costs or to discover which of various possible  alternatives would be the most cost-effective.  According to OMB  guidance, a good regulatory analysis is designed to inform the public and  other parts of the government (as well as the agency conducting the  analysis) of the effects of alternative actions.  Including a discussion of the  full scope of feasible regulations could have enhanced transparency about  the regulatory assessment\u2019s usefulness for informing decision making.  In  response to our findings, CBP officials acknowledged that more  information about the 10+2 rulemaking process, specifically the selection  of the 10+2 data elements, could be added in a future update to the  regulatory assessment, if an update is published, to provide greater  context about the decision making involved in developing the 10+2 rule.", "The regulatory assessment also lacks transparency regarding the final  selection of alternative 1 as the preferred alternative.  OMB guidance  states that regulatory analyses should be transparent, and in particular  that such analyses should clearly explain the assumptions used in the  analysis.  Three of the alternatives (alternatives 1, 2, and 3) have almost  identical costs and, therefore, the number of events (terrorist attacks) that  would need to be avoided to justify the costs are almost identical.  Absent  supporting documentation, it is not clear why, based on the information  and analysis in the regulatory assessment, CBP selected alternative 1 over  the other alternatives.  For example, the assessment does not explain how  alternative 1 may be more likely to achieve benefits, specifically  prevention of terrorist attacks, than the other alternatives to justify the  selection of alternative 1.  The assessment states that alternative 1 was  favored over alternative 2 because the impact of requiring the ISF for bulk  cargo\u2014alternative 1 exempts bulk cargo from the ISF requirement, while  alternative 2 requires an ISF for all cargo\u2014is expected to be slight given  that the number of bulk cargo shipments is small compared to the number  of nonbulk shipments.  Furthermore, according to CBP officials, the  exemption for bulk cargo was selected to mirror the requirements of the  24-hour rule\u2014which requires that carriers submit cargo manifest  information for containerized cargo but allows certain timing exemptions  for bulk cargo submissions.  The assessment states that alternatives 3 and  4 were rejected based on CBP\u2019s judgment that the ISF and Additional  Carrier Requirements should work in tandem to be effective.  However,  the regulatory assessment does not describe or analyze how or why CBP  made this judgment.  For example, it does not describe how the ISF and  Additional Carrier Requirements are used jointly to target for risk to  support the requirement to provide both types of data to CBP.

OMB guidance states that the important uncertainties connected with  regulatory decisions need to be analyzed and presented as part of the  overall regulatory analysis.  Uncertainties with respect to these two  variables may have influenced the results of the assessment.  For example,  if the assessment\u2019s estimate for the value of statistical life was too low, the  resulting conclusion would be that more terrorist attacks using cargo  containers would need to be prevented in a particular time period to  justify the costs of the regulation and the analysis would favor a less costly  alternative.  The quantitative uncertainty analysis includes the number or  percentage of containers that may experience delays and the length of the  potential delays in the supply chain, but the assessment does not address  the impact of the uncertainty associated with the estimate for the dollar  cost of delay.  A more complete analysis of these variables\u2019 uncertainty  could have more fully addressed the elements in OMB guidance and,  therefore, could have improved the regulatory assessment.

To gauge issues trade industry entities may have in  understanding or implementing the ISF requirement, CBP has also  reviewed and analyzed data on ISF errors and rejections, including  determining the most common errors that result in rejections.

According to CBP  officials, CBP can identify a shipment for which an ISF has been filed, but  it is difficult to determine the importer responsible for filing the ISF and  possible reasons for why an ISF was not filed or was not matched to the  shipment.  For the purposes of filing the ISF, the importer for a shipment  may be one of several entities involved in the supply chain, such as the  owner or purchaser of the goods, and it is left to the various supply chain  entities involved with a shipment to determine who will be responsible for  filing the ISF.  Furthermore, a shipment lacking an ISF may appear to be  noncompliant if the importer makes an error in submitting the ISF, such as  providing the incorrect bill of lading number.  In April 2010, CBP began  sending letters to importers who appeared to be noncompliant, based on  CBP\u2019s review of data collected from ISFs and other data such as customs  entries, to notify these importers of possible noncompliance and  encourage them to contact CBP about any concerns they may have.

According to some importers we interviewed, the lack of transaction-level  data may make it difficult for an importer to identify causes of  discrepancies between its own internal data and the information presented  in CBP\u2019s progress report.  However, according to CBP officials, importers  or their filers already receive information for each transaction, such as  messages regarding errors in the ISF or confirmation that the bill of lading  number was matched to other data.", "In addition to the monthly progress reports, CBP has also conducted  outreach sessions for members of the trade industry and has received and  responded to questions and comments about the 10+2 rule.  From  December 2008 through December 2009, CBP sponsored 35 town hall  events across the country and has conducted additional outreach sessions  through trade industry associations.

However, some  importers we interviewed expressed concern that, rather than publish its  policies informally through its Web site and FAQ, CBP should publish its  policies in a document that is legally binding, such as a notice in the  Federal Register.  In particular, one concern is that CBP has not legally  obligated itself to treat its current proxy for measuring ISF timeliness (24  hours prior to vessel departure) as meeting the rule\u2019s requirement of 24  hours prior to loading.  According to CBP officials, the regulation must  require the data to be submitted prior to loading because the SAFE Port  Act establishes this aspect of the requirement.  CBP officials said they  recognize that there is no existing metric for measuring the time of loading  and, therefore, CBP plans to use the proxy measure in enforcing the rule.   CBP also solicited public comments regarding the flexibilities and final  regulatory assessment.

For example, after identifying duplicate ISFs as the most  common error and reason for rejecting ISFs, CBP officials determined that  some filers or importers were resubmitting ISFs if they had received a  message from CBP that the ISF had not been matched to a bill of lading.   In some cases, this was occurring because the ISF preceded submission of  manifest information containing the matching bill of lading number.  As a  result, according to CBP officials, CBP has conducted outreach sessions  through trade industry associations and posted information on its FAQ to  reduce the number of such resubmissions.  In April 2010, CBP also began  identifying importers who may not be complying and sent letters to these  importers notifying them of possible noncompliance and encouraging  them to contact CBP about any concerns they may have.  In general,  representatives of the four industry associations we spoke with said they  have been satisfied with CBP\u2019s outreach efforts during implementation of  the rule.", "In addition to its other outreach efforts, CBP is also working to address  concerns regarding the information contained in ISF progress reports,  specifically the number of ISFs that cannot be measured for timeliness.   In order to determine if an ISF was submitted on time, CBP must match  the ISF to the vessel departure message supplied by carriers.  According  to CBP data, about 50 percent of the ISFs it analyzed for the May 2010  progress reports could not be assessed for timeliness because they could  not be matched to vessel departure messages.  For example, an ISF may  not be matched to a vessel departure message if the bill of lading number  on the ISF does not match a bill of lading associated with cargo on a vessel  for which CBP has received a departure message.  In order to improve the  number of ISFs that can be matched to vessel departure messages, CBP is  making adjustments to the system used by importers and their filers to  submit ISFs, the Automated Broker Interface, to allow filers to query bill  of lading numbers in the system.  According to CBP officials, this will  enable importers and filers to ensure that the bill of lading information is  correct before submitting an ISF.  Under the 10+2 rule, importers are  required to submit complete and accurate information, and fewer errors in  the bill of lading information will improve CBP\u2019s ability to match ISF data  to other data sources and monitor compliance. CBP officials also said that  CBP does not make enforcement decisions based on the information in the  progress reports.", "With respect to carriers\u2019 implementation, CBP officials said that while  there have not been many instances of major carrier companies failing to  submit vessel stow plans, some smaller companies may have had trouble  adapting to the requirement because they had not previously maintained  vessel stow plan information.

For example,  CBP conducted analyses of filed submissions and concluded that relatively  few importers were using the flexibility of not providing either the  consolidator element (entity who loads the container) or the container  stuffing (packing) location element at the time of initially filing their ISFs.   Among initial ISF submissions, 99 percent provided the consolidator  element and 99 percent provided the stuffing (packing) location element.   To gauge importers\u2019 understanding of the flexibilities, CBP implemented a  function in its electronic filing submission system in September 2009 to  allow importers to identify their intent to use flexibilities at the time they  submit filings.  However, this function did not allow CBP to monitor  whether an importer was using both flexibilities for a single ISF.

Prior to this change,  importers could only indicate their intent to use one flexibility type,  although CBP\u2019s system allowed the data to be entered in a way that  utilized both types of flexibilities.", "According to data obtained through CBP, ISFs indicating an intent to use  range flexibilities or timing flexibilities declined from 11 percent of filings  each week in September 2009 to 2 percent each week in January 2010.  Further, following the start of the enforcement period on January 26, 2010,  overall use of the flexibilities has remained low, with importers indicating  use of the flexibilities in about 2 percent of ISFs submitted each week  from January 26, 2010, through June 14, 2010 (see fig. 3). From   September 13, 2009, through June 14, 2010, the percentage of importers  that indicated use of the flexibilities on their ISFs declined from more than  13 percent to less than 4 percent.

Additionally, from   December 7, 2009, through June 14, 2010, ISFs that indicated use of both  types of flexibilities remained below 0.5 percent of all ISFs each week,  which corresponds to about 1 percent or less of importers claiming both  types of flexibilities on their ISFs each week.", "While importers\u2019 use of flexibilities has remained at about 2 percent since  January 2010, the percentage of ISFs indicating use of flexibilities that  constitute incorrect or unnecessary use of flexibilities has remained  consistently high. The system changes CBP implemented to allow  importers to indicate their intent to use the flexibilities has enabled CBP  to gauge importers\u2019 understanding of the flexibilities by analyzing whether  the data provided in ISFs indicating use of the flexibilities are consistent  with the flexibilities provisions in the interim final rule.  For timing  flexibilities, correct use of the flexibilities is indicated by an ISF missing  either the consolidator element or the stuffing (packing) location element,  or both.  For range flexibilities, correct use of the flexibilities is indicated  by multiple entries for one or more of the flexible range data elements:  manufacturer, ship to party, country of origin, or commodity Harmonized  Tariff Schedule number. During the period September 13, 2009, through  June 14, 2010, the rate of incorrect or unnecessary use of range flexibilities  has remained consistent, at around 70 percent or more of the ISFs that  indicated use of the flexibilities. The rate of incorrect or unnecessary use  of timing flexibilities declined from 85 percent to 63 percent during the  time period September 13, 2009, through January 26, 2010, but has  generally remained at around 60 percent or greater since the start of the  enforcement period. Thus, while the overall use of flexibilities remains  relatively low, the rate of incorrect or unnecessary use of flexibilities has  remained consistently high.

CBP\u2019s standard amendment  process, however, provides more latitude in that it allows the importer to  initially submit information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to  be true and then requires the importer to update the filing only if any of  the information changes or more accurate information becomes available.   These updates may be filed any time before goods enter a U.S. port, in  contrast to the flexibilities, which require updates no later than 24 hours  prior to goods\u2019 arrival at a U.S. port.", "CBP officials also explained that using the flexibilities could subject  importers to additional fees if they are using a third-party filer that charges  for each filing because the importers would have to pay for the initial filing  in addition to any updated filings.  However, if the importer does not use  flexibilities, the importer would only be subject to additional filing fees if  shipment information changes and use of the standard amendment  process is required.

Additionally, some  importers who are C-TPAT members said they are reluctant to use  flexibilities because it could convey to CBP that they do not have  complete awareness of their supply chains. Further, some importers cited  no need for the flexibilities because they collect all of the required 10+2  data elements prior to the ISF submission deadline. One importer,  however, stated that use of the range flexibilities has allowed it to develop  a template through which it can submit multiple entries per flexible range  element, which in turn improves the efficiency of its submission process.

If the updated weighted rule set does not perform  according to specification, or if there is an unexpected change in the  number of shipments facing mandatory examination because of their risk  scores, CBP plans to review and possibly amend the weighted rule set.   CBP plans to continue to retest the amended weighted rule set to ensure  that the system is performing according to design and that the flow of  trade is not unduly impacted.  Thus, until this testing is complete, CBP  officials said that they will not be able to determine a date when the  finalized weighted rule set will be in place.  We recognize that the results  of such testing could require adjustments to tasks that make it difficult to  adhere exactly to established dates for completing a project.  However,  establishing milestones and time frames for having the finalized weighted  rule set in place could help guide CBP in such testing and provide CBP  with goals for completing interim steps and finishing this project, thus  better positioning it for targeting high-risk cargo, thereby fulfilling the  statutory purpose of the requirement to collect the additional data  elements.", "According to CBP, the potential effectiveness of the additional 10+2 data  in enhancing cargo security has been demonstrated in analyses it  conducted on cargo containers arriving at the ports of Los Angeles, Long  Beach, New York, and Newark in February 2006.  The analyses indicated  that risk scores assigned while a shipment is in transit, which are based on  manifest data, may differ from the final assigned risk scores, which are  based on customs entry data. For certain shipments, the difference in the  risk scores assigned at these two times, in transit and at arrival, is  significant enough to affect CBP\u2019s response to these shipments.  For  example, twice as many containers were targeted as high risk based on  entry data compared to manifest data.  Therefore, earlier access to  information that approximates entry data could allow CBP to (1) address  risk factors before cargo is loaded on U.S.-bound ships at foreign ports, or  (2) obtain more information that indicates the cargo is not high risk before  the cargo arrives in the United States. The goal of the 10+2 rule is to  prevent dangerous shipments from being loaded onto U.S.-bound vessels  and CBP may issue \u201cDo Not Load\u201d orders for shipments identified as high  risk based on analyses of shipment data.  CBP has yet to issue any \u201cDo Not  Load\u201d orders as a result of the 10+2 rule and does not plan to begin issuing  such orders for ISF noncompliance any earlier than January 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Officials and Trade Industry Representatives Report That Enforcement of the 10+2 Rule Compliance Has Not Measurably Impacted Trade Flow", "paragraphs": ["According to trade industry representatives, to date, CBP\u2019s use of the  additional 10+2 data elements to target noncompliant shipments for  inspection has not impacted trade flow. In particular, none of the 30  importers we interviewed stated that their trade flow has been impacted  by 10+2 rule enforcement efforts such as shipment inspections or holds.  According to CBP officials, individual ports have begun to use the  additional 10+2 data elements to target noncompliant shipments for  inspection, but CBP cannot identify the number of shipments held  specifically due to 10+2 noncompliance because the data it collects do not  discern between different types of holds.  CBP officials added, though,  that they have not received any complaints from the trade industry  regarding inspections of noncompliant shipments impacting the flow of  trade. According to CBP officials, individual ports make compliance  enforcement decisions based on their own discretion. CBP believes that  the potential impacts of noncompliance, which can include cargo  inspection fees of $100 to $150 and a delay in cargo release of 1 to 3 days,  are sufficient incentives for the trade industry to comply with the ISF  requirements.  As a result, CBP\u2019s current enforcement strategy is to  exercise the least punitive measures necessary to obtain full ISF  compliance. CBP does not have any plans for initiating mandatory holds  on noncompliant shipments and will continue to monitor compliance rates  and its application of a measured enforcement approach for the immediate  future.  CBP officials stated, though, that if CBP determines that additional  enforcement actions are necessary, it may consider measures, such as  mandatory inspections for all noncompliant shipments.  CBP officials  added that they do not believe that they would take such actions before  November 2010."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The stated purpose of the SAFE Port Act requirement for CBP to collect  additional data on U.S.-bound cargo is to enhance CBP\u2019s ability to target  high-risk cargo containers at an earlier point in the shipping process than  can currently be done.  To determine the benefits and costs of requiring  such additional data, applying best practices, such as those in OMB  guidance, to the development of regulatory assessments could help to  determine the likelihood that the benefits of a regulation justify the costs  and also identify which possible actions would be most cost-effective.  To  this end, transparency in the assessment regarding why certain  alternatives were selected for analysis and how estimates were derived is  important to ensure that stakeholders can clearly see how the information  in the regulatory assessment informs the regulatory action an agency  takes.  Furthermore, to achieve the proposed benefits of collecting  additional data, CBP would need to incorporate the additional data into its  targeting practices.", "CBP\u2019s regulatory analysis is not transparent regarding how the alternatives  were selected for analysis or why the selected alternative is preferable  over the others.  If CBP publishes an update to its regulatory assessment,  as CBP officials said that CBP may do, further transparency could help  clarify CBP\u2019s decision making in formulating the 10+2 rule.  In addition, a  more complete analysis\u2014with further analysis of uncertainty for both  costs and benefits, as well as certain costs to foreign entities\u2014could help  to provide better information about the circumstances under which  benefits justify costs.  An update to the regulatory assessment with this  additional information could make the assessment more transparent to the  trade industry and other stakeholders who are affected by the rule.", "To accomplish the statutory purpose of collecting the 10+2 data, which is  to enhance CBP\u2019s ability to target high-risk cargo containers, CBP plans to  update the ATS national security weighted rule set to identify risk factors  in 10+2 data.  CBP is in the process of updating the ATS national security  weighted rule set to identify risk factors in submitted 10+2 data elements,  but it has not determined when updates to the ATS national security  weighted rule set will be finalized.  Establishing milestones and time  frames for updating the ATS national security weighted rule set could help  guide CBP staff in its efforts and provide CBP with goals for completing  interim steps and finishing the project, thereby better positioning it to  fulfill the purpose of the SAFE Port Act requirement and enhance its  capability to identify high-risk shipments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of CBP take the following two  actions:  If CBP updates its Regulatory Assessment and Final Regulatory  Flexibility Analysis, provide greater transparency in the updated  assessment regarding the information which contributed to decisions  made in developing the 10+2 rule by including information, such as:  1.  a discussion of how the alternatives were selected for analysis,  including alternatives that were considered but not included in the  analysis, and what information CBP considered in addition to the  regulatory assessment to conclude that the alternative requiring the  Importer Security Filing, with an exemption for bulk cargo, and the  Additional Carrier Requirements was preferable over the other  alternatives analyzed;   2.  an uncertainty analysis for the costs to importers for a day of delay  and for the value of statistical life; and   3.  to the extent data are available, estimates for lost profits borne by  foreign entities.", "To help guide CBP in updating the ATS national security weighted rule  set, establish milestones and time frames for updating the ATS national  security weighted rule set to use 10+2 data in its identification of  shipments that could pose a threat to national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["DHS provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are  reprinted in appendix I. DHS concurred with our two recommendations.   Regarding our recommendation to provide greater transparency in an  updated regulatory assessment, if CBP publishes such an assessment, DHS  concurred. Specifically, it stated that the potential elements we cited for  improving transparency will accompany the publication of a final rule for  the ISF and Additional Carrier Requirements. Such actions should address  the intent of our recommendation, provide greater transparency to the  trade industry and other stakeholders, help clarify CBP\u2019s decision-making  process, and provide better information about the circumstances under  which benefits justify costs. Regarding our recommendation to establish  milestones and time frames for updating the ATS national security  weighted rule set to use 10+2 data in its identification of shipments that  could pose a threat to national security, DHS commented that it had  already updated the weighted rule set for certain risk factors, some of  which are discussed in this report, and identified requirements for  modifying the weighted rule set for other risk factors, many of which it  stated have been incorporated into ATS and are available for preliminary  evaluation and analysis. Moreover, DHS stated that it has plans to fully  integrate these updates by November 2010. Establishing a time frame for  fully integrating these updates into ATS provides DHS with a goal for  completing the project to fulfill the purpose of the SAFE Port Act  requirement to collect additional data and can better position it to  effectively target high-risk container shipments. Therefore, although DHS  did not specifically discuss actions being taken to establish interim  milestones for integrating these requirements, effectively integrating the  updates into ATS by November 2010 would address the intent of our  recommendation.
