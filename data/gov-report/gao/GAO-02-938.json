The nation\u2019s payment system transfers an estimated $3 trillion dollars each day\u2014nearly one third of the U.S. gross domestic product. Because of the payment system\u2019s potential to affect overall economic activity, increasing payment system efficiency remains an ongoing goal for its various participants. You asked us to examine the potential implications of a recent proposal aimed at increasing payment system efficiency by instituting weekend settlement of financial transactions. Currently, settlement\u2014the final step in the transfer of ownership involving the physical exchange of payment or securities\u2014 occurs only during the business week. Some retailers, however, generate approximately half of their weekly sales on weekends\u2014when depository and other financial institutions generally are closed\u2014receiving cash, checks, and electronic payments that are not credited to their accounts until at least the next business day. These funds currently earn no interest for the retailers. The grocery industry is one segment of the retail sector where this is particularly pronounced. Grocery industry representatives have suggested that extending settlement services over the weekend could benefit retailers, the payment system, and the economy as a whole. As agreed with your staff, we identified the (1) potential benefits of weekend settlement for retailers, consumers, and the economy as a whole; (2) potential costs and operational issues for payment service providers as well as lower-cost alternatives to weekend settlement; and (3) legal considerations related to instituting weekend settlement.", "To identify the potential benefits, costs, and operational issues of weekend settlement, we interviewed consumer groups, retail businesses, and payment service providers including banking industry and investment market representatives, clearing organizations, and private electronic payment network operators. We also spoke with officials from various components of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) involved in the provision of payment system services and with senior staff from the Department of the Treasury involved in government securities markets and other senior staff. We obtained and analyzed data from grocery industry representatives, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Federal Reserve to estimate the forgone interest earnings of the grocery industry that result from the current settlement schedule. We also obtained information from selected foreign countries about the operating schedules of their respective settlement systems. Appendix I more fully describes our scope and methodology, appendix II depicts international settlement schedules; and appendix III details our estimation of the grocery industry\u2019s forgone interest earnings.", "Overall, we conducted our work within the context of the current institutional framework, which is based, in part, on current consumer preferences in payment instruments and existing technology. However, future changes in consumer preferences in payment instruments or technological innovations could alter the relative benefits and costs of weekend settlement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Retail payments are relatively high-volume, low-value payments. Retail payment methods include cash, checks, debit and credit card, and ACHtransactions. While depository institutions provide cash processing services to retailers and other depository institutions, the Federal Reserve provides cash processing services only to depository institutions and the U.S. government. The Federal Reserve and correspondent banks provide check collection and settlement services. The Federal Reserve and private electronic network operators provide clearance and settlement services for ACH transactions. Private electronic network operators also provide clearance and settlement services for debit card, credit card, and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions.", "For consumers and retailers, cash transactions are settled instantaneously. However, checks require a more complex settlement process and more time to settle. Depository institutions have several alternative methods for clearing and settling checks. Figure 1 illustrates an example of how a check is settled through direct presentment\u2014when depositary banks present checks directly to the paying bank. In practice, local checks generally settle in 1 business day and nonlocal checks generally settle in 1 to 2 business days. Currently, checks are settled on business days, which do not include weekends, resulting in a delay in the settlement of those checks deposited during the latter part of the week.", "Credit card and debit card payments also require a complex system to clear and settle transactions. A credit transaction is initiated when a customer\u2019s card number is entered into a card reader, followed by the transaction amount. The data are transmitted to the card-issuing bank. The card-issuing bank accepts or denies the transaction. If the transaction is authorized, the customer signs to accept liability for the transaction. In the case of a debit card, the customer enters a personal identification number or sign the sales receipt to accept liability for the transaction. At the end of that day, the retailer submits the customer\u2019s transactions along with all of the other credit card transactions to its depository institution (retailer\u2019s bank), which credits the retailer usually in 1 to 2 business days. The credit card company is then responsible for creating the net settlement positions that result in the transfer of funds from the card-issuing bank to the retailer\u2019s bank. These transfers typically occur by Fedwire funds tranfers through a correspondent bank. The card-issuing bank would then bill the customer. When the customer pays the bill, the cycle is complete, as shown in figure 2. Debit card transactions are authorized and cleared in a similar fashion to credit cards, except that they settle by debiting customers\u2019 accounts and crediting retailers\u2019 accounts on the next business day. Depository institutions use a variety of channels to settle credit and debit card transactions, including accounts at a common correspondent, ACH networks, and Fedwire. Final settlement of ACH transfers processed by the Federal Reserve occurs through debits and credits to the accounts of depository institutions on the books of the Federal Reserve. ACH transfers that are processed only by private-sector ACH operators are net settled through the Federal Reserve.", "Float is created because of the time it takes to clear and settle payments, which affects retailers, consumers, and depository institutions. Float is generally defined as the lag between the receipt of a check or other payment and the settlement of that payment. This lag differs according to the method of payment. There is no float for cash. Checks are subject to the longest float, primarily due to the need to physically transport checks.", "Federal law and regulations prohibit depository institutions from paying interest on demand deposits consisting primarily of commercial checking accounts. Many depository institutions, however, offer \u201csweep\u201d accounts to business customers as a mechanism by which these customers obtain interest earnings on account balances above negotiated account minimums. During the business week, the depository institution transfers, or \u201csweeps,\u201d commercial checking account balances above an agreed minimum into other accounts on which interest might be paid, such as MMDAs, or into interest-earning nondeposit financial instruments. Depository institutions typically invest these funds in short- term, low-risk assets, such as U.S. Treasury bills and notes, or money market mutual funds, among others. Depository institutions do not pay interest earnings on funds deposited on the weekend because they are unable to invest these funds until the next business day.", "Overall, U.S. settlement schedules are similar to settlement schedules in most G-10 countries. In some Asian countries, settlement services are available for a limited number of hours on Saturdays. Specifically, in Singapore and Hong Kong settlement occurs Saturday mornings, in addition to Monday through Friday services. Recently, South Korea ended its Saturday settlement hours because many commercial banks are closed on Saturdays.

Retail industry representatives identified weekend interest earnings as the main potential benefit for retailers. However, our analysis of grocery industry data indicated that the grocery industry currently forgoes small potential interest income on its weekend sales relative to the grocery industry\u2019s annual sales or the national economy. If weekend settlement were adopted, retailers also could realize some secondary benefits such as reducing the amount of cash held in stores. However, other secondary benefits such as accelerated settlement represent benefit transfers primarily from consumers or banks to retailers, creating no economic stimulus to the economy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Forgone Interest Earnings for the Grocery Industry and Retail Sector Are Small", "paragraphs": ["Although retail industry representatives identified weekend interest earnings as the main benefit for retailers, our analysis suggested that investing retailers\u2019 balances in sweep accounts and other investment vehicles over the weekend would provide minimal additional earnings to retailers and have virtually no impact relative to the economy as a whole. According to grocery industry publications, the industry had sales of $494 billion in year 2000, as seen in figure 3.", "Therefore, because depository institutions are unable to invest retailers\u2019 weekend cash deposits until Monday, we estimated, based on grocery industry data, that the grocery industry forgoes approximately $2.6 million each year in after-tax interest earnings, assuming a 2 percent interest rate, and $6.6 million a year, assuming an average 5 percent interest rate. The corresponding forgone after-tax interest earnings for check transactions are $2.8 million and $7 million annually, at 2 percent and 5 percent interest rates, respectively. Finally, for credit and debit cards, the forgone interest earnings are $2.5 million and $6.4 million, at 2 percent and 5 percent interest rates, respectively. Table 1 illustrates the estimates. Appendix III provides details of our estimates. Applying the same assumptions to the entire retail sector, which had sales of $3.4 trillion in the year 2000, we estimated that the annual forgone after-tax interest earnings for that sector would be $53.9 million at a 2 percent interest rate and $134 million at a 5 percent interest rate. However, these benefits might be reduced if depository institutions raised their fees, in a way that passed costs to retailers, to cover the increased costs associated with weekend operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retailers and Consumers Could Receive Secondary Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Weekend settlement could provide a number of secondary benefits to retailers and consumers. For example, retailers noted that weekend settlement would provide secondary benefits, such as reduced amounts of cash in stores, thereby reducing potential losses due to theft and lower insurance costs. The accelerated settlement of transactions would also benefit retailers by lowering accounts receivable balances, as noncash payments owed to retailers settle faster. Grocery officials stated that cash represents a large risk for store employees, and therefore, on a daily basis, grocers tend not to maintain large amounts of cash in stores. Excess sums generally are sent to depository institutions, usually via armored car services. Under the current system, depository institutions are not open to accept retailers\u2019 deposits on Saturday and Sunday evenings; therefore, deposits are generally maintained in store vaults or in bonded safes at the armored car services\u2019 facilities, which is a cost to retailers. Banking industry representatives stated that retailers currently must pay to insure large amounts of cash over the weekend. Finally, accelerated settlement of transactions could also benefit consumers if they are the recipients of check payments by making funds available sooner, assuming that the EFAA and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s implementing regulations were amended to include weekends in the definition of \u201cbusiness day.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weekend Settlement of Check, Credit and Debit Card Transactions Would Not Create New Interest Earnings; Rather, It Would Transfer Float Income", "paragraphs": ["The adoption of weekend settlement would transfer float income among retailers, consumers, and depository institutions rather than create new earnings. For example, retailers would earn interest income previously earned by check and debit card users, but no new interest income or wealth would be created. For credit cards, retailers potentially would obtain faster funds availability, but because card issuing depository institutions offer deferred payment to customers, retailers might earn additional interest income at the expense of depository institutions. For checks and debit cards, if retailers and consumers both had access to interest-bearing accounts or services provided by depository institutions, weekend settlement would move money more quickly out of customers\u2019 accounts and into retail sector accounts. On the other hand, retail industry representatives also stated that a disadvantage of weekend settlement would be that checks they had written would clear faster, thereby reducing interest currently earned on those funds. Faster funds availability from weekend settlement also could present drawbacks for consumers. Consumer advocates stated that consumers might face increased overdrafts if they did not adjust to the accelerated debiting of their checks. Weekend settlement would negatively affect those people who depend on check float to avoid account overdrafts. For example, consumers might write a check on a Friday afternoon for an amount greater than their account balance, knowing that on the following Monday their paycheck would be credited to the account and cover the amount of the check.", "Further, concerning the economy as a whole, the interest payments that retailers would receive from weekend settlement reflect transfers within the economy rather than the creation of income. For example, additional income that retailers might earn from weekend settlement of checks written or debit card transactions received from customers would be offset by corresponding losses of interest by check writers, debit card users, and depository institutions. Consumers with interest-bearing checking accounts would lose the interest they would have earned on checks written on Friday evenings and Saturdays. If checks were drawn on noninterest-bearing accounts, then depository institutions would lose funds on which they were not paying interest. Corporate treasurers of retail businesses noted that although they potentially could accumulate interest earnings if weekend settlement were adopted and interest-earning accounts were available, depository institutions might pass along some or all of the costs of operating on weekends to retailers and consumers in the form of higher fees, thus lessening the gains to retailers. Depository institutions stated that to pay interest, they would need to have access to short-term investment markets on weekends.

Banking industry representatives noted that small depository institutions that perform their own clearing and processing activities would need to hire additional staff to prepare cash and checks for weekend shipment to local Federal Reserve Banks and branches. This could be particularly costly for small depository institutions because \u201cback-office\u201d staffs often consist of one person. Similarly, Federal Reserve officials said that additional staff would be needed for check processing, ACH, Fedwire, internal accounting, credit and risk management, and information technology operations, as well as other support functions.

Some payment providers noted that once technology more generally allows faster computer processing, 6-day settlement could be possible because it would provide 1 day during which computer system maintenance could be performed. The second variation relates to selective processing of transactions by payment method\u2014for example, weekend processing of cash or check transactions. However, according to banking industry representatives, processing and settlement by payment method would be impractical because depository institutions\u2019 demand deposit accounting systems, which debit and credit customer accounts, do not differentiate transactions by payment methods. Rather, representatives from depository institutions stated that large batches of transactions are queued for debiting from and crediting to customer accounts regardless of the payment method associated with the transaction.

Some states, however, have laws prohibiting banks from doing business on Sundays or state holidays. OCC has determined that state bank closure laws do not apply to national banks. National banks, therefore, would not be prohibited from engaging in weekend settlement operations. However, in states prohibiting banks from operating on certain days, state-chartered banks would be precluded from conducting such operations on those days unless the closure laws were preempted. The federal financial institution regulators do not specifically regulate the hours of operation of state-chartered institutions, so state closure laws generally have not been preempted with respect to such institutions. We express no opinion regarding the extent to which the Federal Reserve, pursuant to its authority over the payment system, could preempt state closure laws in order to provide for weekend settlement services. It appears that Congress could choose to preempt such laws through legislation. Because they have not been preempted, state closure laws applicable to state banks could interfere with the development of a uniform national weekend settlements system. Our research indicates, however, that a relatively small number of states have Sunday closure laws.", "In addition to state closure laws, development of a weekend settlement system involves other legal considerations.

Even if banks were to conduct settlement operations over the weekend, such operations would not necessarily result in corresponding funds availability and check returns because weekends are not counted as business days. Moreover, the settlement process could be complicated by a lack of uniformity and predictability in bank operations that might exist if banks were to conduct their clearing and settlement operations using different timetables.", "Other legal considerations include the impact of wage and hour laws and matters of safety and soundness. To the extent bank employees involved in settlement operations are subject to federal and state wage and hour laws, institutions would have to ensure that weekend operations did not run afoul of provisions requiring, among other things, the payment of overtime for work in excess of 40 hours per week.

It also does not take into account that payments made by retailers, under weekend settlement, would be debited from their accounts earlier, thereby potentially decreasing their interest earnings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interest Rates", "paragraphs": ["To measure forgone interest earnings, we used the federal funds rate, the rate at which a bank with excess reserves at a Federal Reserve district bank charges other banks that need overnight funds. This is an appropriate measure because the excess grocery funds would be invested in a similar, short-term fashion. The average federal funds rate from January 1, 1998, to January 1, 2002, was approximately 5 percent. The current federal funds rate is approximately 2 percent. We estimated forgone earnings at both of these rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Period of Lost Earnings", "paragraphs": ["To gain credit for deposits for a given day, retailers must have deposits collected by approximately 2:00 p.m. on that day. Grocery industry representatives stated that most Friday sales tend to occur after that hour; therefore, we assumed that all proceeds from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday do not get deposited until Monday. However, Sunday proceeds deposited on Monday generally would be processed as quickly as money deposited Monday through Thursday; therefore, we did not include Sunday proceeds as idle balances."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Tonita W.
