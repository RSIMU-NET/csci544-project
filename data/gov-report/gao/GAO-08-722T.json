The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to move 8,000 Marines and an estimated 9,000 dependents from Okinawa, Japan, to Guam by the 2014 goal. GAO was asked to discuss the planning effort for the buildup of U.S. forces and facilities on Guam. Accordingly, this testimony addresses (1) DOD's planning process for the military buildup on Guam, (2) potential challenges for DOD and the government of Guam associated with the buildup, and (3) the status of planning efforts by the government of Guam to meet infrastructure challenges caused by the buildup. This testimony is based largely on findings of a September 2007 GAO report on DOD's overseas master plans and prior work on issues related to the U.S. military presence in Okinawa. It is also based, in part, on preliminary observations from an ongoing GAO review of DOD's planning effort to address the challenges associated with the military buildup on Guam and on other GAO work on the effects of DOD-related growth on surrounding communities in the continental United States.

This part of the planning process is ongoing, along with the development of a required environmental impact statement, currently expected to be issued in 2010. However, DOD will submit budget requests for fiscal year 2010 prior to that date, and thus may not know the full extent of its facility requirements before asking Congress to provide the associated funding. Officials of the Navy's Joint Guam Program Office told us that immediately after the environmental impact statement is completed, DOD will commence construction of facilities in efforts to meet the 2014 goal discussed in the Defense Policy Review Initiative. However, other DOD and government of Guam officials believe that this is an optimistic schedule considering the possibility that the environmental impact statement could be delayed, the complexities of moving thousands of Marines and their dependents to Guam, and the need to obtain sufficient funding from the governments of United States and Japan to support the move. DOD and the government of Guam face several significant challenges associated with the proposed military buildup on Guam. DOD's challenges include obtaining adequate funding and meeting operational needs, such as mobility support and training capabilities. There are also challenges in addressing the effects of military and civilian growth on Guam's community and civilian infrastructure. For example, according to DOD and government of Guam officials, Guam's highways may be unable to bear the increase in traffic associated with the military buildup, its electrical system may not be adequate to deliver the additional energy needed, its water and wastewater treatment systems are already near capacity, and its solid waste facilities face capacity and environmental challenges even without the additional burden associated with the projected increase in U.S. forces and their dependents. The government of Guam's efforts to plan to meet infrastructure challenges caused by the buildup of military forces and facilities are in the initial stages, and existing uncertainties associated with the military buildup contribute to the difficulties Guam officials face in developing precise plans. These challenges are somewhat analogous to challenges communities around continental U.S. growth bases face. Government of Guam officials recognize that the island's infrastructure is inadequate to meet the projected demand; however, funding sources are uncertain. These same officials are uncertain as to whether and to what extent the government of Guam will be able to obtain financial assistance for projected infrastructure demands due to the military buildup. In September 2007, GAO reported that most communities experiencing civilian and military population growth at Army installations in the continental United States will likely incur costs to provide adequate schools, transportation, and other infrastructure improvements, and many of these communities are also seeking federal and state assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the planning effort  for the buildup of U.S. forces and facilities in Guam and to describe the  associated challenges for the Department of Defense (DOD) and the local  community in accommodating the expansion of DOD\u2019s military presence  on Guam. To reduce the burden of the U.S. military presence on Japanese  communities while maintaining a continuing presence of U.S. forces in the  region, the U.S.-Japan Defense Policy Review Initiative established a  framework for the future of U.S. force structure in Japan, including the  relocation of American military units in Japan to other areas, including  Guam. As a part of this initiative, DOD plans to move 8,000 Marines and  their estimated 9,000 dependents from Okinawa, Japan, to Guam by the  2014 goal. At the same time, the other military services are also planning to  expand their operations and military presence on Guam. For example, the  Navy plans to enhance its infrastructure, logistic capabilities, and  waterfront facilities; the Air Force plans to develop a global intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance strike hub at Andersen Air Force Base;  and the Army plans to place a ballistic missile defense task force on Guam.  As a result of these plans and the Marine Corps realignment, the total  military buildup on Guam is estimated to cost over $13 billion and increase  Guam\u2019s current population of 171,000 by an estimated 25,000 active duty  military personnel and dependents (or 14.6 percent) to 196,000. The  government of Japan is expected to contribute about $6.1 billion toward  the costs of the Marine Corps move, although a portion of these funds  could be repaid over time by the U.S. government.", "We have issued several reports on DOD\u2019s integrated global presence and  basing strategy and its overseas master plans for changing U.S. military  infrastructure overseas as required by the fiscal year 2004 Senate military  construction appropriation bill report.

In that report, we found that DOD\u2019s planning effort for the military  buildup on Guam was in its initial stages, with many key decisions and  challenges yet to be addressed. Additionally, we found that the potential  effects of the increase in military forces on Guam\u2019s infrastructure\u2014in  terms of population and military facilities\u2014had not been fully addressed.  Also, in September 2007, we reported how communities in the continental  United States are planning and funding for infrastructure to support  significant personnel growth in response to implementing base  realignment and closure, overseas force rebasing, and force modularity  actions.", "As requested, my testimony today will focus on three principal objectives.  First, I will address DOD\u2019s planning process for the military buildup on  Guam.

The U.S. military occupation of  Japan ended in 1952, but the United States administered the Ryukyu  Islands, including Okinawa, until 1972. Efforts to address the Japanese  population\u2019s concerns regarding U.S. military presence in Okinawa began  more than a decade ago. One chief complaint is that the Okinawa  prefecture hosts over half of the U.S. forces in Japan and that more than   70 percent of the land U.S. forces utilize in Japan is on Okinawa. Many  citizens of Okinawa believe the U.S. presence has hampered economic  development. The public outcry in Okinawa following the September 1995  abduction and rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S.  servicemembers brought to the forefront long-standing concerns among  the Okinawan people about the effects of the U.S. military presence on the  island. According to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, at that time,  the continued ability of the United States to remain in Japan was at risk,  and it was important to reduce the effects of the U.S. military presence on  the Okinawan people. To address these concerns, bilateral negotiations  between the United States and Japan began, and the Security Consultative  Committee established the Special Action Committee on Okinawa in  November 1995. The committee developed recommendations on ways to  limit the effects of the U.S. military presence on Okinawa by closing  Marine Corps Air Station Futenma and relocating forces from that base to  another base on Okinawa, and recommended numerous other operational  changes. On December 2, 1996, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, U.S.  Ambassador to Japan, Japan Ministers of Foreign Affairs and State, and  the Director General of the Japan Defense Agency issued the committee\u2019s  final report.", "In 1998, we reviewed the Special Action Committee\u2019s Final Report. At  that time, among other things, we reported that the forward deployment  on Okinawa significantly shortens transit times, thereby promoting early  arrival in potential regional trouble spots such as the Korean peninsula  and the Taiwan straits. For example, it takes 2 hours to fly to the Korean  peninsula from Okinawa, as compared with about 5 hours from Guam,   11 hours from Hawaii, and 16 hours from the continental United States.  Similarly, it takes about 1-1/2 days to make the trip from Okinawa by ship  to South Korea, as compared with about 5 days from Guam, 12 days from  Hawaii, and 17 days from the continental United States. Also, the cost of  this presence is shared by the government of Japan, which provides land  and other infrastructure on Okinawa rent free and pays part of the annual  cost of Okinawa-based Marine Corps forces, such as a portion of the costs  for utilities and local Japanese labor. Most initiatives of the Special Action  Committee on Okinawa involving training operations, changes to the  status of forces agreement procedures, and noise reduction were  successfully implemented. In contrast, initiatives involving land returns  have not been as successful, with the majority still ongoing. For example,  the closure of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma was never completed and  the air station remains open and operational. According to U.S. Forces  Japan officials, these initiatives may involve multiple construction projects  to satisfy the requirements of the initiatives as well as detailed  coordination between the government of Japan and the local communities  to gain consensus for these projects.", "In 2004, the United States and Japan began a series of sustained security  consultations aimed at strengthening the U.S.-Japan security alliance to  better address today\u2019s rapidly changing global security environment.  DOD\u2019s Defense Policy Review Initiative established a framework for the  future of U.S. force structure in Japan designed to create the conditions to  reduce the burden on Japanese communities and create a continuing  presence for U.S. forces in the Pacific theater by relocating units to other  areas, including Guam (app. I shows the location of Guam). This initiative  also includes a significant reduction and reorganization of the Marine  Corps presence on Okinawa to include relocating 8,000 Marines and their  estimated 9,000 dependents to Guam. More than 10,000 Marines and their  dependents will remain stationed in Okinawa after this relocation. Another  initiative includes the closure and replacement of Marine Corps Air Station  Futenma at a less densely populated location on Okinawa by the 2014 goal  as a result of local concerns involving safety and noise. DOD officials view  the success of the Futenma replacement facility as a key objective of the  initiative that will need to be completed in order for other realignment  actions to take place. Previously, the United States and Japan were  unsuccessful in closing and replacing the Marine Corps Air Station  Futenma as a part of the Special Action Committee effort on Okinawa."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Global Realignments", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, DOD has been undergoing a transformation that has been  described as the most comprehensive restructuring of U.S. military forces  overseas since the end of the Korean War.

In addition to the Marine Corps\u2019  move to Guam, the Navy plans to enhance its infrastructure, logistic  capabilities, and waterfront facilities to support transient nuclear aircraft  carrier berthing, combat logistics force ships, submarines, surface  combatants, and high-speed transport ships at Naval Base Guam. The Air  Force plans to develop a global intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance strike hub at Andersen Air Force Base by hosting various  types of aircraft, such as fighters, bombers, and tankers, and the Global  Hawk system, which is a high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial  reconnaissance system, on both permanent and rotational bases. The  Army also plans to place a ballistic missile defense task force on Guam  with approximately 630 soldiers and 950 dependents. As a result of these  plans and the Marine Corps realignment, the active duty military personnel  and dependent population of more than 14,000 on Guam is expected to  increase approximately 176 percent to more than 39,000 (app. II shows  current U.S. military bases on Guam)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Master Planning Requirements for the Military Buildup on Guam", "paragraphs": ["As initiatives for expanding the U.S. military presence on Guam began to  emerge, the Senate Appropriations Committee noted the ambitiousness of  the military construction program and the need for a well-developed  master plan to efficiently use the available land and infrastructure.

In its Defense of Japan  2006 publication, the Japan Ministry of Defense reported that more than   70 percent of U.S. facilities and areas are concentrated in Okinawa and  regional development has been greatly affected by the concentration.  That publication recommended that the relocation of the U.S. Marine  Corps forces from Okinawa to Guam should occur as soon as possible.

A DOD  analysis of training opportunities in Guam concluded that no ranges on  Guam are suitable for the needs of the projected Marine Corps force  because of inadequacy in size or lack of availability. U.S. Pacific Command  is also in the process of conducting a training study that covers both Guam  and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to see what  options are available for training in the region. Marine Forces Pacific  officials stated that live-fire artillery training, amphibious landings, and  tracked vehicle operations will be challenging because of the combination  of factors associated with the limited size of training areas available and  the environmental concerns on the Northern Mariana Islands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase in Military Presence Is Likely to Cause Local Community and Infrastructure Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The increase in military presence is expected to have significant effects on  Guam\u2019s community and infrastructure, and these challenges have not been  fully addressed. This undertaking is estimated to increase the current  Guam population of approximately 171,000 by an estimated 25,000 active  duty military personnel and dependents (or 14.6 percent) to 196,000. The  Guam population could also swell further because DOD\u2019s personnel  estimates do not include defense civilians and contractors who are also  likely to move to Guam to support DOD operations.", "DOD and government of Guam officials recognize that the military buildup  will have significant effects on the local community. For example:    As a result of the military buildup on Guam, construction demands will  exceed local capacity and the availability of workers, though the extent  to which the local workers can meet this increase has yet to be  determined. For example, on the basis of trend data, government of  Guam officials estimate the current construction capacity to be  approximately $800 million per year, as compared with the estimated  construction capacity of more than $3 billion per year needed by DOD  to meet the planned 2014 completion date. In addition, Guam currently  faces a shortage of skilled construction workers. Preliminary analysis  indicates that 15,000 to 20,000 construction workers will be required to  support the projected development on Guam. One estimate is that  Guam may be able to meet only 10 to 15 percent of the labor  requirement locally, a concern to federal, military, and local officials.  Nearby countries may have workers willing to come to Guam to take  jobs to construct needed facilities, but these workers will have to  temporarily enter the United States on temporary nonagricultural  workers visas, currently capped at 66,000 per year. JGPO officials said  that legislation recently passed by both the Senate and the House of  Representatives that will increase the cap in the short term is a first  step toward addressing many of their concerns with temporary  nonagricultural workers visas.", "The government of Guam has expressed several concerns about the  potential effects of an influx of foreign workers on Guam\u2019s community.  The Civilian Military Task Force recommended that Guam needs to  establish a department that would focus on processing foreign  workers. Further, a government of Guam report stated that the influx  of foreign workers would put a strain on existing emergency care  services, medical facilities, and public utilities.", "In addition, DOD and government of Guam officials recognize that the  island\u2019s infrastructure is inadequate to meet the increased demand due to  the military buildup. For example:    Guam\u2019s commercial port has capacity constraints with pier berthing  space, crane operations, and container storage locations. The military  buildup requires a port with double the current capacity, and military  cargo is expected to increase sixfold during construction of facilities  required for the buildup.", "Guam\u2019s two major highways are in poor condition and, when ordnance  (ammunition and explosives) is unloaded from ships for Andersen Air  Force Base now and for the Marine Corps in the future, the ordnance  must be transported on one of these major roads that run through  highly populated areas. The current highway system also experiences  slippery surfaces, potholes, and occasional flooding. Traffic between  military installations and commercial, business, and residential areas is  anticipated to increase significantly with the military buildup.", "Guam\u2019s electrical system\u2014the sole power provider on the island\u2014is  not reliable and has transmission problems resulting in brownouts and  voltage and frequency fluctuations. The system may not be adequate to  deliver the additional energy requirements associated with the military  buildup.", "Guam\u2019s water and wastewater treatment systems are near capacity and  have a history of failure due to aged and deteriorated distribution lines.  The military buildup may increase demand by at least 25 percent.", "Guam\u2019s solid waste facilities face capacity and environmental  challenges as they have reached the end of their useful life. Currently,  the solid waste landfills in Guam have a number of unresolved issues  related to discharge of pollutants and are near capacity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Government of Guam\u2019s Planning Efforts Are in Their Initial Stages", "paragraphs": ["The government of Guam\u2019s planning efforts to address infrastructure  challenges associated with the buildup of military forces are in the initial  stages, and several uncertainties further contribute to the difficulties the  government of Guam faces in developing precise plans to address the  effects of the military buildup on the local community and infrastructure.  In addition, funding sources to address infrastructure challenges are  uncertain. As we have found with some communities experiencing civilian  and military population growth surrounding Army installations in the  continental United States, the government of Guam will likely ask for  assistance to provide civilian infrastructure improvements.", "Two recent studies that examine the various effects of the military buildup  on the local infrastructure and community were developed by the  government of Guam and KPMG. First, the Governor of Guam  commissioned the Civilian Military Task Force to develop a plan that  would both accommodate the military personnel expansion and provide  opportunities for the Guam community. The task force issued its report in  November 2007, which provided a synopsis of the various funding and  resource needs. Second, the government of Guam contracted KPMG to  examine the needs and challenges Guam faces in regard to the military  buildup. The October 2007 report made preliminary assessments on the  effects of the military buildup on Guam\u2019s infrastructure, economy, and  social services. One study estimated that more than $3 billion will be  required for civilian infrastructure and government services to address the  military buildup.", "The uncertainties associated with exact size, makeup, and timing of the  forces to be moved to Guam make it difficult for the government of Guam  to develop comprehensive plans to address the effects of the proposed  military buildup. Guam officials said that without accurate information it  is difficult to develop an infrastructure program that identifies civilian  construction projects and financing to support the military buildup and to  form an administrative structure to oversee and coordinate project  scheduling and implementation. In our September 2007 report on  communities experiencing civilian and military population growth at  continental U.S. Army installations, we found that without knowing  whether Army headquarters-level offices or the local base plans have  accurate information about the expected growth, communities are not  well positioned to plan for and provide adequate schools, housing,  transportation, and other infrastructure.", "As discussed previously, government of Guam officials recognize that the  island\u2019s infrastructure is inadequate to meet the projected demand and will  likely require significant funding to address this challenge. However, the  extent to which the government of Guam will be able to obtain financial  assistance for projected infrastructure demands from the federal  government is unclear. Government of Guam officials we met with were  uncertain as to whether and to what extent federal grant programs will be  available to address Guam\u2019s public infrastructure to support the military  realignments. On the basis of its initial review, KPMG reported that the  data it collected from the government of Guam suggested that it is likely  there will be a significant funding gap between the availability of funds  and requirements for Guam\u2019s infrastructure program. KPMG further  reported that $282 million in federal funding was provided to Guam in  2006. Without additional federal assistance, government of Guam officials  believe that local infrastructure improvements to accommodate the  military buildup would take decades to complete. In our September 2007  report on U.S. communities experiencing civilian and military population  growth at Army installations, we found that communities will likely incur  costs to provide adequate schools, transportation, and other infrastructure  improvements. Because of limited local funding, some of these  communities are seeking federal and state assistance.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
