Recent studies comparing the compensation of federal workers to workers in other sectors have produced varying findings. To improve understanding of federal pay setting, GAO was asked to examine (1) how annual pay adjustments for the GS system are determined; (2) the extent to which the pay increases and awards available to GS employees recognize individual performance, and how the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provides oversight of pay increases and awards; and (3) how selected studies compare federal and private pay and total compensation and the factors that may account for the different findings.", "GAO reviewed legislation, OPM regulations, executive orders, and federal agency documents; analyzed OPM data; and interviewed agency officials.

GAO compared and contrasted the differences between their approaches, methodologies, and data sources, and interviewed the studies\u0092 authors, people with expertise in compensation issues, and agency officials responsible for the data. GAO provided drafts to agencies and study authors for review and comment and made technical changes as appropriate in response to comments received. One study author provided written comments concurring with the findings.

GS employees receive an across-the-board increase (ranging from 0 to 3.8 percent since FEPCA was implemented) that has usually been made in accordance with a FEPCA formula linking increases to national private sector salary growth. This increase is the same for each employee. GS employees also receive a locality increase that varies based on their location; there were 34 pay localities in 2012. While FEPCA specifies a process designed to reduce federal-nonfederal pay gaps in each locality, in practice locality increases have usually been far less than the recommended amount, which has been over 15 percent in recent years. For 2012, when there was a freeze on annual pay adjustments, the FEPCA process had recommended a 1.1 percent across-the-board increase and an average 18.5 percent locality increase.", "GS employees are eligible to receive three types of pay increases and monetary awards that are linked to individual performance appraisals: within-grade increases, ratings-based cash awards, and quality step increases. Within-grade increases are the least strongly linked to performance, ratings-based cash awards are more strongly linked to performance depending on the rating system the agency uses, and quality step increases are also more strongly linked to performance.", "Findings of selected pay and total compensation (pay and benefit) comparison studies varied due to different approaches, methods, and data. Regarding their pay analysis, the studies\u0092 conclusions varied on which sector had the higher pay and the size of pay disparities. However, the overall pay disparity number does not tell the whole story; each of the studies that examined whether differences in pay varied among categories of workers, such as highly or less educated workers or workers in different occupations, found such variations. Three approaches were used to compare pay:", "human capital approach (3 studies)\u0097compares pay for individuals with various personal attributes (e.g., education, experience) and other attributes (e.g., occupation, firm size);", "job-to-job approach (2 studies)\u0097compares pay for similar jobs of various types based on job-related attributes such as occupation, does not take into account the personal attributes of the workers currently filling them; and", "trend analysis approach (1 study)\u0097illustrates broad trends in pay over time without controlling for attributes of the workers or jobs.", "When looking within and across the studies, it is important to understand the studies\u0092 differences in approach, methods, and data because they impact how the studies can be interpreted. The differences among the selected studies are such that comparing their results to help inform pay decisions is potentially problematic. Given the different approaches of the selected studies, their findings should not be taken in isolation as the answer to how federal pay and total compensation compares with other sectors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Skilled federal workers are integral to the successful operation of every  government function.

As a result,  today\u2019s federal jobs require more advanced skills at higher grade levels  than federal jobs 30 years ago. Additionally, federal jobs, on average,  require more advanced skills and degrees than private sector jobs. This is  because a higher proportion of federal jobs than nonfederal are in skilled  occupations such as science, engineering, and program management,  while a lower proportion of federal jobs than nonfederal are in  occupations such as manufacturing, construction, and service work. The  result is that the federal workforce is on average more highly educated  than the private sector workforce.", "Given the changes in the federal workforce over the last 30 years, there  has been growing interest in reexamining the federal pay system\u2014how  pay is determined and how comparisons with other sectors are made.  Specifically, we have reported on the importance of considering the skills,  knowledge, and performance of employees as well as the local labor  market in making pay decisions.

We analyzed data for employees in the  GS pay plan in the aggregate on the number, percentage, and dollar  amount of selected pay increases and awards; the amount of these  increases and awards as a portion of GS payroll (total adjusted basic pay  for all employees in the GS pay plan); and the distribution of these  increases and awards by rating pattern and rating levels from OPM\u2019s  Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) for fiscal year 2011. To help  determine the reliability and accuracy of the CPDF data elements used,  we checked the data for reasonableness and the presence of any obvious  or potential errors in accuracy and completeness; reviewed past GAO  analyses of the reliability of CPDF data; and interviewed OPM officials  knowledgeable about the data. We believe the CPDF is sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of this report. To describe how OPM provides  oversight of pay increases and awards, we collected and analyzed OPM  guidance to agencies including regulations, memoranda, reports, fact  sheets, and frequently asked questions. We also interviewed OPM  officials responsible for federal pay policies to discuss the implementation  of the guidance and monitoring of agencies\u2019 use of increases and awards  through reports and other means; and interviewed OPM officials  responsible for conducting human capital management evaluations at  agencies on pay increases and awards and the overall GS pay system,  among other things.", "To review selected studies that compare federal and private sector pay  and total compensation and describe factors that help account for the  different study findings, we conducted a detailed literature review of  academic journals, agency and organization publications, and other  sources and applied three criteria to the results, selecting five studies  that: (1) were published/issued since 2005; (2) include original analysis;  and (3) have the explicit and primary purpose of comparing federal and  private sector pay and total compensation.

Agencies use a uniform set of classification  standards to determine grade levels for their positions organized within  five occupational categories\u2014Professional, Administrative, Technical,  Clerical, and Other White-Collar (PATCO). The GS system of  classification was established by the Classification Act of 1949 in  response to calls for a modernized system to ensure equity in pay  setting. Until the late 1960s, general pay adjustments for federal  employees were made through acts of Congress. The Federal Pay  Comparability Act of 1970 permanently authorized the President to adjust  GS pay rates annually, and established a system for recommending  adjustments with the goal of increasing federal pay to be comparable with  the private sector; however, we previously found that the gap between  average federal and private sector salaries for similar jobs continued after  implementation of the act because the recommended adjustments were  not always made.", "The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) created  annual locality-based pay adjustments for GS employees to reduce  reported gaps between federal and nonfederal pay in metropolitan  areas.  In addition, FEPCA maintained an annual across-the-board pay  adjustment that is the same for each employee to keep the GS base pay  schedule in line with salary growth in the general labor market, similar to  what had already existed under the 1970 act.", "Before FEPCA, federal employees doing the same job at the same level  anywhere in the country were paid the same amount. However, there  was a growing concern that it was difficult to recruit and retain skilled  federal employees in areas with higher nonfederal wages. We concluded  that locality-based pay adjustments were necessary. FEPCA  established locality pay, and the President\u2019s Pay Agent designated pay  localities based on Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  Metropolitan Statistical Areas. FEPCA\u2019s goal was to reduce the gap  between federal and nonfederal pay in each locality, as measured by BLS  data and reported by the President\u2019s Pay Agent, to 5 percent over the  course of 9 years. This goal was not met, but locality pay increases have  been provided every year since locality pay was implemented in 1994,  except during the pay freeze in 2011 and 2012. According to OPM,  locality pay is now a broadly accepted practice in federal pay  administration.

Study authors  who used this approach said that analyzing federal and private sector  workers\u2019 pay was a way to measure the extent to which the federal  government may be overpaying or underpaying its employees compared  to what they could earn in the private sector. On the other hand, the job- to-job approach compares pay for similar jobs on such job-related  attributes as occupation and level of work rather than personal attributes.  The President\u2019s Pay Agent, which used this approach, examined how pay  for GS and nonfederal jobs compared for the same occupations and  levels of work within the same locality pay areas with the goal of reducing  existing pay disparities. Simply put, the differences among the selected  studies are such that comparing their results to help inform pay decisions  is potentially problematic.

These pay increases and awards are:  within-grade increases, quality step increases, and ratings-based cash  awards. We recognize that there are other types of pay increases and  awards that reflect an individual\u2019s contributions, such as  suggestion/invention and superior accomplishment awards, and pay  increases that do not reflect an individual\u2019s performance at all including  across-the-board and locality pay adjustments. We identified eligibility  requirements outlined in the legislation and regulations and clarified in  OPM guidance that can affect a GS employee\u2019s eligibility for the increase  or award, such as a waiting period given the individual\u2019s position in the  pay grade, frequency of receiving an increase or award, and agency- specific criteria.", "To provide statistics on how the pay increases and awards were  distributed among GS employees, we analyzed data from OPM\u2019s Central   The data we examined  Personnel Data File (CPDF) for fiscal year 2011.included only federal employees in the GS pay plan.

In addition to the GS pay  plan, the GM and GL pay plans are used in federal-nonfederal pay  comparisons to set locality pay. For the purposes of this analysis, we  excluded the GM and GL pay plans because the GS pay plan covers the  majority of the individuals in the GS, GM, and GL pay plans.

We  also reviewed past GAO analyses of the reliability of CPDF data and  interviewed OPM officials knowledgeable about the data to discuss the  data\u2019s accuracy and steps OPM takes to ensure they are reliable. For  example, in its checks of the data, OPM excludes data where the dollar  value is zero for ratings-based cash awards and within-grade and quality  step increases. Also, for within-grade and quality step increases, OPM  checks to make sure values for current and prior adjusted basic pay exist  and the difference is greater than zero.

In 1998, they  determined that the NCS was not suitable for use without improvements,  and a working group with representatives of OPM, BLS, and OMB was  formed to recommend improvements. The working group made  recommendations in 1999 that led to five improvements in the NCS data.  The improvements were implemented starting in 2002, at which point the  Pay Agent began to phase in use of NCS data. The recommendations are  outlined in figure 6 above.", "In 2008, the Federal Salary Council asked BLS to explore the use of  additional sources of pay data so the Council could better evaluate the  need for establishing additional locality pay areas, especially in areas  where the NCS could not provide estimates of nonfederal pay. BLS  developed a model to combine data from the Occupational Employment  Statistics (OES) survey, another BLS survey, with NCS data in order to  increase locality coverage. In 2010, due to budget cuts, BLS announced a  reduction in the size of the NCS sample, and said that the model results  from the combined surveys could still be used to calculate pay gaps.  According to BLS officials, only the size of the NCS sample has changed,  not the substance of what is collected, and the reduction should not affect  the ability to determine levels of work.", "The Federal Salary Council wrote in its 2011 memo to the President\u2019s  Pay Agent that it had concerns about the reduction. For 2011, the final  year when the larger NCS data set was available, the Federal Salary  Council reviewed modeled results both with and without the reduction,  and found concerning discrepancies (about a 5 point average difference  in computed pay gaps). In its memo, the Council recommended that the  Pay Agent use only NCS data for setting pay until the new model is better  understood, and that the full NCS survey be reinstated. The Council wrote  that it plans to continue working with OPM and BLS to study the  NCS/OES model.", "The President\u2019s Pay Agent wrote in its 2011 report dated March 2012 that  it does not consider more funding for NCS to be feasible before exploring  other options. The Pay Agent supported the Council\u2019s plan to continue its  review of the new model and to focus on the impact of dropping roughly  half of the NCS sample on the volatility of the model. The Pay Agent also  noted that the administration recommended Congress establish a  Commission on Federal Public Service Reform composed of members of  Congress, representatives from the President\u2019s Labor-Management  Council, members of the private sector, and academic experts to identify  fundamental reforms for the federal government\u2019s human capital systems  including compensation reform.

They also varied slightly in  how they defined the federal workforce and restricted their analysis of  workers.", "Studies could control for many attributes\u2014personal or job-related\u2014to  help explain the differences between federal and private sector pay, as  shown in the previous table. The types of attributes the selected study  authors controlled for depended on the type of approach used to analyze  pay\u2014human capital or job-to-job. For example, the human capital  approach controls for personal attributes (e.g., education, job experience)  and job-related attributes (e.g., occupation, firm size). The job-to-job  approach involves controlling for job-related attributes (e.g., occupation,  level of work) without considering the personal attributes of the workers.  The trend analysis approach does not control for any attributes. Attributes  such as occupation, level of work, firm size, locality, education, and job  experience were considered relevant by several of the studies\u2019 authors  and people with expertise in compensation issues that we interviewed.", "Controlling for occupation allows a study to account for  different pay rates for different types of jobs. The distribution of  occupations in the federal government is different from the private or  nonfederal sector, which may be a factor that explains differences in  pay. For example, according to the CBO study, 33 percent of the  federal workforce compared with 18 percent of the private sector  workforce was in a professional occupation. A job-to-job approach, as  demonstrated by the study authors who used the approach, involves  matching federal workers to equivalent positions in another sector.  POGO limited its comparison to 35 selected occupations, while the  Pay Agent used over 200 occupations. According to one of the people  with expertise that we interviewed, one challenge with this approach is  the difficulty of finding nonfederal equivalents for certain positions,  such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, that only exist in  the government. Another person with expertise said matching  occupations across sectors is a subjective process. In contrast, study  authors using the human capital approach used fewer and much  broader occupational groups. For example, Biggs/Richwine used 10  categories, while Sherk and CBO used 22 and 24, respectively. In  addition to his analysis of the overall pay disparity, Sherk analyzed  pay data with and without occupation controls, and reported that less  was explained when occupation was not included in the analysis.", "Level of Work: Controlling for level of work (or grade level) allows a  study to account for different pay rates for different levels of job  complexity and responsibility (e.g., entry-level, mid-level, senior level  or finer distinctions by level). Level of work encompasses types of  duties performed, the scope and effect of the work, the level of  difficulty and responsibility, and the level of supervision received. It  can be difficult to measure level of work since levels are defined  differently in different workplace settings. Of the studies we examined,  only the President\u2019s Pay Agent Report controls for level of work. For  federal employment in the GS pay system, there are 15 grade levels.  To compare these with levels in nonfederal workplaces, BLS  economists ranked nonfederal positions based on four factors:  knowledge, job controls and complexity, contacts (nature and  purpose), and physical environment.observed that the human capital approach does not recognize that  there are many different levels within an occupation such as  accountant or lawyer.", "Firm size: Controlling for firm size allows a study to account for the  effect of the number of workers in a firm. Some of the study authors  asserted that large firms tend to offer higher salaries and greater  benefits than smaller firms, but they differed on the decision to control  for this attribute. CBO and Biggs/Richwine felt that federal workers  should be compared to private sector workers at similarly sized  institutions (e.g., firms with at least 1,000 workers) and included a  measure of firm size in their analyses. The reasons the authors cited  included large firms requiring more occupational specialization or  higher levels of skill than smaller firms. Sherk said he chose not to  control for firm size because he views it as a proxy for individual ability  in the private sector\u2014the larger firms pay a premium to hire more  capable individuals and the associated pay reflects that. He said this  is not the case in the federal government; the federal government  does not selectively hire employees from large corporations but  competes for hiring with all sizes of firms in the private sector. Sherk  felt that including firm size could bias results if more productive  workers tend to work in larger firms in the private, but not the federal  sector. A person with expertise we interviewed agreed that a larger  firm would pay more and have better benefits and noted that large  firms are in head-to-head hiring competition with the federal  government. In 2008, the President\u2019s Pay Agent decided to include  data from all establishments in its locality pay recommendations to  increase the amount of data available for jobs. Since locality pay  began in 1994, the Pay Agent had used only data from large  establishments in its calculations.expertise that we interviewed, the larger sample of data helps improve  the quality of the job matching.", "See app. II for more information on the implementation of locality pay since 1994. organization.

Experience both at a specific job and in general can affect pay,  presumably because it can affect productivity, which can be  accounted for in the human capital approach. Biggs/Richwine, CBO,  and Sherk considered job experience a relevant attribute. However,  the CPS does not include a direct measure of job experience. As a  result, the studies use proxies to measure experience. For example,  Biggs/Richwine and CBO used a common approach for measuring  experience, \u201cage minus years of education minus 6,\u201d while Sherk  included age in his model. According to a university professor we  interviewed who has done research on compensation issues across  sectors, there is no data set that measures how long a private sector  worker has been out of the workforce or how long a worker has been  working for a given employer. Age can be used as a proxy, but age  does not reflect time out of the workforce for child-rearing or other  reasons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Total Compensation Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The selected studies varied in the data sources used, benefits included,  and methodologies chosen in analyzing benefits as a part of total  compensation, as shown in table 7.

The CPS\u2014and in particular, the  monthly CPS\u2014has a large sample size relative to other data sources  enabling analyses that would not have been possible in data sets with  a smaller sample size. According to Sherk, he used the monthly CPS  because he needed at least 30 valid observations of occupations in  both the public and private sectors for his analysis comparing detailed  occupations. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the  CPS has questions that are more indepth than the monthly CPS and it  contains measures of job tenure, educational degree, and firm size.  Individuals interviewed for the monthly or Annual Social and  Economic Supplement of the CPS are self-reporting in their  responses, which can result in reporting errors.

While the survey covers all  sectors, it does not collect data on federal workers, which\u2014according  to the study authors who used the NCS\u2014results in the need to piece  together different sources of benefits information in order to get  comparable data. The NCS also provides detailed pay information by  occupational work level that is based on the duties and responsibilities  of a job, which is a key source of information for the President\u2019s Pay  Agent when determining locality pay adjustment amounts. Recently,  the sample size for the NCS was reduced, and BLS has developed a  model to determine locality pay using a combination of the NCS and  the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey.
