As part of our search criteria,  we also sought publications that examined outcomes or practices  associated with joint duty assignments following the implementation of the  Goldwater-Nichols Act because their findings may be relevant to  interagency rotations. In general, however, we did not use the type of  organizations or policy arena as an exclusionary criterion. If it was clear  how the policies, practices, or possible outcomes could be applied to job  rotation programs in the federal national security arena, we included them  in our selection for in-depth analysis. For example, we did not exclude  publications that focused on the human services policy arena or the  manufacturing sector simply because their context was not identical to  that of the federal national security arena.
