Hence, residues of these pesticides may be unavoidable in certain foods. To provide standards for regulating these unavoidable residues in foods, EPA recommends action levels, which FDA and USDA have agreed to establish for use in monitoring and enforcement, in accordance with EPA\u2019s 1982 policy. In recommending action levels, EPA\u2019s policy requires the agency to assess health risks as well as the extent to which residues are unavoidable in foods and to periodically lower action levels as residues of canceled pesticides decline in the environment.", "Like a tolerance, an action level specifies the maximum amount of a pesticide\u2019s residues that may be allowed in or on a food or feed. However, an action level is established only for residues that are considered unavoidable in a certain food. An action level may be established to take the place of a tolerance that has been revoked. An action level may also be established for a pesticide\u2019s unavoidable residues in a food for which a tolerance was never set because the pesticide was never registered for use on that food. FDA issued a notice in the Federal Register (55 Fed. Reg. 14359, Apr. 17, 1990) explaining how the agency would use action levels. FDA stated that, according to FFDCA, \u201cin the absence of a tolerance, any amount of a pesticide residue in a food or feed is unsafe and therefore renders the food or feed adulterated.\u201d But when a food or feed is unavoidably contaminated with certain persistent pesticides that do not have tolerances, FDA said that it would use action levels to provide guidance for determining when enforcement action was warranted.", "Most of the action levels that EPA has proposed or recommended have been for a group of chlorinated compounds\u2014including DDT, chlordane, and dieldrin\u2014that were widely used in U.S. agriculture during the 1950s and 1960s. Because these compounds were later found to pose unacceptable chronic health risks to humans and to affect reproduction and cause birth defects in wildlife, most of their registrations were canceled during the 1970s. However, unlike most pesticides, these compounds have not readily broken down. Today, they are still found in soil, sediment, and water.", "Chlorinated compounds are not highly concentrated in plants, but they are accumulated in other organisms, particularly in fish, which are at or near the top of the aquatic food chain. Unlike the herbivorous land animals eaten by humans, fish are often predators. When they prey on other aquatic animals, they may ingest and accumulate compounds that their prey have already accumulated. According to EPA, aquatic organisms may accumulate environmental contaminants in concentrations up to 1 million times greater than are found in the surface water from which the organisms are taken. Although these chlorinated pesticides were never registered for use on fish, they have been found in fish for decades, largely because agricultural runoff transported the pesticides to the nation\u2019s rivers and lakes. Since these pesticides did not have tolerances for fish, FDA established action levels as guidelines for determining when enforcement action was warranted.", "According to EPA, most foods and feeds either contain no detectable residues of these canceled pesticides or contain residues that are well below the recommended action levels. Therefore, EPA believes that the dietary risk from these canceled pesticides in most foods is low.

EPA also analyzes the economic impact of revoking tolerances on domestic food producers and on imported commodities. Then, EPA prepares and issues a preliminary notice in the Federal Register stating its intent to revoke certain tolerances and requesting comments from interested parties.

We focused on these five canceled pesticides because\u2014unlike most other pesticides\u2014they are highly persistent in the environment and because EPA, the National Academy of Sciences, and other organizations agree that they pose significant health risks through dietary exposure. We focused on fish because fish are more likely than most other foods to accumulate residues of these canceled pesticides. In addition, data on the health risks of residues from other canceled pesticides on food commodities are sparse. But data on the health risks of residues from these five canceled pesticides in fish were readily available because EPA had assessed these risks in response to concerns expressed by Members of Congress, EPA regional officials, and environmental organizations.", "To evaluate EPA\u2019s basis for proposing action levels for the residues of five canceled pesticides in fish, we reviewed EPA documents and Federal Register announcements on establishing action levels.

We compared the current action levels with the actual residue levels detected in fish tested by FDA. Specifically, we compared the current action level for dieldrin residues in whitefish with the average dieldrin residues that FDA detected in testing domestic whitefish from 1984 through 1992.", "To demonstrate the effect of federal action levels on consumers of fish that are not tested by FDA because they do not enter interstate commerce, we interviewed EPA Office of Water officials and reviewed EPA studies on (1) the basis that states use to establish fish advisories, (2) the levels of contamination from pesticides and other chemicals that are found in fish nationwide, and (3) the guidance that the Office of Water provides to states on establishing fish advisories. We also examined a 1991 National Academy of Sciences study of seafood safety, which discusses the extent to which fish are contaminated by pesticides and other chemicals and the actions that are needed to better inform consumers of the potential risks of eating certain fish.

We also examined the Federal Register notices for all pesticides whose tolerances had been revoked as of July 1994 to determine how many tolerances had been revoked and how much time had elapsed between cancellation and revocation. In addition, we reviewed EPA documents and information systems to determine how many canceled pesticides still have tolerances. When we reviewed data from EPA\u2019s information systems on canceled food-use pesticides, we found that much of the information was unreliable and, therefore, could not be used. To identify canceled food-use pesticides that still have tolerances, we examined EPA planning documents and reregistration status reports and asked EPA officials to verify the information.

In response to concerns about DDT expressed in a 1986 congressional hearing, EPA said that it had not assessed health risks when it proposed action levels to replace the tolerances or existing action levels for this pesticide. Instead, EPA reviewed FDA\u2019s pesticide monitoring data and proposed action levels that reflected the actual levels of DDT residue found in foods monitored during the late 1970s.", "EPA officials told us that the proposed action levels for DDT and other chlorinated pesticides were set at a level high enough so that most\u2014about 95 percent\u2014of the residues found in foods would be at or below the action levels. EPA reasoned that the residues of these canceled pesticides were unavoidable and had not entered the food supply through the misuse of pesticides. Therefore, the agency did not want to penalize food producers for past legal uses of the pesticides.", "In response to its preliminary notices, EPA received no significant comments on the adequacy of the action levels it had proposed for foods other than fish. But a number of commenters\u2014including two EPA regions\u2014questioned the safety of the action levels proposed for fish. EPA\u2019s Region VII noted that EPA apparently had not reviewed available health effects data, as required by its 1982 policy, to assess the safety of the proposed action levels. Similarly, EPA\u2019s Region V commented that EPA had not assessed the effects of the proposed action levels on human health. According to several commenters, the risk of cancer under the proposed action levels was far greater than the agency\u2019s risk standards usually allowed. For example, although EPA typically applies a negligible risk standard for cancer when regulating pesticides in food, EPA\u2019s Region VII stated that the risk of cancer under the proposed action level for chlordane was 1 in 22,000, and the National Wildlife Federation estimated that the risk of cancer for dieldrin was 1 in 1,000.", "In commenting on the proposed action levels for fish, FDA maintained that the existing action levels might need to remain in effect because high levels of DDT residue were still being found in fish from at least one part of the United States. But FDA also said that EPA needed to study the health effects of these pesticides in light of the comments it received on its proposed action levels.", "In 1986, EPA issued final notices in the Federal Register in which it revoked the tolerances for DDT, chlordane, and dieldrin in foods other than fish and recommended action levels to replace the tolerances.

However, FDA\u2019s records also show that between 1990 and 1992 residues of dieldrin in fish have remained steady or have increased slightly.

For consumers of average amounts of fish sold in interstate commerce, the figures may significantly overstate risks. For example, for dieldrin, EPA said that if it had used less conservative assumptions for samples in which no residues were detected, the risks calculated for this pesticide would have been only 2 in 1 million rather than 100 in 1 million. According to EPA, more accurate estimates of risk were not possible using available data.", "But EPA also noted that the actual risks could be considerably higher than the average risks shown in the table for consumers of larger amounts of fish or of fish that are more highly contaminated with residues of these pesticides. For example, although the calculations of risk in table 2.1 assume consumption of 15 grams of fish per day, EPA has estimated that typical recreational fishermen consume 30 grams per day and subsistence fishermen consume 140 grams per day, on average. These levels of consumption are about two to nine times greater than the levels EPA used to calculate the risks shown in table 2.1.

The Academy suggested that \u201ca more consistent and focused effort in the determination and communication of public health risks from contaminated seafood should be developed\u201d and that \u201ca more pronounced and consistently defined federal role in the risk characterizations leading to these  advisories would be .\u201d", "In 1992, EPA\u2019s Office of Water completed a study of chemical residues in fish that revealed widespread contamination by pesticides and other chemicals in fish. Concerned about this contamination and about states\u2019 inconsistent procedures for sampling fish and issuing fish consumption advisories, the Office of Water issued guidance to the states in 1993 and 1994 to assist them in developing a risk-based approach for monitoring fish and determining when fish advisories should be issued (see app. II for more detailed information on the study and guidance). Office of Water representatives told us that it was too soon to evaluate the impact of this guidance. They did not know of any states that had used the guidance to strengthen their monitoring standards for pesticides\u2019 residues in fish.", "An Office of Water official also said that a number of states are not active in monitoring fish and issuing fish advisories, principally because they lack funding. He said that other states, such as New York, recognize that the federal action levels are designed for FDA\u2019s regulation of fish in interstate commerce but nevertheless continue to use the federal action levels in their own regulatory programs.", "A New York State environmental health official told us that although her agency believes that a risk-based monitoring approach would protect consumers\u2019 health better than action levels, the agency is reluctant to move toward risk-based monitoring. The official explained that New York has a number of commercial fisheries whose catches are subject to FDA\u2019s monitoring. Because pesticides and other chemicals in these fish do not generally exceed the federal action levels, the fish are sold legally in interstate commerce. The official said that, in view of FDA\u2019s monitoring, the state believes that it would face an untenable position if it were to adopt more stringent risk-based monitoring standards for fish caught and consumed within the state. At the same time as the state was trying to justify stricter standards for fish that would be caught and consumed within New York, the official said, FDA would be allowing the same species of fish, with the same levels of chemical contamination, to be sold nationwide without any warnings or advisories.", "EPA\u2019s Region V also noted that a number of states are reluctant to apply different state and federal standards in monitoring the safety of pesticides\u2019 residues in fish. The region is concerned that if the action levels for pesticides\u2019 residues in fish are not lowered, then the states will not issue more protective fish consumption advisories.", "The Director of FDA\u2019s Contaminants Policy Staff agreed that states might have difficulty explaining differences between federal and state monitoring levels to local consumers and commercial fisheries. Nevertheless, he said that FDA could not set enforcement limits for local conditions because the action levels enforced by FDA apply nationwide to fish in interstate commerce.

Consequently, they are not consistent with the 1982 policy that calls upon EPA, when recommending action levels, to assess health risks as well as unavoidable residues and to revise its recommendations periodically as residue levels decline.", "The action levels that EPA proposed to FDA in 1991 are based on EPA\u2019s assessment of residue data, health risks, and economic effects. Hence, these action levels were developed in accordance with the requirements of the 1982 policy.

We do not believe that the differences between EPA and FDA over the sufficiency of EPA\u2019s data should block attempts by the agencies to reach agreement on appropriate action levels.

But the fact that a pesticide has been canceled voluntarily does not necessarily mean that it poses no dietary risk. In addition, EPA has delayed revocation for almost all pesticides, including those considered to pose dietary risks. For example, long-term exposure through the diet to the pesticide heptachlor could cause cancer in humans, according to EPA, yet the agency revoked the tolerances for this pesticide more than 11 years after canceling its registrations for food uses.", "The low priority assigned to revocation is reflected in the limited resources allocated to it. The EPA official responsible for revocation said that none of the 13 staff in her unit works full-time on revocation actions and slightly fewer than 3 full-time-equivalent staff per year are allocated for such actions. According to this official, her unit has so many other higher-priority responsibilities that it can handle only a limited number of revocation actions at one time.

For example, EPA canceled all registrations for insecticidal uses of the pesticide sodium arsenite in 1988 because of concerns about the pesticide\u2019s toxic effects on workers and the general public.
