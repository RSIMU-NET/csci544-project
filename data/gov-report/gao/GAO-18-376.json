GAO was asked to review states' efforts to recruit and retain foster families.", "This report examines: (1) how state child welfare agencies recruit foster families, including those who provide TFC services, (2) any challenges in recruiting and retaining foster families, and (3) the extent to which HHS provides support to child welfare agencies in these efforts. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; interviewed HHS officials; surveyed child welfare agencies in all states and the District of Columbia; held discussion groups with private providers and foster parents who provide TFC services; and conducted interviews with officials in California, Georgia, and Indiana, which were selected for factors such as changes in foster care caseloads, opioid abuse rates, and geographic location."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["States employ a range of strategies to recruit foster families and nearly all use private providers to recruit, particularly for therapeutic foster care (TFC) services, in which parents receive training and support to care for children who need a higher level of care. Recruitment strategies include searching for relatives, conducting outreach to the community, targeting certain populations, and obtaining referrals from current foster families. In response to GAO's national survey, 49 states reported using private providers to recruit foster families. In the three selected states where GAO conducted interviews, private providers were responsible for both recruiting and retaining foster families, such as helping families become licensed and providing them with support (see fig.).", "States reported various challenges with recruiting and retaining foster families in response to GAO's survey. In recruiting families, over two-thirds of states reported challenges such as limited funding and staff, which can make prioritizing recruitment efforts difficult; extensive licensing processes; and difficulties finding families willing to care for certain children, such as those with high needs. In retaining families, 29 states reported concerns about inadequate support for foster families, which can include difficulties contacting child welfare agency caseworkers. In addition, 31 states reported limited access to services needed to care for children, such as child care.", "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides a number of supports to help states recruit and retain foster families, including technical assistance with their recruitment programs, guidance and information, and funding. Most states GAO surveyed found HHS's supports moderately or very helpful. However, several private providers GAO interviewed in three selected states said they have not received guidance or information from child welfare agencies about recruiting and retaining foster families. In addition, 11 of the 14 providers said they were unaware of related HHS supports and all of them described concerns about communication with child welfare agencies. HHS officials said they encourage states to involve all relevant stakeholders in their efforts, though HHS has focused on supporting child welfare agencies.

According to a recent study by the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the national opioid  epidemic has contributed to this increase because parents under the  influence of opioids are often unable to care for their children. Child  welfare officials in many states have noted challenges finding placements  for children who can no longer live with their parents, and media reports  have described instances in which children were placed in hotel rooms,  emergency shelters, and child welfare offices until appropriate  placements could be found.", "States may place children in a variety of settings depending on a child\u2019s  needs, including placements with unrelated foster parents, relatives, or in  congregate care settings such as group homes and residential treatment  centers. States may use several federal funding sources administered by  HHS to assist in these efforts. However, a 2015 HHS study found  agreement among multiple child welfare stakeholders that children are  best served in family settings, and many states have reduced the number  of children in congregate care in the last decade. The reduction in states\u2019  use of congregate care has contributed to the need for foster families,  particularly for children who require a higher level of care, such as those  who have severe mental health conditions or who are medically fragile. A  potential alternative to congregate care is therapeutic foster care, a  family-based model in which children who need a higher level of care are  placed with foster parents who are trained, supervised, and supported by  qualified program staff to provide services such as crisis support,  behavior management, medication monitoring, counseling, and case  management. There is no national definition of therapeutic foster care  and these programs can vary widely among states.", "You asked us to explore issues related to states\u2019 efforts to recruit and  retain foster families.

States may use title IV-E funds to assist with  the costs of operating their foster care programs, and are generally  entitled to receive these funds based on the number of eligible children  they have in their programs. To be eligible for title IV-E foster care funds,  a child must have been removed from a home that meets income  eligibility standards under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children  program as of July 1996, among other criteria. The Aid to Families with  Dependent Children program was replaced by the Temporary Assistance  for Needy Families program beginning in 1996, and the income eligibility  standards for title IV-E foster care funding have not been changed since  then.

If  adjusted for inflation, the threshold would have been $23,550 in 2013.  Due, in part, to fewer families meeting these income eligibility standards,  we found that the number of children who currently meet title IV-E  eligibility requirements has declined. As a result, we reported that states  have received less federal funding under title IV-E and have paid an  increasingly larger share of funds for their foster care programs.

They noted  that parents may be required to take on more documentation and  supervision responsibilities for a child who requires a higher level of care  and complete more intensive training, which may be difficult for working  parents.", "In addition to challenges finding appropriate families for children, 34  states reported in our survey that a negative perception of foster care  made it moderately or very challenging to recruit new families. Child  welfare officials in two states and 5 of the 14 private providers we  interviewed raised similar concerns. For example, child welfare officials in  one county told us that they recruit foster families in an environment  where media reports have highlighted challenges with overburdened  caseworkers and turnover of agency directors. These officials also said  foster parents may share negative experiences with family and friends,  leading to an unfavorable impression of child welfare agencies within the  community. In addition, child welfare officials in one state and four private  providers said some families who provide foster care services have faced  false allegations of child abuse and subsequent investigations. Some  private providers said these investigations can be emotionally draining or  disruptive to the family, and some said that fear of such allegations and  investigations may deter prospective families from becoming a foster  family. Other recruitment challenges cited by several child welfare  officials, private providers, and foster parents we interviewed included  concerns by prospective foster families about caring for children who  have high needs or who are certain ages, or that providing foster care will  disrupt their nuclear family. While many child welfare officials and private  providers we spoke with acknowledged these negative perceptions and  fears, parents in all eight foster parent groups we interviewed in the three  states also discussed how being a foster family can be a positive  experience. For example, several foster parents said providing foster care  to different types of children has enhanced their family. Private providers  and foster parents also said it is important to share personal experiences  to bring understanding about what it is like to be a foster family. For  example, one foster parent told us about a blog she writes to describe  normal family activities that include children in foster care, such as taking  family trips."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "In Retaining Foster Families, States Reported Challenges with Inadequate Support for Families and Limited Access to Services for Children", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Support for Foster Families", "paragraphs": ["In response to our survey, 29 states reported that inadequate support for  foster families from the child welfare agency made it moderately or very  challenging to retain these families. In the three selected states, all 14  private providers we interviewed and foster parents in all eight of the  foster parent groups we spoke with emphasized the importance of  supporting families in order to retain them. All 14 private providers  discussed concerns about communication with child welfare agencies,  which they said can affect the quality of services they provide to foster  families. For example, 10 of the private providers said they have difficulty  contacting or receiving a response from child welfare agency  caseworkers when they try to obtain information needed to comply with  child welfare agency requirements. One private provider explained that  they are required to develop a service plan for each child they place with  a family, and the plan must be signed by the child welfare agency  caseworker within 5 days of placement. However, this private provider  said they often cannot reach the caseworker to have plans reviewed and  approved within the required time frame. Seven private providers told us  that there often is confusion on the part of child welfare agency  caseworkers about the role of private providers. For example, these  private providers said child welfare agency caseworkers may not know  which tasks the private providers are responsible for or may be unfamiliar  with the paperwork they need to give to the private provider. Similarly,  foster parents in five groups expressed dissatisfaction with the level of  support they have received from child welfare agency caseworkers.  These foster parents described instances in which they were unable to  reach their caseworker during emergencies, such as when they needed  permission to administer medications to their foster child. One foster  parent told us she had waited approximately 8 weeks for her caseworker  to approve her child\u2019s medication. This parent said she worked with her  private provider to email the child welfare agency caseworker on a daily  basis, but received no response. Foster parents in our discussion group  raised similar concerns (see text box).", "Reasons why child welfare agency caseworkers may be limited in their  ability to support foster families can include high caseloads and  caseworker turnover. For example, 33 states reported in our survey that  having too few staff and inadequate funding made it moderately or very  challenging to retain foster families. In the three selected states, child  welfare officials, 9 of 14 private providers, and foster parents in five of the  eight foster parent groups noted that high caseloads contribute to a lack  of support for foster families. Child welfare officials in one state said  although their regulations stipulate a maximum caseload of 12 to 17,  many caseworkers have caseloads that exceed those levels. In addition,  a private provider in this state told us that child welfare agency  caseworkers typically carry about 35 cases. Other private providers  explained that the demands on child welfare caseworkers to meet basic  paperwork and case planning requirements and conduct visits for a large  caseload may prevent them from responding to requests or returning  phone calls in a timely manner. Child welfare officials in two states, 11  private providers, and foster parents in three foster parent groups also  explained that frequent caseworker turnover can affect the level of  support foster families receive, particularly when new caseworkers are  unfamiliar with a child\u2019s history and needs. One foster parent told us that  she had worked with eight different child welfare agency caseworkers in a  19-month period. Another foster parent said she maintains all of her foster  children\u2019s records, since in the past, documents have been lost in  transfers between child welfare agency caseworkers. Child welfare  officials in the three selected states acknowledged difficulties supporting  foster families due to high caseloads or caseworker turnover. Officials in  one state said they recently requested additional state funds to add 500  caseworker positions, and officials in another state said they have made  efforts to revisit staffing levels following reductions during the economic  recession in 2008.", "In addition, many private providers and foster parents we interviewed  noted limitations with other supports for foster families. For example, 10  of 14 private providers and foster parents in three of the eight foster  parent groups in the three states discussed their concerns about low  payment rates for foster families, which some said may not adequately  cover the costs of caring for a child. A 2012 study on payment rates for  foster families found that basic payment rates (e.g., for traditional foster  care services) in the majority of states fell below estimated costs of caring  for a child, based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Five  private providers and foster parents in five foster parent groups also  discussed a lack of access to respite care services or a lack of \u201cvoice\u201d for  foster parents in contributing to decisions regarding children in their care.  These private providers and foster parents said these circumstances can  be frustrating and cause parents to leave the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Access to Services for Children and Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In response to our survey, 31 states reported that inadequate access to  services, such as child care and transportation, made it moderately or  very challenging to retain foster families. In the three selected states,  child welfare officials, 9 of 14 private providers, and foster parents in six  of eight foster parent groups discussed similar difficulties. For example,  they discussed difficulties accessing child care services, which some said  are particularly needed because of the increasing number of opioid- affected infants coming into care. Some officials, private providers, and  foster parents said their state may offer child care subsidies, but waitlists  can be long, and foster families may have difficulties finding an approved  childcare center, particularly for children who need a higher level of care.  Further, child welfare officials, private providers, and foster parents  discussed challenges accessing transportation services. For example,  child welfare officials said children are sometimes moved to homes  outside their original community due to a lack of available homes, which  places a burden on foster families to transport children to physical and  mental health appointments, regular visits with their biological families,  and school. A private provider we interviewed said many parents who  provide transportation to these various appointments also must go  through a burdensome process to claim mileage reimbursement from the  child welfare agency, so many parents do not submit a claim. In addition,  child welfare officials, private providers, and foster parents discussed  challenges accessing mental health services. For example, one private  provider said they have been unable to find a qualified mental health  provider who accepts Medicaid to deliver needed services to an autistic  child. Further, child welfare officials we interviewed in one county  discussed difficulties connecting children with therapists who have an  understanding of childhood trauma.", "In addition to these challenges, child welfare officials and private  providers we interviewed said many foster families leave the foster care  system due to family or life changes, including adoptions of children in  their care, retirements, health issues, and relocation to a different state."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Supports States\u2019 Recruitment and Retention Efforts with Technical Assistance, Guidance, and Funding, though Private Providers Were Unaware of Some Supports", "paragraphs": ["HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF) provides a number  of supports to help state child welfare agencies in their efforts to recruit  and retain foster families, according to ACF officials we interviewed and  agency documents we reviewed. These supports include technical  assistance, guidance and information, and funding.", "Technical assistance. ACF provided technical assistance through its  National Resource Center for Diligent Recruitment (the Center), and  subsequently, the Child Welfare Capacity Building Collaborative.  The Center provided several types of technical assistance to achieve  its aim of helping states develop and implement diligent recruitment  programs to achieve outcomes such as improving permanency and  placement stability for children in foster care. The Center provided on-  and off-site coaching to states in a number of areas, such as  developing a mix of general and targeted recruitment strategies, using  existing data to target recruitment efforts, and developing a  recruitment plan. Staff who worked at the Center reported providing  direct technical assistance and training to 30 states. The Center also  provided toolkits that guide states through the process of developing a  comprehensive diligent recruitment plan to meet federal  requirements. For example, the toolkits include discussion questions  about the goals states have for their plans, suggestions on which  stakeholders to include, and worksheets to help states analyze  existing data. ACF officials told us that they also review states\u2019 diligent  recruitment plans and may provide feedback to states.", "In addition, ACF provides technical assistance to states through its  Child and Family Services Reviews. These reviews are generally  conducted every 5 years and examine a number of factors in states\u2019  foster care programs to assess conformity with federal requirements,  including factors related to recruiting and retaining foster families. In  its reviews of 24 states in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, ACF reported  deficiencies for 18. ACF officials said these deficiencies included a  lack of adequate state recruitment plans and data used for recruitment  efforts. In addition, they said they will be working with states to  address identified deficiencies in subsequent program improvement  plans, which are to be developed in consultation with ACF.", "Guidance and information. ACF provides a wide range of guidance  and information to states to support their recruitment and retention  efforts. For example, the Center distributed free monthly electronic  newsletters that provided information on new tools, resources, and  webinars related to foster family recruitment and retention. The Center  also developed or provided links to publications on topics such as  using data to inform recruitment efforts, taking a customer service  approach in working with current and prospective foster families, and  lessons learned from related projects funded by ACF. The Center  facilitated information sharing among states by holding webinars, such  as one on the benefits of implementing a comprehensive diligent  recruitment program, and peer-to-peer networking events on topics  such as recruiting, developing, and supporting therapeutic foster care  families. In addition, ACF\u2019s Child Welfare Information Gateway is a  website that provides access to a broad array of electronic  publications, websites, databases, and online learning tools for  improving child welfare practice. For example, its resources related  to recruiting and retaining foster families include publications on  strategies and tools, as well as examples from state and local child  welfare agencies on promising practices.", "Funding. HHS administers a number of federal funding sources that  states said they used for their foster family recruitment and retention  efforts. For example, in our survey, states most often cited using child  welfare funds under title IV-E and IV-B of the Social Security Act for  these purposes in fiscal year 2016 (see fig. 3).", "ACF also provided a number of discretionary grants to support state  efforts to recruit and retain foster families through the Adoption  Opportunities program, which funds projects designed to eliminate  barriers to adoption and help find permanent families for children,  particularly older children, minority children, and those with special  needs. Specifically, ACF awarded cooperative agreements to 22  states, localities, and non-profit organizations in fiscal years 2008  through 2013 for 5-year projects that aim to enhance recruitment  efforts and improve permanency outcomes for children, among other  things. For example, ACF awarded a cooperative agreement in 2010  to the county child welfare agency in Los Angeles, California to launch  a project that targeted recruitment efforts to prospective foster families  in African American, Latino, LGBT, and deaf communities to increase  permanency outcomes for their foster care population. In addition, it  awarded a cooperative agreement in 2013 to Oregon\u2019s state child  welfare agency to implement a project that focused on developing  customer service concepts in working with foster families, increasing  community partnerships, and using data to inform recruitment efforts  and outcome measures. In addition, ACF also awarded two  cooperative agreements to Spaulding for Children to develop training  for prospective and current foster and adoptive families. The first,  awarded in fiscal year 2016, was for a 3-year project to develop a  foster and adoptive parent training program to prepare families who  can care for children who have high needs, such as children needing  therapeutic foster care services. The second, awarded in fiscal year  2017, was for a 5-year project to develop a foster and adoptive parent  training program for all individuals interested in becoming a foster  family or adopting a child from foster care or internationally.", "In response to our survey, many states reported that they found these  federal supports helpful to their recruitment and retention efforts. For  example, guidance and information, such as the electronic newsletters,  publications, and webinars provided by the Center, were cited most often  by states as being moderately or very helpful (31 states). Over half the  states reported that networking opportunities, such as peer-to-peer  networking events facilitated by the Center, and technical assistance  provided by the Center were moderately or very helpful to their efforts (28  and 27 states, respectively).", "However, similar to concerns raised by all 14 private providers in the  three selected states about communication issues with child welfare  agencies, several private providers told us they have not received  guidance or information from these agencies about recruiting and  retaining foster families, and most were unaware of some of the supports  provided by ACF. Specifically, 11 of the 14 private providers said they  were unaware of the National Resource Center for Diligent Recruitment,  and 7 told us that the information offered by the Center would have been  useful to their recruitment efforts had they known about it. For example,  one private provider told us they have been trying to use data to more  effectively recruit foster families, and the Center\u2019s resources on  recruitment strategies and tools would have been helpful in these efforts.", "Another private provider said each private provider in their area conducts  recruitment activities based on its own ideas and experiences, and the  Center\u2019s resources would have been helpful in ensuring that they use the  most effective strategies.", "ACF officials said they encourage states to involve all relevant  stakeholders in their efforts to recruit and retain foster families. They  acknowledged that ACF has not provided specific guidance and  information to states on working with private providers, but noted that  some supports, such as online publications and webinars, are available to  private providers working in the public sector. ACF officials explained that  their efforts have focused on child welfare agencies because these are  the entities that receive federal funds. However, federal internal control  standards state that agencies should communicate necessary  information, both internally and externally, to achieve their objectives.  The mission statement for ACF\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau is to partner with  federal, state, tribal, and local agencies to improve the overall health and  well-being of the nation\u2019s children and families. According to its website,  the Children\u2019s Bureau carries out a variety of projects to achieve its goals,  such as providing guidance on federal law, policy, and program  regulations, offering training and technical assistance to improve child  welfare service delivery, and sharing research to help child welfare  professionals improve their services. Given that almost all states use  private providers to help them recruit foster families, and that private  providers may be responsible for providing supports to help retain these  families, it is important for HHS to determine whether additional  information on working more effectively with private providers would be  useful to states.
