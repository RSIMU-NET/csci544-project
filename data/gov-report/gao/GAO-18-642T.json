GAO discusses (1) the extent to which banks are terminating accounts and closing branches in the Southwest border region, (2) the extent to which money transmitters serving selected fragile countries are facing banking access challenges, and (3) actions relevant U.S. agencies have taken to respond to these challenges. For those reports, GAO surveyed more than 400 banks, developed an econometric model on the drivers of branch closures, and conducted case studies on four countries to assess the effects of derisking on remittances flows."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["\u201cDerisking\u201d is the practice of depository institutions limiting certain services or ending their relationships with customers to, among other things, avoid perceived regulatory concerns about facilitating money laundering or other criminal activity such as financing to terrorist groups. In its February 2018 report, GAO found that money laundering risk is high in the Southwest border region because of the high volume of cash transactions, the number of cross-border transactions, and foreign account holders. According to GAO's nationally representative survey of banks, an estimated 80 percent (+/- 11) of Southwest border banks limited or did not offer accounts to customers that are considered high risk for money laundering because the customers drew heightened Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) oversight\u2014behavior that could indicate derisking. Nationally, GAO's econometric analysis suggested that counties that were urban, younger, had higher income, or had higher money laundering-related risk were more likely to lose branches.", "In March 2018, GAO found that money transmitters (businesses that facilitate global money transfers) serving Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, and especially Somalia\u2014 countries it identified as fragile\u2014all reported losing bank accounts or having restrictions placed on them during the last 10 years. As a result, 9 of the 12 money transmitters GAO interviewed, including all 4 that served Somalia, reported using channels outside the banking system (hereafter referred to as nonbanking channels), such as transporting cash to transfer funds, and that this increased their operational costs and exposure to risks. Furthermore, some banks GAO interviewed reported that they closed the accounts of money transmitters because of the high cost of due diligence actions they considered necessary to minimize the risk of fines under BSA/AML regulations. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) officials noted that despite information that some money transmitters have lost bank accounts, Treasury saw no evidence that the volume of remittances was falling or that costs of sending remittances were rising.", "To address concerns about derisking, Treasury and federal banking regulators (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), have taken actions including issuing guidance to banks and conducting some evaluations to assess the extent to which derisking is occurring. While agencies were engaged in BSA/AML regulatory reviews, these were limited in scope and had not evaluated how regulatory concerns may influence banks to engage in derisking or to close branches. Without assessing the full range of BSA/AML factors that may be influencing banks to derisk or close branches, Treasury, the federal banking regulators, and Congress do not have the information needed to determine if BSA/AML regulations and their implementation can be made more effective or less burdensome. Moreover, in March 2018 GAO reported that Treasury could not assess the effects of money transmitters' loss of banking access on remittance flows because existing data did not allow Treasury to identify remittances transferred through banking and nonbanking channels. Nonbanking channels are generally less transparent than banking channels and thus more susceptible to the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made five recommendations in the two reports: to Treasury and the federal banking regulators to conduct a retrospective review of BSA/AML regulations and their implementation, and to Treasury to assess shifts in remittance flows to nonbanking channels.

Cash transactions increase the  BSA/AML compliance risk for banks because the greater anonymity  associated with using cash results in greater risk for money laundering or  terrorist financing. Our review of data on banks\u2019 CTR filings confirmed  that bank branches that operate in Southwest border region counties handled more large cash transactions than bank branches elsewhere.  Specifically, in 2016, bank branches in Southwest border region counties  filed nearly 30 percent more CTRs, on average, than bank branches in  comparable counties elsewhere in their same state, and about 60 percent  more than those in other high-risk counties outside the region. Similar  differences occurred in 2014 and 2015.", "We also reported that cross-border transactions are at a higher risk for  money laundering because international transfers can present an  attractive method to disguise the source of funds derived from illegal  activity.

These types of customers are prevalent in the Southwest  border region, examiners said, and can create challenges for banks to  verify and authenticate their identification, source of funds, and source of  wealth.", "The volume of high-risk customers and cross-border transactions can  lead to more intensive account monitoring and investigation of suspicious  transactions, Southwest border bank representatives said. Performing  effective due diligence and complying with customer identification  requirements for higher-risk customers and transactions can be more  challenging because banks might need specialized processes for higher- risk customers and transactions than for those that are lower risk.  Southwest border bank representatives we spoke with said addressing  these compliance challenges can also require more resources for  monitoring high-risk customers and investigating suspicious transactions.  For example, in 2016, bank branches in the Southwest border region  counties filed three times as many SARs, on average, as bank branches  operating in other counties within Southwest border states and about 2.5  times as many SARs, on average, as bank branches in other high-risk  financial crime or drug trafficking counties in nonborder states.

The statement acknowledged that  money services businesses were losing access to banking services as a  result of concerns about regulatory scrutiny, the risks presented by these  types of accounts, and the costs and burdens associated with maintaining  such accounts.", "The agencies issuing these guidance documents told us they took some  steps to assess the effect of their guidance on bank behavior. For  example, Treasury officials said that Treasury periodically engaged with  banks and money transmitters on an ad hoc basis to learn their views and  gain insight into their concerns. According to Federal Reserve officials,  anecdotal information suggested that some money transmitters lost bank  accounts after FinCEN and federal banking agencies issued the joint  guidance in 2005, and that outcome was contrary to the regulators\u2019 intent.  To address concerns about the guidance, according to these officials,  Treasury held several public discussions on money transmitter account  terminations.", "In addition to issuing guidance, FDIC and OCC took some steps aimed at  trying to determine why banks may be terminating accounts because of  perceived regulatory concerns. For example, in January 2015, FDIC  issued a memorandum to examiners establishing a policy that examiners  document and report instances in which they recommend or require  banks to terminate accounts during examinations. From January 2015  through December 2017, FDIC officials stated that examiners had not  documented any recommendations or requirements for account  terminations. In 2016, OCC reviewed how the institutions it supervises  develop and implement policies and procedures for evaluating customer  risks as part of their BSA/AML programs and for making risk-based  determinations to close customer accounts. OCC focused its review on  certain large banks\u2019 evaluation of risk for foreign correspondent bank  accounts. This effort resulted in OCC issuing guidance to banks on  periodic evaluation of the risks of foreign correspondent accounts. The  federal banking regulators also met with residents and businesses in the  Southwest border region to discuss concerns about derisking in the  region.", "Treasury and the federal banking regulators also participated in a number  of international activities related to concerns about the decline in the  number of correspondent banking and money services business  accounts. For example, FDIC, OCC, and the Federal Reserve participate  in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s Anti-Money  Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism Experts Group. Recent efforts  of the group involved revising guidelines to update and clarify  correspondent banking expectations. Treasury leads the U.S.  engagement with the Financial Action Task Force\u2014an intergovernmental  body that sets standards for combating money laundering, financing of  terrorism, and other related threats to the integrity of the international  financial system\u2014which has issued guidance on correspondent banking  and money services businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BSA/AML Regulatory Reviews Had Not Evaluated All Factors Influencing Banks to Derisk and Close Branches", "paragraphs": ["Executive orders encourage and legislation requires FinCEN and the  federal banking regulators to review existing regulations to determine  whether they should be retained, amended, or rescinded, among other  things. Retrospective reviews of existing rules help agencies evaluate  how existing regulations are working in practice. Recent presidents have  directed agencies to evaluate or reconsider existing regulations. In  addition to the executive orders, the Economic Growth and Regulatory  Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) requires federal banking regulators  to review the regulations they prescribe not less than once every 10 years  and request comments to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly  burdensome statutory or regulatory requirements.", "In February 2018, we reported that FinCEN and the federal banking  regulators had all participated in retrospective reviews of different parts of  the BSA/AML regulations. For example, FinCEN officials told us that they  review each new or significantly amended regulation to assess its clarity  and effectiveness within 18 months of its effective date. As part of fulfilling  their requirements under EGRPRA, the federal banking regulators\u2014 through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)\u2014 have also participated in retrospective reviews of BSA/AML regulations.", "As part of the 2017 EGRPRA review, FFIEC received several public  comments on BSA/AML requirements, including increasing the threshold  for filing CTRs, the SAR threshold, and the overall increasing cost and  burden of BSA compliance. FinCEN officials and the federal banking  regulators stated that the agencies are working to address the BSA- related EGRPRA comments\u2014particularly those related to CTR and SAR  filing requirements\u2014through the BSA Advisory Group (BSAAG).", "However, the actions FinCEN and the federal banking regulators took  related to derisking were not aimed at addressing and, if possible  ameliorating, the full range of factors that influence banks to engage in  derisking, in particular banks\u2019 regulatory concerns and BSA/AML  compliance efforts. Further, the actions regulators took to address  concerns raised in BSA/AML retrospective reviews focused primarily on  the burden resulting from the filing of CTRs and SARs, but these actions  did not evaluate how regulatory concerns may influence banks to engage  in derisking or close branches. Federal internal control standards call for  agencies to analyze and respond to risks to achieving their objectives.  Further, guidance implementing executive orders states that agencies  should consider conducting retrospective reviews on rules that  unanticipated circumstances have overtaken. In February 2018, we  concluded that without assessing the full range of BSA/AML factors that  may be influencing banks to derisk or close branches, FinCEN, the  federal banking regulators, and Congress would not have the information  they need to determine if adjustments are needed to ensure that the  BSA/AML regulations and their implementation are achieving their  regulatory objectives in the most effective and least burdensome way."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Data on Remittances Did Not Allow Treasury to Assess the Effects of Money Transmitters\u2019 Loss of Banking Access on Remittance Flows to Fragile Countries", "paragraphs": ["In March 2018, we found that Treasury could not assess the effects of  money transmitters\u2019 loss of banking access on remittance flows because  existing data did not allow Treasury to identify remittances transferred  through banking and non-banking channels.", "Recent efforts to collect international remittance data from banks and  credit unions did not include transfers these institutions make on behalf of  money transmitters. Since these data collection efforts are designed to  protect U.S. consumers, the remittance data that banks and credit unions  report are limited to remittances individual consumers send directly  through these institutions. Additionally, as of the first quarter of 2018,  about half the states (24) adopted reports to collect remittance data from  money transmitters and of these, 12 states had made it mandatory to  report remittance data by destination country. However, these data do not  distinguish money transmitters\u2019 use of banking and nonbanking channels  to transfer funds.", "Finally, we found that while Treasury has a long-standing effort to collect  information on travelers transporting cash from U.S. ports of exit, this  information did not identify cash transported for remittances. We  concluded that without information on remittances sent through banking  and nonbanking channels, Treasury could not assess the effects of  money transmitter and foreign bank account closures on remittances,  especially shifts in remittance transfers from banking to nonbanking  channels for fragile countries. Nonbanking channels are generally less  transparent than banking channels and thus more susceptible to the risk of money laundering and other illicit financial transactions. Additionally,  while risks associated with shifts of remittances to nonbanking channels  may vary by country, these risks are likely greater for fragile countries,  such as Somalia, where the United States has concerns about terrorism  financing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The collective findings from our work indicate that BSA/AML regulatory  concerns have played a role in banks\u2019 decisions to terminate and limit  accounts and close branches. However, the actions taken to address  derisking by the federal banking regulators and FinCEN and the  retrospective reviews conducted on BSA/AML regulations had not fully  considered or addressed these effects. As a result, in our February 2018  report, we recommended that FinCEN and the three banking regulators in  our review\u2014FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC\u2014 jointly conduct a  retrospective review of BSA/AML regulations and their implementation for  banks, focusing on how banks\u2019 regulatory concerns may be influencing  their willingness to provide services.

Therefore, in the March 2018 report we recommended that  Treasury assess the extent to which shifts in remittance flows from  banking to non-banking channels for fragile countries may affect  Treasury\u2019s ability to monitor for money laundering and terrorist financing  and, if necessary, should identify corrective actions.
