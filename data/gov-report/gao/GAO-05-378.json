GAO identified (1) the universe of federal property in the District of Columbia (the District) managed by the National Park Service (NPS); (2) what recreational facilities, including those that are sports related, exist on these properties; (3) the condition of the properties with sports facilities and the sports facilities thereon; (4) new or expanded recreational uses discussed in NPS general management plans; and (5) the methods that could be used to convey management responsibility for NPS-managed properties to the District government. Commenting on the draft report, Interior stated that NPS is addressing properties in the greatest need of repair or rehabilitation in priority order. It also said that it did not have authority to enter into a lease that allows the erection of a structure on its property.

Most of the properties are what NPS refers to as circles, squares, and triangles, and are less than 1 acre in size. The second largest total number of properties are parks and parkways, which represent about 93 percent of the total acreage for the 356 properties. NPS officials reported to GAO that 202 properties it manages in the District had various recreational facilities such as park benches, outdoor grills, and picnic tables or shelters. Of the 202 properties, 25 had 205 sports facilities, such as basketball and tennis courts and baseball and softball fields. Most of the properties with sports facilities were in good or fair condition, according to NPS deferred maintenance records, but information on the condition of individual sports facilities is limited. While we did not have criteria to determine the condition of sports facilities, we inspected each of the 205 sports facilities to identify obvious deficiencies, such as cracks in the surface area of tennis and basketball courts. Based on our observations, most of the facilities appeared to be well maintained, but we found some sports facilities had conditions that posed a potential safety risk. NPS has developed four general management plans--two finalized and two in draft. These plans identify some opportunities for new or expanded recreation, such as rehabilitating selected baseball and softball fields and basketball and tennis courts; creating a regional sports complex; and developing new hiking trails. For example, one of the plans calls for the creation of a new trail that connects Forts Dupont, Totten, Stevens, Reno, and others as part of the Fort Circle Parks system. Options available for transferring management responsibilities for NPS properties located in the District to the District city government include transfer of title, transfer of jurisdiction, memoranda of agreement or cooperative agreements, leases, and partnerships with public or private entities.

The department provided written comments that are  included in appendix VIII. The department provided us with some  comments with technical clarifications, which we have incorporated as  appropriate. In addressing the condition of properties, the department  stated that NPS is diligently implementing an asset management plan that  addresses deficiencies and that needed repair and rehabilitation of  properties are evaluated and prioritized against the needs of the entire  national park system. Projects of greatest need are undertaken in priority  order, focusing on critical health and safety and resource protection issues.  In addition, the department said that NPS does not have the authority to  enter into a lease that allows erection of a structure on such property.  While we agree that the agency\u2019s authority is limited, NPS regulations  authorize a lease to include a provision allowing for the construction of  minor additions, buildings, and other structures as long as it is (1)  necessary for the support of authorized lease activities, (2) otherwise  consistent with the protection and purposes of the park area, and (3)  approved by the director.", "We will send copies of this report to interested congressional committees;  the Secretary of the Interior; and other interested parties.

These  properties are under the jurisdiction of NPS\u2019 National Capital Region.", "To determine the universe of properties managed by NPS in the District, we  obtained an electronic file from the National Capital Region that contained  all of the properties (reservations) that it manages. Working with NPS  officials, we excluded properties outside of the District. This resulted in  identifying a universe of 356 properties. To facilitate our analysis and  reporting, we grouped the NPS-managed properties into four categories,  primarily based on their description as provided on NPS\u2019 Reservation List.  (NPS does not have a list of the types of properties under its jurisdiction,  nor does it have standard definitions for the properties it manages.) The  four categories we used were park and parkways; circles, squares, and  triangles; Mall/Washington Monument and grounds; and other. The park  and parkways category consists of properties described on NPS\u2019  Reservation List as park, parkway, or combination thereof. Also in this  category are several forts and batteries, which are components of Fort  Circle Parks. Similarly, the circles, squares, and triangles category includes  properties referred to on the Reservation List as physical structures, i.e.,  circles, squares, or triangles. The Mall and Washington Monument and  grounds contain properties identified on the Reservation List as being  connected with the Mall, the Washington Monument, or its grounds. Finally,  the \u201cother\u201d category consists of various properties described on the  Reservation List, as curb/center parking, cemeteries, islands, hills,  historical sites, plazas, memorials, annexes, and fountains. We also  included in this category Ford\u2019s Theatre and the Mary McLeod Bethune  Council House. Appendix II provides a complete listing of the NPS- managed properties in the District and their respective categories.", "To identify the recreational and sports-related facilities on NPS-managed  properties, we developed a data collection instrument (DCI) that we  distributed to NPS National Capital Region officials. The DCI contained  questions about the existence of recreation facilities, including the number  of sports-related facilities; plans for future facilities; and other information  about each of the NPS-managed properties. To ensure that data gathered  from the DCI were valid and reliable, we performed a number of steps.  First, we conducted pretests with National Capital Region officials in two  of its management units and revised the DCI in accordance with these  pretest results. We next asked the region\u2019s six management units  (superintendencies or directors) that have management responsibility for  their respective properties to complete one DCI for each of the 356  properties under their respective jurisdiction. We received completed DCIs  for 100 percent of the properties. We then reviewed the completed DCIs for  obvious errors, such as missing responses to questions and inconsistencies  in the answers provided. We also compared the responses with the  knowledge we gained from visiting or researching the properties. In  addition, we conducted follow-up interviews with region officials to clarify  or correct any errors. The data from the hard copy DCIs were key-punched  into an electronic data file and checked for accuracy. We used this data file  for our analysis. We performed all analysis presented in this report through  programming in statistical software, and both the programming and the  results were checked for accuracy. We identified various types of  recreational facilities, including sports facilities, on the properties. To  verify the accuracy of the NPS-reported data, we visited each of the  properties that NPS identified as having sports facilities or a combination  of sports facilities and other facilities. During these visits, we determined if  the property contained the facilities reported to us in the DCI. For the most  part, we found that the reported number of facilities on these 25 properties  was comparable. However, we found four tennis courts that had not been  reported to us\u2014one on a property in East Potomac Park and three in Rock  Creek Park. NPS officials acknowledged that they had made a mistake in  not reporting these facilities on the DCI. Accordingly, we revised our  database to include these four facilities.", "To determine the condition of the properties with sports facilities as well as  the condition of the sports facilities themselves, we relied on information  in NPS\u2019 Facility Management Software System (FMSS) and interviews with  NPS officials. FMSS is a system that identifies the condition of assets,  including properties, based on the asset\u2019s deferred maintenance costs  relative to its replacement value. Thus, the higher the deferred  maintenance costs, the worse the condition of the asset. Based on NPS  criteria, the condition of properties are assessed as good, fair, poor, or  serious. We asked NPS to provide FMSS data for each of the 25 properties  with sports facilities. NPS provided assessments on the condition of 24 of  the 25 properties. It did not provide information on one property due to  security issues. We then collected the records in support of the estimated  deferred maintenance costs for each of the 24 properties to ascertain if the  records contained specific information relative to the condition of the  sports facilities on the properties. On the basis of our review, we  determined that the maintenance records did not provide sufficient detail  to determine the condition of the sports facilities. Since FMSS did not  provide sufficient information to determine the condition of the sports  facilities, we inspected these facilities to identify any deficiencies, such as  cracks in the surface of tennis and basketball courts. For the most part,  these facilities appeared to be well maintained. However, we did find some  facilities that required maintenance to prevent potential safety hazards.", "To determine any new or expanded recreational use proposed for NPS- managed properties in general management plans, we asked NPS to  identify the plans it had developed for properties that it manages in the  District. We were provided final general management plans for Mary  McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site, the Fort Circle  Parks and draft management plans for (1) Rock Creek Park and the Rock  Creek Park and Potomac Parkway and (2) Anacostia Park. We reviewed  each of these plans to ascertain the specifics regarding new or expanded  recreational uses for the properties. We also spoke with NPS officials to  identify the properties covered under each plan and to obtain information  regarding any updates to these plans and their respective completion dates.  We were also provided a general plan for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal  National Historical Park. However, this plan was developed in 1976 and  prior to the guidance for what is to be included in a general management  plan. Further, it was outdated per NPS\u2019 guidance that general management  plans should not exceed 15 years. Thus, we did not include this plan in our  analysis.", "Finally, to identify methods for conveying management responsibility of  NPS-managed properties to the District, we reviewed legislation,  regulations, legislative histories, and other documents in addition to  interviewing NPS officials in the Department of the Interior\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s  Office and NPS\u2019 National Capital Region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on the 356 NPS-Managed Properties in the District", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides information on the 356 NPS-managed properties in  the District.
