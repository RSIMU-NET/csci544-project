Because of concerns for the safety of federal workers, as well as the costs associated with unsafe workplaces, GAO described the characteristics of federal agencies' safety programs and the implementation challenges they face, and assessed how well the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) oversees and assists federal agencies' efforts to develop and administer their safety programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on a survey of 57 agencies, GAO found that most agencies reported having at least one activity for each of the six components generally associated with a sound safety program--(1) management commitment, (2) employee involvement, (3) education and training, (4) identification of hazards, (5) correction of hazards, and (6) medical management (which includes having a return-to-work program for injured employees). However, agencies faced implementation challenges that cut across the components in the areas of data management, accountability, and safety resources. The survey results indicated that many agencies do not have automated systems for tracking elements of their safety programs, such as training. In addition, several of the agencies did not demonstrate that their managers are held accountable for maintaining effective safety programs. Finally, many agency officials stated that, due to limited resources, they often must depend on safety officers with limited professional safety experience. OSHA's oversight of federal agencies' safety programs is not as effective as it could be because the agency does not use its enforcement and compliance assistance resources in a strategic manner. Although inspections are one of OSHA's primary enforcement tools, it does not conduct many inspections of federal worksites or have a national strategy for targeting worksites with high injury and illness rates for inspection. Furthermore, although OSHA is responsible for tracking violations that agencies dispute and reporting any unresolved disputes to the President, OSHA does not track these disputed violations or their resolution. In addition, although OSHA is required to review agencies' safety programs annually and submit a report on them to the President each year, as of January 2006, the last report submitted was for fiscal year 2000. Finally, while OSHA has a range of compliance assistance programs designed to help agencies comply with its regulations and improve safety, these programs are not being fully utilized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the early to mid 1990s, five Yellowstone National Park employees were  killed in on-the-job accidents ranging from a snowmobiling accident to a  drowning. By the time the last death occurred, the Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA)\u2014the Department of Labor agency  responsible for overseeing federal agencies\u2019 safety programs\u2014decided to  conduct a comprehensive inspection and identified over 500 violations at  the park. OSHA also worked with park officials to improve safety. As a  result, Yellowstone transformed its safety program and according to  Yellowstone officials, OSHA has deemed it a success. However, this  worksite represents only one of thousands of locations where federal  employees work. During the past decade, the number of executive branch  workers killed or injured in work-related accidents at federal worksites  has fluctuated, although the number has decreased overall. Over this  period, over 800 workers died from work-related accidents, with 47 deaths  occurring in 2004. Non-fatal work-related injuries declined over the first  half of this period and increased over the subsequent 5-year period, with  approximately 148,000 claims for injuries being filed in 2004. While the  number of injuries fluctuated, the costs of the claims for these injuries\u2014  adjusting for inflation\u2014remained constant for most of the decade and rose  slightly in 2004 to $1.5 billion. In view of these injuries and their affiliated  costs, you asked us to answer the following questions: (1) What are the  components of federal agencies\u2019 safety programs and what  implementation challenges do they face? (2) How well does OSHA oversee  and assist federal agencies\u2019 efforts to develop and administer their safety  programs?", "To respond to your request, we focused on the executive branch because  OSHA has more oversight responsibilities with respect to these agencies  than it does for judicial and legislative branch agencies. We obtained  information using a data collection instrument from 57 safety managers for  agencies in the eight largest executive branch departments, which  represent about 80 percent of the federal workforce. The instrument  requested information and documentation on six components of sound  safety programs we identified from previous GAO work: (1) management  commitment, (2) employee involvement, (3) education and training, (4)  identification of hazards, (5) following up and correcting hazards, and (6)  medical management. We reviewed the information in the data collection  instrument and documentation that the agencies provided, assessing  whether the documentation supported the agency\u2019s responses and  identifying the types of activities the agency conducted for each program  component. In addition, we conducted more detailed follow-up interviews  with safety officials from 12 of the 57 agencies surveyed. We also  interviewed employee representatives from 8 agencies and visited 5  federal worksites, most of which were identified by OSHA as having strong  safety programs. In addition, we obtained information on workers\u2019  compensation claims from the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019  Compensation Programs (OWCP). We also interviewed all 10 of OSHA\u2019s  regional administrators and federal agency program officers and officials  in 10 area offices including the area director, a compliance safety and  health officer, and, in many cases, a compliance assistance specialist. In  addition, we examined OSHA\u2019s inspection data from fiscal year 1995 to  2004 and reviewed, when available, the annual reports that the eight  largest federal departments provided to OSHA from 2000 to 2004. Finally,  we reviewed the reports on federal safety programs that OSHA provided to  the President during this time frame. For a more detailed explanation of  our methodology, see appendix I.

In  November 2004, OSHA issued a final rule amending the injury  recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to federal agencies.  Prior to this time, federal agencies were required to collect only injury  information related to workers\u2019 compensation claims. OSHA revised the  recordkeeping requirements in order to improve the quality of the federal  recordkeeping system and to increase the utility of the data. Beginning in  January 2005, federal agencies were required to record injuries in the same  manner as private-sector employers and to apply new criteria to determine  whether an injury must be recorded. Specifically, a work-related injury  must be reported if, for example, it results in death, 1 or more days away  from work, restricted work, loss of consciousness, or a significant injury  or illness diagnosed by a physician. The regulations do not require that  this data be reported to OSHA. However, the regulations state that agency  heads must submit an annual report to OSHA, containing such information  as OSHA requests. At a minimum, these reports are to describe the  agency\u2019s safety program and include, among other things, the agency\u2019s  required self-evaluation findings.

In addition, 14 of the agencies reporting that they have  such a system (41 percent) either indicated that their hazard tracking  systems were not currently operational, or they did not provide sufficient  documentation to support the existence of such systems. Approximately a  quarter of the agencies surveyed reported that they did not have  automated systems for tracking safety training completed by their  employees. Furthermore, 34 agencies (60 percent) reported they did not  have an automated system for tracking the status of employees in light or  restricted duty return-to-work programs, and another 16 agencies did not  provide sufficient documentation of their systems. While federal agencies  are not required to use automated data systems, without such a system,  safety officials would have difficulty tracking broader trends such as  participation rates in light or restricted duty programs and the effect of  program participation on worker\u2019s compensation costs.", "Ten of the 12 agencies we reviewed in more detail reported challenges  with their automated systems, such as ensuring that these systems  collected appropriate data needed to evaluate the effectiveness of their  safety programs. For example, an official from the Tobyhanna Army Depot  told us that their computer technicians were in the process of designing a  hazard tracking program because no agencywide programs were available,  and off-the-shelf programs required too much adaptation to be practical.  She also developed a stand-alone spreadsheet to track all work-related  injuries because the systems available did not capture injuries that were  not recordable on the OSHA log (such as injuries requiring only first aid)  or injuries for which workers\u2019 compensation claims are not filed.  Furthermore, a National Park Service official stated that entering safety  meetings and other non-traditional training methods into the agency\u2019s  automated system is difficult because the system does not have data fields  for recording these activities. As a result, the agency has difficulty  determining the extent to which employees have been trained on many  safety issues.", "Despite these challenges, several agencies told us they have started or are  in the process of implementing automated safety systems that will allow  them to collect and analyze data in order to better manage these safety  programs, including assessing the effectiveness of their programs. For  example, according to a Transportation Security Administration official,  the agency is developing a new injury tracking system that will link injury  and illness data with inspection data, allowing them to identify trends,  such as where injuries commonly occur and demographic characteristics  of injured employees. Similarly, officials with the Bureau of Engraving and  Printing said they are testing a medical management system that will  aggregate data from a number of different sources including the health  unit, safety investigation reports, and their workers\u2019 compensation system.  Collecting these data will allow them to streamline the reporting process  and better track injury trends."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge agencies face is holding managers accountable for  implementing effective safety programs. While 51 agencies (89 percent)  reported having policies that establish responsibility for workers\u2019 safety  and health for all employees, 6 reported that they do not have such  policies, despite an OSHA regulation requiring them to establish these  policies for all management officials. Of the 51 agencies reporting having  such policies, 11 agencies did not provide sufficient documentation of the  policies. For example, one agency provided an Employee Performance  Plan, but there were no performance expectations related to safety  anywhere in the plan. Furthermore, although we asked the agencies to  provide copies of their performance appraisal review forms citing safety as  a rating element, only 16 agencies (28 percent) were able to do so.", "Agency officials and employee representatives at 7 of the 12 agencies  selected for follow-up interviews cited further difficulties in maintaining  accountability throughout all levels of their organizations. For example, a  Veterans Health Administration employee representative reported that,  while there is a high level of commitment to safety at the headquarters  level, the message is diluted as it reaches lower levels of the agency. In  another example, the Defense Commissary Agency implemented a  program that requires regional safety managers to evaluate stores\u2019 safety  programs. Agency officials stated that regional officials are expected to  follow up to ensure that stores make timely corrections, but are not  required to document when hazards are corrected. As a result, the agency  has little assurance that the safety of store employees is adequately  protected. In addition, according to an employee representative from the  Commissary, it is not always clear who is responsible for ensuring that  hazards are corrected.", "Several agencies reported that they had developed ways to help ensure  that employees and managers are held accountable for agency safety  programs. For example, in order to address accountability issues within  the agency, the Veterans Health Administration initiated a program that  ties agency safety goals to performance ratings. Moreover, instead of  simply including safety as a general element of performance review, the  agency selects two to three specific safety program goals that change  every few years according to agency needs. Past goals have included  submitting workers\u2019 compensation claims on time and reducing the  occurrence of needle stick injuries. According to agency officials, bonuses  for executive staff members are provided based on their progress in  meeting these goals.

One  agency official we interviewed reported difficulty identifying funding for  the agency\u2019s safety program because safety funding is not specifically  designated as a line item in its budget. This lack of information on  available resources makes it particularly difficult to plan for long-term  safety issues, such as developing and providing training. For example,  officials with the National Park Service, which employs a large cadre of  seasonal workers, reported that the lack of itemized safety funds within its  budget makes it hard to develop their training plans. OSHA officials cited  the federal budget process itself as problematic because it requires federal  agencies to budget months in advance for safety-related equipment  purchases or other safety devices, long before they may have identified the  need for this equipment. This was corroborated by a U.S. Mint official who  reported that it is difficult to correct hazards that require a lot of capital  investment and planning.", "In addition, a potential consequence of operating with limited resources is  the use of collateral duty safety officers\u2014employees whose primary  responsibilities do not involve safety. Nearly all of the agency officials we  interviewed reported relying on these positions, which are typically filled  by employees who volunteer or are assigned by the agency. While some  agency officials reported their collateral duty officers were appropriately  trained, as required by OSHA, others reported that these officers have  limited knowledge or experience in safety. Some agency officials we  interviewed said that this lack of experience, as well as the limited amount  of time collateral duty officers are allotted for safety duties, has made it  difficult for these officers to learn all of the safety program requirements.  For example, according to a National Park Service official, collateral duty  officers at this agency typically spend about 10 percent of their time on  their safety responsibilities, and this may inhibit their ability to respond  effectively when safety concerns arise. Moreover, one Forest Service  official told us that collateral duty officers questioned the feasibility of  building safety programs with collateral duty officers, and was concerned  that the safety duties might detract from their primary job responsibilities.", "Finally, 11 of the 12 agencies selected for follow-up interviews reported  that competing priorities make it difficult to manage their safety programs.  For example, a Food Safety Inspection Service official noted that  completing safety forms and fulfilling data requests can be a burden to the  agency\u2019s overall mission of meat and poultry inspections. Similarly, an  employee representative at the Forest Service told us that, because safety  achievements are not typically recognized or rewarded\u2014even though such  recognition is encouraged by OSHA regulations\u2014supervisors focus on  meeting production targets rather than working safely.", "Agencies identified a number of techniques for addressing the difficulties  associated with managing resources. For example, an official with a  National Park Service regional office said that they host monthly  conference calls with the collateral duty safety officers at several national  parks, which gives these individuals a chance to ask technical questions of  the regional safety officer and share effective practices among the parks.  These monthly calls also enable their collateral duty officers, who have  limited backgrounds in safety, to gain knowledge and experience over  time.

According to its internal guidance, OSHA is supposed to develop a list that  targets federal worksites for inspection. However, OSHA\u2019s Office of  Federal Agency Programs has not developed such a list in over 5 years. In  the past, OSHA used workers\u2019 compensation claims data collected by  OWCP to identify federal worksites with high numbers of injuries and  illnesses. Because of limitations in the data, however, it was difficult to  identify where each injury occurred and, therefore, use this information to  target federal worksites for inspection. OSHA officials at the national  office reported that they are working to start a new targeting effort but are  still facing the same difficulties in using workers\u2019 compensation data to  select federal worksites for inspection.", "As shown in figure 6, OSHA primarily conducts inspections of federal  worksites as a result of complaints.", "Unprogrmmed inpection initited y complintOther nprogrmmed inpection (ccident, referr, etc.)", "OSHA\u2019s inspection data of federal worksites show that complaint  inspections generally result in few violations compared to targeted  inspections, which generally identify a greater number of serious  violations (see fig. 7). For example, over the last 10 years, unprogrammed  inspections, which are generally initiated by complaints, uncovered an  average of one serious violation per inspection, in contrast to an average  of four serious violations for programmed (targeted) inspections. The  small average number of violations for unprogrammed inspections is  driven by the fact that over half of these inspections result in no violations  being identified.", "The new recordkeeping rule, which was implemented in January 2005,  requires federal agencies to begin collecting the same injury and illness  data as private-sector employers and could help OSHA develop its  targeting program, according to OSHA officials. Since the new rule  requires federal worksites to keep logs that include information that can  be used to calculate injury and illness rates, OSHA officials said these data  would be more useful in creating an effective targeting program than the  workers\u2019 compensation data. While the new rule does not require federal  agencies to report injury and illness data to OSHA, OSHA officials said  they could target federal worksites for inspection in the same way they  target private-sector employers in industries with high injury and illness  rates for inspection. For its targeting program of private worksites, OSHA  surveys a sample of worksites in industries with the highest injury and  illness rates. The survey form requires employers to report on (1) the  average number of employees who worked for them during the previous  calendar year, (2) the total hours the employees worked during the  previous year, and (3) summary injury and illness data from their OSHA  logs. OSHA then uses this information to compute the worksites\u2019 injury  and illness rates and sends those with relatively high rates a letter  informing them that they may be inspected. Finally OSHA develops a list  of worksites with high injury and illness rates to be targeted for  inspection. As an alternative to conducting a survey of federal worksites,  OSHA has the option of requiring federal agencies to report this  information in their annual reports to OSHA.", "One of OSHA\u2019s regional offices\u2014which includes four area offices\u2014and an  area office in another region developed their own targeted programs of  federal agency worksites using the workers\u2019 compensation data. While  officials reported using the data has been difficult, they said that these  efforts have resulted in improved safety at federal worksites. In addition,  they reported that the agencies that were inspected have become more  aware of OSHA\u2019s role and, in turn, have sought OSHA\u2019s assistance in  improving their safety programs. Furthermore, agency officials whose  worksites have been selected for inspection have focused more attention  on safety and shared information, resulting in further improvements. For  example, at one worksite in Montana, Forest Service officials reported  that, after colleagues in Idaho told them OSHA had targeted federal  worksites in the state for inspection, they were reviewing their safety  programs and OSHA\u2019s requirements in preparation for possible OSHA  visits.", "Officials with OSHA\u2019s national office said that they have encouraged  regions to develop their own programs targeting federal agencies for  inspection, but we identified some challenges that need to be addressed  before more regions can successfully develop these programs. For  example, one regional OSHA official reported requesting workers\u2019  compensation data from the national office to start a targeting program,  but was told the national OSHA office did not have enough time to provide  the data requested. In addition, regional and area office OSHA officials  said that the ability to develop and maintain targeting programs depends  on the resources available.

The agency challenged the  violation, and the dispute reached the national office, where no decision  was made\u2014leaving the violation unresolved for 7 years.

For the elements we used,  although small data discrepancies were found, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for providing the basic descriptive statistics  reported.", "In reviewing OSHA\u2019s role, we analyzed inspection data of federal agencies  for fiscal years 1995 through 2004 from OSHA\u2019s Integrated Management  Information System. We interviewed OSHA officials at the national office  and all of its 10 regional administrators and federal agency program  officers. For each region, we interviewed the director of the area office  that had the largest number of inspections of federal worksites in the last 5  years. We also interviewed a compliance safety and health official in each  of these offices identified by the area director and, where possible, the  compliance assistance specialist, although not every area office had a  compliance assistance specialist. In addition, we interviewed two OSHA  officials about the local emphasis program for federal worksites that one  region had implemented.", "Finally, when available, we examined agencies\u2019 annual reports to OSHA  from 2000 to 2004 and asked to review OSHA\u2019s annual reports to the  President for the same time period. However, as noted in the report, OSHA  had not completed its annual reports to the President for fiscal years 2001  through 2004 as required. We reviewed the report to the President that  OSHA had completed for fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO comments on Labor\u2019s letter dated March 17, 2006.  1.

OSHA suggests that our finding\u2014that violations disputed by federal  agencies were not being tracked\u2014was confusing because the agency  has an inspection database that it uses to track the status of all  violations. However, as noted in its comments, when OSHA generated  a report to identify unresolved violations at federal agencies, staff  could not determine the status of 11 violations. In addition, OSHA  acknowledged that the Office of Federal Agency Programs (OFAP)  does not have a formal tracking system for cases it receives for  resolution.
