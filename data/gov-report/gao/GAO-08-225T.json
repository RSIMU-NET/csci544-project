Recent media accounts indicate that some sites performing DOT drug test collections may not be adhering to the collection protocols. Moreover, given the different techniques a drug user may employ in an attempt to defeat a drug test, it is possible that a commercial truck driver could defeat a drug test by diluting, substituting, or adulterating a urine specimen in order to obtain a passing result. GAO was asked to perform an undercover operation to determine whether (1) urine collectors followed DOT protocols at selected collection sites and (2) commercially available products could be used to defeat drug tests.

While all urine collection sites followed DOT protocols by asking GAO undercover investigators to provide identification, investigators successfully used bogus driver's licenses to gain access to all 24 sites--demonstrating that a drug user could send someone to take a drug test in their place using fake identification. In addition, 22 of the 24 selected urine collection sites did not adequately follow the remaining protocols GAO tested. For example, 75 percent of the urine collection sites GAO tested failed to restrict access to items that could be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen, meaning that running water, soap, or air freshener was available in the bathroom during the test. The table below provides information about the high failure of selected protocols for the 24 collection sites tested. GAO also found that drug masking products such as adulterants, dilutants, and substitutes were widely available on the Internet. After purchasing drug masking products from Web sites, GAO investigators used adulterants at four of the collection sites and substitute synthetic urine at another four sites without being caught by site collectors--demonstrating that these products could easily be brought into a collection site and used during a test. Even in one case where a collection site followed all DOT collection protocols regarding administration of the test, investigators were still able to substitute synthetic urine for their sample. Every drug masking product went undetected by the drug screening labs. Provided the adulterant GAO used would be able to mask drug use as advertised, a drug user would likely be able to use the substances GAO tested to obtain a passing result on his or her test. According to officials GAO interviewed at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), companies that make drug-masking products are aware of government test standards and devise products that prevent laboratories from detecting them. SAMHSA is required to provide information to laboratories on how to test the validity of the urine specimens, publicly providing detailed information on lab testing procedures on its Web site."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our undercover operation to test  Department of Transportation (DOT) drug testing regulations as they  relate to commercial truck drivers. According to DOT, its regulations  implement the world\u2019s largest drug and alcohol testing program covering  six DOT operating administrations and over 12.1 million employees in the  United States, including school bus drivers, commercial truck drivers  transporting hazardous materials, and airline pilots. We focused our  efforts on the DOT drug testing program for commercial truck drivers,  which DOT considers to be a safety-sensitive transportation position. If an  employee in a safety-sensitive transportation position were using  controlled substances such as marijuana, cocaine, or phencydidine (PCP),  a clear public safety risk would exist.", "To help prevent accidents resulting from drug use by individuals holding  safety-sensitive positions, federal law requires motor carriers to drug test  their employees. Motor carriers in the United States are responsible for  conducting the drug testing of their employees and can use third-party  administrators to help them coordinate the drug tests. Drug tests involve  collecting a urine specimen from the employee at a collection site. As long  as the collection site meets the requirements of DOT\u2019s regulations, urine  collection can be performed at sites across the nation, in addition to being  performed onsite at an employer\u2019s facilities. DOT regulations contain  numerous control measures intended to ensure the integrity of the urine  specimen and the collection process during these tests. However, a drug  using employee may attempt to defeat a drug test using techniques  commonly known as substitution, dilution, and adulteration. To prevent an  employee from defeating the drug test, DOT regulations mandate that  collection sites follow certain protocols, for instance:     DOT protocols require collectors to validate that an employee is  carrying photo identification before the test. This is designed to  prevent an employee from having somebody else take the test for him  or her, which is one form of substitution.", "DOT protocols require collectors at drug testing sites to ensure that no  clear water source is available in the collection area, among other  measures, to prevent an employee from using water in the bathroom to  dilute their urine specimen.", "DOT protocols specify that employees should not be able to access  soap, air freshener, or other chemicals to prevent them from using  these products to adulterate a urine specimen. Other DOT protocols  designed to prevent adulteration require employees to empty their  pockets and wash their hands before providing the specimen.", "Recent media accounts indicate that some private sector collection sites  performing DOT drug test collections may not be adhering to established  collection protocols. Moreover, given the different techniques a drug user  may employ in an attempt to defeat a drug test, it is possible that a  commercial truck driver could defeat a drug test by diluting, substituting,  or adulterating a urine specimen in order to obtain a passing result. You  asked us to perform an undercover operation to determine whether   (1) urine collectors followed DOT protocols at selected collection sites  and (2) commercially available products could be used to defeat drug  tests.", "To determine whether urine collectors followed DOT protocols at selected  publicly advertised urine collection sites, we created two fictitious  trucking companies. Since our focus was on commercial truck drivers, we  produced bogus commercial driver\u2019s licenses using computer software  and hardware available to the public. Our investigators then posed as  commercial truck drivers employed at the fictitious companies. We also  used the fictitious company names to hire third-party administrators  (TPA) to help us coordinate the drug tests by recommending collection  sites and processing the required paperwork. Our undercover investigators  then reported to urine collection sites pretending they had been selected  by their company to receive a drug test and submitted urine specimens.  The specimens were sent to the drug testing laboratories by the collection  sites, and through our TPA we were able to access the laboratory results  of our drug tests. We selected 24 publicly advertised urine collection sites  to test four major geographic areas throughout the United States,  including 6 urine collection sites in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan  area and 6 in each of the following three areas\u2014Los Angeles, New  York/Northern New Jersey, and Dallas/Fort Worth. We chose the  Washington, D.C., area because of its size and for reasons of convenience  and economy, and the other three areas due to the large number of truck  drivers residing within each area. At each urine collection site we tested  16 specific DOT protocols which we determined, based on our research, to  be the most critical in preventing an employee from defeating a drug test.", "Investigators brought mobile phones with photographic capability into the  collection sites to photograph any breaches of protocol they observed.", "To determine whether commercially available products could be used to  defeat drug tests, we researched products available to mask drug use by  conducting Internet searches, reviewing prior GAO reports, and  interviewing knowledgeable government officials. We then purchased  adulterants and substitute synthetic urine over the Internet and used them  in an attempt to defeat 8 out of the 24 drug tests. We did not test any  commercially available dilutants or use dilutants we found in the  collection area (e.g., tap water). While synthetic urine requires complete  substitution, adulterants were mixed with the urine specimen our  investigators provided. It is therefore important to note that since our  investigators\u2019 urine specimens did not contain traces of drug use, we  cannot report on whether the adulterants we used were able to mask drug  use\u2014only on whether the laboratories could detect the presence of the  adulterant. We assumed that a drug user could receive a passing result as  long as the laboratories did not detect the presence of the synthetic urine.  It is not possible to generalize the results of our undercover testing to  apply to all collection sites or to all drug-masking products.", "We conducted this investigation from May to September 2007 in  accordance with standards prescribed by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Six operating administrations under DOT have issued regulations requiring  antidrug programs in the aviation, highway, railroad, mass transit,  pipeline, and maritime industries. Antidrug programs for commercial truck  drivers are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  (FMCSA), which is the operating administration responsible for enforcing  FMCSA regulations and establishing who is tested and when they are  tested. FMCSA antidrug regulations require that employers of commercial  motor carriers, including those who are owner-operators, conduct drug  testing according to the DOT \u201cProcedures for Transportation Workplace  Drug Testing Programs.\u201d These DOT regulations mandate that motor  carriers must conduct pre-employment, reasonable suspicion, random,  and post-accident drug testing on their employees. While these scenarios  are all different, DOT requires collectors and collection sites to follow  uniform collection protocols regardless of the reason for the test.  Collection sites are privately run facilities, where the collectors at the sites  do not have to be certified by DOT, but must meet DOT regulations by  completing the required training and following DOT protocols. Because  collection sites are spread throughout the nation, it is easy for an  employee in any of the drug testing scenarios, from pre-employment to  post-accident drug testing, to get to a collection site within the given time  frame. According to DOT regulations, collection sites must promote  privacy, incorporate the scientific and technical guidelines of the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), utilize a scientifically  recognized testing method, and require that specimens be labeled and  secured in the presence of the tested employee to prevent tampering. To  help collection sites comply with these regulations, DOT\u2019s Office of Drug  and Alcohol Policy and Compliance issued revised protocols in December  2006. The protocols indicate that the collector has a major role in the  success of the DOT drug testing program because he or she is the one  individual in the testing process with which all employees have direct,  face-to-face contact. The protocols also state that the test may lose validity  if the collector does not ensure the integrity of the specimen and  collection process.", "DOT protocols have specific requirements that collection sites must meet,  including procedures to (1) prevent unauthorized access to the urine  collection site; (2) prevent the tested employee or anyone else from  gaining unauthorized access to the collection materials/supplies;   (3) ensure that the tested employee does not have access to items that  could be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen such as soap,  disinfectants, cleaning supplies, and water; and (4) ensure that the tested  employee is under the supervision of a collector or appropriate site  personnel at all times when permitted into the site.", "To document the collection of the specimen, DOT requires that urine  collection sites correctly complete the Federal Drug Testing Custody and  Control Form (CCF) for every collection under the DOT drug testing  program. This form is also used to document the transfer of the specimen  to the HHS-approved, private sector laboratories, where the urine  specimen is sent to be tested for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines,  opiates, and phencydidine (PCP) as identified by HHS regulations. It is  important to note that the laboratories that test the specimen are separate  entities than the urine collection sites. The collection sites must follow  DOT protocols and their role is to collect the urine specimen, while the  laboratories must be certified by HHS and their role is to perform the drug  testing of the specimen. The laboratories are authorized to also conduct  validity testing to determine if the specimen is consistent with normal  human urine, whether adulterants or foreign substances are present, or if  the specimen was diluted or substituted. The HHS organization, Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), administers  the Federal Workplace Drug Testing Program and revised the guidelines in  2004 to require that specimen validity tests be conducted on all urine  specimens of federal employees due to the increase in the number of  chemical adulterants that were marketed on the Internet and in certain  magazines. DOT did not adopt this update in their regulations------so  currently drug testing laboratories are only authorized, not required, to  perform validity testing for all DOT required commercial motor carrier  drug tests.", "As an additional quality control check, DOT requires that a Medical  Review Officer (MRO) serve as an independent, impartial authority to  verify the lab results. After the results are verified, the MRO, who is a  licensed physician, informs the designated company official whether the  employee passed or failed the drug test. The MRO may also designate test  results as cancelled in the case of an invalid test. An invalid test results  when a drug screening lab identifies an unidentified adulterant, substitute,  or abnormal physical characteristic in the specimen that prevents the lab  from obtaining a valid test result. In the case of a cancelled test, the MRO  conducts an interview with the employee to determine if there is a  legitimate medical reason for the result. If the MRO determines there is a  legitimate medical reason, no further action is required. However, if the  MRO determines there is no legitimate medical reason, the employee is  required to take another drug test under direct observation\u2014effectively  getting another opportunity to take the test, but without the privacy  afforded previously. In the case of a positive result, which is defined as a  failed drug test, a supervisor or company official is required to  immediately remove the employee from the job. Employees who test  positive and continue to perform safety-sensitive functions and employers  who permit them to do so are both subject to criminal and civil fines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Collection Sites Failed to Comply with All DOT Protocols", "paragraphs": ["In our tests of the selected 24 urine collection sites in four major  geographic areas throughout the United States, we determined that 22 of  the 24 sites showed varying degrees of failure in complying with the  protocols that we tested.
