These measures include how quickly calls were answered and the accuracy of information provided. The contract between USCIS and its contractor stipulated that the contractor could earn financial incentive awards if the average monthly performance met or exceeded the standards on a quarterly basis at each of four call centers. Conversely, financial deductions could be made if the standards were not met. USCIS did not finalize the terms regarding how the contractor's actual performance would be calculated, or scored, before awarding the contract. This limited USCIS's ability to exercise performance incentives (positive or negative) because the parties could not reach agreement on performance terms. USCIS suspended the use of financial incentives while the parties negotiated the issue. Agreement was not reached after 16 months, however, USCIS determined that the contractor had failed to meet standards for 4 of the 7 performance measures in the fourth quarter of 2004 and took action to reduce its payments for services. The contractor objected, citing the lack of agreement on the performance measurements and the impact of workload increases, but USCIS disagreed and stated it would reduce payment. In a separate but related matter, USCIS failed to meet contractual, regulatory, and GAO standards pertaining to how the contractor's performance would be documented--especially with respect to any deficiencies. Finally, USCIS exercised its option to extend the call center contract through May 2006, to allow time to solicit and award new call center contracts. USCIS said it intends to finalize performance measurement terms in the new contracts. USCIS used contractor performance data it collected over the course of the contract to identify opportunities to improve customer service and call flow, among other things.

Customer service representatives  (CSR) at Tier 1 respond to inquiries in English or Spanish. The CSRs focus  primarily on providing administrative information to customers by using a  series of scripts provided by USCIS. For example, if a customer needs  what USCIS considers basic information, such as USCIS local offices\u2019  hours of operations, eligibility requirements, and procedures to follow,  such questions are to be answered by CSRs at Tier 1 call centers using  specific scripts. In addition, CSRs are to refer customers to USCIS service  centers and local offices, for such things as changes of address and  appointment scheduling at USCIS application support centers. (Some of  these tasks may alternatively be performed by customers through the  USCIS Web site\u2014www.uscis.gov.) As of April 2005, the four Tier 1 call  centers employed over 450 CSRs.

Their purpose is to ensure that  contractors are given the freedom to determine how to meet the  government\u2019s performance objectives, that appropriate quality levels are  achieved, and that payment is made only for services that meet these  levels. This type of contract is to emphasize standards for customer  service and measurement of performance and may offer financial  incentives, both positive and negative, to encourage quality performance.

According to OFPP, with performance-based  service contracts, incentive payments made to an independent contractor  are to be contingent on the contractor\u2019s ability to meet the government\u2019s  performance standards; the contract does not specify how those standards  are to be met. Thus, the contractor retains discretion in determining how  to meet performance standards specified in the contract, for example, how  many CSRs to hire to ensure calls are answered within a contractually  specified time. Other elements suggested for using a performance-based  service contract include (1) identifying the agency\u2019s needs and addressing  those needs with performance requirements that describe required service  results; (2) establishing performance standards that describe the required  performance level; and (3) establishing a quality assurance plan for  assessing contractor performance in order to ensure that the contractor  has performed in accordance with the standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USCIS Established Performance Measures to Assess Contractor\u2019s Call Center Performance", "paragraphs": ["USCIS used a multi-faceted approach to monitor and evaluate the quality  of information and service provided by CSRs to customers calling  contractor-operated Tier 1 call centers.

Data  on these measures are to be collected by the contractor\u2019s quality  assurance staff, who are to randomly monitor two calls per day for each  CSR. (CSRs are not to know when they are being monitored.) The data  collected are to be reported to USCIS on a monthly basis. Details on these  three measures follow:    Call quality monitoring. Calls are to be monitored by the contractor\u2019s  quality assurance staff to assess the CSRs\u2019 \u201csoft skills,\u201d that is, their  ability to interact with customers, establish customer rapport, maintain  composure during a call, speak with clarity and professionalism, and  other factors. Call quality monitoring data are to be captured on a  standardized form. CSR responses for each of nine different \u201csoft  skills\u201d are scored as percentages, with scores for the most highly  valued skills, such as \u201cactive listening\u201d\u2014that is, whether the CSR was  deemed to be attentive when listening to the customers\u2014given more  weight than the scores for other skills. The nine scores (i.e.,  percentages) are combined for a total \u201csoft skills\u201d score, with 100  percent as the highest possible score. The performance standard stated  in the PRS for this measure is that all calls monitored achieve an  average score of 90 percent to 95 percent after the nine \u201csoft skills\u201d  scores (i.e., percentages) for each call are combined.

Calls are to be monitored by the  contractor\u2019s quality assurance staff to determine, among other things,  whether CSRs provided accurate and complete responses. Using a  standardized form, the staff score CSRs on five different efforts, such  as whether the CSR used software tools appropriately and whether,  when the callers were asked directly, they indicated that their needs  had been satisfied. The five efforts are scored as percentages, with  more weight given to the scores for certain efforts, such as \u201cprovides  complete response.\u201d The scores are then combined for a total  \u201caccuracy of information provided\u201d score, with 100 percent as the  highest possible score.

All transactions and other significant events need to be  clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily available for  examination. This information should be recorded and communicated to  management and others within the agency who need it to carry out their  responsibilities. GAO\u2019s standards provide a framework for establishing  and maintaining internal control and for identifying and addressing major  performance challenges. Appropriate and effective internal control is a  key factor in helping agencies better achieve program results.", "The contract also requires the contractor to provide a quality assurance  plan. The plan that was developed by the contractor describes the  contractor\u2019s approach and strategy for ensuring the delivery of high-quality  service. As part of the plan, the contractor is to conduct formal, biweekly  internal performance review meetings to help with the identification and  correction of performance deficiencies. These meetings are to be attended  by contractor and USCIS officials, with contractor staff reporting on  quality performance issues, and are to be in addition to the quarterly (now  monthly) meetings discussed above. Minutes of the meetings are to  identify action items, responsibilities, and solution time frames, and the  minutes are to be published for USCIS review. However, a contractor  official said that these meetings never took place. According to both  contractor and USCIS officials, the quarterly meetings were used to  discuss operations and performance and to focus senior management  attention on any performance issues.", "Under FAR \u00a7 37.602-2, the government\u2019s quality assurance surveillance  plans should include actions to help ensure that the contractor carries out  its quality control obligations. By failing to ensure that the contractor held  and documented performance review meetings as required by the  contractor\u2019s quality assurance plan, USCIS did not meet its quality  assurance obligations under FAR \u00a7 37.602-2 and GAO\u2019s internal control  standards. In addition, USCIS\u2019s failure to obtain the contractor\u2019s written  acknowledgment of USCIS-identified performance deficiencies did not  meet the notification procedures established by the contract,  documentation requirements of FAR \u00a7 46.104(c), and GAO\u2019s standards for  internal control.", "In its comments on a draft of this report, DHS noted that the contract was  administered by a component of the VA until April 20, 2005, and DHS said  the VA was provided with documentation discussed at quarterly and  monthly performance assessment meetings between USCIS and the  contractor. According to DHS, the lack of a clear understanding between  USCIS and the VA regarding their roles contributed to the fact that formal  documentation and evaluations were not always properly maintained and  formally transmitted to the contractor.

With  \u201cintelligent call routing\u201d in place since February 2004, telephone calls  routed from the interactive voice response system to Tier 1 are now  routed to the next available CSR, at any of the four Tier 1 contractor- operated call centers. Previously, telephone calls to Tier 1 were routed  to the next available CSR in the call center that resided in the same  geographic region of the country as the caller. USCIS officials said that  by June 2005 they will also have implemented \u201cintelligent call routing\u201d  for calls transferred from Tier 1 to the next available IIO at either of the  two Tier 2 call centers.", "USCIS implemented \u201coverflow routing.\u201d USCIS started its \u201coverflow  routing\u201d initiative in October 2004, enabling certain general call types,  identified as \u201cEnglish Other\u201d and \u201cSpanish Other,\u201d to be routed directly  from the interactive voice response system to Tier 2 USCIS-operated  call centers, bypassing the Tier 1 contractor-operated call centers.  Previously, all calls handled by IIOs at Tier 2 were first routed from the  interactive voice response system to Tier 1, where CSRs then  transferred the calls to Tier 2. USCIS officials said they expect the  change will result in 1 to 5 percent of all calls being routed directly to  Tier 2, which should help when Tier 1 CSRs cannot handle the call  volume.", "USCIS implemented interactive voice response system routing of  certain telephone calls to USCIS service centers. USCIS changed its  automated interactive voice response system in December 2004 so that  certain types of customers\u2019 telephone calls\u2014for example, certain  issues concerning new permanent residents, cases already approved or  denied, and pending cases\u2014are now routed directly to USCIS service  centers, bypassing CSRs at Tier 1. Previously, all customers\u2019 telephone  calls that needed to be handled by USCIS service centers were routed  by the interactive voice response system to Tier 1. Then, after talking  with the customers, the CSRs referred the customers to the service  centers (whose employees have access to case paperwork) via e-mail.  CSRs were allowed to transfer customers\u2019 telephone calls to service  center personnel only when customers requested emergency and  expedited handling of applications.", "USCIS implemented a portfolio management system. Private attorneys,  paralegals, and other representatives can use the USCIS Internet Web  site to check the status of their clients\u2019 immigration cases using a  USCIS receipt number. Under the system, USCIS also notifies the  representatives via e-mail when a case status changes; for example,  when actions are taken, such as the approval or denial of an  application.

After a  referral is made, NCSC does not know whether the service center or  local office responded to the customer in a timely manner or even  responded at all. To better monitor this process, USCIS plans to  implement a referral management system, with such service request  referrals placed in a database and assigned a tracking number. The  system is to (1) determine the proper service center or local office to  process the referral, (2) assign the case to an adjudicator, (3) update  the case on a daily basis, and (4) report once a month on case status.  The referral management system is planned to be accessible to  customers on USCIS\u2019s Internet Web site so they can make and track  their own service request referrals. In addition, customers without  Internet access are to be able to call on the telephone and CSR\u2019s will  access the USCIS Web site and create referrals for them.
