Officials from five tribes reported information-sharing challenges with the Border Patrol, such as not receiving notification of federal activity on their lands. Border Patrol officials reported challenges navigating tribal rules and decisions. Border Patrol and DHS have existing agreements with some, but not all, tribes to address specific border security issues, such as for the establishment of a law enforcement center on tribal lands. These agreements could serve as models for developing additional agreements between the Border Patrol and other tribes on their specific border security coordination challenges. Written government-to-government agreements could assist Border Patrol and tribal officials with enhancing their coordination, consistent with practices for sustaining effective coordination. DHS established an office to coordinate the components' tribal outreach efforts, which has taken actions such as monthly teleconferences with DHS tribal liaisons to discuss tribal issues and programs, but does not have a mechanism for monitoring and overseeing outreach efforts, consistent with internal control standards.

Border Patrol and tribal officials report that they share border  security\u2013related information through the BEST and IBET forums, and  tribal officials reported receiving border security\u2013related information from  fusion centers. In addition, according to Border Patrol and tribal officials,  the Border Patrol uses tribal or public lands liaisons to coordinate with  tribes on border security. Another way Border Patrol and tribal officials  said they coordinate on these issues is by tribal law enforcement using  Operation Stonegarden funds to support daily coordination with the  Border Patrol, including participating in joint patrols with the Border Patrol.  In addition to these methods, the Border Patrol and tribes reported using  joint operations, such as patrolling together in the same vehicles and  using shared facilities, to coordinate on border security. Table 3 contains  more detailed information regarding these coordination methods.", "In addition to these mechanisms, tribal and Border Patrol officials  reported using other coordination methods, such as agent-to-tribal police  officer interaction, meetings, and e-mails to coordinate on border security.  For instance, although officials from two of the tribes in our review said  their tribes do not use any of the coordination methods described in table  3, both tribes reported using meetings to coordinate as the need arises  with the Border Patrol on border security issues. Officials from six of the  eight tribes and 4 of the 10 Border Patrol stations we contacted reported  that these methods of contact are the most beneficial for coordinating on  border security. Officials from one tribe in our review reported that the  timely sharing of information via e-mail is the tribe\u2019s most important  coordination mechanism with federal agencies. Officials from another  tribe explained that leadership from the responsible Border Patrol Sector  regularly calls the tribal chairman to discuss border security issues, as  well as holding frequent meetings. Officials from four of the eight tribes  and 4 of the 10 stations we interviewed also reported that they  communicate daily with each other.", "Officials from some of the tribes and Border Patrol sectors and stations  we contacted reported positive aspects of coordinating to address border  security issues. Specifically, officials from five of the eight tribes we  contacted reported having a good or effective relationship with the Border  Patrol. In particular, officials from two of the tribes we reviewed, as well as  the corresponding Border Patrol sectors and stations, reported that there  are positive aspects of DHS\u2019s overall coordination with the tribes to  address border security threats. For example, officials from one of the  tribes explained that tribal law enforcement officers have a good working  relationship with the Border Patrol and that the Border Patrol is the best  federal agency they have worked with in terms of coordinating with the  tribe. Tribal officials cautioned that while the tribe has a good relationship  with the Border Patrol, the majority of tribal community members do not  want any Border Patrol presence on the reservation and that the tribal  community is very mistrusting of nontribal entities, including law  enforcement agencies. Border Patrol sector officials\u2014who staff the sector  responsible for border security on one of the two reservations\u2014stated  that in addition to productive monthly Border Patrol\u2013tribal leadership  meetings and daily interaction between Border Patrol agents and tribal  law enforcement, the Border Patrol was the first federal law enforcement  agency invited to speak at tribal schools and community meetings.", "Officials from one of the tribes in our review also reported that DHS and  the Border Patrol at both the national and local levels are more sensitive  to tribal concerns now than in the past and that the Border Patrol is willing  to work with tribal law enforcement in sharing intelligence and keeping the  lines of communication open. For instance, tribal officials explained that  they have quarterly meetings with the Border Patrol sector during which  the Border Patrol shares existing and future border security strategies  with the tribe, including the decision of whether to deploy surveillance  towers on the reservation. As a result of this interaction, the tribe,  according to tribal officials, feels involved in the decision to potentially  install towers on the reservation to help monitor and better secure the  border.

Specifically, officials from five of the eight  tribes we reviewed reported coordination challenges related to not  receiving notification and information from federal agencies, including the  Border Patrol, regarding federal law enforcement activity on their  respective reservations. The following examples illustrate these  coordination challenges.", "Officials from one of the tribes in our review reported that they are not  given advance notification of Border Patrol law enforcement actions,  such as independently patrolling the reservation or the deployment of  undercover surveillance teams, occurring on their reservation. These  officials reported that they would be in a better position to support  federal agencies with border security efforts if they received  information regarding planned federal law enforcement actions in a  more timely manner. Border Patrol officials from the sector stated that  the Border Patrol notifies tribal law enforcement of its own operations,  as well as joint operations, which often involve tribal law enforcement,  on the reservation. However, the Border Patrol does not provide  detailed information on its patrol schedule and dates and times of  operations, among other enforcement activities, to non-law- enforcement entities.", "A tribal official from another Indian reservation stated that there are  numerous law enforcement agencies with different enforcement  objectives working on the reservation and that there have been a few  instances in which a tribal law enforcement unit and another federal  agency were tracking the same suspects unaware of each other\u2019s  presence. These situations, according to tribal officials, were  problematic because the agencies were concerned that the overall  operation would fail because of the lack of notification by each agency  of its respective operations. Although a Border Patrol official with  border security responsibilities on this Indian reservation was not  aware of the Border Patrol being involved in such incidents, according  to tribal officials, when tribal officials and the Border Patrol work  together, they can complement each other and act as force multipliers  by utilizing their respective resources. We have previously reported on  the importance of deconfliction and coordinating to prevent law  enforcement entities from unknowingly interrupting each other or  duplicating each other\u2019s efforts. Moreover, CBP reports that in some  areas along the border, surveillance and response capabilities are  limited, so the success of its border security initiatives depends on  leveraging intelligence and partnerships with federal, state, local, and  tribal governments.", "Officials from a third tribe in our review reported that although the tribe  provides information to federal agencies, these agencies do not  consistently provide information, particularly information related to  tribal members, to the tribe. For instance, in 2009, Border Patrol and a  county sheriff\u2019s deputy responded to an incident involving two  individuals who tried to illegally cross the border on tribal lands.  Although the tribe was conducting operations in the area and could  have responded to this incident, tribal officials stated that they did not  receive information about the illegal crossing from the Border Patrol.  Border Patrol officials from the sector with responsibility for this Indian  reservation were not able to confirm Border Patrol involvement in this  incident.", "Further, according to Border Patrol officials, in some cases, coordination  challenges with tribes have affected the Border Patrol\u2019s ability to patrol  and monitor the border so as to prevent and detect illegal immigration and  smuggling. Border Patrol officials from three of the seven Border Patrol  sectors and 5 of the 10 stations we contacted reported coordination  challenges related to understanding and collaborating with tribes within  tribal government rules. Specifically, officials from two sectors that include  Indian reservations and corresponding stations reported coordination  challenges related to tribal government rules that hindered law  enforcement in working together to secure the border.", "Border Patrol officials from one of the sectors with border security  responsibilities on an Indian reservation in our review stated that the  reservation faces border threats and is vulnerable, in part, because  the Border Patrol cannot patrol as frequently as it would like to on the  reservation. The Border Patrol is limited, because of tribal decisions,  in the type of border security enforcement, particularly the  implementation of visible countermeasures, such as mobile  surveillance systems or integrated fixed towers, it can implement on  the reservation, according to these Border Patrol officials. Further,  these Border Patrol officials stated that some tribal members are  opposed to the Border Patrol\u2019s presence on the reservation, which,  because of the potential for volatile protests by these tribal members,  impedes the Border Patrol\u2019s ability to patrol certain areas of the  reservation, including a road in a major smuggling area. As a result of  these issues, Border Patrol officials reported that the Border Patrol  cannot apply all of its capabilities, particularly technology, to address  border security threats and vulnerabilities on the reservation. Tribal  officials from this Indian reservation stated that although the Border  Patrol is not permitted to implement border security technologies on  the reservation because of tribal community preferences, the Border  Patrol is able to implement technologies and checkpoints just off of  the reservation. Border Patrol headquarters officials stated that the  implementation of these countermeasures off of instead of on the  reservation adjacent to the border hampers the Border Patrol\u2019s ability  to secure the border.", "Border Patrol officials from a sector with an Indian reservation  reported that the tribe has negotiated with the Border Patrol via its  tribal resolution process and other means to limit the tactical  infrastructure the Border Patrol sector uses to support the border  security mission on the reservation. For example, the Border Patrol is  limited in the deployment of tactical checkpoints and must negotiate  regarding the deployment location of vehicle-mounted radar  systems.mounted radar system had to be moved to a tactically less   According to the Border Patrol, in one case, a vehicle- advantageous position because of tribal concerns over its location on  a sacred mountain.", "According to the Border Patrol, the tribal resolution process for  gaining approval from the tribe to implement border security  countermeasures is difficult to navigate, which significantly affects the  Border Patrol\u2019s ability to quickly respond to threats, and reduces the  Border Patrol\u2019s presence on the border. The tribal resolution process,  according to Border Patrol officials, includes several steps for  soliciting feedback and approval for all proposed Border Patrol actions  from all of the tribe\u2019s districts and communities. Border Patrol sector  and station officials expressed concerns about individual community  members, including those possibly involved in cross-border crime,  being able to prevent passage of the resolution. These officials also  stated that the tribe has changed the approval process without  communicating these changes to the Border Patrol, which makes it  difficult for the Border Patrol to adapt to the changes for both new  projects and projects already under consideration by the tribe.", "Tribal officials stated that the Border Patrol established temporary  camps on its own initiative without gaining approval from the tribal real  estate office, so the tribal officials had the Border Patrol remove the   However, these officials acknowledged that the resolution  camps.process is lengthy and can be tedious for Border Patrol officials,  particularly since the Border Patrol has deadlines it must meet to  receive funding for projects. They also recognized that some of the  tribal districts were not familiar with the steps required by the  resolution process. As a result, tribal officials have established a tribal  committee to ensure the districts and the Border Patrol better  understand the approval process.", "Given these coordination challenges, written agreements between the  Border Patrol and tribes could provide a mechanism to help resolve  coordination issues, such as the tribes\u2019 lack of notification and information  from federal agencies regarding law enforcement activity on their  reservations, when they emerge. We have previously reported on  practices that can enhance and sustain effective collaboration, such as  establishing common standards, policies, or procedures to use in  collaborative efforts and the development of written agreements to  document collaboration. We reported that as agencies bring diverse  cultures to the collaborative effort, it is important to address these  differences to enable a cohesive working relationship and to create the  mutual trust required to enhance and sustain the collaborative effort.  Regarding the use of written agreements to document collaborative  efforts, we have reported on the utility and benefits of written government- to-government agreements between U.S. government agencies and  foreign governments or other sovereign entities to improve cooperation.These agreements, in part, provide a legal framework for improving  partnerships, facilitate information exchange, define tasks to be  accomplished by each entity, and establish written assurances of each  entity\u2019s commitments. A government-to-government agreement could  help DHS and tribal governments to come together as partners to  establish complementary goals and strategies for achieving shared  results in securing the border on tribal lands.", "Border Patrol headquarters officials reported that they have considered  the potential utility and benefits of written government-to-government  agreements with individual tribes to address border security challenges.  In addition, DHS has entered into memorandums of agreements (MOA)  with individual tribes on other security-related issues, which have  benefited DHS and the tribes. For example, DHS entered into MOAs with  individual tribes regarding the implementation of the Enhanced Tribal  Card, which is a DHS program that allows all federally recognized tribes  to work with CBP to produce a card denoting citizenship and identity that  can be accepted for entry at the POEs. A DHS official from CBP\u2019s Land  Border Integration Project Management Office responsible for negotiating  these MOAs with the tribes reported that the MOAs were designed to  protect tribal sovereignty, as well as describe the steps the tribes must  take to produce a card. These MOAs, according to this official, are  binding and protect both the tribes and CBP from expending resources on  developing the card without assurances that the card will meet the  requirements of the program.", "Both Border Patrol and tribal officials reported that a written government- to-government agreement could benefit their border security coordination.  Border Patrol sector officials responsible for border security on one of the  reservations stated that the establishment of such an agreement explicitly  describing the steps required to obtain approval for Border Patrol actions,  including the tribe\u2019s resolution process and mechanisms for notifying the  Border Patrol when changes are made to the process or approval  requirements, could help resolve challenges for the Border Patrol in  coordinating with the tribe. Tribal officials also reported that a  government-to-government agreement could assist with resolving  remaining coordination challenges by supporting overall coordination and  ensuring that coordination processes are followed. Officials from another  tribe in our review stated that they would also be receptive to an  agreement that shows respect for the tribe and its practices, is developed  with tribal participation, and involves senior DHS officials with negotiating  capabilities. Border Patrol sector officials with responsibility for another of  the reservations in our review stated that they considered pursuing an  agreement with the tribe, but decided instead to actively engage tribal  council officials, law enforcement officers, and community members in  resolving issues, a course of action that has, according to Border Patrol  officials, been effective in gaining the support of tribal leadership and law  enforcement. The Border Patrol sector officials noted, though, that if  agreements with tribal officials were pursued, senior DHS officials would  need to be involved in the negotiation of any government-to-government  agreements because tribal leadership officials do not view the Border  Patrol, as a law enforcement agency, as the appropriate federal  government representative for negotiating these types of agreements.  Officials from both of these tribes emphasized the importance of tribal  sovereignty and the need for the federal government to interact with tribes  on a government-to-government basis. An assessment of the utility of  written, government-to-government agreements between DHS and  individual tribal governments to address and mitigate specific coordination  challenges, particularly for tribes facing border security threats, could help  DHS build on its tribal partnerships. Further, agreements that are  tailored to help resolve specific challenges, such as not receiving  notification and information from federal agencies regarding federal law  enforcement activity on the tribes\u2019 respective reservations could bring  greater transparency to tribal government rules for the Border Patrol.

The 2009  memorandum requires all federal agencies to submit to OMB a detailed  action plan of the steps the agency will take to ensure meaningful and  timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that  have tribal implications. As DHS was formulating the Action Plan, tribes  recommended, among other things, that DHS develop accountability and  tracking mechanisms to ensure that the agency is responding to issues  that are raised through tribal consultation. The Action Plan and its 2010  Progress Report call for the implementation of various action items  designed to monitor and oversee DHS\u2019s tribal coordination efforts at the  department level, including appointing a Senior Advisor for tribal affairs to  provide policy advice and leadership on tribal issues and determining the  feasibility and usefulness of establishing an internal leadership advisory  council on tribal affairs. According to the Action Plan, this intra-agency  council, staffed by DHS IGA and composed of officials from the  department and components, would provide ongoing advice to the  Secretary of Homeland Security on issues and policies that affect tribes,  including border security, as well as bringing together DHS leadership  from across the department\u2019s divisions and components to ensure  consistency on policies affecting tribes. According to DHS officials, while  DHS took steps to hire a Senior Advisor, the position was ultimately not  sustainable because of staff turnover and a lack of funding for the  position. DHS officials further noted that the position of Director of Tribal  Affairs within the Intergovernmental Affairs office was established to help  fulfill this role. Additionally, DHS officials reported that they did not  establish an advisory council because of personnel limitations, among  other issues.

As DHS was developing its Action Plan, it received feedback from  tribes regarding the need to establish accountability and tracking  mechanisms to ensure that DHS is responding to issues raised by tribes.  For example, in summarizing feedback received from tribes, DHS noted  in the Action Plan that tribal leaders expressed frustration regarding the  expenditure of significant time and resources engaging with a federal  agency only to see very little response or consideration of tribal  recommendations. However, DHS does not have a mechanism to monitor  and provide accountability for coordination efforts, as suggested by the  tribes and the Action Plan, to position DHS to, for example, identify  departmental and component coordination successes as well as areas  needing improvement, including addressing coordination challenges that  have remained since DHS obtained feedback from tribes in developing  the plan. An oversight mechanism, such as one or more of those  identified in DHS\u2019s Action Plan, could help identify and address these  coordination challenges as well as determine which coordination efforts  work well.

A monitoring and oversight  mechanism could yield additional information and insights on the  effectiveness of DHS\u2019s coordination with tribes, as well as help reinforce  accountability when coordinating to address border security issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance DHS-tribal coordination on border security on Indian  reservations, including DHS\u2019s monitoring and oversight of these  coordination efforts, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security take the following two actions: examine, or direct CBP to examine, as appropriate, the potential  benefits of government-to-government written agreements with tribes  facing border security threats, and develop and implement a mechanism to monitor DHS\u2019s department- wide border security coordination efforts with tribes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS, DOJ and DOI for comment. We  received written comments from DHS on the draft report, which are  summarized below and reproduced in full in appendix I. DHS concurred  with both recommendations. DOJ and DOI did not provide written  comments to include in this report. DOJ provided technical comments via  an e-mail received on December 7, 2012, which we incorporated as  appropriate. DOI provided oral technical comments on December 7,  2012, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "Regarding the first recommendation, that DHS examine or direct CBP to  examine, as appropriate, the potential benefits of government-to- government written agreements with tribes facing border security threats,  DHS concurred. DHS stated that more formalized government-to- government agreements between CBP and tribal nations should be  developed for substantive issues. DHS further noted that written  agreements, subject to legal review prior to signature, will memorialize  both the issues and solutions. DHS stated that the DHS  Intergovernmental Affairs office will work with CBP in the coming year to  determine how the recommendation can be implemented. We will  continue to monitor DHS\u2019s efforts.", "Regarding the second recommendation, that DHS develop and  implement a mechanism to monitor DHS\u2019s department-wide border  security coordination with tribes, DHS concurred. DHS agreed that  developing an agency-wide program could further enhance the interests  of the tribes and the department for border security and many other  programs. DHS stated that, in consultation with tribes, it will convene an  internal group to discuss the feasibility of establishing a permanent  program or an intra-agency oversight committee to address border  security and other issues related to interaction and program delivery with  tribes. This action, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of  the recommendation.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-8777 or gamblerr@gao.gov.
