Foreignflagged vessels cruising to foreign ports serve most of the U.S. demand for cruises. However, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) recently obtained an exemption from U.S. maritime law to operate three foreign-built ships under the U.S. flag in Hawaii. Cruise lines and others have raised concerns over the advantage the exemption might confer to NCL, since foreign-flagged competitors are unable to offer the same itineraries due to the Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA), which prevents foreign vessels from transporting passengers solely between U.S. ports. Concerns have also been raised over the effect this exemption might have on future attempts to grow the U.S.-flag cruise vessel fleet, since potential U.S.-flag competitors would need to build ships in the United States, presumably at higher cost. GAO was asked to (1) review the original intent of the PVSA and rulings and decisions regarding it, (2) determine if the exemption will affect the implementation of the PVSA or other maritime laws, (3) assess the potential effects of the exemption on competition and entry into the U.S. domestic cruise market, and (4) assess the potential economic effects of granting other cruise lines similar exemptions. The Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation generally agreed with the findings in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The original intent of the PVSA, enacted in 1886, was to protect the U.S. maritime industry from foreign competition by penalizing foreign vessels that transport passengers solely between U.S. ports. However, several rulings and decisions interpreting the PVSA have allowed itineraries for foreign cruise vessels between U.S. ports that were previously restricted. For example, voyages by foreign vessels between two U.S. ports that include a distant foreign port, and round trip voyages from U.S. ports that include a nearby foreign port and other U.S. ports, do not violate the PVSA. NCL's exemption will likely have little impact on how the PVSA or other maritime laws are administered or interpreted because it is specific to three NCL vessels and cannot be applied to any other vessels in any other areas. The exemption effectively gives NCL a monopoly on interisland Hawaiian cruises--providing consumers with itineraries that were previously unavailable. However, NCL will likely have little power to raise prices on these itineraries because of competition from other vacation options. Because NCL is able to operate foreign-built ships in Hawaii, the exemption provides an additional obstacle for any potential U.S.-flag competitor to enter that market, since that competitor would need to build the ship in the United States at a higher cost. However, independent of the exemption, there were and still are other substantial obstacles for any potential U.S.-flag cruise vessel due to the higher capital and operating costs (e.g., labor costs) associated with the U.S. flag, as compared with existing foreign-flag cruise vessels offering itineraries through a foreign port. Granting additional exemptions to ease entry into the domestic trade could lead to benefits for port cities, U.S. seamen, and consumers; however, it is unclear how many cruise lines would choose to enter even if they were permitted to operate foreign-built ships under the U.S. flag, because of the higher operating costs associated with a U.S.-flag carrier operating in domestic itineraries and because of uncertain market conditions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["All of the passengers embarking on large cruise vessels from United  States ports, about 6.5 million in 2002, went aboard foreign cruise vessels.  The three major carriers in the cruise industry, Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal  Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) are all foreign  corporations operating foreign-built vessels, registered under foreign flags  with predominantly foreign crews. Because trips from and between U.S.  ports that do not include a stop at a foreign port are prohibited for foreign- flag vessels, these vessels must include at least one foreign port in their  itineraries to serve consumers out of U.S. ports.", "Wholly domestic itineraries are reserved for U.S. vessels by the Passenger  Vessel Services Act (PVSA) and U.S. vessel documentation laws. For  example, ferries providing transportation in U.S. ports and steamboats  providing service along the Mississippi are U.S.-built vessels, registered  under the U.S. flag. The PVSA penalizes foreign vessels that provide  transportation between U.S. ports, at $300 per passenger transported. U.S.  vessel documentation laws have established the requirements vessels must  meet in order to operate under the U.S. flag and operate in domestic trade.  These laws require that U.S.-flag vessels providing transportation between  two U.S. points must be U.S.-built, owned by U.S. citizens, and operated  with U.S. crews. However, no large U.S.-flag, overnight, ocean-going cruise  vessels are currently in operation, and no large passenger liners have been  built in the United States since 1958. American Classic Voyages, which filed  for bankruptcy in 2001, was the last company to operate large overnight  cruise ships under the U.S. flag, offering itineraries among the Hawaiian  Islands since the late 1970\u2019s.", "NCL was recently granted a legislative exemption from the U.S.-built  requirement of U.S. vessel documentation law to operate three foreign-built  cruise ships in limited domestic itineraries under the U.S. flag. These ships  must meet all other requirements to operate under the U.S. flag, including  U.S. ownership requirements and operating with a U.S. crew. NCL has  created a U.S. subsidiary, NCL America, to meet the U.S. ownership  requirements to operate U.S.-flag vessels in domestic trade. Because the  U.S.-built requirement is waived and the vessels will be operating under the  U.S. flag, these ships will be considered qualified to operate in the domestic  trade. These ships are therefore unaffected by the restrictions of the PVSA.  However, the exemption limits the markets these ships may serve. NCL is  required to keep the ships in \u201cregular service\u201d in Hawaii and is restricted  from using the exempted vessels for transporting passengers to ports in the  Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, or Alaska. NCL is scheduled to begin  service in Hawaii in July 2004.", "Cruise line officials and others have raised concerns over the exemption.  The exemption potentially confers a market advantage to NCL, since other  foreign-flag competitors are unable to offer the same itineraries as NCL.  This exemption may also affect any future attempts to grow the U.S.-flag  cruise vessel fleet. As you requested, this report discusses (1) the original  intent of the PVSA and how rulings and decisions regarding the act relate to  its original purposes; (2) how the exemption provided to NCL may affect  the future implementation of the PVSA, U.S. vessel documentation laws, or  the Jones Act; (3) the potential effects of the exemption on competition in  the passenger cruise industry and entry into the U.S. domestic cruise  market under the U.S. flag, and the exemption\u2019s broader economic effects;  and (4) the potential economic effects of granting other cruise lines similar  exemptions.", "To address the original intent of the PVSA, rulings and decisions regarding  the act, and how the exemption might affect the future implementation of  the PVSA or other cabotage laws, we reviewed and analyzed the PVSA, its  amendments and legislative history, U.S. vessel documentation laws, the  exemption given to NCL, and other related laws, regulations,  administrative rulings, and judicial decisions. We also interviewed officials  from the Maritime Administration (MARAD), Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), and the U.S. Coast Guard responsible for implementing  and interpreting these laws and regulations. To address the potential  economic effects of the exemption on competition and entry, and the  potential effects of additional exemptions, we reviewed existing studies  examining competition and the economic impacts of the cruise industry;  and we also interviewed officials from cruise lines, cruise industry  associations, union organizations, and ports; representatives from the  shipbuilding industry; and other stakeholders. In addition, we analyzed  available data on capital and operating cost differentials between U.S.-flag  and foreign-flag cruise vessels to determine the extent to which foreign-flag  vessels have a cost advantage. Since most of these data are proprietary, we  were unable to independently verify them because we have no authority to  require access to the underlying data. However, we applied logical tests to  the data and found no obvious errors of completion or accuracy. Along  with our use of corroborating evidence, we believe that the data are  sufficiently reliable for our use. We conducted our work from August 2003  through February 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

At the end of September 2003, two companies,  Carnival Cruises Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., controlled 86.4  percent of the market in North America, with NCL being the next largest  cruise provider, holding a little less than 9 percent of the North American  market. (See fig. 1.)", "These companies are foreign-owned and operate foreign-built vessels.  Carnival Cruise Lines is incorporated in Panama with its North American  ships flying the Bahamian or Panamanian flag. Royal Caribbean is a  Liberian corporation, with ships flying the Bahamian or Norwegian flag.  NCL is a subsidiary of Star Cruises, a Bermuda corporation headquartered  in Hong Kong, with its ships in North America flying the Bahamian flag.", "While there are several U.S. companies in the cruise industry, such as  Disney and Radisson Seven Seas, these companies also elect to operate  foreign-built vessels under a foreign flag in order to operate under the same  capital and operating cost structure as their foreign competitors. Currently,  there are no large U.S.-flag cruise ships in operation, and no large new  cruise ships have been built in the United States since 1958. This use of  foreign-built ships is largely due to the higher costs anticipated when  building a ship in the United States, rather than in shipyards in Italy, Germany, and elsewhere that have the infrastructure, expertise, and  economies of scale for this segment of the market.", "Over the past decade, several bills have been introduced into the U.S.  Congress with the objective of stimulating the development of a U.S.-flag  fleet and growth in the domestic cruise ship trade, the travel industry, and  port cities, although none have been enacted. Generally, these bills would  have allowed foreign ships either to operate in the domestic trade or to be  reflagged with the U.S. flag under certain specified conditions. For  example, the U.S. Cruise Vessel Act (S. 127), introduced in 2001, would  have allowed U.S.-owned, foreign-built cruise ships to enter the domestic  market for a limited time if the operators agreed to build replacement  vessels in the United States. This law was designed to allow new  companies to enter the domestic market with existing vessels and  immediately increase the size of the U.S. commercial fleet, thus providing  new jobs for merchant mariners. Under the proposal, these foreign-built  cruise ships would have been required to fully comply with all applicable  U.S. laws, regulations, and tax obligations.", "Many federal agencies oversee U.S. maritime policy. For example, in the  Department of Transportation, the Maritime Administration\u2019s (MARAD)  primary mission is to strengthen the U.S. maritime transportation system\u2014 including infrastructure, industry, and labor\u2014to meet the economic and  security needs of the nation. MARAD also seeks to ensure that the United  States maintains adequate shipbuilding and repair services, efficient ports,  and effective intermodal water and land transportation systems. MARAD  programs are designed to promote the development and maintenance of an  adequate, well-balanced, U.S. merchant marine. MARAD originally  financed two of the ships that NCL will be operating in the Hawaiian  Islands through MARAD\u2019s Title XI loan guarantee program under a project  known as \u201cProject America,\u201d that provided loan guarantees to help  construct two new cruise vessels for American Classic Voyages in a U.S.  shipyard for use in the Hawaiian Islands. Congress also granted American  Classic Voyages a monopoly in the Hawaiian market for the life of the  vessels. However, American Classic Voyages filed for bankruptcy in 2001,  and the partially completed hull of one ship and parts for the other were  purchased by NCL for $29 million. Subsequent to the purchase, NCL  obtained the exemption, allowing them to complete these ships in a foreign  shipyard and still operate them in Hawaii under the U.S. flag.", "The Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the  Department of Homeland Security, are generally responsible for  administering and enforcing maritime laws and U.S.-flag requirements,  including the PVSA and U.S. vessel documentation laws, as well as the  Jones Act. The Coast Guard handles documentation requirements for  U.S.-flag ships\u2014such as determining whether vessels meet the U.S.- ownership and crewing requirements in order to operate under the U.S.  flag\u2014and U.S.-built requirements in order to operate in domestic trade.  Through this process the Coast Guard provides endorsements to vessels  defining the type of trade in which they are allowed to engage, e.g., foreign  trade, domestic trade, or fishing. The Coast Guard also conducts quarterly  inspections on all vessels embarking passengers at U.S. ports. CBP also has  a role in administering the PVSA, such as publishing rulings on the legality  of proposed itineraries. CBP also has civil enforcement authority under the  PVSA, with the ability to levy penalties on any passenger vessel operators  engaging in service in the domestic market without the relevant Coast  Guard endorsements. The current penalty that can be levied against a ship  operator for a violation of the PVSA is $300 per passenger.", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for ensuring that the  nation\u2019s markets are vigorous, efficient, and free of restrictions that harm  consumers. The FTC exists to protect consumers by enforcing federal  consumer protection laws and conducting economic research and analysis  to inform all levels of government. In this regard, FTC conducted an  analysis of competition in the cruise market and the potential competitive  affects of a merger between two of the largest cruise lines and issued its report in October 2002. After FTC\u2019s study of the cruise market, in April  2003, Carnival Corporation acquired P&O Princess Cruises.

Specifically, there was  a concern about competition from Canadian vessels that were transporting  passengers across the Great Lakes. The PVSA originally stated \u201cno foreign  vessel shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United  States, either directly or by way of a foreign port, under a penalty of $2 for  each passenger so transported and landed.\u201d  Congress originally thought  that the $2 penalty per passenger would discourage this practice.", "Some industry associations and U.S. courts view the PVSA, U.S. vessel  documentation laws, and the Jones Act, as serving other purposes,  including providing a ready fleet in times of national defense, sustaining a  U.S. merchant marine, and supporting the U.S. shipbuilding industry. U.S.  courts have said that the PVSA and the Jones Act have helped to secure the  national defense by maintaining, \u201ca merchant marine of the best equipped  and most suitable types of vessels sufficient\u2026to serve\u2026in time of war or  national emergency.\u201d Because vessels in the domestic trade must be U.S.- crewed, labor groups view the laws as protecting jobs for the U.S.  merchant marine. According to data supplied by MARAD, over 1,000  passenger vessels are operating under the U.S. flag, employing U.S.  seamen, including ferries, steamboats, and small cruise vessels; however,  the last large U.S.-flag overnight cruise vessels ceased operations when  American Classic Voyages declared bankruptcy in October of 2001. In  addition, because the PVSA and the Jones Act protect the domestic  maritime transportation market for U.S.-built ships, they also support U.S.  shipyards. While several U.S. shipyards routinely build passenger vessels  for U.S.-flag operators such as ferry operators and steamship operators,  U.S. shipyards have not built large overnight, ocean-going cruise ships, and  the last large passenger liner built in the United States was completed in  1958."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal and Administrative Rulings and Decisions Have Expanded Itineraries Foreign Vessels Can Operate", "paragraphs": ["Several administrative rulings and judicial decisions have identified limited  exceptions to the PVSA that allow certain vessel operations between U.S.  ports by foreign passenger vessels. One significant decision\u2014which has  allowed passenger travel between U.S. ports by foreign vessels as long as a  distant foreign port is included\u2014was a 1910 Attorney General opinion. This  opinion states that an around-the-world cruise that started in New York and  touched numerous foreign destinations and ended in San Francisco did not  violate the PVSA because the voyage could not be considered domestic  trade. The Attorney General made this determination on the supposition  that the purpose of the trip was not to travel from one U.S. port (New York)  to another (San Francisco), but to travel to different locations around the  world. In 1940, a federal court also found that the transportation of  passengers on a foreign vessel from New York to Philadelphia that stopped  in a foreign port was not \u201cdetrimental to the coast wise monopoly sought to  be assured to U.S. vessels.\u201d The court said this was not a violation of the  PVSA because the vessel, which was originally scheduled to return to New  York, was forced to dock at the Philadelphia port because it was carrying  perishable cargo, requiring passengers to disembark in Philadelphia. The  court found that it was not the purpose of the trip to transport passengers  from New York to Philadelphia.", "Two regulations and rulings by CBP have also contributed to expansion of  the number and variety of itineraries in which foreign-flag vessels can  engage, from and between U.S. ports. First, based on the 1910 Attorney  General Opinion, CBP, in its regulations, interprets the PVSA to allow a  foreign vessel to embark passengers at one U.S. port and disembark  passengers at a different U.S. port, so long as the vessel makes a port of call  at what the regulations define as a \u201cdistant foreign port,\u201d such as Aruba or  Curacao. Second, a 1985 CBP regulation allows round-trip cruises from a  U.S. port, that touch on a \u201cnearby foreign port\u201d\u2014defined by the regulation  as such places as Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda\u2014to visit other U.S. ports  and allow passengers to go ashore temporarily, as long as they return to the  ship. For example, foreign vessels can embark passengers in New York,  make a quick stop in Canada or Bermuda, then cruise to several other U.S.  ports and return to New York without violating the PVSA. CBP\u2019s decision to  allow these types of itineraries was based on the supposition that the PVSA  put some U.S. ports at a disadvantage in competition for tourist business.  In its response to opposing comments, CBP stated that it is \u201cof paramount  importance in this area to consider the primary object of passengers in  taking a voyage,\u201d citing both the 1910 Attorney General Opinion and the  1940 court case as the authority for doing so.

Additional legislation would be required to allow for  any further domestic operations by foreign-built vessels.", "In addition, this exemption will likely not have any legal impact on the  Jones Act and its restrictions on shipping cargo between U.S. points.  Although interest groups and labor organizations link the PVSA and the  Jones Act philosophically, as being parallel laws for passengers and cargo,  respectively, numerous amendments and changes have been made to each  law that have not affected the other. For example, in 1920, the PVSA was  modified to allow permits to be issued for the transport of passengers by  foreign vessels to or from Hawaii, which lasted for 2 years. Furthermore,  an exception to the PVSA was made in 1938 to allow for the transport of  passengers by Canadian vessels between the New York ports of Rochester  and Alexandria Bay. More recently, Congress passed the Puerto Rico  Passenger Ship Act, which allows vessels not qualified to engage in the  domestic trade to carry passengers between U.S. ports and Puerto Rico and  between Puerto Rico ports. None of these exemptions has had an impact  on transporting cargo, which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Jones  Act, or on justifying the transportation of passengers outside the specific  scope of the exemption. Furthermore, the rulings and decisions discussed  earlier that have allowed foreign-flag vessels to transport passengers from  and between U.S. ports, if a foreign port is visited, do not extend to freight  transportation. For example, a foreign ship can pick up passengers in New  York, travel to Paris and pick up passengers there, and return to Boston to  disembark the passengers without violating the PVSA; however, the same  ship cannot take freight cargo from New York, pick up additional cargo in  Paris, and drop off the cargo in Boston without violating the Jones Act."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Exemption Allows NCL to Offer Exclusive Domestic Itineraries and Creates an Additional Barrier to U.S.-Flag Entry, but It Could Generate Economic Benefits", "paragraphs": ["The exemption allows NCL to offer exclusive all-domestic itineraries in  Hawaii because no other large U.S.-flag passenger ships currently offer  such service, and no other foreign-built ships can offer all-domestic  itineraries.

In addition, NCL\u2019s exclusive  right to operate foreign-built ships in U.S. domestic trade creates an  additional obstacle for any large cruise lines attempting to compete in the  domestic market under the U.S. flag. NCL is able to complete building the  ships abroad at a lower cost than they could be completed in the United  States, while any would-be entrant into the domestic market would have to  build a ship in the United States and would therefore face a higher capital  cost structure than NCL.

According to a comprehensive cruise  market analysis conducted by the FTC in 2002, a single cruise itinerary  does not constitute a market; rather, competitive conditions should be  assessed in the context of a market that includes all vacation options or,  minimally, all other cruise options. Therefore, although no cruise lines will  compete directly on the domestic itineraries, NCL will continue to face  competition from comparable vacation options, such as land vacations and  similar cruises in different geographic areas. NCL will also compete with  foreign-flag vessels that operate with lower costs on other itineraries that  include Hawaii. Those foreign-flag vessels could offer a lower price than  NCL, which would make any theoretical attempt at a price increase by NCL  unsustainable.", "One of the reasons for FTC\u2019s broad market definition is its finding that  cruise passengers are highly sensitive to price changes. In other words, an  attempt by a cruise line to raise prices above competitive levels likely  results in significantly fewer bookings. NCL anecdotally confirmed this  finding, citing a decline in its bookings following an attempt to raise prices  by about 3 to 4 percent on its 2003 Norwegian Star, 7-day Hawaiian-Fanning  Island itineraries\u2014which had no competition from any other cruise line on  the same itinerary\u2014after showing strong sales during 2002. From the  outset, over a year from sailing dates, sales were slower than in 2002 for the  same cruise, and NCL was forced to reduce its prices to fill the ship,  resulting in approximately 8 percent lower revenue yields by the sailing  date on the 2003 cruises compared with the 2002 cruises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exemption Adds to Existing Barriers for Potential U.S.- Flag Market Entry", "paragraphs": ["NCL has a large capital cost advantage over potential competitors, who  might attempt to build ships entirely in the United States for operation  under the U.S. flag because the exemption permits NCL to complete  construction of its U.S.-flag ships in a foreign shipyard at a lower cost than  a comparable ship built in a U.S. shipyard. Unless they also receive an  exemption from the U.S.-built requirement, cruise lines entering the  domestic market would have to build their ships in U.S. shipyards or  refurbish an existing U.S. built vessel overseas. Such building costs, based  on estimates from Project America, compared with contract costs for  foreign-built ships, would likely be much higher. For example, we  compared the contract cost to construct the first Project America ship with  the total projected cost for NCL\u2019s Pride of America, built from the partially  U.S.-built hull of the first Project America ship now being completed  overseas. The Project America contract cost was between 35 and 54  percent, or $140 to $190 million, higher than total cost projections to  complete the Pride of America in a German shipyard, as shown in figure 3.  The disparity is likely even larger because the actual costs of the Project  America ships were expected to exceed the contract costs. Incorporating  adjustments to the Project America contract costs, the cost differential  ranges from 71 to 95 percent higher, or $284 to $334 million higher.", "Cruise officials and shipbuilders state that U.S. construction costs are  higher than foreign construction costs because U.S. shipyards have not  developed technical capability, a reliable supply chain, and economies of  scale to build cruise ships competitively. According to one shipbuilder we  spoke with, while U.S. shipyards are experienced at building complex  cargo and military vessels, cruise ships require wholly different  construction techniques; and U.S. shipyards have not developed certain  technical capabilities. One official asserted that U.S. shipyards might  become competitive if they partner with foreign shipyards to learn the  latest technology. In addition, officials from the American Shipbuilders  Association acknowledge that, while U.S. shipyards currently have the  ability to build the hull and superstructure of a cruise ship, unlike  European shipbuilders, U.S. shipbuilders do not have established and  reliable supply chains for certain materials and other structures on a  cruiseship, which are critical to efficient and timely completion of  cruiseships. These officials said that they expect that the capital cost  differential would be negligible if the U.S. shipbuilding industry grew and  realized economies of scale; however, such growth seems unlikely given  the current lack of demand for U.S.-built cruise ships and concerns about  technical capabilities and undeveloped supply chains. Moreover, ships  must be built in order for economies of scale to be realized, so the first  ships that would have to be built for any would-be U.S.-flag operation will  likely have higher capital costs than NCL\u2019s vessels.", "While the exemption affords NCL a capital cost advantage over would-be  entrants, acquiring financing for U.S. ship construction may not be any  more difficult because of the exemption. In theory, financiers would be less  willing to provide financing for capital costs to an operator who will  compete in a market with an existing competitor who has a lower capital  cost structure. However, industry financial analysts we spoke with said that  acquiring financing was equally difficult prior to the exemption because of  the presence of competing lower-cost, foreign-flag cruise lines and would  not necessarily be more difficult once NCL begins providing U.S.-flag  service in the Hawaiian Islands. Furthermore, an official from the Office of  Ship Financing within MARAD said that, while theoretically the NCL  presence in the U.S. domestic market could affect decisions about  applications for new vessels, they have not seen and do not expect to see  any impact from the NCL exemption. They said that they receive so few  applications for large cruise ships that they are unable to determine if the  number of applications has declined because of the NCL exemption.  Furthermore, no applications for financing of large cruise ships have been  denied or withdrawn because of the NCL exemption or NCL\u2019s expected  presence in the U.S. domestic market.", "Prior to the NCL exemption, cruises offered by lower cost foreign-flag  vessels already limited the likelihood of cruise lines entering the domestic  market. With the possible exception of Hawaii, the close proximity of  foreign ports-of-call in Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean  allows foreign-flag ships to serve U.S. cruise demand without meeting the  requirements of operating under the U.S. flag and adding significant time or  fuel costs to the voyages. Figure 4 shows examples of cruise itineraries  between U.S. ports that foreign-flag vessels can offer. The availability of  foreign-flag service on U.S. itineraries that include a foreign port-of-call  reduces the likelihood that potential U.S.-flag carriers can offer competitive  prices because U.S.-flag ships have higher capital and operating costs than  foreign-flag ships. In addition to higher ship construction costs discussed  earlier, according to an industry trade organization, wage costs on U.S.-flag  ships could range between 30 and 100 percent higher than wage costs for a  similar foreign-flag ship due to compliance with U.S. labor laws that require  minimum wage, overtime compensation, payment of social security tax,  and protection and indemnity coverage, which do not apply to foreign-flag  vessels. According to NCL officials, wage costs for their U.S.-flag  operations will be 100 to 150 percent higher than wage costs for their  foreign-flag operations. Cruise officials also stated that due to regulations  pertaining to overtime and labor requirements for U.S. seafarers, they  would likely have to hire more U.S. workers at higher wages to serve the  same number of passengers. Finally, U.S.-flag ships are liable for corporate  income taxes, while foreign-flag ships typically incorporate in countries  where their income is tax-exempt, resulting in an additional cost advantage  for foreign vessels. See appendix II for additional information on laws that  apply to U.S.-flag ships."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Economic Benefits May Result from the Exemption", "paragraphs": ["Several economic benefits might be generated as a result of NCL\u2019s  exemption.

According to  MARAD data from July to September of 2003, Carnival and Royal  Caribbean control a combined 86.4 percent of the North American cruise  market, while NCL is the third largest firm with 8.8 percent of the market.   NCL\u2019s ability to offer unique domestic itineraries, primarily in Hawaii,  affords NCL an opportunity to further differentiate itself from its primary  competitors. NCL\u2019s differentiation is important because it provides travel  agents with an incentive to sell NCL\u2019s products. Officials from the American  Society of Travel Agents and cruise lines agree that recommendations by  travel agents play a significant role in determining which cruises customers  choose to buy. While the share of airline and land vacation purchases made  through travel agents has declined in recent years, travel agents still sell  approximately 90 percent of all cruises. If NCL only offered the same  itineraries as Carnival and Royal Caribbean, travel agents may have an  incentive to discontinue sales of NCL products, because travel agents are  paid commissions that often increase with the number of cruises sold on a  particular cruise line. Without travel agents endorsing its products, NCL  could have difficulty competing with Carnival and Royal Caribbean.  However, the unique Hawaiian cruise products that NCL can now offer help  NCL to continue to be the third major firm in the market. If there are only  two major players in a market, there is a much higher probability of the two  firms coordinating higher prices, thus hurting consumers. The recent  acquisition of P&O Princess Cruises by Carnival Corporation resulted in a  reduction from four major competitors to three. The FTC\u2019s decision to not  challenge the merger stated that a reduction from three to two major  competitors would likely be more problematic for consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Potential Effects of the Exemption Include Employment Growth and Tax Revenues", "paragraphs": ["NCL\u2019s operations resulting from the exemption will create jobs on the  exempted ships and where it offers itineraries, and they will likely increase  tax revenue. According to NCL\u2019s analysis of the Hawaiian market, its  expanded operations will generate about 2,400 full-time shipboard jobs and  additional shoreside employment in Hawaii. This estimate seems  reasonable, because NCL must hire at least 800 U.S. employees per ship for  three ships, as well as additional land-based employees. Some of these jobs  might be transfers of jobs from other states to Hawaii and, thus, would not  represent new benefits to the U.S. economy. An NCL consultant estimates  total annual tax revenues from the exemption operations to be $126.5  million, including employee income taxes and social security taxes, airfare  taxes, and customs, immigration and ship passenger taxes. In addition,  NCL\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, NCL America\u2014which will operate the exempted  ships in order to meet the U.S.-ownership requirements needed to register  the vessels under the U.S. flag\u2014will be liable for corporate income taxes  on any profits it earns; and it will be subject to the payment of employer  payroll taxes in Hawaii.", "NCL estimates passenger expenditures will bring an additional $355 million  annually to the regions where NCL operates.

However, as noted above,  industry analysts question NCL\u2019s ability to operate the interisland Hawaiian  cruises profitably. Analysts speculate that these cruises might not be  profitable since they will still have to compete with foreign-flag cruises  with significantly lower operating costs than NCL, though on different  itineraries. Analysts also expressed concern that NCL is deploying too  much capacity for the uncertain Hawaiian market demand. According to  Cruise Lines International Association, Hawaiian cruises generated only  about 3 percent of the business in the North American cruise market in  2002. NCL plans to grow the Hawaiian market by 23 percent each year for  the next 5 years, resulting in Hawaiian destinations comprising 6 percent of  the North American cruise market by 2007. This plan is quite aggressive,  considering that industry trade groups expect the cruise market in general  to grow 10 percent each year. If NCL is not profitable operating the  exempted vessels in the United States, analysts speculate that NCL will  seek government approval to reflag the vessels and operate them in foreign  trades. NCL could continue to serve the Hawaiian market with the  reflagged vessels, if the itinerary included a stop at Fanning Island or  another foreign port. In this case, the exclusive interisland cruise options  for consumers would no longer be offered, jobs for U.S. crew and the  associated tax revenue would be lost, and NCL would not be liable for U.S.  corporate income tax. In addition, if NCL is unable to operate successfully  under the U.S. flag in Hawaii, possibly the most desirable market protected  under the PVSA, there will be further disincentive for any other cruise line  to attempt to operate under the U.S. flag, thus limiting the potential  development of the U.S.-flag cruise vessel fleet."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Unclear if Granting Other Cruise Lines Similar Exemptions Would Lead to Entry by Other Cruise Lines and Resulting Economic Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Granting similar exemption to ease entry into the domestic trade could lead  to additional benefits for ports and port cities, the merchant marine and  consumers; however, it is unclear how many cruise lines would choose to  enter if they were permitted to operate foreign-built ships under the U.S.  flag. For certain unique itineraries, where foreign vessels cannot easily  operate with a nearby foreign port, such as in Hawaii, one-way cruises in  Alaska, or short 3 to 4-day itineraries on the east or west coasts, some  potential exists for U.S.-flag ships to enter the market. However, there are  substantial disincentives to operating under the U.S. flag due to (1)  operating cost differentials between the would-be U.S.-flag entrant and  foreign-flag ships that still offer somewhat similar itineraries, but include a  foreign port, (2) labor conditions and ship requirements, and (3) uncertain  market conditions. Moreover, entry from additional ships exempt from the  U.S.-built requirement could have a negative impact on the U.S.  shipbuilding industry and small U.S.-flag cruise ships, though these impacts  are likely to be minimal if the U.S.-built requirement is waived only for large  cruise ships."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Additional Benefits Could Result from More Entry into the Domestic Markets", "paragraphs": ["Ports and port cities, the merchant marine, and consumers could benefit if  additional exemptions to the U.S.-built requirement led to new entrants  providing U.S.-flag cruise service. Additional domestic cruises could create  more activity for the ports and result in more jobs and increased spending  in port cities. U.S.-flag ships also would employ U.S. seamen, adding to the  base of trained maritime employees who could serve the country in a time  of emergency. Moreover, potential entrants could offer more cruise options  and new itineraries to consumers. For example, a 1997 study conducted for  the California State Tourism Board found that with similar exemptions to  operate foreign-built vessels under the U.S. flag, cruise lines could offer  cruise itineraries on the California coast to smaller ports, such as Santa  Barbara and Monterey, resulting in more tourist dollars in those areas.  However, if new domestic cruises primarily replaced existing foreign-flag  service, with minor itinerary changes caused by eliminating foreign ports- of-call, the benefits to ports, port cities and consumers might be minimal.  On the east coast, for example, Carnival currently offers cruises on a  foreign-flag ship\u2014round-trip from New York including stops in Boston,  Massachusetts; Portland, Maine; and Canada. If U.S.-flag vessels replaced  the foreign-flag vessels offering east coast cruises and had itineraries  running from New York to Portland without the stop in Canada\u2014but  including the same ports-of-call as the former Carnival cruise\u2014ports, port  cities and consumers would experience very little additional benefit from  these cruises.

The wage differential is so great that an official from one  cruise line stated that the cruise line would prefer to employ foreign  workers for any non-U.S. domestic itineraries offered on a U.S.-flag ship.", "The official noted that it would be difficult to hire a separate seasonal U.S.  crew to work on a U.S.-flag ship, which may operate domestic itineraries  only at certain times of the year. U.S.-flag cruise ships also must meet U.S.  building standards, which sometimes conflict with international standards.  For example, an industry official cited different wiring configurations  required on U.S. ships. One cruise line official stated that the cruise line he  represents would not specially build a ship to comply with U.S. standards  only to be able to operate the ship in domestic trade, given the existing  operating cost differentials. Furthermore, cruise officials and industry  analysts question whether U.S.-flag operations can be profitable since  lower cost foreign-flag ships can serve similar itineraries and demand is  unknown for domestic destinations.", "Despite all the expected difficulties and disadvantages, representatives of  two cruise lines said they would explore entry into some domestic markets  if they were given exemption from the U.S.-built requirement. According to  these representatives, they would consider testing the Alaskan and  Hawaiian markets, and short coastal cruises because of their unique  attributes. In Alaska, one-way cruises are popular and currently cannot be  offered from a U.S. port, such as Seattle, due to the PVSA. In Hawaii, the  nearest foreign port adds at least 2 days of sailing time to the itinerary.  Short coastal cruises on the east or west coasts are attractive because  including a foreign port would lengthen the cruise.", "However, even these attractive markets have factors deterring U.S.-flag  operations. Foreign-flag ships currently serve the one-way Alaskan trade  embarking in Vancouver. These operators would still have a competitive  advantage over U.S.-flag operators granted an exemption from the U.S.- built requirement and operating out of Seattle. While consumers might face  an added land transportation cost to depart from Vancouver rather than  Seattle, foreign-flag operators would continue to have a significant  operating cost advantage over U.S.-flag ships and thus might offer lower  prices. The price advantage of the foreign-flag ships is likely to offset the  cost disadvantage to consumers of departing from Vancouver. Moreover,  according to one industry analyst, the Port of Vancouver might respond to  potential competition from the Port of Seattle by lowering its port fees to  retain firms operating less costly foreign-flag ships.", "Hawaii\u2019s long distance from most foreign ports creates an especially  attractive opportunity for entry under the U.S.-flag, but potential  competitors would have to compete with an established operator, NCL, for  unknown demand. In addition to NCL\u2019s ability to offer wholly domestic  cruises in Hawaii with the exemption, it has had an exclusive arrangement  for its ships to stop at Fanning Island, the closest foreign port to Hawaii.  With this exclusive agreement NCL has been able to garner the largest  market share of the Hawaiian trade. NCL intends to run three U.S.-flag  ships and one foreign-flag ship regularly in Hawaiian itineraries. As noted  previously, some industry analysts do not think consumers in the Hawaiian  market can support NCL\u2019s capacity increase; therefore, success might be  difficult for any additional companies entering the market. In fact, one  cruise line we spoke with is uncertain about continued operations, given  the sales performance of its initial entry into the Hawaiian market.", "Finally, while short 3- or 4-day cruises along the east or west coasts of the  United States may hold some attraction for would-be entrants, these  cruises could still face lower cost competition from foreign vessels offering  similar itineraries with a foreign port included.

However, if the exemptions were broader, including small  passenger ships, U.S.-flag operators of small cruise ships might purchase  less expensive ships from foreign shipyards, exposing U.S. shipyards to  foreign competition that is not subject to the same laws, regulations, and  taxes.", "Another potential adverse effect of similar exemptions is the shift of  passengers away from small U.S.-flag cruise lines to domestic cruises on  larger U.S.-flag ships built in foreign shipyards. Small U.S.-flag vessels are  built in the United States and operate under all U.S. laws. A major shift in  their customer base could disrupt this segment of the cruise industry and  negatively affect the shipyards that build these small vessels.
