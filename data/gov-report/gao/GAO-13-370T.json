In its assessment of DHS's progress and challenges 10 years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as its more recent work, GAO reported that DHS had, among other things, developed strategic and operational plans across its range of missions; established new, or expanded existing, offices and programs; and developed and issued policies, procedures, and regulations to govern its homeland security operations. However, GAO also identified that challenges remained for DHS to address across its missions. Examples of progress made and work remaining include the following:", "Aviation security. DHS developed and implemented Secure Flight, a program through which the federal government now prescreens all passengers on all commercial flights to, from, and within the United States. However, DHS did not validate the science supporting its behavior detection program before deploying behavior detection officers at airports, including determining whether such techniques could be successfully used to detect threats.", "Border security/immigration enforcement. DHS reported data indicating it had met its goal to secure the land border because of a decrease in apprehensions, attributed in part to changes in the U.S. economy and achievement of DHS strategic objectives. However, DHS has not developed a process to identify and analyze program risks, such as a process to evaluate prior and suspected cases of fraud, in its Student and Exchange Visitor Program, a program intended to, among other things, ensure that foreign students studying in the United States comply with the terms of their admission into the country.", "Emergency preparedness and response. DHS issued the National Response Framework, which outlines disaster response guiding principles. However, GAO reported that DHS could reduce the costs to the federal government related to major disasters declared by the President by updating the principal indicator on which disaster funding decisions are based and better measuring a state's capacity to respond without federal assistance.", "GAO has identified three key themes--leading and coordinating the homeland security enterprise, implementing and integrating management functions for results, and strategically managing risks and assessing homeland security efforts--that DHS needs to address from a departmentwide perspective to effectively and efficiently position the department for the future. DHS has made progress in all three areas by, among other things, providing leadership and coordination. However, DHS has continued to face challenges in all of these areas. For example, GAO reported that improving research and development could help DHS reduce, among other things, cost overruns and performance shortfalls by reducing inefficiencies and costs for homeland security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["While this testimony contains no new recommendations, GAO has previously made about 1,800 recommendations to DHS designed to strengthen its programs and operations.

However,  DHS did not consistently follow the acquisition management approach  outlined in its management directives in developing and managing the  program. The lack of defined requirements, acquisition strategy, and  associated cost parameters contributed to program deployment  delays of over 2 years.

As these themes have contributed to challenges in  the department\u2019s management and operations, addressing them can  result in increased efficiencies and effectiveness. For example, DHS can  help reduce cost overruns and performance shortfalls by strengthening  the management of its acquisitions, and reduce inefficiencies and costs  for homeland security by improving its research and development (R&D)  management. These themes provide insights that can inform DHS\u2019s  efforts as it works to implement its missions within a dynamic and  evolving homeland security environment.

DHS has made important strides in providing leadership and  coordinating efforts across the homeland security enterprise, but needs to  take additional actions to forge effective partnerships and strengthen the  sharing and utilization of information. For example, DHS has improved  coordination and clarified roles with state and local governments for  emergency management. DHS also strengthened its partnerships and  collaboration with foreign governments to coordinate and standardize  security practices for aviation security. The department has further  demonstrated leadership by establishing a governance board to serve as  the decision-making body for DHS information-sharing issues.

However, we also  reported that the key departments and agencies responsible for  information-sharing activities, including DHS, need to continue their  efforts to share and manage terrorism-related information by, among  other things, identifying technological capabilities and services that can  be shared across departments and developing metrics that measure the  performance of, and results achieved by, projects and activities. DHS  officials explained that its information-sharing initiatives are integral to its  mission activities and are funded through its components\u2019 respective  budgets.

However, DHS has not always effectively executed or  integrated these functions.", "While challenges remain for DHS to address across its range of missions,  the department has made considerable progress in transforming its  original component agencies into a single cabinet-level department and  positioning itself to achieve its full potential. Important strides have also  been made in strengthening the department\u2019s management functions and  in integrating those functions across the department, particularly in recent  years. However, continued progress is needed in order to mitigate the  risks that management weaknesses pose to mission accomplishment and  the efficient and effective use of the department\u2019s resources. In particular,  the department needs to demonstrate continued progress in  implementing and strengthening key management initiatives and  addressing corrective actions and outcomes that GAO identified, and  DHS committed to taking actions address this high-risk area. For  example:", "Acquisition management: Although DHS has made progress in  strengthening its acquisition function, most of the department\u2019s major  acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take  longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than  promised. We identified 42 programs that experienced cost growth,  schedule slips, or both, with 16 of the programs\u2019 costs increasing from  a total of $19.7 billion in 2008 to $52.2 billion in 2011\u2014an aggregate  increase of 166 percent. We reported in September 2012 that DHS  leadership has authorized and continued to invest in major acquisition  programs even though the vast majority of those programs lack  foundational documents demonstrating the knowledge needed to help  manage risks and measure performance. We recommended that  DHS modify acquisition policy to better reflect key program and  portfolio management practices and ensure acquisition programs fully  comply with DHS acquisition policy. DHS concurred with our  recommendations and reported taking actions to address some of  them.", "Information technology management: DHS has defined and begun  to implement a vision for a tiered governance structure intended to  improve information technology (IT) program and portfolio  management, which is generally consistent with best practices.  However, the governance structure covers less than 20 percent  (about 16 of 80) of DHS\u2019s major IT investments and 3 of its 13  portfolios, and the department has not yet finalized the policies and  procedures associated with this structure. In July 2012, we  recommended that DHS finalize the policies and procedures and  continue to implement the structure.

Without sound controls and systems, DHS faces challenges in  obtaining and sustaining audit opinions on its financial statement and  internal controls over financial reporting, as well as ensuring its  financial management systems generate reliable, useful, and timely  information for day-to-day decision making.", "Human capital management: In December 2012, we identified  several factors that have hampered DHS\u2019s strategic workforce  planning efforts and recommended, among other things, that DHS  identify and document additional performance measures to assess  workforce planning efforts. DHS agreed with these  recommendations and stated that it plans to take actions to address  them. In addition, DHS has made efforts to improve employee morale,  such as taking actions to determine the root causes of morale  problems. Despite these efforts, however, federal surveys have  consistently found that DHS employees are less satisfied with their  jobs than the government-wide average.

It is understandable that these threats had to be  addressed immediately as they arose. However, limited strategic and  program planning by DHS, as well as assessment to inform approaches  and investment decisions, has contributed to programs not meeting  strategic needs or not doing so in an efficient manner.", "Further, DHS has made important progress in analyzing risk across  sectors, but it has more work to do in using this information to inform  planning and resource-allocation decisions. Risk management has been  widely supported by Congress and DHS as a management approach for  homeland security, enhancing the department\u2019s ability to make informed  decisions and prioritize resource investments. Since DHS does not have  unlimited resources and cannot protect the nation from every conceivable  threat, it must make risk-informed decisions regarding its homeland  security approaches and strategies. We reported in September 2011 that  using existing risk assessment tools could assist DHS in prioritizing its  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) implementation  mechanisms. For example, examining the extent to which risk  information could be used to help prioritize implementation mechanisms  for the next QHSR could help DHS determine how to incorporate and use  such information to strengthen prioritization and resource allocation  decisions. DHS officials plan to implement a national risk assessment in  advance of the next QHSR, which DHS anticipates conducting in fiscal  year 2013.", "Our work has also found that DHS continues to miss opportunities to  optimize performance across its missions due to a lack of reliable  performance information or assessment of existing information;  evaluation among possible alternatives; and, as appropriate, adjustment  of programs or operations that are not meeting mission needs. For  example, we reported in February 2013 that the government\u2019s strategy  documents related to Information Systems and the Nation\u2019s Cyber Critical  Infrastructure Protection included few milestones or performance  measures, making it difficult to track progress in accomplishing stated  goals and objectives. In addition, in September 2012, we reported that DHS had approved a third generation of BioWatch technology\u2014to further  enhance detection of certain pathogens in the air\u2014without fully evaluating  viable alternatives based on risk, costs, and benefits. As the department  further matures and seeks to optimize its operations, DHS will need to  look beyond immediate requirements; assess programs\u2019 sustainability  across the long term, particularly in light of constrained budgets; and  evaluate trade-offs within and among programs across the homeland  security enterprise.

Since it began operations in 2003, DHS has implemented key  homeland security operations and achieved important goals and  milestones in many areas. DHS has also made important progress in  strengthening partnerships with stakeholders, improving its management  processes and sharing of information, and enhancing its risk  management and performance measurement efforts. Important strides  have also been made in strengthening the department\u2019s management  functions and in integrating those functions across the department,  particularly in recent years. Senior leaders at the department have also  continued to demonstrate strong commitment to addressing the  department\u2019s management challenges across the management functions.  These accomplishments are especially noteworthy given that the  department has had to work to transform itself into a fully functioning  cabinet department while implementing its missions\u2014a difficult  undertaking for any organization and one that can take years to achieve  even under less daunting circumstances.", "Impacting the department\u2019s efforts have been a variety of factors and  events, such as attempted terrorist attacks and natural disasters, as well  as new responsibilities and authorities provided by Congress and the  administration. These events collectively have forced DHS to continually  reassess its priorities and reallocate resources as needed, and have  impacted its continued integration and transformation. Given the nature of  DHS\u2019s mission, the need to remain nimble and adaptable to respond to  evolving threats, as well as to work to anticipate new ones, will not  change and may become even more complex and challenging as  domestic and world events unfold, particularly in light of reduced budgets  and constrained resources. Our work has shown that to better position  itself to address these challenges, DHS should place an increased  emphasis on and take additional action in supporting and leveraging the  homeland security enterprise; managing its operations to achieve needed  results; and strategically planning for the future while assessing and  adjusting, as needed, what exists today. DHS also needs to continue its  efforts to address the associated high-risk areas that we have identified  which have affected its implementation efforts. Addressing these issues  will be critically important for the department to strengthen its homeland  security programs and operations.
