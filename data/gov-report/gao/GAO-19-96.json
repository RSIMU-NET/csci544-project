TSARA contains a report and certification provision pursuant to which TSA is to submit information to Congress 30 days prior to the award of a contract for an SRT acquisition exceeding $30 million. Through July 2018, TSA obligated about $1.4 billion on SRT and associated services. TSA officials explained that none of these obligations\u2014including 7 SRT orders, each in excess of $30 million\u2014invoked the report and certification provision because the obligations did not align with TSA's implementation policy, which provides that the $30 million threshold relates to the contract ceiling of the initial SRT contract and not to individual task and delivery orders. Revising TSA's policy to include contracts for services that enhance the capabilities of SRT, including any orders for SRT and associated services in excess of $30 million, would better ensure that Congress has the information it needs to effectively oversee TSA's SRT acquisitions.", "TSA has not effectively communicated internally its implementation decisions for what constitutes an SRT under TSARA. TSA officials described to GAO that SRT must be equipment that is public facing, but TSA's policy does not clearly state the parameters of what is considered an SRT. Without clear guidance, TSA staff may be unaware of these parameters and how they apply to future acquisitions under TSARA. For example, TSA acquisition program staff were initially unable to confirm for GAO whether the technologies TSA had acquired were SRTs and thus subject to TSARA.

Such technologies are vital to TSA efforts to prevent a terrorist attack on  an aircraft using explosives or other prohibited items. In 2017, TSA was  responsible for the screening of about 2.4 million passengers, 4.4 million  carry-on bags, and 1.2 million checked bags at over 440 TSA-regulated  airports in the United States on an average day.", "In past work, we found that TSA encountered challenges in effectively  acquiring and deploying passenger and checked baggage screening  technologies and had not consistently implemented DHS policy and best  practices for procurement. Additionally, Congress has recognized that  TSA historically faced challenges in meeting key performance  requirements for several major acquisitions and procurements, resulting  in reduced security effectiveness and inefficient expenditures among  other things. Enacted in December 2014, the Transportation Security  Acquisition Reform Act (TSARA) introduced legislative reforms to  promote greater transparency and accountability with respect to TSA\u2019s  acquisitions of security-related technology (SRT).", "Under TSARA, we were directed to submit a report to Congress not later  than 1 year after enactment, and are to submit a subsequent report 3  years thereafter, evaluating TSA\u2019s progress in implementing the act.

Among other things, the memo  designates roles and responsibilities for TSARA\u2019s requirements and  outlines TSA\u2019s approach to implementing each requirement.", "To explain what constitutes an SRT for the purposes of TSARA, TSA  officials described various parameters to us that guide their decision- making. However, not all of these parameters are documented in the  implementation strategy memo. Specifically, the memo states that, \u201cTo  support  and ensure Congress is receiving the necessary  information regarding critical TSA acquisitions, TSA will focus on security  screening related technologies. This ensures the necessary actions are  implemented for those technologies the public directly interacts with (i.e.  is impacted by).\u201d TSA officials clarified for us that technologies the public  does not directly interact with or that do not otherwise impact the public in  some physical manner, such as STIP and Secure Flight, are not  considered SRT and thus not subject to TSARA, but this distinction is not  clearly documented. Further, the memo does not explicitly explain which  technologies are considered SRT and which are not. For example, TSA  officials told us that SRT under TSARA excludes software such as  updates to threat detection algorithms, and other associated services  such as STIP, but this is not documented in the memo.", "TSA acquisition program staff are responsible for determining if a new  acquisition qualifies as SRT under TSARA and initiating TSA\u2019s  congressional notification process. TSA officials stated that program staff  rely upon the TSARA Implementation Strategy Memo to make these  decisions. During our review, TSA\u2019s acquisition program staff were initially  unable to confirm in all instances whether the security-related equipment  they had acquired were subject to TSARA. Over the course of our review,  TSA officials clarified the application of TSARA\u2019s SRT definition to us and  based on our inquiries, confirmed a list of existing technologies that are  considered SRT. However, this information has not been documented in  the TSARA Implementation Strategy Memo. TSA officials explained that  there was a lot of activity after TSARA was initially enacted to determine  how to comply with TSARA, but after the implementation working group  disbanded, activity subsequently faded. Consequently, the  implementation strategy memo has not been updated since its initial  distribution in June 2015. TSA officials stated that they plan to update the  implementation strategy memo by the end of calendar year 2018 to reflect  the new offices responsible for implementing TSARA\u2019s requirements due  to an internal reorganization.", "Effective information and communication are vital for an entity to achieve  its objectives. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that management should document policies in the appropriate level  of detail and internally communicate the necessary quality information to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. In the absence of a policy that clearly  states what constitutes an SRT and with several large acquisitions  pending, TSA may be missing an opportunity to ensure effective and  consistent implementation of TSARA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["TSA spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing,  acquiring, deploying, and maintaining technologies in furtherance of its  mission to ensure civil aviation security. Through TSARA, Congress  sought to address challenges faced by TSA in effectively managing its  acquisitions and procurements by specifying measures for TSA to  implement that align with identified acquisition best practices and  increase the transparency and accountability of TSA\u2019s SRT acquisitions.  Overall, TSA has policies and procedures in place to accomplish many of  the reforms sought by TSARA, but more could be done to improve the  transparency of its spending on SRTs. Specifically, reporting on individual  task and delivery orders as well as associated services under TSARA\u2019s  report and certification provision would help TSA ensure that Congress  has timely information it could use to effectively oversee TSA  acquisitions. TSA took a positive step towards greater transparency on  SRT spending with its first notifications to Congress in August 2018\u2014in  accordance with its policy\u2014, but TSA\u2019s existing policy does not require  similar notification for associated services or for individual task and  delivery orders issued that exceed $30 million.", "Further, while TSA developed the TSARA Implementation Strategy  Memo, which serves as TSA\u2019s policy for implementing TSARA,  designated roles and responsibilities for TSARA\u2019s requirements, and  outlined TSA\u2019s approach to implement each requirement, TSA has not  clearly documented and internally communicated its parameters on what  constitutes an SRT under TSARA. With several large acquisitions  pending, clear guidance would better assure that staff understand how  TSARA\u2019s reporting requirements apply.
