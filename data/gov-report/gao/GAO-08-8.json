For all workers with a current or former DC plan, including rolled-over retirement funds, the total median account balance was $22,800. Among workers aged 55 to 64, the median account balance were $50,000, and those aged 60 to 64 had $60,600. Low-income workers had less opportunity to participate in DC plans than the average worker, and when offered an opportunity to participate in a plan, they were less likely to do so. Modest balances might be expected, given the relatively recent prominence of 401(k) plans. Projections of DC plan savings over a career for workers born in 1990 indicate that DC plans could on average replace about 22 percent of annualized career earnings at retirement for all workers, but projected \"replacement rates\" vary widely across income groups and with changes in assumptions. Projections show almost 37 percent of workers reaching retirement with zero plan savings. Projections also show that workers in the lowest income quartile have projected replacement rates of 10.3 percent on average, with 63 percent of these workers having no plan savings at retirement, while highest-income workers have average replacement rates of 34 percent. Assuming that workers offered a plan always participate raises projected overall savings and reduces the number of workers with zero savings substantially, particularly among lower-income workers. Recent regulatory and legislative changes and proposals could have positive effects on DC plan coverage, participation, and savings, some by facilitating the adoption of automatic enrollment and escalation features. Some options focus on encouraging plan sponsorship, while others would create accounts for people not covered by an employer plan. Our findings indicate that DC plans can provide a meaningful contribution to retirement security for some workers but may not ensure the retirement security of lower-income workers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Employer-sponsored pensions represent an important component of  retirement income. Since the early 1980s, while the percentage of workers  participating in a pension plan has remained around 50 percent of the  private sector work force, pension coverage has seen a noticeable shift  away from \u201ctraditional\u201d defined benefit (DB) plans, in which workers  typically accrue benefits based on years of service and earnings, toward  defined contribution (DC) plans, in which participants accumulate  balances in personal accounts. DC plans provide participants tax-preferred  savings vehicles, portability, and the transparency of known account  balances. However, they shift the responsibility of saving for retirement,  and certain key risks, from employers to employees. Under such plans,  workers often manage the investment of plan assets throughout their lives.  However, workers may receive limited or no contributions from their  employers, spend accumulated savings prior to retirement, or choose not  to participate in a pension plan at all, ultimately arriving at retirement with  insufficient savings to support themselves. Further, retirees usually must  manage their DC plan savings to make them last throughout retirement.  Possible reforms to Social Security to address that program\u2019s long-term  solvency could reduce benefits for future retirees, possibly increasing the  future role of DC plans, as well as other personal savings, in providing  retirement income.", "Based on these concerns, this report addresses the following questions: (1)  What percentage of workers participate in DC plans, and how much have  they saved in them? (2) How much are workers likely to have saved in DC  plans by the time they reach retirement and to what degree do certain key  individual decisions and plan features affect plan saving? (3) What options  have been recently proposed to increase DC plan coverage, participation,  and savings?", "To analyze participation and savings in DC plans, we examined data from  the 2004 version of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Survey of Consumer  Finances (SCF), the latest available SCF, and data published by other  government agencies, by private organizations, and from academic  studies.  To analyze how much Americans can expect to save in DC plans  by the time they retire and the factors that affect these savings, we utilized  a microsimulation model, PENSIM, that simulates demographic, working,  and pension patterns for a constructed sample over their lives. (See  appendix I for further details of our projections using PENSIM.) We also  reviewed similar studies to compare their methodologies and conclusions  (see app. II). To analyze policy options to increase DC plan coverage,  participation, and savings, we synthesized information gathered from  interviews of plan practitioners, financial managers, and public policy  experts, as well as from academic and policy studies on DC plan  participation and savings. We also researched current government  initiatives and policy proposals to broaden participation in account-based  pension plans and increase retirement savings. We conducted our work  from July 2006 to October 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Employer-sponsored pensions fall into two major categories: defined  benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) plans. In DB, or traditional,  plans, benefits are typically set by formula, with workers receiving  benefits upon retirement based on the number of years worked for a firm  and earnings in years prior to retirement. In DC plans, workers  accumulate savings through contributions to an individual account. These  accounts are tax-advantaged in that contributions are typically excluded  from current income, and earnings on balances grow tax-deferred until  they are withdrawn. An employer may also make contributions, either by  matching employee\u2019s contributions up to plan or legal limits, or on a non- contingent basis.", "Like DB plans, DC plans operate in a voluntary system with tax incentives  for employers to offer a plan and for employees to participate.  Contributions to and earnings on DC plan accounts are not taxed until the  participant withdraws the money, although participants making  withdrawals prior to age 59 \u00bd may incur an additional 10 percent tax. In  2006, the pension tax expenditure for DC plans amounted to $54 billion. In  addition, a nonrefundable tax credit to qualifying low-and middle-income  workers who make contributions, the saver\u2019s credit, accounted for less  than 2 percent of the 2006 tax expenditure on account-based retirement  plans.", "DC plans offer workers more control over their retirement asset  management, but also shift some of the responsibility and certain risks  onto workers. Workers generally must elect to participate in a plan and  make regular contributions into their plans over their careers. Participants  typically choose how to invest plan assets from a range of options  provided under their plan, and accordingly face investment risk. Savings  in DC plans are portable in the sense that a participant may keep plan  balances in a tax-protected account upon leaving a job, either by rolling  over plan balances into a new plan or an IRA, or in some cases leaving  money in an old plan. Workers may have access to plan savings prior to  retirement, either through loans or withdrawals; participants may find  such features desirable, but pre-retirement access may also lead to lower  retirement savings (sometimes referred to as leakage) and possible tax  penalties. Workers who receive DC distributions in lump-sum form must  manage account withdrawals such that their savings last throughout  retirement. In contrast, a formula, often based on preretirement average  pay and years of service, determines DB plan benefits, and workers are  usually automatically enrolled in a plan. The employer has the  responsibility to ensure that the plan has sufficient funding to pay  promised benefits, although the sponsor can choose to terminate the  plan. DB plans also typically offer the option to take benefits as a lifetime  annuity, or periodic benefits until death. An annuity provides longevity  insurance against outliving one\u2019s savings, but may lose purchasing power  if benefits do not rise with inflation. Table 1 summarizes some of the  primary differences between DC and DB plans.", "Over the past 25 years, DC plans have become the dominant type of  private sector employee pension. In 1980, private DB plans had 38 million  participants, while DC plans had 20 million. As of 2004, 64.6 million  participants had DC plans, while 41.7 million had DB plans. Further, over  80 percent of private sector DC participants in 2004 were active  participants (in a plan with their current employer), while about half of DB  participants had separated from their sponsoring employer or retired.  According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), while  overall pension coverage among families remained around 40 percent  between 1992 and 2001, 38 percent of families with a pension relied  exclusively on a DC plan for retirement coverage in 1992, while 62 percent  had a DB plan. In 2001, 58 percent of pension-participating families had  only a DC plan, while 42 percent had a DB plan. Assets in all DB plans  exceeded total DC assets as recently as 1995. As of 2006, DC plans had  almost $3.3 trillion in assets while DB plans had almost $2.3 trillion. In  addition, assets in IRAs, accounts that are also tax protected and include  assets from rolled-over balances from employer-sponsored plans,  measured over $4.2 trillion in 2006.", "There are several different categories of DC plans. Most of these plans are  types of cash or deferred arrangements (CODA), in which employees can  direct pre-tax dollars, along with any employer contributions, into an  account, with assets growing tax deferred until withdrawal. The 401(k)  plan is the most common, covering over 85 percent of active DC  participants.  Certain types of tax-exempt employers may offer plans, such  as 403(b) or 457 plans, which have many features similar to 401(k) plans.  Many employers match employee contributions, generally based on a  specified percentage of the employee\u2019s salary and the rate at which the  participant contributes. Small business owners may offer employees a  Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers  (SIMPLE) or a Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP), two types of DC  plans that have reduced regulatory requirements for sponsors. Other types  of DC plans keep the basic individual account structure of the 401(k), but  with different requirements and employer practices. Some are designed  primarily for employer contributions. These include money purchase  plans, which specify fixed annual employer contributions; profit sharing  plans, in which the employer decides annual contributions, perhaps based  on profits, into the plan, and allocations of these to each participant; and  employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), in which contributions are  primarily invested in company stock.", "Building up retirement savings in DC plans rests on factors that are, to  some degree, outside of the control of the individual worker, as well as  behaviors an individual does control (see fig. 1). Factors outside the  individual\u2019s direct control include the following:    Plan sponsorship\u2014the employer\u2019s decision to sponsor a plan, as well  as participation eligibility rules.", "Employer contributions\u2014whether the sponsor makes matching or  noncontingent contributions.", "Investment options\u2014the plan sponsor\u2019s decisions about investment  options to offer to participants under the plan.", "Market returns on plan assets\u2014market performance of plan assets.", "Key individual decisions and behaviors that may affect retirement savings  include the following:    Employee contributions\u2014deposits into the plan account, typically  out of current wages.", "Investment decisions\u2014how to invest plan assets given investment  options offered under the plan.  balances, which usually incur a tax penalty. Similarly, taking out a loan  from a plan, if allowed, may reduce future balances if the loan is not  repaid in full and treated as a withdrawal, or by lowering investment  returns.", "Rollover\u2014upon separation from a job, a participant may transfer the  plan account balance to an IRA, which maintains most of the same tax  preferences on the balances, move it to a new tax-qualified plan, or  leave the money in the old plan. Alternatively, any cash withdrawal  would likely be subject to income tax and penalties.", "Age at retirement\u2014the decision as to when to retire determines how  many years the worker has to accumulate plan balances and how long  the money has to last in retirement.", "There is little consensus about how much constitutes \u201cenough\u201d savings to  have going into retirement. We may define retirement income adequacy  relative to a standard of minimum needs, such as the poverty rate, or to  the consumption spending that households experienced during working  years. Some economists and financial advisors consider retirement  income adequate if the ratio of retirement income to pre-retirement  income\u2014or replacement rate\u2014is between 65 and 85 percent. Retirees may  not need 100 percent of pre-retirement income to maintain living  standards for several reasons. Retirees will no longer need to save for  retirement, retirees\u2019 payroll and income tax liability will likely fall, work  expenses will no longer be required, and mortgages and children\u2019s  education and other costs may have been paid off. However, some  researchers cite uncertainties about future health care costs and future  Social Security benefit levels as reasons to suggest that a higher  replacement rate, perhaps above 100 percent or higher, would be  considered adequate.", "To achieve adequate replacement rate levels, retirees depend on different  sources of income to support themselves in retirement. Social Security  benefits provide the bulk of retirement benefits for most households. As of  2004, annuitized pension benefits provided almost 20 percent of total  income to households with someone age 65 or older, while Social Security  benefits provided 39 percent. Social Security benefits compose over 50  percent of total income for two-thirds of households with someone age 65  or older, and at least 90 percent of income for one-third of such  households. Table 2 shows estimated replacement rates from Social  Security benefits for low and high earners retiring in 2007 and 2055, as  well as the remaining amount of pre-retirement income necessary to  achieve a 75 percent replacement rate. These figures give rough  guidelines for how much retirement income workers might need from  other sources, such as employer-sponsored pensions, as well as earnings  and income from other savings or assets.", "It is important to keep certain economic principles in mind when  evaluating the effectiveness of retirement accounts, or any pensions, in  providing retirement income security. First, balances accumulated in a DC  plan may not represent new saving; individuals may have saved in another  type of account in the absence of a DC plan or its tax preferences. Second,  evaluating worker income security should consider total compensation,  not just employer contributions to DC plans. All else equal, we should  generally expect more generous employer-sponsored pension benefits to  lower cash wages and that the split between current wages and deferred  compensation is largely a reflection of labor market conditions, tax  provisions, and worker and employer preferences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Workers Have No Plan Coverage, and Most DC Plan Participants Currently Have Modest Account Balances", "paragraphs": ["Many workers do not have DC plans, and median savings levels among  participants show modest balances.

Only 36 percent of working individuals were actively participating in  a DC plan, according to data from the 2004 SCF. Further, workers aged  55 to 64 had median balances totaling $50,000 in account-based retirement  savings vehicles, including DC plans and rollover accounts. Leakage,  when workers withdraw DC savings before retirement age, can also  reduce balances; almost half of those taking lump-sum distributions upon  leaving a job reported cashing out their balances for non-retirement  purposes.

Only 36 percent of working  individuals participated in a DC plan with their current employer   (see fig. 2). Data indicated similar participation rates for working  households, as 42 percent of households had at least one member with a  current DC plan.", "For many workers who participated in a plan, overall balances in DC plans  were modest, suggesting a potentially small contribution toward  retirement security for most plan participants and their households.  However, since DC plans were less common before the 1980s, older  workers would not have had access to these plans their whole careers. In  order to approximate lifetime DC balances when discussing mean and  median DC balances in this report, our analysis of the 2004 SCF aggregates  the \u201ctotal balances\u201d of DC plans with a current employer, DC plans with  former employers that have been left with the former employer, and any  retirement plans with former employers that have been rolled over into a  new plan or an IRA. Workers with a \u201ccurrent or former DC plan\u201d refers to  current workers with one or more of those three components. For all  workers with a current or former DC plan, the median total balance was  $22,800. For all households with a current or former DC plan, the median  total balance was $27,940 (see fig. 3).", "For individuals nearing retirement age, total DC plan balances are still low.  Given trends in coverage since the 1980\u2019s, older workers close to  retirement age are more likely than younger ones to have accrued  retirement benefits in a DB plan. However, older workers who will rely on  DC plans for retirement income may not have time to substantially  increase their total savings without extending their working careers,  perhaps for several years. Among all workers aged 55 to 64 with a current  or former DC plan, the median balance according to the 2004 SCF was  $50,000, which would provide an income of about $4,400 a year, replacing  about 9 percent of income for the average worker in this group. Among  all workers aged 60 to 64 with a current or former DC plan, the median  balance was $60,600 for their accounts. Markedly higher values for mean  balances versus median balances in figure 3 illustrate that some  individuals in every age group are successfully saving far more than the  typical individual, increasing the mean savings. These are primarily  individuals at the highest levels of income.", "Leakage, or cashing out accumulated retirement savings for non- retirement purposes, adversely affects account accumulation for some of  those with accounts, particularly for lower-income workers with small  account balances. Participants who withdraw money from a DC plan  before age 59 \u00bd generally pay ordinary income taxes on the distributions,  plus an additional 10 percent tax in most circumstances. Participants may  roll their DC plan balances into another tax-preferred account when they  leave a job, and employers are required, in the absence of participant  direction, to automatically roll DC account distributions greater than  $1,000 but not greater than $5,000 into an IRA, or to leave the money in the  plan. As of 2004, 21 percent of households in which the head of household  was under 59, had ever received lump-sum distributions from previous  jobs\u2019 retirement plans. Among these households that received lump-sum  distributions, 47 percent had cashed out all the funds, 4 percent cashed  out some of the funds, and 50 percent preserved all the funds by rolling  them over into another retirement account. Workers were more likely to  roll over funds when the balances are greater. Among households that had  cashed out all retirement plans with former employers, the median total  value of those funds was $6,800. For households that had rolled over all  retirement plans with former employers, the median total value of rolled- over funds was $24,200.", "Some evidence suggests that pre-retirement withdrawals may be  decreasing. One study finds that those receiving lump-sum distributions  are more likely to preserve funds in tax-qualified accounts than they were  in the past. For example, data show that in 1993, 19 percent of lump-sum  distributions recipients preserved all of their savings by rolling them into a  tax-qualified account, compared to 43 percent in 2003. Further, 23 percent  used all of their distribution for consumption in 1993, declining to 15  percent in 2003 (see fig. 4). According to the same study, age and size of  the distribution are major determinants of whether or not the distribution  is preserved in a tax-qualified account. For example, the authors found  55.5 percent of recipients aged 51 to 60 rolled their entire distribution in a  tax-qualified account compared with 32.7 percent of recipients 21 to 30.  Additionally, 19.9 percent of distributions from $1 to $499 were rolled over  in tax-qualified accounts, as opposed to 68.1 percent of distributions of  $50,000 or more.", "Additionally, some participants take loans from their DC plan, which may  reduce plan savings. One survey found that in 2005, 85.2 percent of  employers surveyed offered a loan option. Most eligible participants do  not take loans, and one analysis finds that at the year end 2006, loans  amounted to 12 percent of account balances for those who had loans.  Individuals may prefer to take out pension loans in lieu of other lines of  credit because pension loans require no approval and have low or no  transaction costs. Borrowers also pay the loan principal and interest back  to their own accounts. However, someone borrowing from a DC plan may  still lose money if the interest on the loan paid back to the account is less  than the account balance would have earned if the loan had not been  taken. Further, loans not paid back in time, or not paid back before the  employee leaves the job, may be subject to early withdrawal penalties. No  data have been reported on the rate of loan defaults, but it is expected to  be much lower where repayments are made by payroll withholding.  However, a loan feature may also have a positive effect on participation, as  some workers may choose to participate who otherwise might not,  precisely because they can borrow from their accounts for non-retirement  purposes at relatively low interest rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low-Income Workers Have Particularly Low DC Plan Coverage and Plan Balances", "paragraphs": ["Among workers in the lowest income quartile, only 8 percent participated  in a current DC plan, a result of markedly lower access as well as lower  participation than the average worker (see fig. 5).

Projected  savings allow us to analyze how much workers might save over a full  working career under a variety of conditions in a way that analyzing  current plan balances cannot, since DC plans have become primary  employer-sponsored plans only relatively recently.

The projections  assume that all workers fully annuitize all accumulated DC plans balances  at retirement, which occurs sometime between age 62 and 70. Participants  are assumed to always invest all plan assets in life cycle funds, and stocks  earn an average real annual return of 6.4 percent.

Almost 37 percent of workers in this cohort have no  projected DC plan savings at retirement, which brings down overall  average replacement rates. Workers in the lowest income quartile  accumulate DC plan savings equivalent to an annuity of about $1,850 per  year, or a 10.3 percent replacement rate, and 63 percent of this group have  no plan savings by the time they retire. In contrast, highest income quartile  workers save enough to receive about $50,000 per year in annuity income,  enough for a 33.8 percent replacement rate. Even in this highest-income  group, over 16 percent of workers have zero plan savings at retirement.  In  all cases, our replacement rates include projected savings only in DC  plans.  Retirees may also receive benefits from DB plans, as well as from  Social Security, which typically replaces a higher percentage of earnings  for lower-income workers.", "Projected household-level plan savings show a higher average replacement  rate of 33.8 percent, with about 29 percent of households having no plan  savings at retirement.

However, we  still see a significant portion of the workers with no DC savings at  retirement. First, we limit the sample only to those workers who are  eligible to participate in a plan for at least 15 years over their careers.

This change in projected  savings suggests that automatically enrolling new employees in plans as a  default could have a significant positive impact on DC balances, especially  for low-income workers whose jobs offer a plan, although this stylized  scenario likely describes a more extreme change in eligibility and  participation than plans are likely to implement under automatic  enrollment, and that higher participation and savings would raise  employer\u2019s pension costs, perhaps leading to a reduction in benefits or  coverage.", "Another stylized scenario we model assumes that all workers who have a  DC plan balance always keep the money in a tax-preferred account upon  leaving a job, either by keeping the money in the plan, transferring it to a  new employer plan, or rolling it into an IRA, rather than cashing out any  accumulated savings. Eliminating this source of leakage raises average  annuity income from DC plans by almost 11 percent and average  replacement rates from 22.2 percent in the baseline to 25.6 percent; it also  reduces the percentage of the cohort with no DC savings at retirement by  over 25 percent. As with the instant participation scenario, \u201cuniversal  rollover\u201d raises annuity savings and reduces the number of retirees with  zero plan savings by the biggest percentages among lower-income  workers, suggesting that cashing out accumulate plan savings prior to  retirement may be a more significant drain on retirement savings for these  groups.

Higher annual maximum  contributions affect projected savings almost exclusively among the  highest-income group, indicating that few workers earning less are likely  to contribute at existing maximum levels. The highest income quartile  replacement rises from 33.8 to 38.5 percent, while replacement rates  hardly change in the lower income groups. Similarly, this scenario has  almost no impact on the percentage of workers with DC plan savings at  retirement.", "Finally, we model retirement savings in two scenarios in which workers  delay retirement by 1 or 3 years. Encouraging workers to retire later has  been suggested as a key element in improving retirement income security,  by increasing earnings, allowing more time to save for retirement, and  reducing the length of retirement. In our projections, delaying retirement  not only provides more years to contribute to and earn returns on plan  balances but also might raise annual retirement income because older  retirees receive more annuity income for any given level of savings,  holding all else equal. In our projections, working longer modestly raises  retirement savings in our projections. Working one extra year changes  projected annuity income by 5.8 percent, but has little effect on the  percentage of people with no DC savings in our projections. Delaying  retirement by 3 years raises annuity income from DC plans by 20.9 percent  on average, with replacement rates rising from 22.2 percent in the baseline  to 25.7 percent overall. The 3-year delay increases annuity levels  somewhat evenly across income groups, with higher-income workers  showing slightly higher increases. Overall, working an extra 3 years raises  average replacement rates about as much as universal account rollover  would, but with little reduction in workers with no retirement savings.  Thus, while working longer would likely raise workers\u2019 incomes, and in  most cases retirement benefits from other sources such as Social Security,  our projections show that this change alone would have a modest impact  on retirement income from DC plans, particularly regarding lower-income  workers and those not already saving in DC plans in the baseline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes and Proposals Could Have Positive Effects on DC Plan Coverage, Participation, and Savings", "paragraphs": ["Recent regulatory and legislative changes and proposals could have  positive effects on DC plan coverage, participation, and saving.

To reverse the effects of these tendencies, some experts have suggested  changing default plan actions to automatically sign up employees for  participation, escalate contributions, and set default investment options  unless workers opt out. Some studies have shown that automatic  enrollment may increase DC plan participation. For example, one study of  a large firm, automatic enrollment increased participation from 57 percent  for employees eligible to participate 1 year before the firm adopted  automatic enrollment to 86 percent for those hired under automatic  enrollment. Another study finds that, prior to automatic enrollment, 26 to  43 percent of employees at 6 months\u2019 tenure participated in the plan at  three different companies; under automatic enrollment 86 to 96 percent of  employees participated. Some also advocate automatically rolling over  DC savings into an IRA when employees separate from their employers to  further increase retirement savings.

Accordingly, the percentage of 401(k) plans using  automatic plan features has increased in recent years. One annual study of  plan sponsors found that in 2004, 12.4 percent of 401(k) plans were  automatically enrolling participants, and this number increased to 17.5  percent of plans in 2005. The percentage of plans automatically  increasing employee contributions also rose from 6.8 percent in 2004 to  13.6 percent in 2005.

Auto enrollment may not help expand plan sponsorship; in  fact, sponsors who offer a matching contribution may not want to offer  automatic enrollment if they believe this will raise their pension costs.  Also, if sponsors automatically invest contributions in a low-risk fund such  as a money market fund, this could limit rates of return on balances.  However, choosing a risky investment fund could subject automatic  contributions to market losses.

To maximize  participation, employees would be automatically enrolled at 3 percent of  pay, or could elect to opt out or to defer a different percentage of pay to an  IRA, up to the maximum IRA annual contribution limit ($4,000 for 2007;  $5,000 for 2008). Employers would not be required choose investments or  set up the IRAs, which would be provided mainly by the private-sector IRA  trustees and custodians that currently provide them.  Employers also  would not be required or permitted to make matching contributions, and  would not need to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974 (ERISA) or any qualified plan standards such as non- discrimination requirements.  Employers, however, would be required to  provide notice to employees, including information on the maximum  amount that can be contributed to the plan on an annual basis.  One  congressional proposal would require employers, other than small or new  ones, to offer payroll deposit IRA arrangements to employees not eligible  for pension plans and permit automatic enrollment in such IRAs in many  circumstances.

Additionally, some proposals would have employers contribute to the  account, whereas other proposals would also have the federal government  match contributions. One proposal suggests a 2 percent annual  contribution from the federal government regardless of individual  contributions, while another would provide for individual contributions  only, capped at $7,500 per year. In 1999, the Clinton Administration  proposed a UA to be established for each worker and spouse with  earnings of at least $5,000 annually. Individuals would receive a tax credit  of up to $300 annually. Additionally, workers could voluntarily contribute  to the account up to specified amounts with a 50 to 100 percent match by  the federal government. This match would come in the form of a tax  credit, and total voluntary contributions, including government  contributions, would be limited to $1,000.

However, according to one analysis, because the credit is nonrefundable,  only about 17 percent of those with incomes low enough to qualify for the  credit would receive any benefit if they contributed to a plan. Some  analysts think that expanding the saver\u2019s credit, or creating direct  transfers such as tax rebates or deposits into retirement savings accounts,  could increase plan contributions specifically for low- and middle-income  workers. Making the saver\u2019s credit refundable to the participant could  also provide a direct transfer to the tax filer in lieu of a retirement account  match, but offers no assurance that funds would be saved or deposited  into a retirement account.

Achieving retirement security  through DC plans carries particular challenges for workers, since  accumulating benefits in an account-based plan requires more active  commitment and management from individuals than it does for DB   participants. Since workers must typically sign up and voluntarily reduce  their take home pay to contribute to their DC plans, invest this money  wisely over their working years, and resist withdrawing from balances  prior to retirement, it is perhaps to be expected that even those who have  the opportunity to participate save little. While our results on both current  and projected plan balances suggest that while some workers save  significant amounts toward their retirement in DC plans, a large  proportion of workers will likely not save enough in DC plans for a secure  retirement.", "Of particular concern are the retirement income challenges faced by lower  earners. Many of these workers face competing income demands for basic  necessities that may make contributions to their retirement plans difficult.  Further, the tax preferences that may entice higher-income workers to  contribute to their DC plans may not entice low-income workers who have  plan coverage, since these workers face relatively low marginal tax rates.

The 78,045 people  in the sample who have some earnings, do not immigrate into the cohort  after age 25, live to age 55, and retire (or become disabled at age 45 or  older), work a median 29.4 years full-time and 2.1 part-time, with median  \u201csteady\u201d earnings of $46,122 (in 2007 dollars). Those whose earnings fall  in the lowest quartile work full-time for only a median 14.1 years, while  working part-time for 9.1 years, and 13.4 years for their longest-tenured  job; this group\u2019s median annual steady earnings measure $16,820. In  contrast, those in the highest-quartile of earnings work for a median 34.8  years, including 19.5 years for their longest job, and have median steady  earnings of $126,380 per year. The results also show that pension coverage  varies somewhat across income groups. About 83 percent of workers in  the lowest income quartile have at least one job in which they are covered  by a DC plan throughout their working careers, and are eligible for DC  plan coverage for a median 9.4 years. In contrast, at least 90 percent of  workers in the highest three income quartiles have some DC coverage  during their careers. Those in the highest income quartile are eligible for  DC participation for a median 25.2 years throughout their career.", "Cross-sectional results of the sample cohort also provide some insights  into the model\u2019s assumptions, as well as some further insights into the  relatively low projected sample replacement rates (see table 10). These  statistics describe the working characteristics for each employed  individual at a randomly determined age sometime between 22 and 62 in  order to provide a snapshot of a \u201ccurrent\u201d job for most of the sample.", "Among those employed at the time of the survey, 61.8 percent had an  employer who sponsors a DC plan. Of these workers with a plan offered,  94 percent were eligible to participate, and among those eligible 67  percent participated. Taking all of these percentages together, this means  that at any one time only 38.9 percent of the working population actively  participated in a DC plan in our projections. Even among these  participants, only 56.9 percent reported making a contribution to the plan  in the previous year, while 45.7 percent had an employer contribution.  Median combined employer-employee contributions in the previous year  were 6.2 percent of earnings in our simulation."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comparison of DC Plan Projections Based on PENSIM to Other Studies", "paragraphs": ["Other studies have projected DC plan savings for workers saving over  their entire working careers. These studies generally find higher projected  replacement rates from DC plan savings than our simulations do.  However, each study makes different key assumptions, particularly about  plan coverage, participation, and contributions.", "A 2007 study by Patrick Purcell and Debra B. Whitman for the  Congressional Research Service (CRS) simulates DC plan replacement  rates based on earnings, contributions, and the rate of return on plan  balances. CRS projects savings for households that begin saving at age 25,  35, or 45. The study estimates 2004 earnings using the March 2005 CPS as  starting wages, and assumes that households experience an annual wage  growth rate of 1.1 percent. Households are randomly assigned a 6 percent,  8 percent, or 10 percent retirement plan contribution rate every year from  their starting age until age 65. The study assumes households allocate 65  percent of their retirement account assets to Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index  of stocks from ages 25 to 34, 60 percent to stocks from ages 35 to 44, 55  percent to stocks from ages 45 to 54, and 50 percent to stocks from age 55  and above, with the remaining portfolio assets invested in AAA-rated  corporate bonds. A Monte Carlo simulation based on historical returns on  stocks and bonds determines annual rates of return. Replacement rates  represent annuitized DC plan balances at age 65 divided by final 5-year  average pay.", "After running the simulations, CRS finds variation in replacement rates  depending on rate of return, years of saving, and earning percentile. In the  CRS \u201cmiddle estimate,\u201d the unmarried householder that saves for 30 years,  has annual household earnings in the 50th percentile, contributes 8  percent each year until retirement, and earns returns on contributions in  the 50th percentile would have a 50 percent replacement rate (see table  11). The projected replacement rate jumps to 98 percent at 40 years of  saving, and 22 percent at just 20 years of saving. Assuming a 6 percent  annual contribution reduces projected replacement rates by about 10 to 30  percent. For example, an unmarried householder at the 50th percentile of  annual earnings and the 50th percentile of returns saving for 40 years is  projected to have a replacement rate of 72 percent at a 6 percent annual  contribution (see table 12). All CRS estimates, however, exceed those we  report in projections in this report, in part because CRS assumes constant  participation in, and contributions to, a DC plan. In addition, CRS  calculated annuity equivalents of accumulated DC balances based on  current annuity prices; for younger workers retiring several decades into  the future, we would expect the price of a given level of annuity income to  be higher than today\u2019s levels because of longer life expectancies. This  would lower the replacement rates for any projected lump sum.", "A 2005 study, by Sarah Holden of ICI and Jack VanDerhei of EBRI,  simulates, as a baseline scenario, retirement savings at age 65 for a group  in their 20s and 30s in the year 2000. The baseline assumes workers are  continuously covered by a DC plan throughout their career, and that  workers will continuously participate. However, the authors also run the  model assuming this group will have participation rates similar to current  rates by allowing workers to not be covered by, participate in, or  contribute to a DC plan. Their model also incorporates the possibility that  a participant might cash out a DC plan balance upon leaving a job.  Replacement rates are calculated by earnings quartile for participants  retiring between 2035 and 2039 as the annuity value of age-65 plan  balances divided by final 5-year average pay.", "The EBRI/ICI baseline projections, starting with a sample of plan  participants, show a median replacement rate of 51 percent for the lowest  earnings quartile and 67 percent for the highest. (See table 13). The  authors analyze the effect of other plan or behavioral assumptions. For  example, replacement rates fall significantly when the projections relax  the assumption of continuous ongoing eligibility for a 401(k) plan,  although they remain higher than our projections, perhaps because the  projections start with current participants and assume continuous  employment.  When the authors include nonparticipants and assume  automatic enrollment with a 6 percent employee contribution and  investment of assets in a life cycle fund, replacement rates rise  significantly from projections without automatic enrollment.  Although  they project a larger effect on replacement rates resulting from automatic  enrollment than our projections show, EBRI/ICI similarly shows a greater  increase in savings for lower-income workers.", "A forthcoming study by Poterba, Venti, and Wise uses the Survey of  Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to project DC plan balances at  age 65. In order to project participation, the authors assume that DC plan  sponsorship will continue to grow, although more slowly than during  recent decades. They calculate participation by earnings deciles within 5- year age intervals. The authors assume that 60 percent of plan  contributions are allocated to large capitalization equities, and 40 percent  to corporate bonds, and assume an average nominal rate of return of 12  percent for equities and 6 percent for corporate bonds. In addition, the  authors run a projection assuming the rate of return on equities is 300  basis points less than the historical rate. They determine a person\u2019s  likelihood of DC plan participation based on age, cohort, and earnings, as  well as the probability of cashing out an existing DC plan balance when  someone leaves a job. The authors simulate earnings histories based on  data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and impute earnings for  younger cohorts for which data are not available. They assume an annual  combined employee-employer contribution rate of 10 percent for each  year an individual participates, and do not account for increases in annual  contributions or changes made to DC plans in the Pension Protection Act,  such as a possible increase in participation by automatically enrolling  employees.", "The authors find retirement savings for individuals retiring by decade  between 2000 and 2040 by lifetime earning deciles. For workers in the fifth  earnings decile retiring in 2030 at age 65, the authors project a mean DC  plan balance of $272,135 in 2000 dollars, and $895,179 for the highest  earning decile (see table 14). Earners in the lowest and second deciles,  however, project average balances of $1,372, and $21,917. The projected  average DC plan assets for 2030 retirees fall to $179,540 for the fifth decile  of earnings, $614,789 for the highest decile, and $810 for the lowest decile  when the authors assume an annual rate of return 300 basis points below  the historic rate of return (see table 15).", "Finally, a 2007 study by William Even and David Macpherson estimates  replacement rate for those continuously enrolled in a DC plan between 36  and 65 years of age. The authors simulate a sample using the SCF, and  generate an age earnings profile for their sample using data on pension- covered workers in the 1989 SCF. The authors also use the SCF to  generate annual contributions to DC plans, which are estimated using a  person\u2019s earnings, age, education, gender, race, ethnicity, martial status,  union coverage, and firm size. The authors also create an artificial sample  for workers who are predicted to be eligible for a DC plan, but choose not  to participate. Finally, the authors assume three different rates of return  on pension contributions: a 3 percent rate of return based on historical  returns on government bonds; a historic returns portfolio based on an  account mix of 75 percent in stocks split between large and small capital  equities, and 25 percent split between long term corporate bonds, long- term government bonds, midterm government bonds, and Treasury bills; a  6.5 percent real rate of returns based on the average real rate of return on  DC plans from 1985 to 1994 for plans with over 100 participants. In  calculating annuity rates, the authors rely on mortality tables for group  annuitants as opposed to the population as a whole, and do not include the  charge the company makes for marketing and administrative expenses.", "The authors find that replacement rates vary by income distribution. For  example, low-income workers who are continuously enrolled in a DC plan  at the median replacement rate distribution are estimated to have a 30  percent replacement rate. (see table 16) The average replacement rate for  such workers is 44 percent. Middle-income and high-income workers have  median replacement rates 31 percent and 35 percent respectively.
