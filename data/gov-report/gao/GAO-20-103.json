GAO's past work has found that one of the important factors contributing to the tax gap is the extent to which information is reported to IRS by third parties. Without third-party reporting, IRS will have to rely on resource-intensive audits to enforce certain TCJA provisions, which could be challenging given recent trends of declining audit rates and enforcement staff. GAO has recommendations from March 2019 for IRS to take actions to mitigate hiring risks and reduce skill gaps.", "IRS was also unable to update all information technology systems prior to the start of the 2019 tax season due to the magnitude of TCJA changes. As a result, IRS was not able to capture certain tax return information in a format that can be easily analyzed to help with compliance planning activities.

The law created  119 provisions that modified, added, or repealed sections of the U. S. tax  code, 86 of which relate to business and international taxes. Among its  many provisions, the law reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35  percent to 21 percent, created potential tax benefits for taxpayers  invested in designated qualified opportunity funds, and significantly  changed the international tax regime.", "Given the magnitude of the changes in TCJA, IRS determined that it  would take significant effort to implement the law and ensure that  taxpayers have the necessary guidance to fulfill their obligations. While  IRS has to make changes to its products every year, many of the  changes needed to implement TCJA were time sensitive and extensive.  IRS determined it would need to revise or create nearly 500 tax forms,  instructions, and publications to help taxpayers meet their new tax filing  obligations. Also related to TCJA implementation, IRS officials said they  would need to reprogram information technology (IT) software systems,  hire more than 1,000 new employees, and train the IRS workforce.", "You asked us to review IRS\u2019s implementation of the business and  international provisions of TCJA.

Although there are some guidelines  in the IRM for intra-agency coordination, IRS has not identified instances  when this enhanced collaboration would benefit guidance development or  taken steps to document these parameters to assure consistency and  accountability.", "Based on our analysis, we found that IRS officials leveraged several key  practices for implementing collaborative mechanisms to support TCJA  implementation, including identifying leadership roles and responsibilities,  identifying relevant participants, and using resources to facilitate  collaboration, which we identified in prior work. For instance, IRS  formed TRIO to manage TCJA implementation and centralize  accountability and decision-making. Additionally, Chief Counsel\u2019s earlier  and more frequent work with the BODs allowed for participants with  appropriate skills and expertise to contribute to guidance development  and highlight potential enforcement concerns. This collaboration included  weekly, and in some instances daily, meetings for participants to provide  implementation status updates. Further, IRS developed joint project  documents and leveraged collaborative technologies to track and manage  TCJA implementation and facilitate sharing across the agency.", "IRS officials stated that there were several benefits to this enhanced  collaborative approach, including: more efficient and effective development of comprehensive  regulations, for instance guidance for the QBI provision;  faster decision-making on time-sensitive regulations; earlier identification of tax administration and enforcement concerns; mitigation of potential enforcement challenges, such as narrowing the  definition of specified trades and businesses on the QBI deduction;  and ability to begin compliance planning earlier.", "Our prior work on interagency collaboration mechanisms and the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government identify areas  for agencies to improve and sustain collaboration. For instance, we  identified that frequent communication can help facilitate working across  agency boundaries and that articulating agreement in formal documents  that are regularly updated and monitored can strengthen commitment to  working collaboratively. In addition, federal internal control standards  state that agencies should ensure stakeholders from different parts of an  organization communicate to help the agency fulfill its mission.", "Chief Counsel officials acknowledged the value of this enhanced  collaboration but as of December 2019 had not identified or documented  criteria for when this collaborative approach would benefit guidance  development and help achieve agency goals. Chief Counsel officials said  that the guidelines as written provided flexibility in determining when to  collaborate early with other offices during TCJA implementation. In  addition, officials said that the value of collaboration depends on the  scope and complexity of a tax law change and the decision to use earlier  and more frequent collaboration would need to consider tradeoffs and  other considerations such as other IRS priorities and the effects of pulling  employees away from other activities.", "However, IRS officials described the enhanced collaboration used  throughout TCJA implementation as unprecedented and key to  successful implementation, indicating that identifying the situations when  this earlier and more frequent collaboration would make sense and  updating relevant documentation to reflect this could benefit IRS guidance  development. Documenting the parameters and procedures for enhanced  collaboration practices would better position IRS to be prepared to use  enhanced collaboration during implementation of complex or time- sensitive changes to the tax code. For example, enhanced collaboration  may help to identify and mitigate potential administrative effects of  regulatory design decisions, potentially helping IRS identify more cost- effective alternatives within the limits of available resources. These  potential benefits are also supported by our past work on regulatory  design during the rulemaking process. Specifically, we found that it is  important for agencies to consider enforcement and compliance issues  during regulation development because different design choices have  implications for future enforcement and compliance efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Treasury\u2019s Economic Analyses Omit Key Considerations of Distributional Effects of Tax Regulations", "paragraphs": ["While developing regulations to help implement and administer TCJA  provisions, Treasury and IRS made discretionary decisions in the  regulatory development process that have meaningful effects on  taxpayers\u2019 tax liability and government revenue collection that were not  included in their analysis. Changes to tax liability have distributional  consequences, as taxes transfer money from taxpayers to the  government, but do not directly affect the total resources available to the  country. These distributional effects are one element that should be  recognized during the regulatory development process, along with costs  and benefits of the regulations. While we found that, among the  provisions we looked at more deeply, Treasury\u2019s analyses did recognize  some costs and benefits related to factors such as administrability,  compliance costs, and economic distortions, Treasury\u2019s analyses did not  generally assess the distributional effects, including effects on tax  revenue collection, the regulations had as a result of changes in tax  liability.", "As part of the regulatory development process, Treasury and IRS must  adhere to Executive Order (E. O.) 12866, which establishes standards for  regulatory planning and review. E.O. 12866 instructs agencies to select  regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits, including economic,  distributive, and equity effects, unless a statute requires another  regulatory approach. Any regulation that is determined to be significant  must be submitted to OIRA for review, along with an analysis of the costs  and benefits of that regulation.", "However, until 2018, Treasury\u2019s and IRS\u2019s tax regulations were not  regularly subjected to analysis and review under E.O. 12866. In many  cases, tax regulations were deemed not significant under E.O. 12866,  and as a result, Treasury and IRS did not perform regulatory analyses  and they were not reviewed by OIRA. Some tax regulations were also  exempt from OIRA review, which was otherwise required under E.O.  12866 based on an agreement between OMB and Treasury. However,  E.O. 13789, signed in 2017, instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to  reconsider the scope of that exemption, and in April 2018, Treasury and  OMB signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) subjecting certain tax  regulations to OIRA review.", "In accordance with the MOA and the requirements in E.O. 12866, for  regulations deemed significant, Treasury is responsible for conducting  and producing an analysis of the impact of the regulations, including an  assessment of costs and benefits. Tax regulations with an anticipated  annual non-revenue effect of $100 million or more are deemed  economically significant, and are subjected to this additional analysis.  Under the MOA, Treasury was allowed a 12-month transition period to  obtain reasonably sufficient resources to meet the additional  requirements for economically significant regulations. The transition  period expired in April 2019, and any new regulations will be subjected to  these additional analyses where applicable.", "E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular No. A-4, a guide developed by OMB for  agencies to perform regulatory analyses required by E.O. 12866,  emphasize that agencies should assess the costs and benefits of  proposed regulations. In some cases, regulations may transfer money  from one group to another, creating no net costs or benefits to society as  a whole, but nonetheless affecting those who have been affected by the  transfers. When regulations have this effect, they are said to have a  distributive impact on society, and both E.O.12866 and OMB Circular A-4  instruct agencies to consider distributive effects.", "Because revenues raised through taxation are transfers and are not costs  or benefits to society, OMB Circular A-4 instructs agencies to develop a  description of the distributional effects of a regulation that is separate  from the costs and benefits. Such an analysis should recognize the  effects of the regulation across the population and the economy, divided  up in various ways, such as income groups, race, sex, industrial sector, or  geography.", "Treasury\u2019s and IRS\u2019s significant proposed and final rules used to  implement TCJA included a section analyzing the impact of the  regulations; however, we found these analyses generally overlooked the  distributional effects of the regulations arising from changes in tax liability  and revenue collection. The illustrative examples below from TCJA  regulations highlight the potential effects of Treasury\u2019s and IRS\u2019s  regulatory decisions on tax liability and how those were reflected in  Treasury\u2019s analysis.", "Eligibility for QBI deduction for real estate and insurance  brokers. The QBI deduction provides a deduction of up to 20 percent  of QBI, but depending on a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income, a specified  service trade or business (SSTB) may not be a qualified trade or  business and therefore may not produce QBI. The statute defines  SSTBs as trades or businesses within a list of broadly-identified fields.  Treasury and IRS determined that guidance clarifying the types of  trades or businesses that would be considered to be within the listed  fields was needed. As one example, the statute specified that  \u201cbrokerage services\u201d are considered an SSTB, but Treasury and IRS  regulations further specified that \u201cbrokerage services\u201d was limited to  securities brokers, while other brokerage services, including real  estate brokers and insurance brokers, were explicitly excluded from  the definition of \u201cbrokerage services.\u201d The choices Treasury and IRS  made when providing additional guidance on SSTBs will significantly  affect the tax burden and revenue collected from certain businesses.", "In its analysis of its decisions regarding the definitions of SSTBs,  Treasury stated that articulating which business activities were or  were not considered SSTBs would provide clarity to taxpayers and  prevent similarly-situated taxpayers from behaving differently, which  could potentially create economic inefficiencies. Treasury did not  address the fact that decisions about which business activities would  be considered SSTBs would affect eligibility for a 20 percent  deduction, and would affect the distribution of resources between  certain taxpayers and the federal government.", "According to data from IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income on sole  proprietorships\u2014one of several business structures that can earn a  QBI deduction\u2014categories representing insurance agencies and  brokerages, and offices of real estate agents, brokers, property  managers, and appraisers recorded more than $35 billion in net  income in 2016. The precise effect of not being categorized as an  SSTB depends on the specific circumstances of the individual  businesses, but given the magnitude of their annual net revenue,  excluding real estate and insurance brokers from the definition of  SSTB could lower their collective tax burden by billions of dollars  annually. This could result in a reduction in federal tax revenues  compared to the regulatory alternative of considering these sectors to  be SSTBs.", "End date for opportunity zones. An investor who invests capital  gains in a Qualified Opportunity Fund, and maintains that investment  for at least 10 years, is eligible to make an election at the time of sale  that would render such gains no longer taxable. TCJA\u2019s statutory  language did not specify an end date for investors to make this  election, or a point at which taxpayers must dispose of investments in  opportunity funds and recognize future capital gains to be taxed. IRS\u2019s October 2018 proposed regulations for opportunity zones stated that  investors will have until December 31, 2047, to dispose of  investments and make this election. The decision to set an end date  of December 31, 2047, was one of four approaches discussed in the  proposed regulations. The other options considered were to offer no  further guidance on this issue, to specify no end date to elect the gain  exclusion, and to allow the election until December 31, 2047, but  without disposition of the assets.", "In its analysis of this decision, Treasury considered how providing  clarity would help taxpayers make more efficient investments in  opportunity zones. Treasury also considered how forced dispositions  could lead to economic inefficiencies, while a longer time horizon  could lead to greater investment, but more administrative costs.  Treasury did not, however, assess how the different decisions would  influence the ultimate tax liability of investors. The determination of a  disposition date can have a potentially large effect on tax liability. For  example, if a taxpayer invested $1 million into an opportunity fund in  2019, and that grew at a 7 percent rate, it would be worth  approximately $2 million after 10 years, $3.9 million after 20 years,  and $6.6 million in 2047. Under Treasury\u2019s and IRS\u2019s regulations,  such capital gains\u2014$5.6 million in this example\u2014would be exempted  from taxation.", "We found that in the course of developing regulatory impact analyses for  TCJA regulations, Treasury generally excluded any analysis of  distributional effects due to changes in tax revenue collection. In the  examples above, Treasury\u2019s decisions would significantly affect tax  liability for certain taxpayers, which were not reflected in Treasury\u2019s  analyses of the regulations.", "Treasury officials did not conduct distributional analyses related to  revenue effects because in their view, the MOA instructed them to focus  only on non-revenue effects and superseded E.O. 12866. This view is  reflected in Treasury\u2019s guidance to staff on how to conduct regulatory  analyses. Specifically, Treasury\u2019s internal guidance instructs staff to  conduct distributional analyses, describing how benefits, costs, and  transfers are distributed among subpopulations. This guidance further  states that staff should not include transfers of revenue to the  government, and Treasury officials told us that they did not think they  should include any analysis of these effects in their regulatory impact  analyses.", "However, Treasury\u2019s understanding that revenue effects should be  excluded from its analyses is inconsistent with the MOA and OIRA\u2019s  position. While Section 1 of the MOA between Treasury and OMB  excludes revenue effects for the purposes of determining whether or not a  regulation is economically significant, and thus subject to OIRA review,  that limitation does not appear elsewhere in the MOA, and the MOA does  not state that revenue should be excluded from all analysis. OIRA officials  told us that that all agencies, including Treasury, are subject to the same  requirements of E.O. 12866, and that outside of the MOA, OIRA had no  agreements with Treasury that would otherwise modify the requirements.", "OIRA officials we spoke with reiterated that all agencies, including  Treasury, should generally analyze the distributional impact of their  regulations, and OMB\u2019s guidance identifies changes in tax revenue as an  example of a transfer that would have a distributional impact. OIRA  officials stated that they recognize conducting these analyses was a new  procedure for Treasury, and that Treasury officials were still learning how  to apply the analytical framework in Circular A-4.", "Treasury\u2019s internal guidance for conducting regulatory impact analyses is  inconsistent with the standards in E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4 that  all agencies are expected to follow.

By identifying situations when this earlier and  more frequent collaboration would benefit IRS\u2019s guidance development  process and by updating any relevant policies or procedures to document  beneficial collaboration practices, IRS will be better prepared to  implement the next set of complex or time-sensitive changes to the tax  code.", "In developing regulations for TCJA provisions, Treasury and IRS made  decisions that could potentially affect tax liability by billions of dollars per  year, which would have distributional effects on the economy, but these  effects were not included in their regulatory analyses. The distributional  effects of tax liability changes from regulations can be significant;  updating Treasury\u2019s internal guidance to include analysis of these effects  in the rulemaking process would provide greater transparency to the  public, and would better inform decision makers who must determine  which regulatory alternative is the best to adopt.", "Addressing data reliability issues in IRS\u2019s tracking documentation could  better ensure that further TCJA implementation work is performed in an  efficient and timely manner and better enables IRS to identify  opportunities for improvements to their implementation process.  Additionally, this could enable IRS to better complete and evaluate  existing TCJA implementation processes, as well as be better equipped  to improve those processes for future application.", "SB/SE\u2019s ability to analyze tax return data and efficiently plan compliance  efforts is impeded by the lack of easily accessible and useable data for  certain TCJA changes. Taking steps to obtain these data in instances  where the potential benefits outweigh the costs would help the agency  identify return filing trends and potential noncompliance to help the  agency improve audit selection. It would also help SB/SE fulfill IRS\u2019s  goals of improving operations using data analytics and would also help  the agency be able to effectively ensure compliance with and enforce  TCJA provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of five recommendations, including four to IRS and  one to Treasury. Specifically:  The Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service, in coordination with  appropriate offices, should identify and document parameters and  procedures for applying enhanced collaborative approaches to regulation  and other guidance development with IRS Business Operating Divisions.  (Recommendation 1)", "The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should develop a process to  accurately and thoroughly capture implementation status of ongoing  projects in accordance with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. (Recommendation 2)", "The Commissioner of Small Business/Self Employed should coordinate  with appropriate IRS divisions or offices to identify the costs and benefits  of retroactively transcribing taxpayer data resulting from TCJA.  (Recommendation 3)", "Based on the costs and benefits identified in recommendation 3, the  Commissioner of Small Business/Self Employed should determine which  TCJA provisions\u2019 data should be converted into a more useful electronic  format for compliance and enforcement purposes and work with the  appropriate offices to obtain the transcribed data, as appropriate.  (Recommendation 4)", "The Assistant Secretary of Tax Policy should update Treasury\u2019s internal  guidance to ensure that Treasury\u2019s regulatory impact analyses include  examination of the distributional effects of revenue changes when  regulations influence tax liability. (Recommendation 5)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget for review and comment. In its written  comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in appendix IV,  IRS disagreed with the four recommendations addressed to that agency.", "The Director of Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis did not comment on the  merits of the recommendation directed to Treasury and provided other  comments by email, which are summarized below. In addition, IRS,  Treasury, OMB also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate.", "IRS disagreed with our recommendation to identify and document  parameters and procedures for applying enhanced collaborative  approaches to regulation and other guidance development  (Recommendation 1). IRS stated it believes that its Internal Revenue  Manual provides sufficient guidance and flexibility on when such  enhanced collaboration is appropriate and that establishing specific  criteria is likely to reduce the flexibility and independent judgement that  presently exists. Additionally, IRS said that this type of collaboration is not  needed for more routine tax law changes.", "We are recommending that IRS document the collaboration procedures  that were cited as critical for implementing TCJA for use in specific  instances\u2014such as during complex or time-sensitive tax law changes.   As discussed in the report and acknowledged in IRS\u2019s letter, this  collaboration was particularly helpful for TCJA implementation and had  many benefits, such as faster decision-making and identifying  enforcement concerns earlier in the guidance development process.", "We believe that by implementing this recommendation, IRS can help  ensure that institutional knowledge and beneficial practices from TCJA  implementation will be documented and effectively leveraged to support  implementation of future time-sensitive or complex tax law changes  without restricting IRS\u2019s flexibility. Documenting procedures would ensure  IRS can retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having  that knowledge limited to a few personnel.", "For our recommendation that IRS develop a process to accurately and  thoroughly capture implementation status of ongoing projects in  accordance with federal internal control standards (Recommendation 2),  IRS disagreed that a new process is needed and said that inaccurate  reporting of implementation status did not harm IRS implementation of  any TCJA provision.", "As we acknowledge in this report, IRS officials told us implementation  was not impeded by data inconsistencies. However, accurately and  thoroughly capturing implementation status on ongoing projects would  provide accurate information to decision makers and could prevent  potential misreporting, mismanagement, or inefficient resource  investment in the future.  For example, our ability to use these data to  inform Congress of TCJA implementation status was impeded because  we deemed the data unreliable for this purpose. Our recommendation  does not require IRS to develop a new process for capturing and tracking  implementation status. If deemed appropriate, IRS could, instead, update  or modify existing processes in ways designed to ensure data reliability.", "IRS disagreed with our recommendations to identify the costs and  benefits of retroactively transcribing certain taxpayer data and then to  implement transcription based on this determination (Recommendations 3  and 4). IRS stated that retroactively transcribing data is a resource- intensive, manual process.", "We disagree with this assertion. LB&I is using optical character  recognition to convert PDF data into a more useable format, which is a  semi-automated process. Further, as also stated in this report, IRS IT  officials we interviewed told us they had the capability to develop a  program that would convert PDF data to a more useable format if IRS  management deemed it a priority.", "In its response, IRS also states that the benefits of converting data to a  more useable format are unknown. We do not expect IRS to conduct a  complex and detailed cost-benefit analysis. Rather, as acknowledged in  this report, a high-level analysis of costs and benefits could help IRS  management determine what, if any, data would benefit compliance and  enforcement efforts. IRS could use readily available existing information  (such as the number of returns affected by a certain provision, LB&I and  IT cost data on conversion efforts already implemented, or the usefulness  of past compliance analytics in similar areas) to inform the analysis.", "IRS also states that the potential noncompliance costs are unknown until  the agency completes audits of TCJA provisions. As we reported,  conducting audits is labor-intensive and IRS\u2019s audit rate and enforcement  efforts have declined since 2011. Further, senior IRS officials we  interviewed stated that a limitation of taxpayer information in the PDF  format is that it is not easily analyzed. Therefore, we believe that  converting data in instances where the benefits outweigh the costs would  better position IRS to more effectively and efficiently pursue its mission of  ensuring taxpayer compliance.", "In an email, the Director of Tax Analysis indicated that Treasury generally  did not agree with the report\u2019s findings regarding its economic analyses.", "The Director did not specifically comment on the merits of our  recommendation that Treasury update its guidance for conducting  regulatory impact analyses (Recommendation 5), but stated that the  analyses underlying Treasury\u2019s tax regulations have fully complied with  the MOA established with OMB, which in Treasury\u2019s view focuses on non- revenue effects.", "We maintain that decisions Treasury and IRS made when developing  regulations to implement TCJA could potentially impact tax liability by  billions of dollars per year; however, Treasury\u2019s internal guidance dictates  that these revenue effects should not be included in its economic  analyses of the regulations.", "Amending Treasury\u2019s guidance to ensure that impacts on tax revenue  and liability are included would make the guidance consistent with E.O.  12866 and OMB Circular A-4, which underlie the MOA and instruct  agencies to analyze the distributional consequences of regulations.  Including these effects of tax regulations, as we recommended, is  necessary in order to provide greater transparency to the public and  better inform decision makers, who must determine which regulatory  alternative is the best to adopt.", "We are sending copies to the appropriate congressional committees.

We defined business and  international provisions as provisions assigned to IRS\u2019s Large Business &  International (LB&I) Division or Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE)  Division.", "To examine IRS\u2019s processes to provide guidance to taxpayers, we  analyzed IRS documentation, such as prioritization records, guidance  development records, and actual regulations and other guidance  documents (e.g., notices and news releases) and interviewed IRS  officials. Specifically, we reviewed IRS\u2019s documentation of prioritization of  TCJA provisions and interviewed IRS officials in the Tax Reform  Implementation Office (TRIO) and the Office of Chief Counsel (Chief  Counsel) to examine the criteria IRS used to prioritize TCJA provisions for  implementation. We also reviewed IRS documentation on internal  coordination and interviewed IRS TRIO and Chief Counsel officials to  examine IRS\u2019s strategy for and process of guidance development and  IRS\u2019s plan to provide taxpayers with timely information. We used criteria  from Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and our  key practices for collaboration to determine the extent to which IRS\u2019s  process for providing guidance to taxpayers was consistent with these  standards and best practices.", "To assess the economic analyses Treasury conducted as part of the  regulatory development process, we analyzed IRS, Treasury Office of  Tax Policy (OTP), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  documentation detailing the regulatory development and decision-making  processes. We also interviewed officials from IRS TRIO, Chief Counsel,  OTP, and OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).  Specifically, to identify the factors Treasury and IRS considered when  analyzing trade-offs presented by different regulatory options to decide  which regulatory options to select, we analyzed underlying regulatory  development documentation and interviewed relevant officials. For  example, we examined issues lists, internal memorandums, emails  discussing regulatory alternatives and their tradeoffs, and early drafts  regulations with internal comments.", "We also analyzed TCJA published regulations and interviewed OIRA and  Treasury OTP officials to determine the extent to which Treasury OTP  and IRS included discussions of regulatory alternatives and cost-benefit  and economic analyses of these alternatives in the published regulations.  We used criteria from OMB regulatory guidance for executive branch  agencies to examine Treasury\u2019s development and analyses of regulatory  alternatives. This guidance includes the Memorandum of Agreement  (MOA) between Treasury and OMB prescribing OMB review of tax  regulations under Executive Order 12866; Executive Order 12866,  Regulatory Planning and Review; and OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory  Analyses, to determine the extent to which Treasury\u2019s analyses met OMB  guidance for developing regulations.", "To describe the implementation status of business and international TCJA  provisions, we analyzed IRS project management documentation, such  as IRS\u2019s Enterprise Integrated Project Plan (EIPP) for TCJA  implementation and publicly issued guidance and met with IRS officials.  Specifically, we analyzed EIPP to determine which tasks were guidance  or training related based on description, and developed keywords to limit  our dataset to only relevant tasks. We interviewed IRS TRIO officials to  ensure we accurately interpreted the description and status of the  identified implementation tasks. We monitored for progress on guidance  tasks by regularly reviewing IRS\u2019s tax reform website and the Federal  Register, as well as SB/SE and LB&I\u2019s implementation trackers and Chief  Counsel\u2019s guidance planning documentation. We reviewed Chief  Counsel, LB&I, and SB/SE documentation (e.g., implementation trackers)  and met with those officials to understand their internal tracking  mechanisms for TCJA tasks and implementation status. To monitor  training tasks, we used the EIPP to establish which provisions would  require training and reviewed training documentation (e.g., training  schedules and materials) from LB&I and SBSE. To describe and monitor  information technology (IT) implementation status, we analyzed IRS\u2019s  Information Technology organization\u2019s TCJA implementation  documentation and met with IRS Information Technology organization  officials. We reviewed IRS\u2019s IRM website to determine whether IRS had  updated its IRM sections as planned in its EIPP and other planning  documents.", "While we identified potential data reliability issues with the EIPP, LB&I\u2019s  implementation tracking documentation, and SB/SE\u2019s implementation  tracking documentation (including inaccurate recording of the completion  status of multiple categories of tasks, inconsistent use of unique task  identifiers across tracking documentation, and potential errors introduced  in the transition from the EIPP to the subsequent tracking  documentation), we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purpose of reporting the status of guidance releases, training, and  overall TCJA IT tasks. We did not find the data sufficiently reliable to  report on the status of IRM updates. We were also unable to report on the  number of IT tasks specific to business and international provisions as a  subset of overall TCJA IT implementation because IRS\u2019s IT organization  did not track work by TCJA section.", "To assess the reliability of the EIPP, we met with TRIO officials to  understand how the EIPP was created and updated, as well as verified  information from outside sources, including the Federal Register and  IRS\u2019s tax reform website. After identifying potential discrepancies in  LB&I\u2019s and SB/SE\u2019s TCJA tracking documentation, we followed up with  SB/SE and LB&I to determine whether the status of our selected tasks  was accurate and complete. SB/SE and LB&I provided responses and  statements indicating that the status of some tasks was not accurately  recorded. For example, we identified an instance where LB&I\u2019s tracking  documentation had a provision\u2019s final regulations listed as issued in July  2019, when IRS had yet to issue the guidance. Based on these  discrepancies and inconsistencies, we used criteria from the Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government to evaluate IRS\u2019s project  management activities.", "To identify the impact of OIRA\u2019s effect on the status of TCJA  implementation, we analyzed information available on the agency\u2019s public  website to determine the length of time of OIRA review of regulations. We  compared the length of time of OIRA\u2019s review to agreed-upon time frames  for OIRA review of tax regulations in the Memorandum of Agreement,  Review of Tax Regulations under Executive Order 12866 (MOA) between  Treasury and OMB to determine the extent to which OIRA met the MOA\u2019s  10- and 45-day time frames.", "To examine challenges that could affect IRS\u2019s ability to effectively  administer these provisions, we analyzed TCJA and IRS documentation.  Further, we interviewed TRIO, LB&I, SB/SE, IT, Chief Counsel officials,  and outside tax practitioners. We analyzed TCJA\u2019s statutory language to  identify instances where the law included compliance safeguards, such as  anti-abuse provisions or information reporting requirements. We reviewed  IRS documentation (e.g., SB/SE compliance plans) and interviewed IRS  officials to understand IRS\u2019s views on the opportunities, challenges, and  risks to administering and ensuring compliance with the new law. We also  interviewed and subsequently analyzed statements from seven randomly  selected tax practitioners who had submitted public comments on IRS\u2019s  proposed regulations for the qualified business income (QBI) deduction,  opportunity zones, and the repatriation tax (see below for discussion of  provisions we further analyzed) to identify outside perspectives on  challenges for IRS administration and enforcement.", "We downloaded the public comments on these proposed regulations on  April 9, 2019. For the QBI deduction, the open comment period was from  August 16, 2018, to October 1, 2018, and as of the time we downloaded  comments, there were 340 comments. For the repatriation tax, the open  comment period was from August 9, 2019, to October 9, 2019, and as of  the time we downloaded comments, there were 188 comments. For  opportunity zones, the open comment period was from October 29, 2018,  to February 8, 2019, and as of the time we downloaded comments, there  were 185 comments.", "We also interviewed tax practitioners from two of the four \u201cBig Four\u201d tax  firms and one outside tax practitioner to which we were referred to  describe some outside opinions\u2019 on challenges for IRS administration and  enforcement. The views expressed in these interviews are not  necessarily representative of those of other tax practitioners, or tax  practitioners as a whole, and the views of the tax practitioners we  interviewed are being used as illustrative examples throughout our report.  We examined these challenges and risks and subsequently followed up  with IRS to examine the extent to which IRS was aware of them and  planning mitigating actions to address them. We used IRS\u2019s strategic plan  and to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government as  criteria for identifying any gaps between mitigation efforts and overall  agency-wide goals and priorities.", "As part of our work, we further analyzed three provisions\u2014the QBI  deduction, opportunity zones, and the repatriation tax\u2014to gain specific  insights into the decision-making process for prioritizing and developing  guidance and regulations and factors that may affect IRS\u2019 ability to  effectively administer these provisions. We selected these three  provisions for closer examination based on a number of factors, including  (1) IRS designating them higher priority for implementation and  identification, and (2) IRS, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and other  knowledgeable stakeholders identifying them as especially challenging or  complex to implement, administer, or enforce. Further, these three  selections ensured we were able to examine at least one provision  impacting domestic taxpayers managed by SB/SE division and at least  one provision impacting foreign, or multinational, taxpayers managed by  LB&I.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2018 to February 2020  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
