Timely response to and correction of  discrepant ATON is a high-priority task for the Coast Guard. According to  internal guidance, the Coast Guard has a tiered approach to address  ATON discrepancies that accounts for the importance of the ATON  relative to the waterway and the nature of the discrepancy. In particular,  according to Coast Guard guidance, the servicing unit response ranges  from immediately after notification up to 72 hours or as soon thereafter as  weather and resources permit. In some cases, the determining factors do  not require responding within 72 hours and the servicing unit is to advise  the district of future plans to correct the discrepancy. Coast Guard  guidance states that during the routine servicing process for floating  ATON (buoys), the primary purpose of the ATON units is to check the  buoys\u2019 positions, their condition, and ensure the correct operation of the  buoys\u2019 signal hardware. As part of this process, the Coast Guard may  extract the buoys from the water and bring them onboard an ATON  vessel to check the condition of their mooring chain, hull, and lighting  equipment.

Since its creation,  WOPL has coordinated and helped to implement various Coast Guard- wide initiatives to improve the management of fixed and floating ATON.", "These initiatives include centralized funding for ATON inspection and  major repair services, changes in cost limits for floating ATON  refurbishments, and expansion of commercial depot-level maintenance  contracts to supplement the Coast Guard\u2019s ATON major repair and  refurbishment capacity. WOPL has also analyzed and recommended the  transition from steel to foam buoys, where appropriate, to increase life  cycle cost savings and reduce servicing times. In addition, WOPL has  initiated changes to better manage and sustain the duration of floating  ATON, including extending time in the water between major  refurbishments from 6 to 9 years for some buoys and increasing the  allowance for selected steel buoy hull repair weld hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initiatives to Address Specific ATON Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has developed and is implementing a variety of  initiatives to address specific ATON management challenges that were  discussed earlier in this report. These initiatives include the following:  Improving the Availability of ATON Cutters and Boats: The Coast  Guard has ongoing initiatives to extend the service lives and to  recapitalize certain ATON cutters and boats to improve their availability  rates. For example, in fiscal year 2019, the Coast Guard continued the  major maintenance availability efforts on the 225-foot Seagoing Buoy  Tender fleet. In addition, from 2006 to 2016, a portion of the Coast  Guard\u2019s ATON fleet (River Tenders, Buoy Tenders, and Construction  Tenders) underwent a limited maintenance program to act as a bridging  strategy until replacement assets could be acquired. Our 2018 report on  Coast Guard acquisitions noted that the designed service life for each of  these tenders is 30 years, but as of the time of the report, their average  age was 53 years. In 2018, we reported that the Department of  Homeland Security approved the Waterways Commerce Cutter Program  to replace aging River Tenders, Buoy Tenders, and Construction  Tenders. While the acquisitions have been approved, it will likely be years  before the new cutters are built and deployed. The Coast Guard has also  had an ongoing initiative since 2007 that has recapitalized the boat fleet  by 290 boats.", "Conducting Routine ATON Servicing in a Timely Manner: The Coast  Guard has issued guidance to its districts to look for opportunities to  reduce the number of ATON that do not significantly increase navigational  risk and explore and leverage new technologies, such as the use of  electronic ATON, where feasible. Collectively, these efforts should help to  ease the servicing burden. In addition, the Coast Guard has also  introduced initiatives focused on improving ATON servicing time. For  example, officials in one district told us that they require their ATON units  to send in monthly reports on ATON servicing due dates and plans.  District officials review this information and may shift ATON servicing  work to another unit when the primary servicing vessel or unit is not  available to provide the needed service in a timely manner. Another  ongoing initiative the Coast Guard is exploring is the use of year-round  buoys for ice prone areas to reduce servicing requirements. The Coast  Guard has received positive feedback in two of the three districts where  such buoys have been in service.", "Improving Capacity Limits at ATON Major Repair and Refurbishment  Facilities: According to a Coast Guard official, the Coast Guard has had  commercial contracts in District 9 (the Great Lakes region) and District 13  (the Pacific Northwest) going back decades to provide floating ATON  major repair and refurbishment services. Then, in March 2019, WOPL  awarded four regional commercial contracts to provide increased capacity  for ATON major repairs and refurbishments in an effort to help reduce the  Coast Guard\u2019s floating ATON major repair and refurbishment backlog.  Specifically, the Coast Guard (1) renewed the contract in District 13; (2)  awarded a contract covering California (part of District 11); (3) awarded a  contract for a zone covering New England and the Mid-Atlantic (Districts 1  and 5); and (4) awarded a contract covering Guam (part of District 14).  According to Coast Guard officials, the addition or renewal of these four  regional contracts has resulted in greater capacity and flexibility to reduce  the floating ATON major repair and refurbishment backlog."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATON Management Initiatives Lack Certain Elements", "paragraphs": ["While the Coast Guard has developed various initiatives to improve  management of fixed and floating ATON, these initiatives do not contain  certain elements, which limit assurance that the initiatives will be  effectively implemented. For example, we found that many initiatives we  evaluated do not contain milestone and completion dates for Coast  Guard-wide implementation, which are elements that can guide decisions  on the success of the initiatives. Under the foam buoy implementation  initiative, the Coast Guard evaluated the use of foam buoys in lieu of steel  buoys (which are more expensive to overhaul) and found that it was  feasible to replace steel buoys with foam buoys in some locations but not  in others. For example, the Coast Guard\u2019s evaluations showed that foam  buoys cannot stand up to ice conditions. On the basis of its evaluations,  the Coast Guard plans to continue replacing certain classes of steel  buoys with foam buoys where operationally feasible. However, the  initiative does not contain milestone dates or desired outcomes for Coast  Guard-wide implementation.", "According to guidance from the Program Management Institute, programs  or projects\u2014like the ATON-related initiatives being implemented by the  Coast Guard\u2014are to include specific, desired outcomes, along with the  appropriate steps and time frames needed to achieve the final outcomes  and results to implement the enhanced capabilities across the  organization. In addition, our leading practices in capital decision- making state that such initiatives should include milestones and  completion dates. According to Coast Guard officials, WOPL is a  relatively new unit and is still developing ATON guidance and procedures  for ATON-related initiatives and responsibilities to be performed by the  districts.

However, the future of the fixed and floating ATON and the  vessels used to service them bears close watching given the challenges  the Coast Guard faces in managing its fixed and floating ATON. The fact  that many of the ATON have reached, or will soon be reaching, the end of  their designed service lives could lead to an increase in the number of  ATON requiring major repairs or replacement in the near future.  According to Coast Guard data, the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to refurbish or  replace its aging ATON is made more challenging by limited capacity for  conducting major repairs and refurbishments of floating ATON. The Coast  Guard has taken positive steps to develop strategic plans to guide the  ATON program, and these plans have led to the development of various  initiatives to improve management of fixed and floating ATON, but these  initiatives would benefit from the inclusion of certain elements, such as  desired outcomes to be achieved and associated milestone dates, to  have better assurance that the initiatives will be effectively implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["The Commandant of the Coast Guard should direct the Assistant  Commandant for Engineering and Logistics and Assistant Commandant  for Prevention Policy to update the Coast Guard\u2019s ATON-related  initiatives to include the specific outcomes to be achieved and associated  time frames.
