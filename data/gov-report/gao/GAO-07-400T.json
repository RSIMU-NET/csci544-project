In  July 2004, HHS released The Decade of Health Information  Technology: Delivering Consumer-centric and Information-rich  Health Care\u2014Framework for Strategic Action. This framework  described goals for achieving nationwide interoperability of health  IT and actions to be taken by both the public and private sectors in  implementing a strategy. HHS\u2019s Office of the National Coordinator  for Health IT updated the framework\u2019s goals in June 2006 and  included an objective for protecting consumer privacy. It identified  two specific strategies for meeting this objective\u2014(1) support the  development and implementation of appropriate privacy and  security policies, practices, and standards for electronic health  information exchange and (2) develop and support policies to  protect against discrimination based on personal health information  such as denial of medical insurance or employment.", "In July 2004, we testified on the benefits that effective  implementation of IT can bring to the health care industry and the  need for HHS to provide continued leadership, clear direction, and  mechanisms to monitor progress in order to bring about measurable  improvements. Since then, we have reported or testified on several  occasions on HHS\u2019s efforts to define its national strategy for health  IT. We have recommended that HHS develop the detailed plans and  milestones needed to ensure that its goals are met and HHS agreed  with our recommendation and has taken some steps to define more  detailed plans. In our report and testimonies, we have described a  number of actions that HHS, through the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health IT, has taken toward accelerating the use of  IT to transform the health care industry, including the development  of its framework for strategic action. We have also described the  Office of the National Coordinator\u2019s continuing efforts to work with  other federal agencies to revise and refine the goals and strategies  identified in its initial framework. The current draft framework\u2014 The Office of the National Coordinator: Goals, Objectives, and  Strategies\u2014identifies objectives for accomplishing each of four  goals, along with 32 high-level strategies for meeting the objectives,  including the two strategies for protecting consumer privacy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996", "paragraphs": ["Federal health care reform initiatives of the early- to mid-1990s were  inspired in part by public concern about the privacy of personal  medical information as the use of health IT increased.

As health  information exchange expands across state lines, organizations are  challenged with understanding and resolving data-sharing issues  introduced by varying state privacy laws. HHS recognized that  sharing health information among entities in states with varying  laws introduces challenges and intends to identify variations in state  laws that affect privacy and security practices through the privacy  and security solutions contract that it awarded in 2005.", "Several organizations described issues associated with ensuring  appropriate disclosure, such as determining the minimum data  necessary that can be disclosed in order for requesters to  accomplish the intended purposes for the use of the health  information.

Organizations also described issues with  obtaining individuals\u2019 authorization and consent for uses and  disclosures of personal health information and difficulties with  determining the best way to allow individuals to participate in and  consent to electronic health information exchange.

Additionally, as health information is amended, HIPAA rules require  that covered entities make reasonable efforts to notify certain  providers and other persons that previously received the individuals\u2019  information. The challenges associated with meeting this  requirement are expected to become more prevalent as the numbers  of organizations exchanging health information increases.", "Implementing Adequate Security Measures for Protecting  Health Information  Adequate implementation of security measures is another challenge  that health information exchange providers must overcome to  ensure that health information is adequately protected as health  information exchange expands.
