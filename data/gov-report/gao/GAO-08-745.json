The Coast Guard has increased accountability by bringing Deepwater under a restructured acquisition function and investing its government project managers with management and oversight responsibilities formerly held by ICGS. Coast Guard project managers and technical experts--as opposed to contractor representatives--now hold the greater balance of management responsibility and accountability for program outcomes. However, like other federal agencies, the Coast Guard has faced obstacles in building an adequate government workforce. It has various initiatives under way to develop and retain a workforce capable of managing this complex acquisition program, but faced with an almost 20 percent vacancy rate, it is relying on support contractors, such as cost estimators, in key positions. The Coast Guard's decision to manage Deepwater under an asset-based approach, rather than as an overall system-of-systems, has resulted in increased government control and visibility over acquisitions. Agency officials have begun to hold competitions for Deepwater assets outside of the ICGS contract. While the asset-based approach is beneficial, certain cross-cutting aspects of Deepwater, such as the program's communications and intelligence components and the numbers of each asset needed, still require a systems-level approach. The Coast Guard recognizes this but is not yet fully positioned to manage these aspects. The Coast Guard has begun to follow the disciplined, project management framework of its Major Systems Acquisition Manual (MSAM), which requires documentation and high-level executive approval of decisions at key points in a program's life cycle. But the consequences of not following this approach in the past are now evident, as Deepwater assets have been delivered without a determination of whether their planned capabilities would meet mission needs. The MSAM process currently allows limited initial production to proceed before the majority of design activities have been completed. In addition, a disconnect between MSAM requirements and current practice exists because DHS had earlier delegated to the Coast Guard all Deepwater acquisition decisions, resulting in little departmental oversight. Coast Guard project managers and decision makers are now receiving information intended to help manage project outcomes, but some key information is unreliable. The earned value management data reported by ICGS lacks sufficient transparency to be useful to Coast Guard program managers, and subcontractor Northrop Grumman's system for producing the data may need to be re-certified to ensure its reliability. Officials state that they are addressing these issues through joint efforts with the Navy and the Defense Contract Management Agency."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Deepwater is the largest acquisition program in the Coast Guard\u2019s  Deepwater is the largest acquisition program in the Coast Guard\u2019s  history\u2014one that has experienced serious performance and management  history\u2014one that has experienced serious performance and management  problems such as cost breaches, schedule slips, and assets designed and  problems such as cost breaches, schedule slips, and assets designed and  delivered with significant defects.

To  carry out these responsibilities, the Coast Guard operates a number of  vessels and aircraft and, through its Deepwater Program, is currently  modernizing or replacing those assets. At the start of the Deepwater  Program, the Coast Guard chose to use a system-of-systems acquisition  strategy that would replace its assets with a single, integrated package of  aircraft, vessels, and communications systems through ICGS, a lead  system integrator that was responsible for designing, constructing,  deploying, supporting and integrating the assets to meet Coast Guard  requirements. Under this approach, the Coast Guard provided the  contractor with broad, overall performance specifications\u2014such as the  ability to interdict illegal immigrants\u2014and ICGS determined the  specifications for the Deepwater assets.

The role of a system integrator differs from that of a  traditional prime contractor in that it includes increased responsibilities  for ensuring that the design, development, and implementation of the  system-of-systems it is under contract to produce meet established budget  and schedule. The close working relationship with the government that  this arrangement engenders has advantages and disadvantages. An  advantage is that such a relationship allows flexibility in responding to  shifting priorities. Disadvantages are the government\u2019s weakened ability to  provide oversight over the long term and the potential for increased costs.", "In a series of reports since 2001, we have noted the risks inherent in the  lead system integrator approach to the Deepwater Program and have made  a number of recommendations intended to improve the Coast Guard\u2019s  management and oversight. In particular, we raised concerns about the  agency\u2019s ability to keep costs under control in future program years by  ensuring adequate competition for Deepwater assets and pointed to the  need for better oversight and management of the system integrator. We, as  well as the DHS Inspector General and others, have also noted problems in  specific acquisition efforts, notably the NSC and the 110-Foot Patrol Boat  Modernization, which the Commandant of the Coast Guard permanently  halted in November 2006 because of operational and safety concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Established a More Accountable Acquisition Organization but Faces Challenges in Building Acquisition Workforce", "paragraphs": ["Acknowledging that the initial approach to Deepwater gave too much  control to the contractor, the Coast Guard has reoriented its acquisition  organization to position itself to execute systems integration and program  management responsibilities formerly carried out by industry.

Previously,  the Coast Guard held only an advisory role in making technical decisions,  and in some cases this arrangement led to poor outcomes. For example,  Coast Guard officials told us their engineering experts had raised concerns  during the NSC\u2019s design phase about its ability to meet service life  requirements and recommended design changes, but were ignored. If the  recommendations had been heeded, changes to the ship\u2019s design could  have been made earlier and some additional costs may have been avoided.", "To supplement and enhance the use of its internal expertise, the Coast  Guard has increased its use of third-party, independent sources of  technical expertise and advice. For example, the Coast Guard is increasing  its use of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), an independent  organization that establishes and applies standards for the design and  construction of ship and other marine equipment, to assist the Coast  Guard in certifying that Deepwater vessels meet certain safety and  performance standards. As a case in point there are 987 standards  pertaining to hull, mechanical, and electrical systems on the first NSC  which must be certified. Currently, ICGS is responsible for submitting  documentation to the Coast Guard for 892 of the standards, while ABS and  other third parties have a minimal role. In contrast, the Coast Guard plans  for ABS to be responsible for reviewing approximately 200 certifications  starting with the third NSC and to have an even broader role in certifying  the design and production of future assets such as the Offshore Patrol  Cutter (OPC) and Fast Response Cutter (FRC).

This process requires documentation and approval of  program activities at key points in a program\u2019s life-cycle. The MSAM  represents a disciplined management approach that begins with an  identification of deficiencies in overall Coast Guard capabilities and then  proceeds through a series of structured phases and decision points to  identify requirements for performance, develop and select candidate  systems that match these requirements, demonstrate the feasibility of  selected systems, and produce a functional capability. At each decision  point, referred to as a \u201cmilestone,\u201d entities across the Coast Guard, such as  those responsible for oversight of the budget process or command and  control, are to be consulted. Designated officials at high levels\u2014including  the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard\u2014then formally approve the  program to proceed to the next phase. Each milestone requires  documentation that captures key information needed for decision making.  For example, when the Coast Guard makes its milestone decision, under  the MSAM process, to proceed with the OPC from the initiation phase into  development, the project office presented documentation that described  the capabilities the ship is expected to provide, a draft concept for  operations, and an initial assessment of cost and schedule. Figure 3  presents the key phases and milestones of the MSAM process and the  current status of Deepwater assets within the process.", "The MSAM process provides a number of benefits that have the potential  to improve acquisition outcomes. Primarily, it requires event-driven  decision-making by high ranking acquisition executives at a number of key  points in an asset\u2019s lifecycle.

In  addition, as the assets proceed through each phase of the process and the  requirements and capabilities of the assets become more defined, these  assets\u2019 ability to fill deficiencies identified by the Coast Guard must be  established.", "Previously, the Coast Guard authorized the Deepwater Program to deviate  from its major systems acquisition process, stating that the process was  focused on acquiring discrete assets and contains requirements and  documentation that may be inappropriate for the Deepwater system-of- systems approach. Instead, Deepwater Program reviews were required on  a schedule-driven basis\u2014planned quarterly or annually\u2014to report the  status and performance of the contractor\u2019s efforts.

While the MSAM process  contains many characteristics of a knowledge-based approach, there are  key differences that could affect acquisition outcomes. For example, the  Milestone 2 decision to approve low-rate initial production precedes the  majority of the design activities in the capability development and  demonstration phase. By following such a process, the Coast Guard may  decide to enter production before a design is proven, a decision that could  result in increased costs as design and production activities are conducted  concurrently. In a previous report, we reviewed DHS\u2019 acquisition process,  with which the Coast Guard\u2019s MSAM process is aligned and intended to  complement, and found a similar weakness.

This requirement would apply to Deepwater, as it has been  designated a DHS major investment program. However, DHS approval of  Deepwater acquisition decisions as part of its investment review process is  not technically necessary because the department deferred decisions on  specific assets to the Coast Guard in 2003. The department did require  notification of changes to the Deepwater Program that could result in  significant changes to cost, schedule, and performance, but this  requirement was at the overall systems level. In practice, the Coast Guard  has increased communication and coordination with DHS through good  will and informal procedures such as personal working relationships.  While increased communication between the Coast Guard and DHS is to  be applauded, without a formal process in place, DHS could lose the  ability to make strategic decisions\u2014such as how and whether to fund  certain projects\u2014across its components if informal procedures and  relationships should change. Coast Guard and DHS officials told us that  the processes and procedures for coordinating acquisitions with DHS\u2019  Investment Review Board, which is tasked with reviewing major  acquisition programs, are currently undergoing revision, and changes to  the process are expected near the end of fiscal 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Not Following MSAM Process Are Apparent for Assets in Production", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is facing the consequences of its decision not to follow  the MSAM process as it attempts to better define requirements for  individual assets already being procured, such as the NSC, Long-Range  Interceptor (LRI), and the MPA, and to ensure that desired capabilities are  met within cost and schedule constraints. Under the MSAM, the  requirements generation process takes broad mission needs and translates  them to operational capability requirements and then to asset performance  specifications. Figure 4 depicts this traceability from mission needs to  performance specifications.", "For example, under the MSAM process, before the design of an asset is  selected, representatives of the operational forces within the Coast Guard  are required to generate the Operational Requirements Document that  determines the capabilities or characteristics considered essential to  achieve their mission. Operational requirements described in this  document\u2014such as operating environment, functions to be performed,  and the need for interoperability with other assets\u2014ultimately drive the  performance and capability of an asset and should be traceable  throughout development, design, and testing. They should also include  basic asset requirements such as speed, maneuvering, and range to serve  as threshold and objective values for future trade-off analyses.", "Under the ICGS-led system-of-systems acquisition approach, the Coast  Guard developed high-level system requirements for capabilities, such as  the ability to interdict illegal migrants. ICGS then developed an integrated  force mix of specific aircraft, vessels, and communications systems to  meet those needs. But because the disciplined MSAM approach was not  followed, the Coast Guard could not trace the ICGS-proposed asset  performance to actual mission needs. Program and project managers are  \u201cbackfilling\u201d the necessary requirements documentation in programs that  are already well underway, with the intent of providing the traceability  that was previously lacking. For example, in 2006, the Coast Guard  acknowledged that the lack of a traditional requirements document for the  NSC, which was then under construction, would inhibit the Coast Guard\u2019s  ability to evaluate the vessel\u2019s suitability and effectiveness for Coast Guard  missions. To resolve this problem, the Coast Guard developed a document  that lists all the operational requirements for the NSC, as derived from  identified mission needs, to guide operational testing. According to Coast  Guard officials, operational testing based on these requirements will  commence when the third NSC is complete. Under the MSAM, operational  requirements would have been established prior to design and production  to serve as the basis to link the asset\u2019s performance to its ability to fill a  mission need.", "Failure to follow a disciplined approach in requirements generation is also  apparent with problems related to the LRI, a small boat intended to be  launched from larger cutters such as the NSC. The Coast Guard accepted  the ICGS-proposed performance specifications for the LRI as part of the  overall Deepwater specification, but the specifications were not tied to  Coast Guard mission requirements. Thus, the Coast Guard had no  assurance that the boat it was buying was what it needed to accomplish its  missions. As a result of Coast Guard-identified technical deficiencies in the  performance specifications, design changes were required after the LRI  task order was issued. For example, a number of C4ISR specifications had  to be added; the initial specification for the fuel tank size was deleted, as  its capacity would not enable the boat\u2019s 400 nautical mile range to be met;  and a more powerful electrical system was needed. These and other  changes, which were required for the boat to accomplish what ICGS had  proposed, drove the price for design and production from $744,621 to  almost $3 million. The Coast Guard is beginning to define needed  capabilities for the LRI under the MSAM process, with an eye towards  developing the service\u2019s own requirements for the asset. For example,  Coast Guard officials told us that ICGS\u2019 proposed top speed of 45 knots is  unrealistic and would under no circumstances be needed to accomplish  Coast Guard missions. The LRI has been equipped with a C4ISR suite that  officials believe to be much more extensive than they need. They are also  concerned that the boat is too heavy, at 22,000 pounds.", "The ramifications of accepting asset performance specifications not tied to  Coast Guard mission requirements also became apparent during recent  testing of the system that launches and recovers small boats, such as the  LRI, from the NSC\u2019s stern. Design changes to the launch system had to be  made because it was found to be inadequate to handle the heavy weight of  the LRI. The Coast Guard will pay for this change because the NSC is a  cost-plus incentive fee contract. In addition, Coast Guard officials told us  that the LRI\u2019s inboard spray rail, which had initially been installed to  enable the boat to reach 45 knots, had to be removed to allow the boat to  effectively launch from the NSC, a cost ICGS will bear under that fixed- price contract. Coast Guard officials stated that the current LRI acquisition  will be terminated with delivery of the first boat (now being considered a  prototype with the potential to be used to test launch and recovery  mechanisms on future NSCs).", "The Coast Guard\u2019s procurement of MPAs is another example of the  consequences of not following a disciplined acquisition approach, as key  program documents that establish the Coast Guard\u2019s requirements for this  asset and a plan for operational testing to those requirements have not  been finalized. The testing is expected to occur between June 2008 and  December 2008. The Coast Guard has contracted with ICGS for eight  MPAs and accepted delivery of three aircraft between December 2006 and  June 2007. In March 2008, it also accepted delivery of three mission system  pallets, which provide the aircraft with C4ISR capabilities.

In addition, officials believe that Northrop  Grumman\u2019s earned value system may require re-certification to meet  government standards to ensure the reliability of the data.

A Coast Guard official responsible  for analyzing the contractor\u2019s reported earned value data for the NSC  stated that the data do not provide sufficient visibility for decision making  at the asset level. The concerns stem in part from the system-of-systems  contract structure with ICGS and how the terms for reporting earned value  data to the government were negotiated. Earned value data are reported at  different levels of activity, descending in order from the general to the  specific, as determined in advance by the government. The levels of  activity required for earned value reporting are very important and can  determine the usefulness of the data received. Under the ICGS contract,  the earned value data are reported at seven levels, beginning with the  Deepwater system-of-systems level\u2014\u201dICGS\u201d\u2014and stopping at the major  component level\u2014such as propulsion and armaments. Coast Guard  officials stated that previously data on the NSC was reported to the fifth  level, which only presents data on the progress of production of the cutter  as a whole. A Coast Guard official stated that in order to gain adequate  visibility into reported cost variances, a deeper level of reporting is  necessary. While the Coast Guard has negotiated a more detailed level of  earned value reporting on the first three NSCs to receive data at the major  component level, according to an official, the Coast Guard may seek even  more detailed levels of cost data in upcoming negotiations for the fourth  NSC.", "In addition to concerns about visibility into contractor earned value data,  Coast Guard officials have concerns about the reliability of the underlying  systems the contractors use to collect this data. An important  consideration in relying on contractor-provided earned value management  data is ensuring that the contractor\u2019s process for generating the data is  compliant with government standards. Contractors are expected to have  earned value management plans that document the methodology,  products, and tools they have in place to track earned value. Independent  third parties, such as the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)  or the Defense Contract Audit Agency, ensure the contractor\u2019s initial  compliance with government standards and perform surveillance reviews  to ensure that the contractor remains compliant. While Lockheed Martin\u2019s  earned value management system has been certified as compliant by  DCMA, Coast Guard officials have stated that Northrop Grumman\u2014the  first tier subcontractor responsible for work on the NSC\u2014may require re- certification. Previously, Northrop Grumman\u2019s earned value management  system had been certified by the Navy, but this certification is no longer  considered acceptable by the Coast Guard. According to officials, the  Coast Guard is working with DCMA and the Navy to review and, if  necessary, re-certify Northrop Grumman\u2019s earned value system. In the  meantime, the Coast Guard intends to improve its insight into how the  contractor produces and reports earned value data by executing a  memorandum of agreement with the DCMA for on-site surveillance at the  shipyard. Such on-site presence is critical to increase the likelihood that  the Coast Guard receives accurate earned value data.", "These concerns about visibility into, and reliability of, earned value data  affect not only the information the Coast Guard needs for decision making  on current projects, but also the information necessary for decisions on  future projects, such as the production of the fourth NSC. As the Coast  Guard compiles earned value information on the ships being constructed  by Northrop Grumman, it can use this information in the estimates of  future costs used to establish target prices for additional work to be  performed. Because the Coast Guard lacks confidence in how Northrop  Grumman is representing its cost and schedule performance on current  projects, it may be in the position of paying the contractor for future  projects, such as the long lead material and production of the fourth NSC,  without the understanding necessary to evaluate proposed prices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In response to significant problems in achieving its intended outcomes  under Deepwater, Coast Guard leadership has made a major change in  course in its management and oversight of this program.

While the initiatives the Coast Guard has underway have already begun to  have a positive impact on reducing these risks, the extent and durability of  their impact depends on positive decisions that continue to increase and  improve government management and oversight.", "The current reliance on informal procedures to keep DHS informed of  Deepwater developments is not appropriate for an acquisition of this  magnitude. The Deepwater Program will continue for some time to come,  and the full burden of transcending the inevitable challenges should not  rest solely with the initiatives of the current Coast Guard leadership. The  Coast Guard\u2019s major systems acquisition process requires DHS approval of  milestone decisions; however, the 2003 DHS delegation to the Coast Guard  of such approval means that DHS does not have formal approval authority,  and it could lack the information needed to strategically allocate funding  by balancing requirements and needed capabilities across departmental  components. In addition, the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition process calls for a  decision to authorize initial production before knowledge is gathered  about the stability of an asset\u2019s design and production processes, which is  contrary to best practices and could result in cost increases and schedule  delays because of redesign. And because the Coast Guard\u2019s knowledge of  the reasonableness of contractors\u2019 proposed cost and schedule targets for  Deepwater assets relies in part on visibility into and confidence in the  contractors\u2019 earned value management data, the Coast Guard may lack a  solid basis to evaluate future proposals by Northrop Grumman until  known problems with its data are resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the initiatives to improve Deepwater management and  oversight continue as intended and to facilitate decision-making across the  department, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  direct the Under Secretary for Management to rescind the delegation of  Deepwater acquisition decision authority.", "We also recommend that the Commandant of the Coast Guard take the  following two actions:    To improve knowledge-based decision-making for its acquisitions,  revise the procedures in the Major Systems Acquisition Manual  related to the authorization of low-rate initial production by requiring a  formal design review to ensure that the design is stable as well as a  review before authorizing initial production.", "To improve program management of surface assets contracted to  Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, develop an approach to increase  visibility into that contractor\u2019s earned value management data  reporting before entering into any further contractual relationships,  such as for long lead material for and production of the fourth NSC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of  Homeland Security concurred with our findings.
