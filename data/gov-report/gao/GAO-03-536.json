Government researchers can use the technology without paying a royalty, and federal agencies can authorize their funding recipients to use the government's licenses for specific contracts, grant awards, or cooperative agreements meeting a federal government need. The government is not entitled to automatic price discounts simply because it purchases products that incorporate inventions in which it happens to hold a license. Furthermore, the government's rights attach only to the inventions created by federally funded research and do not necessarily extend to later inventions based on them. Thus, the government may have no rights in a next-generation invention that builds on federally funded technology if the new invention were not itself created by federally sponsored research. Few of the biomedical products that federal agencies most commonly buy appear to incorporate federally funded inventions. In 2001 the government had licensing rights in only 6 brand name drugs associated with the top 100 pharmaceuticals that VA procured and in 4 brand name drugs associated with the top 100 pharmaceuticals that DOD dispensed. GAO was unable to determine the extent to which the government had rights to other types of biomedical products because there are no databases showing the underlying patents for most of these products and such products may incorporate numerous components that might not be covered by identifiable patents. The federal government uses its licenses to biomedical inventions primarily for research; however, researchers generally do not document such usage. These licenses are valuable because researchers can use the inventions without concerns about possible challenges for unauthorized use. Neither VA nor DOD has used the government's licenses to procure biomedical products because they cannot readily determine whether products use federally funded technologies and they believe they already receive favorable pricing through the Federal Supply Schedule and national contracts.

Increasingly, this situation was a source of dissatisfaction because of a  general belief that technology resulting from federally funded research  was not being transferred to U.S. businesses for developing new or  improved commercial products. For example, there were concerns that  biomedical and other technological advances resulting from federally  funded research at universities were not leading to new products because  the universities had little incentive to seek uses for inventions to which  the government held title. Additionally, the complexity of the rules and  regulations and the lack of a uniform policy for these inventions often  frustrated those who did seek to use the research.", "In 1980, the Congress enacted two laws that have fostered the transfer of  federal technology to U.S. businesses. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology  Innovation Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-480, Oct. 21, 1980) promoted the transfer of  technology from federal laboratories to the private sector. The Bayh-Dole  Act (P.L. 96-517, Dec. 12, 1980) gave universities, nonprofit organizations,  and small businesses the option to retain title to inventions developed  with federal funding. It also authorized federal agencies to grant exclusive  licenses to patents on federally owned inventions that were made at  federal laboratories or that federal agencies patented after a federal  funding recipient opted not to retain title.", "To protect the public\u2019s interest in commercializing federally funded  technology, the Bayh-Dole Act required, among other things, that a  contractor or grantee that retains title to a federally funded invention  (1) file for patent protection and attempt commercialization and  (2) comply with certain reporting requirements. The act also specified  that the government would retain \u201ca nonexclusive, nontransferable,  irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf  of the United States any subject invention throughout the world.\u201d", "The Bayh-Dole Act did not give large businesses the right to retain title  to their federally funded inventions. Subsequently, in February 1983,  President Reagan issued a memorandum on patent policy to executive  agency heads stating that, to the extent permitted by law, the  government\u2019s policy is to extend the policy enunciated in the Bayh-Dole  Act to all federally funded inventions arising under research and  development contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements. In April 1987,  President Reagan issued Executive Order 12591, which, among other  things, requires executive agencies to promote the commercialization of  federally funded inventions in accordance with the 1983 memorandum.", "Our 1999 report noted that federal agencies were not always aware of  the government\u2019s licenses and could not tell us the circumstances under  which these licenses had been employed.

There are two primary ways in which the government can use its right  to practice an invention in which it has retained a license. First, the  government can contract with a third party to make a product that  incorporates the invention for or on behalf of the government without  either the government or the contractor being liable for patent  infringement. It is our understanding that this right has never been  invoked for biomedical products. Second, the government can use the  invention itself without obtaining a license from or paying a royalty to  the patent owner.

The Bayh-Dole Act provides  that the license is \u201cnontransferable,\u201d which means that the government  may not sell or otherwise authorize another to practice an invention in  its stead. This concept is not unique to the Bayh-Dole Act. Such language  appears frequently in patent practice, where nonexclusive licensing  agreements are typically construed as restricting assignment of the  license without the licensor\u2019s consent. In the Bayh-Dole Act, the term  \u201cnontransferable\u201d is followed immediately by qualifying text\u2014language  that allows the government to authorize others to practice the invention  for or on its behalf but which restricts the purposes for which it may  do so.", "Federal agencies typically have authorized contractors to use the  government\u2019s license to develop and produce mission-critical hardware,  such as a weapon system. This use of the government\u2019s license satisfies  a legitimate federal governmental need in support of a congressionally  authorized program.", "Such linkages to an agency\u2019s mission are less prevalent when grants or  cooperative agreements are used, as is typically the case with NIH, which  sponsors biomedical research to benefit the public health. This research  serves the public good through biomedical advances from publishing  scientific results and developing new technology that improve people\u2019s  life. This good may represent a sufficient government need for NIH to  authorize its grantees to use the government\u2019s license as a basis for using  federally funded inventions in their research. However, according to a  senior NIH attorney, NIH does not use this rationale to authorize grantees  to exercise the government\u2019s licenses and has not included a clause in  its grant agreements authorizing the use of federally funded inventions  as part of the research. As a result, NIH\u2019s grantees might be sued for  infringement and must negotiate any licensing agreements they believe  they need to support their work. Furthermore, the government\u2019s license  to use a federally funded invention generally does not apply to HHS\u2019s  purchases of drugs and vaccines because (1) HHS has never contracted  for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical made with federal funds for the  government\u2019s use and (2) HHS\u2019s funding assistance for acquiring drugs or  vaccines for distribution is intended to assist the states\u2019 public health  services, rather than to meet a federal agency\u2019s need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Government Is Not Automatically Entitled to Price Discounts", "paragraphs": ["The \u201cpaid-up license\u201d that the Bayh-Dole Act specifically confers on the  federal government is often referred to as a \u201croyalty-free license.\u201d The  term \u201croyalty-free\u201d license (and even \u201cpaid-up license\u201d) has sometimes  been misinterpreted in a way that effectively eliminates the conditions set  forth in the statute. The license for which the federal government is \u201cpaid  up\u201d entitles it to practice an invention itself, or to have others practice the  invention on the government\u2019s behalf. The statute does not give the federal  government the far broader right to purchase, \u201coff the shelf\u201d and royalty  free (i.e., at a discounted price), products that happen to incorporate a  federally funded invention when they are not produced under the  government\u2019s license."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Government\u2019s License May Not Extend to Related Inventions", "paragraphs": ["An invention rarely represents a completely new form of technology  because the inventor almost always has used \u201cprior art\u201d in developing  the ideas that led to an invention. Prior art is the intellectual basis\u2014the  knowledge base\u2014upon which the novelty of an invention is established  or the basis that determines whether the \u201cinvention\u201d would have been  obvious to one skilled in the art. In making an invention, an inventor  typically would build on the prior art in the particular technology, and  some of this prior art might have been developed by either government  scientists or federal funding recipients. However, an intellectual property  interest in prior art does not in and of itself give one an interest in  someone else\u2019s subsequent invention.", "Also, an invention often is part of a family of related inventions. One  research project may spawn multiple inventions that, for example, are  separate and distinct or are further developments of a basic invention  for specific applications. Similarly, the idea on which the original  invention is based may trigger new inventions. The question of whether  the government has an interest in later inventions also arises in instances  involving the same technologies when the patents to these inventions are  related in some fashion. Patents may be related because they protect  inventions springing from the same essential technologies or scientists  discover additional uses for an invention. For example, while a patent  application is pending at USPTO, the applicant may decide to clarify the  description of an invention because what initially was viewed as a single  invention is found to be two or more inventions or because the USPTO  patent examiner determines that patent application claims must be  separated and independently supported.", "Whether the government has the right to practice an invention because it  retains a license to use it under the Bayh-Dole Act depends upon whether  the invention was developed with federal funding and is, therefore, subject  to the act. An invention is a \u201csubject invention\u201d if it is conceived or first  actually reduced to practice \u201cin the performance of work under a funding  agreement\u201d (contract, grant, or cooperative agreement) to which the act  applies. Rights to the parent patent do not automatically generate rights  vis-\u00e0-vis related subsequent patents. In this regard, the government is not  entitled to any different protection than other entities that fund research.", "There is one exception to the general rule that inclusion depends upon  whether each invention was itself conceived or first actually reduced to  practice in performing federally funded research. This exception holds  that while the owner of a \u201cdominant patent\u201d can block the unlicensed  use of that patent and related patents, the owner may not assert that  patent either to deprive its licensee\u2019s right to a \u201csubservient patent\u201d or,  similarly, block the government\u2019s license to use a subservient patent for  a federally funded invention. Thus, if the owner of a dominant patent  subsequently makes a new invention in the course of work under a federal  contract or other federal assistance, the owner cannot assert the dominant  patent to frustrate the government\u2019s exercise of its license to use the  second invention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Government Appears to Hold Few Licenses to the Biomedical Products It Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Although determining the extent to which the government has licenses  in biomedical products is difficult, the number appears to be small.

Thus, they have no way to  readily determine which patented technologies have been used or whether  the government had an interest in them. However, the NIH officials cited  additional reasons why NIH researchers seldom obtain licenses to conduct  research: First, NIH researchers may not really need a license because  they can work with the underlying principles behind the technology simply  by using the information that has been published. Second, there is a  prevailing practice not to enforce patent rights among federal agencies  and nonprofit organizations that conduct academic research. Third, under  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, federal agencies cannot be enjoined from using patented  technology in conducting research; the patent owner\u2019s only recourse is to  sue the government for a reasonable royalty.", "An Army patent attorney told us that he advises researchers to inform him  of any patented technologies they are using in their research. He also said,  however, that this does not always happen in practice and that he and the  researchers generally are not aware of a potentially infringing use until the  patent owner informs them. At that time, he researches the matter and  seeks permission, obtains a license, or informs the patent owner of the  government\u2019s interest if there is one. Because the attorney does not have  records on government licenses, he has to research each case individually.  He added that he had invoked the privileges of the licenses for research  purposes but could not readily tell us how often this had occurred.", "A VA official said that, like NIH, VA researchers usually do not know  whether the technology they use for research is patented. Furthermore,  information about the government\u2019s interest in the development of  products is difficult to obtain because extensive research would be  required. She said that VA procures some research materials using  Material Transfer Agreements with universities.

Concerning the availability of the experimental use exception to a  university, the court ruled that the experimental use exception is very  narrow and strictly limited, extending only to experimental uses that are  not in furtherance of the infringer\u2019s legitimate business and are solely  for the infringer\u2019s amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strictly  philosophical inquiry. The court also stated that the profit or nonprofit  status of the user is not determinative of whether the use qualifies for the  experimental use exception.

In addition, VA and DOD  procurement officials informed us that they do not have agencywide data  showing the most frequently purchased items because many devices are  purchased at the local level.", "Because of these limitations, we identified five medical devices for  which the VA Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2014a major procurer of  medical devices\u2014had spent more than $1 million during fiscal year 2002.  This approach also provided only limited information. We examined the  government\u2019s rights to each device by identifying it in the General Services  Administration\u2019s on-line supply catalog, which includes the items on  the Federal Supply Schedule, and reviewing the corresponding item  descriptions. However, we found that the catalog does not provide patent  or licensing information for any of the products. We also were unable to  determine from the USPTO patent database the specific patents used for  each medical device. Finally, our examination of product Web sites found  that they do not provide information on the products\u2019 patented  technologies or address whether the government has license rights  to them.", "To examine how the government has used its licenses to federally funded  inventions, we interviewed DOD, NIH, and VA officials who procure  biomedical products or who are involved in scientific research. Also, we  researched relevant statutes and case law and met with knowledgeable  officials in NIH and industry to determine whether a general research  exception exists regarding patent infringement that applies to government  and other researchers conducting research for purely scientific reasons.", "We conducted our work from April 2002 through April 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. We did not  independently verify the data that VA, DOD, or NIH provided or the data  obtained from the USPTO and FDA databases. However, agency officials  addressed each of our questions regarding their data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The Top 100 Pharmaceuticals Procured by VA on the Basis of Dollar Value, Fiscal Year 2001", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: The Top 100 Pharmaceuticals Dispensed by DOD on the Basis of Dollar Value, July 1, 2001\u2013June 30, 2002", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the National Institutes of Health", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the National Institutes of Health\u2019s  letter dated April 22, 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We agree with NIH that federal agencies have unrestricted rights to  use a federally funded invention for government purposes. It has,  indeed, a \u201cnontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license\u201d to practice the  invention. Or it may authorize someone to practice the invention on its  behalf. However, these rights cannot be taken so as to undermine the  rights that the Bayh-Dole Act clearly intends to accord to inventors.  Specifically, the government\u2019s license permits it to practice the  invention to meet its needs, i.e., to meet needs that are reasonably  associated with the requirements of federal programs, not to act  outside of those constraints that normally distinguish public- from  private-sector activities.  2.  We deleted the footnote.  3.  We deleted \u201cgenerally\u201d from the sentence.   4.  We disagree. Related issues have been discussed in several court  decisions. See, for example, AMP, Inc. v. United States, 389 F.2d 448,  454 (Ct. Cl. 1968), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 964 (1968). Regarding NIH\u2019s  concern that adherence to these cases might have a chilling effect on  the willingness of private entities to participate as funding recipients,  we point out that the parties can negotiate intellectual property rights  dealing with these issues on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the  scope of any exception is limited as required to permit use of the  government\u2019s license in the subservient patent."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
