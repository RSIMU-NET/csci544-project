While it formerly used only interest rate differences across bonds to derive expected loss rates, it now uses corporate bond default data, adjusted for trends in interest rates, to predict defaults and makes assumptions regarding recoveries to estimate expected loss rates. As the figure shows, expected loss rates fell under the new approach: they were higher across risk rating categories in fiscal year 2002 (the last year that the former method was used) than in fiscal year 2005. This drop has contributed to lower Ex-Im Bank projections of subsidy costs and budget needs. OMB's current method for estimating expected loss rates involves challenges and lacks transparency. Estimating such losses on developing country financing is inherently difficult, and OMB's shift to using corporate default data has some basis, given the practices of some other financial institutions and limitations in other data sources. However, the corporate default data's coverage of developing countries has historically been limited, and their predictive value for Ex-Im Bank losses is not yet established. OMB's method generally predicts lower defaults than the corporate default data it used, whereas more recent corporate data show higher default rates. At the same time, OMB has assumed increasingly lower recovery rates, which serve to somewhat offset the lower default expectations, but the basis for the recovery rates and the changes over time has not been transparent. In addition, despite the method's complexity, OMB developed it independently and provided affected agencies with limited information about its basis or structure."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the official U.S. export credit agency (ECA), charged with providing  financing to facilitate U.S. exports, the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank)  issues loans, guarantees, and insurance products to foreign governments  and corporations, primarily in developing countries.

Ex-Im Bank\u2019s mandate states that it  should not compete with the private sector but rather assume the credit  and country risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept.  Ex-Im Bank offers various financial products, such as direct loans, loan  guarantees, export credit insurance, and working capital guarantees, to  foreign buyers of U.S. goods and services and to U.S. exporters. In the last  decade, new Ex-Im Bank authorizations of loans, guarantees, and  insurance averaged nearly $12 billion per year.", "Because of its mandate, a large percentage of Ex-Im Bank\u2019s business is with  developing country borrowers that are typically considered more risky  than borrowers in developed countries. Nearly 80 percent of Ex-Im Bank\u2019s  medium- and long-term exposure at the end of fiscal year 2003 was to  borrowers from low- and middle-income countries. According to Ex-Im  Bank officials, the types of borrowers it finances within countries have  shifted over the last decade: whereas Ex-Im Bank historically financed  foreign government (sovereign) purchases of U.S. exports, its new  financing is now primarily for purchases by private sector borrowers. This  shift is gradually being reflected in Ex-Im Bank\u2019s portfolio of outstanding  credits, which at the end of fiscal year 2003 included about 36 percent in  financing to sovereign governments, about 46 percent in financing to  foreign corporations, and about 18 percent in financing to public sector,  nonsovereign borrowers.", "Both sovereign and private borrowers present some risk of failing to meet  payment obligations (i.e., defaulting), potentially causing a financial loss  for Ex-Im Bank and the U.S. government.In 1990, to more accurately  measure the cost of federal credit programs, the government enacted credit  reform, which required agencies that provide domestic or international  credit, including Ex-Im Bank, to estimate and request appropriations for  the long-term net losses, or subsidy costs, of their credit activities.According to credit reform, Ex-Im Bank incurs subsidy costs when  estimated payments by the government (such as loan disbursements)  exceed estimated payments to the government (such as principal  repayments, fees, interest payments, and recovered assets), on a present  value basis over the life of the loan. For each credit activity, Ex-Im Bank  assesses the potential future losses based on the risk of the activity. It  collects up-front fees or charges borrowers higher interest rates, or both, to  offset that loss and receives subsidy appropriations to cover remaining  losses.", "Credit reform requires credit agencies to have budget authority to cover  subsidy costs before entering into loans or loan guarantees. Credit  agencies, in their annual appropriations requests, estimate the expected  subsidy costs of their credit programs for the coming fiscal year. Credit  reform also requires agencies to annually reestimate subsidy costs of  previous financing activity based on updated information. When  reestimated subsidy costs exceed agencies\u2019 original subsidy cost estimates,  the additional subsidy costs are not covered by new appropriations but  rather are funded from permanent, indefinite budget authority.", "To estimate their subsidy costs, credit agencies estimate the future  performance of direct and guaranteed loans. Agency management is  responsible for accumulating relevant, sufficient, and reliable data on  which to base these estimates. To estimate future loan performance,  agencies generally have cash flow models, or computer-based  spreadsheets, that include assumptions about defaults, prepayments,  recoveries, and the timing of these events and are based on the nature of  their own credit program. Agencies that provide credit to domestic  borrowers generally develop these cash flow assumptions, which OMB  reviews, based on their historical experiences. For U.S. international  credits, OMB provides the expected loss rates, which are composed of  default and recovery assumptions, that agencies should use to estimate  their subsidy costs.", "The determination of expected loss rates for federal agencies that provide  international credit has two components: the assignment of risk ratings for  particular borrowers or transactions and the determination of loss rates for  each rating category, according to the maturity of the credit. Both of these  components, and their relationship to one another, are important in  determining overall expected losses. For Ex-Im Bank, risk ratings are  determined partly through an interagency process and partly by Ex-Im  Bank\u2019s risk management division. The appropriateness of these ratings is a  key determinant in the overall appropriateness of Ex-Im Bank\u2019s subsidy  cost estimations.", "Through the Interagency Country Risk Assessment System (ICRAS),which OMB chairs, ICRAS agencies determine risk ratings that will be in  effect each fiscal year (see box 1 in fig. 1). There are two types of ICRAS  ratings\u2014one for foreign government (sovereign) borrowers and one for the  private sector climates in foreign countries. Ratings range from 1 (least  risky) to 11 (most risky). Ratings for sovereign borrowers are based on  macroeconomic indicators, such as indebtedness levels; balance-of\u00ad payments factors; and political and social factors. In determining ratings,  the agencies take into account country risk ratings assigned by private  sector ratings agencies and by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD). Private sector ratings assigned through the  ICRAS process also take into account factors such as the banking system  and legal environment in a country. Ex-Im Bank generally authorizes, with  few exceptions, new business for borrowers with ICRAS ratings of 8 or  better. (App. IV contains more information about the ICRAS risk rating  process.)", "For Ex-Im Bank\u2019s financing with foreign governments, the ICRAS sovereign  risk rating applies. For Ex-Im Bank\u2019s private sector lending, Ex-Im Bank  officials assign risk ratings. According to Ex-Im Bank officials, they use  private rating agency ratings for a corporation when the ratings are  available, which is the case for a minority of borrowers. For most private  sector borrowers, Ex-Im Bank officials use the private sector ICRAS rating  as a baseline and adjust that rating depending on their assessment of the  borrower\u2019s creditworthiness.", "For the second component, OMB plays a key role. It determines expected  loss rates for each ICRAS risk rating and maturity, which U.S. agencies that  provide international credit use in preparing their subsidy cost estimates  (see fig. 1, box 2). OMB provides these loss rates to ICRAS agencies each  fiscal year, in time to be used in preparing budget submissions. To  estimate future cash flows, ICRAS agencies use OMB\u2019s expected loss rates  in their cash flow models. The loss rates are also used to allocate subsidy  costs during the fiscal year and to calculate subsidy cost reestimates at the  end of the fiscal year. OMB also provides agencies with a credit subsidy  calculator, which has been audited, that agencies use to convert agency\u00ad estimated cash flows into present values.", "The credit reform act resulted in the establishment of a special budget  accounting system to track inflows and outflows associated with agencies\u2019  lending activities. Expected long-term subsidy costs for financing activities  in a fiscal year appear in an agency\u2019s annual budget submission and are  subject to congressional approval. However, any increases over time in  expected subsidy costs for financing that took place in earlier years are  financed from permanent indefinite budget authority and do not have to be  appropriated in the annual appropriations process. In the case of Ex-Im  Bank, such changes could result, for example, from changes in the risk  assessment for certain countries or changes in loss assumptions for a given  risk level. (App. V contains additional information about the credit reform  budget accounting system.)", "In addition to estimating expected losses for budgetary purposes, Ex-Im  Bank measures the expected loss of its portfolio in its own annual audited  financial statements.

In  developing its current approach, OMB cited emerging academic literature  that indicated its former approach may have overestimated likely costs to  the government. Ex-Im Bank officials also said they believed, based on  their reestimates, that their subsidy cost appropriations had been too high  relative to their loss experience since the beginning of credit reform.

Interest rate spreads are an  indicator of expected loss, in that the size of a spread tends to widen as the  perceived risk increases. For example, when interest rates on a foreign  bond are 6 percent and U.S. Treasury bond interest rates are 5 percent, the  spread between the two is 1 percentage point. The foreign bond in this  example provides a higher rate of interest than the U.S. Treasury bond  because creditors require a higher return on their capital, at least in part  because they perceive that foreign bonds carry a higher risk of non\u00ad repayment.", "Spreads fluctuate over time depending in part on changes in market views  of borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. Figure 2 shows interest rate spreads for  Argentine, Russian, and Mexican government bonds over U.S. Treasury  bonds from 1999-2003, illustrating how spreads can fluctuate. Spreads  increased sharply in 2001 for the Argentine bonds, as Argentina\u2019s default on  those bonds was imminent. Conversely, the spread for the Russian bonds  shown narrowed over the period as Russia\u2019s economy improved, while the  spreads for the Mexican bonds were consistently the smallest of the three  countries.", "OMB has used varying underlying instruments to calculate bond spreads  and expected losses for ICRAS agencies. In the beginning of credit reform,  OMB used the spreads on U.S. corporate bonds at different risk levels to  estimate risk premia (and thus expected loss). That is, OMB determined  the interest rate spread for U.S. corporate bonds within a risk rating  category and used those spreads to compute a risk premium for each  ICRAS category. In fiscal year 1997, OMB began using the interest rate  spreads on other instruments, including foreign government bonds.", "After interest rates on some types of international bonds rose in the late  1990s, OMB determined that basing expected loss rates only on interest  rate spreads resulted in estimates that were too high. According to OMB, it  was decided in the discussions within the executive branch and with  Congress leading to credit reform that only the expected cost to the  government was relevant for estimating default losses to the government  under credit reform. OMB decided to change its method for determining  default losses, primarily because emerging research showed that factors  other than expected losses from defaults account for a significant portion  of interest rate spreads. According to this literature, differences in  liquidity and tax considerations, and an aspect of credit risk that OMB  termed \u201cportfolio risk,\u201d affect interest rates on international bonds.", "Studies cited by OMB and other related literature indicate that factors  other than expected losses from defaults account for a high proportion of  interest rate spreads\u2014in some cases, most of the spread\u2014especially on  higher-quality bonds. For bonds with risk ratings that correspond to the  riskier ICRAS rating categories, 5 and higher (riskier), conclusions from the  literature that OMB cited and other literature that we reviewed are less  clear. One study cited by OMB found that differences in tax treatment, and  compensation for risk beyond expected losses, explained most of interest  rate spreads; however, because of limited data, that study did not include  bonds in risk categories higher than those corresponding to ICRAS  category 4. A second study cited by OMB found that market interest rate  spreads on bonds were greater than those that would be predicted based  on corporate default data. The differences were particularly apparent for  bonds in investment-grade categories and were smaller for speculative\u00ad grade bonds.", "For the fiscal year 2002 budget, OMB imposed an across-the-board  reduction in the expected loss estimates for ICRAS risk categories 1  through 8. OMB said that it did this to eliminate part of the spread  between other bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds to come closer to measuring  only default cost. The risk factors and expected loss estimates for the  bottom three categories did not change.", "A further rationale for adjusting the expected loss rates, according to Ex- Im Bank officials, was that the bank had calculated several downward  reestimates of its subsidy costs since the inception of credit reform. They  viewed this as evidence that the bank\u2019s original subsidy cost estimates were  conservative. According to Ex-Im Bank officials, several factors influence  the bank\u2019s subsidy cost reestimates, including changes in the outstanding  balance of its cohorts (the term \u201ccohort\u201d refers to the financing extended in  a given fiscal year, which Ex-Im Bank further subdivides by product type);  changes in cohort performance or average riskiness; and changes in OMB\u2019s  expected loss rates. Ex-Im Bank calculated a net downward reestimate of  about $368 million in fiscal year 1999, followed by a larger net downward  reestimate of about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2000 and a subsequent net  downward reestimate of about $300 million in fiscal year 2001. (In these  years, upward reestimates of some cohorts were more than offset by larger  downward reestimates of other cohorts.) There were small net downward  and upward reestimates in fiscal years 1992 through 1995, and Ex-Im Bank  did not calculate reestimates in fiscal years 1996 through 1998. Ex-Im  Bank\u2019s reestimates represent the bank\u2019s ongoing assessment of the  riskiness of its post-credit reform financing at a given point in time and are  not a final assessment of the performance of cohorts that have not reached  maturity at the time of the reestimate.

Instead, it uses spread information as a  signal of how current market conditions might differ from those reflected  in the Moody\u2019s historical data. The model is designed to adjust historical  default rates by rating category up or down in cases where interest rate  spreads in a category are unusually high or low relative to the average  spreads for that category. The adjustment in the model gives greater  weights to more recent spreads in calculating the averages.

Because Ex-Im Bank prepares its financial statements according to private  sector, rather than federal, accounting principles, there has always been  some difference between the bank\u2019s subsidy cost and loss allowance  estimates. This is because of differences in the treatment of fee income  between private sector and federal accounting approaches. While Ex-Im  Bank is not required to use OMB loss rates when calculating financial  statement loss allowances, Ex-Im Bank officials said that they had  historically chosen to do so in order to link the loss estimates prepared for  budget purposes with the financial statement loss allowances. However, in  its 2002 financial statement, Ex-Im Bank began applying higher loss rates  than OMB\u2019s loss rates to most of its portfolio. Ex-Im Bank officials said that  with the modification, its approaches to calculating subsidy costs and loss  allowances differ not only in fee treatment but also in their expectations of  loss.", "According to Ex-Im Bank officials, the bank modified its financial  statement loss allowance methodology for two reasons. First, Ex-Im Bank  discussed with its new auditors, Deloitte & Touche, the bank\u2019s approach for  accounting for guarantees and insurance, which comprise a majority of the  bank\u2019s portfolio. They determined that relevant accounting standards  suggested that it would be appropriate to record these credits at their fair  market value. This called for using different loss rates than those derived  using OMB\u2019s current methodology, which focuses on credit loss. Second,  the bank determined that it should value its impaired credits in a manner  more consistent with relevant accounting standards. Deloitte & Touche  observed that Ex-Im Bank had not historically separated its portfolio into  impaired and unimpaired groupings in accordance with accounting  guidance, even though a significant portion of these loans and claims were  likely impaired. Total loans and claims represented, on average, about 24  percent of the bank\u2019s total exposure during fiscal years 1999-2003.", "In addition, when initially estimating its 2002 loss allowances using its  former approach and OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2003 loss rates, Ex-Im Bank  determined that its allowances would have dropped substantially, from  about $10 billion for 2001 to about $6 billion for 2002, a decrease of about  40 percent. Because of the size of the reduction and the importance of loss  allowances as an overall reflection of an institution\u2019s expected loss from  year to year, the bank\u2019s auditor identified this as a key area to be reviewed.", "Ex-Im Bank\u2019s approach for calculating its loss allowances, beginning with  the 2002 financial statement, used different loss rate methodologies for  different parts of its portfolio and distinguished between impaired and  unimpaired credits. To determine the loss allowances for its impaired  loans and claims and for all of its loan guarantees and medium- and long\u00ad term insurance, Ex-Im Bank applied higher loss rates than those that were  used in 2001. These higher rates were used to calculate about 95 percent of  the 2002 loss allowance. Ex-Im Bank had asked OMB to provide these  higher rates using its former, spread-based methodology. Ex-Im Bank  officials stated that the spread-based loss rates were more appropriate for  its outstanding guarantees and insurance because they provided a more  market-based valuation that was better suited to a fair value presentation.  To determine the 2002 loss allowances for its unimpaired loans and claims,  Ex-Im Bank applied OMB\u2019s expected loss rates for the fiscal year 2004  budget. These rates were generally lower than the rates used to calculate  the loss allowance in 2001. For 2002, the bank\u2019s loss allowances were about  6 percent higher than their 2001 level.

If this is the case, then spreads might provide an adequate  forecast of default probabilities near the means of the Bloomberg data  set used in the regression but not for values of spreads that depart from  the mean spread in the regression data. This issue could be important  for the reliability of estimates for credits with ratings several categories  below the average in the Bloomberg data.

One component uses default  rates for corporate bonds published in 2000 by a nationally recognized  private rating agency, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, to calculate the  probability that ICRAS agency borrowers will default. It estimates default  probabilities for each ICRAS rating category by using one or more  underlying Moody\u2019s risk category. The other component uses data on  interest rate differences, or spreads, to vertically adjust the Moody\u2019s  corporate default rates by rating category when interest rate spreads are  unusually high or low relative to average spreads in that rating category.  Once it has determined default probabilities by ICRAS rating category, the  methodology applies a recovery rate assumption to derive expected loss  rates by rating category.", "We compared the default probabilities underlying OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2004  and 2005 expected loss rates for ICRAS categories 1 through 8 with the  Moody\u2019s corporate default data that OMB used in estimating these rates.  We determined that the OMB default probabilities were lower for each  ICRAS rating category in both fiscal years than were the underlying  Moody\u2019s default rates.
