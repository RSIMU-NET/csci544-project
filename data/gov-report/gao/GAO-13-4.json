Concern about the magnitude of JWST's cost increase and schedule delay and their effects on NASA's progress on other high-priority missions led conferees for the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, to direct GAO to report on the project. Specifically, GAO assessed (1) the extent to which NASA's revised cost and schedule estimates are reliable based on best practices, (2) the major risks and technological challenges JWST faces, and (3) the extent to which NASA has improved oversight of JWST. To do this, GAO compared NASA's revised cost and schedule estimates with best practice criteria, reviewed relevant contractor and NASA documents, and interviewed project and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has provided significantly more time and money to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) than previously planned and expressed high confidence in the project's new baselines. Its current cost estimate reflects some features of best practices for developing reliable and credible estimates. For example, the estimate substantially meets one of four cost characteristics--comprehensive--that GAO looks for in a reliable cost estimate, in part because all life cycle costs were included. The estimate, however, only partially met the other three characteristics--well documented, accurate, and credible--which detracts from its reliability. For example, the estimate's accuracy, and therefore the confidence level assigned to the estimate, was lessened by the summary schedule used for the joint cost and schedule risk analysis because it did not provide enough detail to determine how risks were applied to critical project activities. The estimate's credibility was also lessened because officials did not perform a sensitivity analysis that would have identified key drivers of costs, such as workforce size. Program officials believe that it would have been difficult to fully address all best practice characteristics. GAO believes there is time to improve the estimate and enhance the prospects for delivering the project according to plan.", "Project officials report that the JWST schedule has 14 months of reserve, which meets Goddard guidance for schedule reserve; however, only 7 of the 14 months are likely to be available for the last three of JWST's five complex integration and test efforts. GAO's prior work shows that the integration and test phases are where problems are commonly found and schedules tend to slip. Given that JWST has a challenging integration and test schedule, this could particularly be likely. The project has made some significant progress in the past year, notably successfully completing development of the 18 primary mirror segments--considered JWST's top technical risk. Nevertheless, ongoing challenges are indicative of the kinds of issues that can require significant effort to address. For example, instrument challenges have delayed the first integration and test effort. In addition, key long-term risks on subsystems with a significant amount of work remaining will not be retired until 2016. Currently, NASA's plan for project oversight calls for one independent mission-level system integration review about 13 months before launch. While this is consistent with what NASA requires for its projects, this approach may not be sufficient for a project as complex as JWST.", "JWST has taken several steps to improve communications and oversight of the project and its contractors--such as taking over responsibility for mission systems engineering from the prime contractor; instituting meetings that include various levels of NASA, contractor, and subcontractor management; and implementing a new risk management system to allow for better tracking of risks. The enhancements to the oversight of the project are steps in the right direction, but it will take time to assess their effectiveness and ensure that the efforts are sustained by the project in the future. Reductions in travel budgets, however, could require the project to adjust the oversight approach that was adopted as a result of the replan. Additional reductions in travel budgets are anticipated in future years, but officials do not have a plan to address such reductions and their potential impact on continuing the current oversight approach."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends NASA take six actions including, among others, to take steps to improve its cost estimate; to conduct an additional, earlier independent review of test and integration activities; and to develop a long-term oversight plan that anticipates planned travel budget reductions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is one of the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) most expensive and  technologically advanced science projects.

We did not assess the most current JWST  integrated master schedule because of ongoing negotiations for contract  modifications associated with the replan. To identify the major short and  long term risks and technological challenges facing the project, we  interviewed project officials for the major subsystems as well as  contractor officials. We also reviewed the project\u2019s risk database, monthly  status reviews, and other documentation provided by the project officials.  To understand the steps NASA implemented to improve the oversight  being performed on the project, we interviewed project and contractor  officials and reviewed documentation from independent reviews prior to  the replan and actions taken by NASA in response.

Prior to being approved for development, cost estimates  of the project ranged from $1 billion to $3.5 billion with expected launch  dates ranging from 2007 to 2011. In March 2005, NASA increased the  JWST\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate to $4.5 billion and slipped the launch date  to 2013. We reported in 2006 that about half of the cost growth was due  to schedule slippage\u2014a 1-year schedule slip because of a delay in the  decision to use a European Space Agency-supplied Ariane 5 launch  vehicle and an additional 10-month slip caused by budget profile  limitations in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. More than a third of the cost  increase was caused by requirements and other changes. An increase in  the program\u2019s contingency funding accounted for the remainder\u2014about  12 percent\u2014of the growth. NASA Headquarters chartered an  Independent Review Team to evaluate the project that same year. In April  2006, the review team\u2019s assessment confirmed that the program\u2019s  technical content was complete and sound, but expressed concern over  the project\u2019s contingency reserve funding\u2014funding used to mitigate  issues that arise but which were previously unknown\u2014reporting that it  was too low and phased in too late in the development life cycle. The  team reported that for a project as complex as the JWST, a 25 to 30  percent total contingency was appropriate. At that time, JWST\u2019s total  contingency was about 19 percent. The team cautioned that this  contingency compromised the project\u2019s ability to resolve issues, address  risk areas, and accommodate unknown problems. The team also  concluded that the 2013 launch date was not viable for the project based  on its anticipated budget. It recommended that before the project was  formally approved for development and baselined, NASA should take  steps to provide the JWST project with adequate time-phased reserve  funding to secure a stable launch date. Additional reserves were added  and the project was baselined in April 2009 with a life-cycle cost estimate  of $4.964 billion and a launch date in June 2014.", "Shortly after JWST was approved for development and its cost and  schedule estimates were baselined, project costs continued to increase.  In 2010, Senator Barbara Mikulski, chair of the Senate Committee on  Appropriations, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies, asked NASA to initiate another independent review in  response to the project\u2019s cost increases and reports that the June 2014  launch date was in jeopardy. The Independent Comprehensive Review  Panel (ICRP) was commissioned by NASA and began its review in  August 2010. In October 2010, the ICRP issued its report and cited  several reasons for the project\u2019s problems including management,  budgeting, oversight, governance and accountability, and communication  issues. The panel concluded JWST was executing well from a technical  standpoint, but that the baseline funding did not reflect the most probable  cost with adequate reserves in each year of project execution, resulting in  an unexecutable project. The review panel recommended that additional  resources be considered along with organizational and management  restructuring. Following this review, the JWST program underwent a  replan in 2011. In November 2011, the JWST project was reauthorized,  but not before it was recommended for termination by the House  Appropriations Committee. On the basis of the replan, NASA announced  that the project would be rebaselined at $8.835 billion\u2014a 78 percent  increase to the project\u2019s life-cycle cost from the confirmed baseline\u2014and  would launch in October 2018\u2014a delay of 52 months. The revised life- cycle cost estimate included 13 months of funded schedule reserve. In  the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2013 budget request, NASA reported a 66  percent joint cost and schedule confidence level associated with these  estimates.

This includes the development of software  that will translate data into usable formats as well as operation of the  software once the telescope is in space.

For example, as part of its  cost estimation process, the project conducted a joint cost and schedule  risk analysis, or joint cost and schedule confidence level (JCL), which  assigned a 66 percent confidence level to the estimate. In addition, we  found that the cost estimate included all life cycle costs for the project.  Although NASA\u2019s methods for developing the JWST cost estimate reflect  some features of best practices, our review of the estimate showed that  based on best practice criteria, it did not fully meet the four characteristics  of a reliable estimate. See figure 3.", "Specifically, the project\u2019s estimate was found to substantially meet the  best practice criteria for being comprehensive, and the remaining three  characteristics of being well documented, accurate, and credible were  found to be only partially met. For example, the accuracy of the cost  estimate, and therefore the confidence level assigned to the estimate,  was lessened by the schedule used in the JCL analysis because it  prevented us from, among other things, identifying the activities that were  on the critical path\u2014defined as time associated with activities that drive  the overall schedule. The credibility of the estimate was lessened  because project officials did not perform a sensitivity analysis that would  have identified key drivers of costs, such as workforce size. Although  NASA is not required to adhere to these best practices, our prior work has  shown that not following best practices for cost estimating can make the  cost estimate less reliable, putting projects at risk of experiencing cost  overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. The best  practices stem from practices federal cost estimating organizations and  industry use to develop and maintain reliable cost estimates, including the  Department of Defense and NASA. According to program officials, it  would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the project to have met all  of the best practice criteria given the complexity of the project and that  some elements of the project are quite mature in their development.  Instead, the program manager stated that the project followed a tailored  process to develop the cost estimate that was appropriate for the project.  Furthermore, officials report the project is currently meeting a majority of  its milestones and executing as planned to the revised estimates for the  JWST.", "A work breakdown structure reflects the requirements and what must be accomplished to  develop a program, and it provides a basis for identifying resources and tasks for  developing a program cost estimate. The work breakdown structure should be used to  define all program activities and tasks to ensure that the schedule encompasses the entire  work. two was not compatible. Finally, although the project outlined and  documented the ground rules and assumptions, we were unable to  determine whether risks associated with any assumptions were identified  and traced to specific elements.", "Well documented: The JWST cost estimate only partially met the criteria  for being well documented because it did not include a step-by-step  description of how the estimate was developed, the raw data used to  develop the estimate, or the calculations and estimating methodology for  specific cost elements of the work breakdown structure. Without good  documentation, a cost analyst unfamiliar with the program will not be able  to replicate the estimate, because he or she will not understand the logic  behind it. Good documentation, for example, assists management and  oversight in assessing the credibility of the estimate, helps to keep a  history of reasons for cost changes and to record lessons learned,  defines the scope of the analysis, and answers questions about the  approach or data used to create the estimate. Project documentation,  however, does provide evidence that NASA management reviewed and  accepted the cost estimate because managers were briefed on the  technical aspects of the estimate and were provided an overview of the  joint cost and schedule risk analysis that was conducted.", "Accurate: The JWST cost estimate only partially met the criteria for being  accurate because the projected costs of schedule reserve did not reflect  actual data, the summary schedule used to derive the JCL prevented us  from sufficiently understanding how risks were incorporated, and the  project did not provide evidence that it regularly updates the estimate or  plans to conduct another JCL. For example, using historical actual cost  data from Northrop Grumman, we estimated that 13 months of schedule  reserve is likely to be $204 million instead of NASA\u2019s estimate of $121  million\u2014a potential underestimation of 69 percent related to the schedule  reserve. Project officials, however, believe they have adequate reserves  available to offset any underestimation. In addition, the summary  schedule the project used as an input to the JCL, although deemed  acceptable by NASA, contained many long-duration activities, some with  1,000 days or more. Because of these long durations in the summary  schedule used for the JCL, the lack of detail prevented us from identifying  the activities that were on the critical path, as well as which risks were  applied to remaining activities. As a result, there is no way to ensure  that risks were appropriately assigned to activities in the schedule to  account for the impact of the risks during the JCL analysis.", "Finally, it was unclear whether the cost estimate was regularly updated to  reflect material changes in actual costs and in the project itself, such as  when schedules or other assumptions change, due to a lack of detailed  documentation for the cost estimate. Project officials stated that in  keeping with NASA policy they do not plan, nor are they required, to  conduct another JCL analysis. GAO\u2019s cost estimating best practices call  for estimates to be continually updated through the life of the project,  ideally every month as actual costs are reported in earned value  management reports, and that a risk analysis and risk simulation  exercise\u2014like the JCL analysis\u2014be conducted periodically through the  life of the program, as risks can materialize or change throughout the life  of a project. Unless properly updated on a regular basis, the cost estimate  cannot provide decision makers with accurate information to assess the  current status of the project. NASA officials state that the life-cycle cost  estimate is updated annually for the budgeting process, and that historical  records such as earned value data were used to develop the estimate.  They also stated that this information is updated in several different  documents being provided to management; however, we were unable to  determine how this information was used in updating the cost estimate on  a regular basis.", "Credible: The JWST cost estimate only partially met the criteria for being  credible because project officials did not adequately test and verify the  reasonableness of the cost estimate and the schedule used in conducting  the JCL did not have a valid critical path and contained durations that  were too long to properly account for risks. For example, project officials  said they did not perform a sensitivity analysis for the cost estimate. A  sensitivity analysis identifies key elements that drive cost and permits  analysis of different outcomes and is often used to develop cost ranges  and risk reserves. NASA officials stated that the largest cost driver for the  JWST project is the size of the workforce, which could have been  subjected to a sensitivity analysis; yet, the cost model did not include a  sensitivity analysis that would show how staff increasing or decreasing  over time affects cost. In addition, NASA officials believe that all risks  were sufficiently accounted for when conducting the JCL, however, the  software used to conduct the JCL analysis does not recognize certain  risks that officials had placed on activities in the project schedule and,  therefore, some risks were discarded during the simulation.", "The schedule used to conduct the JCL was also summarized at such a  high level that the durations were too long to effectively model the risks.  For example, one of the activities that drove the launch date was over 4  years in duration and should have been broken down further prior to  conducting the simulation. Moreover, the critical path in the JCL schedule  consisted of six level of effort activities all with the same duration of 2,238   Level of effort activities should never be on the critical  days in length.path because support activities should never drive any milestone finish  date. As a result of the schedule used in the JCL not fully meeting best  practices, we question the results of the analysis. Furthermore, the risk of  having to carry the JWST workforce to support the project if delayed was  not included since a sensitivity analysis was not performed. Project  officials report that, instead, risk associated with the workforce was  factored in when establishing cost reserves.", "In addition, project officials did not commission an independent cost  estimate, which is considered one of the best and most reliable estimate  validation methods because it shows whether other estimating  procedures produce similar results, and it provides an independent view  of expected program costs that tests the program office\u2019s estimate for  reasonableness.independent cost estimate has an increased risk of being underfunded   An estimate that has not been reconciled with an  because the independent cost estimate provides an objective and  unbiased assessment of whether the project estimate can be achieved.

This time could be used easily by the project if an issue were to  arise during integration and test.

As  shown in figure 6, the current spacecraft projected mass exceeds its  mass allocation.", "Primary drivers of the mass growth on the spacecraft are increases in the  estimated weight of the wiring harnesses, which distribute power and  electric signals between different parts of the observatory, the solar array,  and other structures that make up the spacecraft. The burden to find  ways to reduce mass has been primarily placed with the spacecraft  because it was assessed by the project to have the least technical risk  and because it is the least mature subsystem and can more easily  accommodate design changes. Over 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds, of  mass savings options are being evaluated by the project and Northrop  Grumman, which is developing the spacecraft. Potential mass solutions  have been identified by Northrop Grumman and the project; however,  cost and risk vary with each solution and the project is still evaluating the  trade-offs of the various solutions. Project officials stated that final  decisions for all tradeoffs will need to occur before spacecraft critical  design review in December 2013.", "The ISIM subsystem is experiencing technology and engineering  challenges that resulted in the use of 18 of ISIM\u2019s 26 months of schedule  reserve. The schedule for the instruments needed for ISIM continues to  slip, which could result in use of more schedule reserve. Based on the  replan, all four instruments were to be delivered by September 2012;  however, only two instruments were delivered by that time and those still  have issues that must be addressed. The remaining two instruments are  currently scheduled to be delivered at least 11 months late. See table 1  below for the instrument specific issues.", "In addition to the instrument delays, two other technical challenges  associated with ISIM are: (1) the detectors used by three of the four   instruments to capture infrared light in space are degrading and may  need to be replaced, resulting in the addition of another round of cryo- vacuum testing\u2014in which a test chamber is used to simulate the near  absolute zero temperatures in space, and (2) issues with the  development of the cryo-cooler system that removes heat and cools MIRI.  In December 2010 the project became aware that the detectors in three  of the instruments were degrading.million and 15 months of schedule reserve to replace the detectors were  included in the replan. These additions covered the cost of manufacturing  the detectors; fabrication, assembly, and test of new focal plane  assemblies; changing the detectors on three instruments, and the  addition of a third ISIM cryo-vacuum test. The manufacturing process for  new detectors takes approximately 30 months, which means that they  cannot be delivered until after the second round of ISIM cryo-vacuum  testing in 2014. As a result, $2 million of the $42 million in the replan was  used to add a third round of cryo-vacuum testing for ISIM. The third test  will validate the performance requirement of the ISIM and is the only time  the instruments are tested with the flight detectors. Changing the  detectors requires disassembling the instruments from ISIM, a process  that will risk damage to the structure and instruments. Project officials  stated that they will continue to monitor the degradation rate of the current  detectors because if the degradation rate is low, they may not replace the  detectors.", "As a result, approximately $42  Development issues with a part of the cryo-cooler needed for MIRI have  delayed its delivery to ISIM. In 2010, project officials realized that an  essential valve in the cryo-cooler was leaking at rates that exceeded  requirements. Following the results of a failure review board, the  contractor manufactured a newly designed valve, but it also did not meet  leak rate requirements. Project officials stated that a new valve design will  not be manufactured in time for use in the first ISIM cryo-vacuum test.  The project is concurrently developing three alternatives and authorized  manufacturing for one of the alternatives in October 2012. Project officials  stated that the MIRI cryo-cooler is particularly complex because it spans  approximately 10 meters\u2014or approximately 33 feet\u2014through the entire  JWST observatory. These issues combined required the use of 18  months of schedule reserve, which reduced ISIM\u2019s schedule reserve from  the 26 months established in the replan to 8 months before it is needed  for integration with the OTIS subsystem.", "These types of issues are not uncommon among NASA programs as  technical issues tend to arise when disparate parts are integrated and  tested together for the first time. Given the complexity and cutting edge  technology developed and used on JWST, it is expected that these kinds  of issues will continue to materialize as the program moves through its  complex integration and test program. Figure 7 shows the delay of  instrument deliveries as well as changes to the ISIM integration and test  and final delivery dates over the last year.", "Until the project is able to overcome the major issues with the instruments  and other parts of the ISIM, it is likely that the schedule would continue to  slip and may begin to affect the overall project schedule. ISIM still has 8  months of schedule reserve before the slipping of its schedule would  affect the schedule for the remainder of the project. The instrument,  detector, and cryo-cooler issues have all contributed to the delay in the  ISIM integration and test schedule and the reduction of objectives that  can be achieved in the first two rounds of cryo-vacuum testing. The first  round of testing will not include two instruments, a final design of the cryo- cooler hardware, or new detectors. As a result project officials will only be  able to gather risk reduction information on the FGS/NIRISS, MIRI, test  procedures, and test support equipment from the first cryo-vacuum test.", "The project also has several known long term risks and challenges  remaining. For example, risks related to OTIS, the sunshield, and the  ground system subsystems are not scheduled to be addressed until late  in project development. As of October 2012, seven of the top 10 project  risks were related to the long-term risks associated with the OTIS and  sunshield, most of which will not be resolved until 2016 or later. For  example, several risks relating to OTE are not scheduled to be closed  until the OTIS testing in the chamber at Johnson Space Center in  February 2017. Project officials are adding risk mitigation through early  and additional testing, where possible, to these subsystems. Prior to the  replan, the ground system software was at high risk for not being  completed before launch and many tasks were planned for completion  after launch. Space Telescope Science Institute officials stated that the  replan allows them to plan for completion of their work before launch on a  more realistic time schedule, which decreases schedule and operational  risk.

The intended outcome of the review  was 1) to obtain a snapshot of performance to determine if the program  was progressing in accordance with its plan, and 2) to identify leading  indicators for upper management to use when tracking future  performance.

It is also one of the most expensive,  with a recent major replan resulting in a total cost of $8.8 billion. The  reasons for cost and schedule growth were largely recognized by an  independent review team to be rooted in ineffective funding,  management, communication, and oversight. NASA has invested  considerable time and resources replanning the project and instituting  management and oversight improvements in order to ensure that it (1)  can be executed within its new estimates and (2) has addressed the  majority of issues raised in the recent independent review. It appears that  communications with contractors and within NASA have improved, that a  more robust risk mitigation system is in place, that more is known about  what it will take to complete the project and how much it will cost, and that  the project is currently meeting the majority of its milestones.  Nevertheless, over the course of the next several years, the project will  be executing a large amount of work with several extremely complex and  challenging integration and test efforts. Because three major test and  integration efforts must be completed in the last 2 years of the JWST  schedule, it is essential that issues are identified and addressed early  enough to be handled within the project\u2019s current schedule. While the  JWST oversight plan is consistent with NASA\u2019s requirements for all  project\u2019s required reviews, a single independent review scheduled just  over a year before launch may not be sufficient to identify and resolve  problems early for a project of this magnitude. A key element of  overseeing project progress is monitoring how the project is executing to  its cost baseline. To that end, while NASA took some steps that were in  line with best practices to develop its revised baseline, some of the  deficiencies we found in its process could impact the reliability of the cost  estimate and the joint cost and schedule confidence level that was  provided to headquarters decision-makers. Without higher-fidelity,  regularly updated information related to costs, as well as an oversight  regime during later phases of test and integration that is commensurate  with the complexity of that effort, NASA risks late identification of  technical and cost issues that could delay the launch of JWST and  increase project costs beyond established baselines. Also important to  oversight for the remainder of the project is the ability of officials to  sustain improvements to communication with and oversight of  contractors. Anticipated travel restrictions, however, could decrease the  project team\u2019s ability to sustain these actions.

In response to this  recommendation, NASA officials stated that the project currently receives  earned value data from some of its contractors and performs monthly  analysis of that data to understand the contractors\u2019 estimates at  completion, and then compares these numbers to similar figures  independently assessed by the JWST project. NASA also highlighted its  efforts to improve the agency\u2019s documentation of the earned value  variances and to extend the earned value management analysis to areas  where it is not yet implemented, such as ground systems development at  the Space Telescope Science Institute. In addition, NASA responded that  its annual budget process generates a requirements-driven budget plan  consistent with the rebaseline. NASA stated that this information is  updated in several different documents that are provided to management  and it does not plan to revise its JCL documentation developed during the  replan. Despite these steps, we could not independently confirm that they  were leading to an updated cost estimate, which is the basis of our  recommendation. If the estimate is not updated, it will be difficult to  analyze changes in project costs and collecting cost and technical data to  support future estimates will be hindered. Furthermore, if not properly  updated on a regular basis, the cost estimate cannot provide decision  makers with accurate information for assessing alternative decisions.  Without a documented comparison between the current estimate  (updated with actual costs) and the old estimate, the cost estimator  cannot determine the level of variance between the two estimates and  cannot see how the project is changing over time. Therefore, we continue  to believe NASA will be well served by following best practices and  updating its cost estimate with current information and documenting  reasons for any variances. We encourage the project to improve the cost  estimate documentation and record any reasons for variances between  planned and actual costs and we intend to review the documentation as a  part of our ongoing review of the project.", "NASA officials partially concurred with our recommendation that the  project conduct a sensitivity analysis on the number of staff working on  the project to determine how staff variations affect the cost estimate. In its  response, the agency stated that it believes it met the intent of this  recommendation when staffing levels were determined in the 2011 JWST  rebaseline based on programmatic experience from the accomplishment  of similar activities. To accommodate the possibility of increased costs  based on increased staffing hours, NASA reports that funded schedule  reserve was built into the JWST rebaseline, in addition to unallocated  future expenses being held at various levels of the organization. NASA  believes that these reserves will be sufficient to cover increases for the  duration of specific activities that result in increased staffing cost, and that  an additional workforce sensitivity analysis is not warranted. NASA added  that the joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis performed  provided a de facto workforce sensitivity analysis and does not plan any  further action. A joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis,  however, is not the same as a sensitivity analysis wherein the sources of  the workforce variation should be well documented and traceable. While  we appreciate the steps NASA took to account for workforce variation, the  JWST cost model does not show how staff levels increasing or  decreasing over time affects cost. Furthermore, best practices call for a  risk analysis to be conducted in conjunction with a sensitivity analysis, not  to be a substitute for it. As a best practice, a sensitivity analysis should be  included in all cost estimates because it examines the effects of changing  assumptions and ground rules. Since uncertainty cannot be avoided, it is  necessary to identify the cost elements that represent the most risk and, if  possible, cost estimators should quantify the risk. Without performing a  sensitivity analysis that reveals how the cost estimate is affected by a  change in a single assumption, such as workforce size, the cost estimator  will not fully understand which variable most affects the cost estimate.  Therefore, we continue to believe that NASA should conduct a sensitivity  analysis for the JWST project, given the large number of staff working on  the program, to determine how staff variations positively or negatively  affect the cost estimate rather than relying on schedule reserve and  unallocated future expenses to offset any shortfall.", "NASA concurred with our recommendation to perform an updated  integrated cost and schedule risk analysis using a schedule that meets  best practices and includes enough detail so that risks can be  appropriately mapped to activities and costs. In response to this  recommendation, NASA stated that the agency is already using tools and  a method to conduct programmatic assessments of projects after the  baseline was established using the JCL methodology. While these may  be good tools, the key point is the need to address shortcomings of the  schedule that supports the baseline itself. For example, the lack of detail  in the summary schedule used for the joint cost and schedule risk  analysis prevented us from sufficiently understanding how risks were  incorporated; therefore, we question the results of that analysis. Since the  JCL was a key input to the decision process of approving the project\u2019s  new cost and schedule baseline estimates, we maintain that the JWST  project should perform an updated JCL analysis using a schedule with  sufficient detail to map risks to activities and costs. Doing so could help  increase the reliability of the cost estimate and the confidence level of the  JCL. Furthermore, risk management is a continuous process that  constantly monitors a project\u2019s health. Given that JWST is many years  from launch and the risks that the project faces are likely to change, a risk  analysis should be conducted periodically throughout the life of the  project.", "NASA concurred with our recommendation to conduct a separate  independent review prior to the beginning of the OTIS and spacecraft  integration and test efforts. In response to this recommendation, NASA  stated that it will request members of the independent JWST Standing  Review Board participate in OTIS Pre-Environmental Review scheduled  prior to the beginning of OTIS environmental testing. A member of the  Standing Review Board will co-chair this review and report its findings to  the NASA Associate Administrator, which is the practice of all Standing  Review Board reviews.

While we agree that this change will move  the review earlier than previously planned, based on its response, NASA  still plans to hold the review after the observatory integration and test is  already underway. Holding this review after the observatory integration  and test effort is already underway does not meet agency policy and will  lessen the impact of the review as it may be inadequate to ensure key  technical and management issues are identified early enough to be  addressed.

After reviewing cost estimate  documentation submitted by NASA and conducting numerous interviews  with relevant sources within the project office, we calculated the  assessment rating of each criteria within the four characteristics by  assigning each individual assessment rating: Not Met = 1, Minimally Met  = 2, Partially Met = 3, Substantially Met = 4, and Met = 5. We then took  the average of the individual assessment ratings for the criteria to  determine the overall rating for each of the four characteristics. The  resulting average becomes the \u201cOverall Assessment\u201d as follows: Not Met  = 1.0 to 1.4, Minimally Met = 1.5 to 2.4, Partially Met = 2.5 to 3.4,  Substantially Met = 3.5 to 4.4, and Met = 4.5 to 5.0. We discussed the  results of our assessments with officials within the program office at  NASA headquarters and the project office at Goddard Space Flight  Center.", "We supplemented the assessment of the revised 2011 cost estimate with  an assessment of the summary schedule used for the JCL, which was a  part of the project\u2019s cost estimation process, and followed criteria laid out  in the GAO schedule guide. These practices address whether the  schedule (1) captured all activities; (2) sequenced all activities\u2014that is,  listed in the order in which they are to be carried out; (3) assigned  resources to all activities; (4) established the duration of all activities; (5)  integrated schedule activities horizontally and vertically, which identifies  whether products and outcomes associated with other sequenced  activities are arranged in the right order, and that varying levels of  activities and supporting subactivities are also aligned properly; (6)  established for all activities, the critical path, which is the longest  continuous sequence of activities that is necessary to examine the effects  of activities slipping in the schedule; (7) identified between activities float,  which is the amount of time by which a predecessor activity can slip  before the delay affects the program\u2019s estimated finish date; (8) identified  a level of confidence using a schedule risk analysis; and (9) was updated  using logic and durations to determine dates. We also reviewed the inputs  to the JCL model, the document outlining the methodology of the analysis  that accompanied the electronic files, and interviewed cognizant project  officials to discuss their use of the summary schedule.", "Because the project\u2019s detailed integrated master schedule has not been  finalized because of ongoing negotiations and contract modifications, we  did not conduct a complete schedule analysis using the GAO schedule  assessment guide. We plan to perform this assessment in a subsequent  review of the JWST project.", "To assess the major short- and long-term risks and technological  challenges facing the project, we reviewed the project\u2019s risk list, monthly  status reviews, and other documentation provided by projects and  contractor officials. This information covered the risks, mitigation plans,  and timelines for addressing risk and technological challenges. We also  interviewed project officials for each major observatory subsystems to  clarify information and to obtain additional information on risks and  technological challenges. Further, we interviewed officials from the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems,  Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Company, Teledyne Imaging  Sensors, the University of Arizona, and the Space Telescope Science  Institute concerning risks and challenges on the subsystems, instruments,  or components they were developing. We reviewed GAO\u2019s prior work on  NASA Large Scale Acquisitions, NASA Office of Inspector General  reports, and NASA\u2019s Space Flight Program and Project Management  Requirements and Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements   We compared NASA\u2019s controls as outlined in these  policy documents.agency policies with the project plan to assess the extent to which the  JWST\u2019s plan followed the intent of the policies with regard to independent  oversight and management approval processes.", "To assess the extent to which NASA is performing enhanced oversight of  the JWST project, we reviewed documentation from the Independent  Comprehensive Review Panel and the project to determine actions taken  by NASA in response to the panel\u2019s recommendations. We interviewed  project officials to understand the impact of these changes on the  oversight processes for the project and communication between the  project and its contractors. We also interviewed officials from the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems,  Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Company, Teledyne Imaging  Sensors, the University of Arizona, and the Space Telescope Science  Institute concerning project oversight of work they were performing and  the effectiveness of oversight changes. In addition, we reviewed a  presidential directive and Office of Management and Budget and project  documentation and interviewed project officials concerning the reductions  to travel budgets and their impact on project oversight activities. We  interviewed the Director of NASA\u2019s Office of Evaluation about a recent  internal review of the JWST project and reviewed documentation from  that review. We also reviewed documentation and interviewed project  officials concerning the changes made to the project\u2019s risk management  system.", "Our work was performed primarily at NASA Headquarters in Washington,  D.C., and Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. We also  visited Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
