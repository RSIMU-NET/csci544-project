IRS created the Fiscal Year 1995-2001 Business Master Plan (BMP) to incorporate IRS\u2019 vision and long-range objectives. The fiscal year 1996 BMP formalized IRS\u2019 \u201cmeasures hierarchy,\u201d which was intended to link IRS\u2019 mission, objectives, and annual performance goals with respective programs. For fiscal year 1997, IRS replaced the BMP with the Strategic Plan and Budget and the Annual Performance Plan.

IRS expects to use these documents to provide guidance to its field offices and to implement the Results Act.", "According to IRS, improving taxpayer service is one of its highest priorities, and it has a variety of programs and operational units to assist taxpayers in meeting their federal tax obligations. A primary source of taxpayer assistance is IRS\u2019 24 customer service centers, which are to answer calls from taxpayers who have questions about the tax laws, where to file returns, or the status of their accounts and refunds. According to IRS, in fiscal year 1996, the centers answered over 99 million taxpayer calls about tax law and procedures. Other sources of assistance include IRS\u2019 walk-in sites, taxpayer education and outreach programs, Problem Resolution Program, and Internet web site. According to IRS, about 440 walk-in sites helped almost 6.4 million taxpayers in fiscal year 1996 with tax forms, questions about their accounts, or preparing tax returns.", "In addition, over the past several months, IRS has been working to improve its measures and has consulted with many stakeholders. A task force has been formed with representatives from Treasury and OMB to develop a \u201cbalanced scorecard.\u201d", "IRS\u2019 taxpayer education and outreach programs assist millions of taxpayers at various community locations, often with the help of volunteers and nonprofit organizations. For example, almost 12.7 million taxpayers in fiscal year 1996 received free tax information and return preparation through IRS\u2019 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, Tax Counseling for the Elderly, and other outreach programs. The Problem Resolution Program staff assists taxpayers who have such problems as repeated unsuccessful attempts to resolve an issue or a pending IRS enforcement action that might cause undue hardship, such as the seizure of a taxpayer\u2019s property. Also, taxpayers may use the Internet to obtain forms and instructions, publications, information on tax topics, and press releases. According to IRS, its web site had 73 million \u201chits\u201d in fiscal year 1996.", "IRS has had several efforts under way to improve its performance measures. For example, the agency established the Measures Advisory Group, comprising field and National Office executives, in part to provide advice and recommendations on the agency\u2019s performance measures. As the group suggested, IRS recently developed three new performance measures for its customer service centers: (1) customers successfully served per dollars expended, (2) dollars collected per dollars expended, and (3) taxpayers gaining access to telephone assistance as a percentage of demand. IRS\u2019 September 30, 1997, Strategic Plan included the first measure as a strategic-level indicator for increasing productivity and the third measure as a strategic-level indicator for improving customer service.

Agencies are expected to set goals, measure performance, make needed improvements, and report results. The Results Act required executive agencies, no later than September 30, 1997, to have developed strategic plans covering a period of at least 5 years and have submitedt them to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Strategic plans are intended to be the framework for each agency\u2019s performance measurement system.

The burden estimate excludes the time and costs taxpayers face after they file their tax returns, such as responding to IRS notices and audits. Additionally, it is not linked to important IRS services to assist taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations. As a result, IRS\u2019 burden estimates may not reflect reductions in taxpayer burden that are attributable to these services.

In a recent draft issue paper, IRS identified several other shortcomings in the model, including weaknesses in the underlying assumptions of the model. For example, the model uses the number of lines on a form to estimate the form\u2019s burden, even though additional lines may make the form simpler or easier to understand. Also, the draft issue paper said that the 1983 data underlying the model are outdated and cited methodological errors in the development of the model.", "The limitations of the taxpayer burden measure affect IRS\u2019 mission effectiveness indicator because taxpayer burden is one of the four elements of this indicator. The indicator compares total revenue collected during a fiscal year, less the cost of collecting the revenue (the sum of IRS\u2019 budget and estimated taxpayers\u2019 costs) with the revenue that should have been collected if all taxpayers had paid their full liability.

However, according to IRS, no contractors were interested in doing the work.", "The lack of response to IRS\u2019 request may reflect the difficulty of measuring overall compliance burden. In our December 9, 1994, testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight, House Committee on Ways and Means, we discussed the difficulties of measuring taxpayer burden and reported that a reliable estimate of the overall burden taxpayers incur to comply with the tax laws was not available. As a part of our study, we spoke with several business and tax professionals, who told us that the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code, compounded by the frequent changes made to the Code, is part of what makes federal tax compliance so burdensome.", "Recently, IRS initiated another effort to obtain a contractor to develop an improved burden measurement model and is now in the initial stages of determining contractor interest. In the short term, IRS plans to expand its current measure of taxpayer burden to include contact and enforcement burden, such as the burden taxpayers incur when responding to IRS notices, telephone calls, and audits.", "Despite recognizing the shortcomings in the current taxpayer burden measure, IRS has set goals for reducing burden based on the measure. It then rolls these goals up into its mission effectiveness indicator. To show progress through this indicator, IRS must reduce the number of lines on tax forms or worksheets, reduce the number of words and pages in instructions, or take actions that affect the variables in the Little model. However, the model does not distinguish between lines on forms that add to burden and lines that reduce the burden by making the calculation of tax liability easier. Unless additional analysis is done to assess how eliminating particular lines on forms affects burden, IRS could take actions to meet its goals that actually increase taxpayer burden. Furthermore, most IRS customer service programs have no effect on IRS\u2019 measure of taxpayer burden.", "Devising a comprehensive measure to gauge the costs taxpayers incur to meet their federal tax obligations is a difficult task and offers a significant challenge for IRS. First, IRS would need to devise a means to capture the costs taxpayers incur after they file their returns. This may be difficult to do, because the costs could vary substantially depending on the circumstances of the different taxpayers. For example, providing information to support a tax return may not cost very much when compared to the cost of preparing for and responding to an audit. Second, because of the limitations of the Little model, IRS must decide whether to revise the model or to devise another means to estimate the costs taxpayers incur to prepare and file their tax returns. Third, IRS must measure the elements of burden it can influence as opposed to the burden caused by such things as changes in the tax code. A reliable taxpayer burden measure would allow IRS to make decisions on how to allocate resources to best reduce the burdens taxpayers face to meet their tax obligations. Finally, as IRS refines its taxpayer burden measure, it will be faced with devising an efficient means for collecting and analyzing the data to measure burden over time.

IRS\u2019 1997 Annual Performance Plan had 27 program-level indicators for its customer service centers and 3 for its Problem Resolution Program.

In our August 1994 report, we concluded that IRS was overstating its successes for one-stop service because it was counting calls that did not fully resolve the taxpayers\u2019 questions. We recommended that IRS develop better measures to exclude those instances where taxpayers would likely need to contact IRS again about the same matter. We also recommended that IRS measure all types of taxpayer inquiries, including all telephone contacts, service center correspondence, and walk-in inquiries.

The internal audit report did not address the need for measuring other types of IRS assistance, such as education and outreach and walk-in. Essentially, the report concluded that IRS\u2019 initial contact resolution measure should be limited to telephone operations, because the inclusion of correspondence would add responses to notices that had, in the past, taken up to 60 days to resolve. An IRS official told us that the initial contact resolution measure would not include walk-ins because (1) IRS does not have a system in place to measure the rate; (2) it is very difficult to monitor walk-in contacts in a valid way without standing over the individual customer service representative; and (3) the volume is relatively small compared to telephone contacts and paper correspondence and, as a result, would not affect the measure very much.
