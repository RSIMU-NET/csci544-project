The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 further mandated that DOD's General Fund Statement of Budgetary Resources be audit ready by the end of fiscal year 2014. DOD issued the FIAR Plan and related guidance to provide a strategy and methodology for achieving its audit readiness goals. However, substantial risks exist that may impede DOD's ability to implement the FIAR methodology and achieve audit readiness.", "GAO was asked to assess DOD's risk management process for implementing its FIAR Plan. This report addresses the extent to which DOD has established an effective process for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks that could impede its progress in achieving audit readiness.

However, its actions were not fully in accordance with widely recognized guiding principles for effective risk management, which include (1) identifying risks that could prevent it from achieving its goals, (2) assessing the magnitude of those risks, (3) developing risk mitigation plans, (4) implementing mitigating actions to address the risks, and (5) monitoring the effectiveness of those mitigating actions. DOD did not have documented policies and procedures for following these guiding principles to effectively manage risks to the implementation of the FIAR Plan.", "In January 2012, DOD identified six departmentwide risks to FIAR Plan implementation: lack of DOD-wide commitment, insufficient accountability, poorly defined scope and requirements, unqualified or inexperienced personnel, insufficient funding, and information system control weaknesses. DOD officials stated that risks are discussed on an ongoing basis during various FIAR oversight committee meetings; however, the risks they initially identified were not comprehensive, and they did not provide evidence of efforts to identify additional risks. For example, based on prior audits, GAO identified other audit-readiness risks that DOD did not identify, such as the reliance on service providers for much of the components' financial data and the need for better department-wide document retention policies. Risk management guiding principles provide that risk identification is an iterative process in which new risks may evolve or become known as a program progresses throughout its life cycle.", "Similarly, DOD's actions to manage its identified risks were not in accordance with the guiding principles. GAO found little evidence that DOD analyzed risks it identified to assess their magnitude or that DOD developed adequate plans for mitigating the risks. DOD's risk mitigation plans, published in its FIAR Plan Status Reports, consisted of brief, high-level summaries that did not include critical management information, such as specific and detailed plans for implementation, assignment of responsibility, milestones, or resource needs. In addition, information about DOD's mitigation efforts was not sufficient for DOD to monitor the extent of progress in mitigating identified risks.", "Without effective risk management at the department-wide level to help ensure the success of the FIAR Plan implementation, DOD is at increased risk of not achieving audit readiness initially for its Statement of Budgetary Resources and ultimately for its complete set of financial statements.", "GAO identified two DOD components--the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)--that had established practices consistent with risk management guiding principles, such as preparing risk registers, employing analytical techniques to assess risk, and engaging internal and external stakeholders consistently to assess and identify new risks. These components' actions could serve as a starting point for improving department-level risk management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD design and implement policies and procedures for FIAR Plan risk management that fully incorporate the five risk management guiding principles and consider the Navy's and DLA's risk management practices.

GAO affirms its recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has had serious problems with its  financial management operations for decades. Pervasive financial  management, business operations, and systems weaknesses have  adversely affected DOD\u2019s ability to control costs; ensure basic  accountability; anticipate future claims and costs on the budget (such as  health care, weapons systems, and active duty payroll); measure  performance; maintain control of funds; prevent and detect fraud, waste,  and abuse; address pressing management issues; and prepare auditable  financial statements.", "Since 1995, DOD financial management has been on GAO\u2019s list of  programs and operations at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement. Previous attempts at reform have largely proven  unsuccessful, including repeated attempts since fiscal year 1996 to  achieve auditability. DOD remains the only major federal agency that has  been unable to receive an audit opinion of any kind on its department- wide financial statements. Given the size and complexity of DOD\u2019s  worldwide operations\u2014involving a requested budget of approximately  $614 billion for fiscal year 2013\u2014accurate, complete, and timely financial  management information and effective accountability are critical.", "Overhauling DOD\u2019s financial management presents a major management  challenge that goes far beyond financial statement auditability to  transforming DOD\u2019s business processes and operations. The successful  transformation of DOD\u2019s business processes and operations will allow  DOD to routinely generate timely, complete, and reliable financial and  other information for day-to-day management decision making, including  resource allocation decisions. Auditable financial statements should be a  natural by-product of the ability to produce reliable financial information.", "To encourage progress, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  for Fiscal Year 2010 mandated that DOD develop and maintain a  Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan that among  other things, describes the specific actions to be taken and costs  associated with ensuring that its department-wide financial statements  are validated as audit ready by September 30, 2017. In October 2011,  the Secretary of Defense directed the department to accelerate audit  readiness for key elements of its financial statements. Subsequently, the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 amended this requirement to add that the  FIAR Plan should also support the goal of validating audit readiness of  the department\u2019s Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR) no later than  September 30, 2014.", "As we have previously reported, DOD has developed a methodology to  implement the FIAR Plan\u2014issued as the FIAR Guidance\u2014which is  reasonable and, if implemented as intended, should enable the  department to identify and address its financial management weaknesses  and thereby achieve auditability. However, we have also reported on concerns with the department\u2019s efforts to implement this methodology.  For example, our review of the Navy\u2019s Civilian Pay and Air Force\u2019s  Military Equipment audit readiness efforts identified significant  deficiencies in the components\u2019 execution of the FIAR Guidance, resulting  in insufficient testing and unsupported conclusions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Given DOD\u2019s difficulties in achieving audit readiness and addressing its  long-standing financial management deficiencies, you asked us to assess  DOD\u2019s risk management process for implementing its FIAR Plan.

Based on our analysis, we found commonalities and identified five  basic guiding principles governing effective risk management: (1) identify  risks, (2) analyze risks, (3) plan for risk mitigation, (4) implement a risk  mitigation plan, and (5) monitor risks and mitigation plans. Using these  guiding principles as criteria, we analyzed DOD documents related to risk  management, such as the May 2012 and November 2012 FIAR Plan  Status Reports, which identified DOD\u2019s program risks and mitigation  plans, and FIAR oversight committee meeting minutes, which  documented the results of DOD\u2019s efforts to prioritize and manage these  risks. We interviewed the FIAR Director and other officials responsible for  the FIAR Plan in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer  (DCMO) to obtain an understanding of DOD\u2019s risk management process.", "We also inquired about coordinated risk management efforts and about  DOD\u2019s plans to revisit identified risks, identify new risks, and mitigate  those risks.", "Although the FIAR Directorate is responsible for DOD-wide risk  management activities to implement the FIAR Plan, FIAR Directorate  officials told us that some of DOD\u2019s component entities may have risk  management activities under way.

Of these, the  Department of the Navy (Navy) and DLA had risk management practices  being implemented at the time of our review, and we included them for  comparison purposes to the DOD-wide efforts. Using the five risk  management guiding principles as criteria, we reviewed and analyzed the  Navy\u2019s and DLA\u2019s risk management plans and supporting documents that  identified, described, and prioritized risks to audit readiness as well as  progress or status reports related to their efforts to address and monitor  those risks. We also interviewed the Navy\u2019s and DLA\u2019s Financial  Improvement Plan directors and other knowledgeable officials about their  risk management processes and coordination with DOD\u2019s FIAR Director  and the Office of the DCMO.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 to August 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, the DOD Comptroller established the FIAR Directorate,  consisting of the FIAR Director and his staff, to develop, manage, and  implement a strategic approach for addressing financial management  deficiencies, achieving audit readiness, and integrating those efforts with  other initiatives. Also in 2005, DOD first issued the FIAR Plan\u2014a strategic  plan and management tool for guiding, monitoring, and reporting on the  department\u2019s ongoing financial management improvement efforts and for  communicating the department\u2019s approach to addressing its financial  management weaknesses and achieving financial statement audit  readiness.", "In August 2009, the DOD Comptroller sought to focus FIAR efforts by  giving priority to improving processes and controls that support the  financial information most often used to manage the department.  Accordingly, the DOD Comptroller revised the FIAR Plan strategy to focus  on two priorities\u2014budgetary information and asset accountability. The  first priority was to strengthen processes, controls, and systems that  produce DOD\u2019s budgetary information. The second priority was to  improve the accuracy and reliability of management information  pertaining to the department\u2019s mission-critical assets, including military  equipment, real property, and general equipment. In May 2010, the DOD  Comptroller first issued the FIAR Guidance, which provided the standard  methodology for the components\u2014including the Departments of the  Army, Navy, and Air Force and DLA\u2014to implement the FIAR Plan.  According to DOD, the components\u2019 successful implementation of this  methodology is essential to the department\u2019s ability to achieve full  financial statement auditability.", "In recent years, legislation has reinforced certain DOD financial  improvement goals and initiatives and has strengthened the role of DOD\u2019s  Chief Management Officer (CMO). For example, the NDAA for Fiscal  Year 2010 tasked the CMO, in consultation with the DOD Comptroller,  with the responsibility for developing and maintaining the FIAR Plan, and  required the plan to describe the specific actions to be taken and the  costs associated with validating audit readiness by the end of fiscal year  2017. This act also mandated that the department provide semiannual  reports\u2014no later than May 15 and November 15\u2014on the status of its  implementation of the FIAR Plan. In October 2011, the Secretary of  Defense directed the department to achieve audit readiness for its SBR  for general fund activities by the end of fiscal year 2014, and the NDAA  for Fiscal Year 2012 required that the next FIAR Plan update include a  plan to support this goal. Most recently, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013  made the 2014 target for SBR auditability an ongoing component of the  FIAR Plan by amending the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 such that it now  explicitly refers to describing the actions and costs associated with  validating as audit ready both DOD\u2019s SBR by the end of fiscal year 2014  and DOD\u2019s complete set of financial statements by the end of fiscal year  2017."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Oversight Entities for the FIAR Effort", "paragraphs": ["The department has established a FIAR governance hierarchy to oversee  the FIAR Directorate\u2019s management and implementation of the FIAR  Plan. At the top is the CMO, who approves the vision, goals, and priorities  of the FIAR Plan, which are provided by the DOD Comptroller, in  coordination with stakeholders within the department (e.g., military  departments) as well as external stakeholders (e.g., the Office of  Management and Budget and Congress). The CMO chairs the Deputy  Management Action Group, which (1) provides advice and assistance to  the CMO on matters pertaining to DOD enterprise management, business  transformation, and operations and (2) reviews DOD component FIAR  Plans and monitors their progress. To manage and oversee FIAR Plan  implementation efforts, a number of committees and working groups,  beginning with the FIAR Governance Board, have been established, as  shown in table 1. The FIAR Governance Board engages the department\u2019s  most senior leaders from the functional and financial communities and  oversees DOD component progress. The FIAR Committee and  Subcommittee oversee the management of the FIAR Plan. Descriptions  of these key FIAR oversight bodies are presented below.", "In the November 2012 FIAR Plan Status Report, DOD reported the  following:", "Fifteen percent of the department\u2019s reported general fund budgetary  resources were undergoing audits, including the Marine Corps\u2019  budgetary resources. The military departments, defense agencies,  and other components were preparing the remaining budgetary  resources to be ready for audit by the end of September 2014.", "For mission-critical assets, DOD reported that 4 percent of these  assets were undergoing audits, 37 percent had been validated as  audit ready, 12 percent had been asserted as audit ready by the  respective component, and the remaining 47 percent were being  prepared for audit readiness assertions.", "DOD\u2019s projected funding for the FIAR effort for fiscal years 2012 through  2018 is shown in table 2.", "Risk management is a strategy for helping program managers and  stakeholders make decisions about assessing risk, allocating resources,  and taking actions under conditions of uncertainty. Risk management can  be applied to an entire organization, at its many levels, or to specific  functions, projects, and activities. While risk management does not  provide absolute assurance regarding the achievement of an  organization\u2019s objectives, an effective risk management strategy can be  particularly useful in a decentralized organization\u2014such as DOD\u2014to help  top management identify potential problems and reasonably allocate  resources to address them. Leading risk management practices  recommend that organizations develop, implement, and continuously  improve a process for managing risk and integrate it into the  organization\u2019s overall governance, strategy, policies, planning,  management, and reporting processes. When planning for risk, an  organization determines the methodology, strategies, scope, and  parameters for managing risks to the objective.", "In researching risk management principles, we identified five basic  guiding principles of risk management, as shown in figure 1.", "Identify risks. The goal of risk identification is to generate a  comprehensive list of risks, regardless of whether those risks are  under the control of the organization, based on events that could  significantly affect the achievement of objectives. Risk identification  involves continuous and iterative communication and consultation with  internal and external stakeholders to identify new risks, sources of  risk, areas these risks affect, events (including changes in  circumstances), their causes (root causes), and potential  consequences to the objective. This can be performed through  additional inquiry with subject matter experts, surveying and  interviewing experienced executives, high-level and detailed  documentation reviews, checklists based on historical information,  and diagramming processes.", "Analyze risks. Risk analysis involves developing an understanding of  identified risks to assist management in determining the most  appropriate methods and strategies in prioritizing and responding to  risk. It requires risks to be analyzed to determine the impact of  interdependencies between the overall program risks and program  component risks. According to guiding principles, risk analysis is a  vital part of the entire risk management process as it helps managers  determine where to focus their attention and allocate resources to  maximize the likelihood of achieving objectives. This requires  management to consult with key stakeholders, project managers, and  experts to discuss, analyze, and rank risks based on their expert  analysis. Suggested techniques for risk analysis include the following: o  Risk categorization. Risks can be categorized by sources of risk,  the area of the program affected, or other useful categories to  determine the areas of the program most exposed to the effects of  uncertainty. Grouping risks by common root causes can lead to  developing effective risk responses.  o  Risk urgency assessment. Risks requiring near-term responses  may be considered more urgent to address. Indicators of priority  can include time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning  signs, and the risk rating.  o  Modeling. This includes techniques that can be used to assess the  effect of risk interdependencies (i.e., one risk is dependent on  another risk being resolved) with specific attention to life cycle  program costs. Examples include (1) sensitivity analysis, which  helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on  the program, and (2) financial analysis methods, such as life cycle  program costs, return on investment, or cost benefit analysis,  which helps to determine the viability, stability, and profitability of a  program.", "Plan for risk mitigation. Planning for risk mitigation entails selecting  the most appropriate and timely action to address risks while  balancing the costs and efforts of implementation against the benefits  derived. The mitigating actions must also be realistic, achievable,  measurable, and documented. Among other things, the plan should  include the point of contact responsible for addressing each risk, the  root causes of the risk, the options for mitigation, risk status,  contingency actions or fallback approach, and resource needs.", "Implement risk mitigation plan. Implementing the risk mitigation  plan determines what planning, budget, requirements, contractual  changes, or a combination of these is needed; provides a coordination  vehicle for management and other stakeholders; directs the team to  execute the defined and approved risk mitigation plans; outlines the  risk reporting requirements for ongoing monitoring; and documents  the history of changes.", "Monitor risks and mitigation plan implementation. Effective  tracking of risk mitigation implementation (risk monitoring) provides  information that assists managers with making effective decisions  before problems occur by continually monitoring mitigation plans for  new and changing risks. Risk monitoring is the process of identifying,  analyzing, and planning for new risks; tracking identified risks; and  reanalyzing existing risks throughout the life of the program.  Monitoring is also intended to help management determine whether  program assumptions are still valid and whether proper risk  management policies and procedures are being followed.", "Risk management is an iterative process and these guiding principles are  interdependent such that deficiencies in implementing one guiding  principle will cause deficiencies in performing other guiding principles. For  example, if the procedures for identifying risks are not comprehensive  and not all significant risks are identified, then the other guiding principles  for risk management will not be carried out for any risks not identified.  Similarly, if identified risks are not sufficiently analyzed, then it is less  likely that effective risk mitigation plans will be developed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Established an Effective Risk Management Process", "paragraphs": ["DOD carried out some risk management practices centrally with respect  to implementing the FIAR Plan, but did not follow many risk management  principles necessary for effective risk management and did not document  its risk management policies and procedures.

In addition, its procedures for analyzing,  mitigating, and monitoring risks were also undocumented and did not  adhere to guiding principles.

In  January 2012, DOD identified six risks that if not mitigated, could impede  its efforts to achieve auditability. The department included these risks in  its May 2012 semiannual FIAR Plan Status report. The following is DOD\u2019s  summary of the six risks it identified.  1.  A lack of DOD-wide commitment. Stakeholders must be committed to  improving controls and providing supporting documentation.  2.  Insufficient accountability. Leaders and managers must be  incentivized to achieve FIAR goals.  3.  Poorly defined scope and requirements. Financial improvement plans  should address accounting requirements important to audit success.  4.  Unqualified or inexperienced personnel. DOD must ensure that  personnel are capable of making and supporting judgments that  auditors will agree meet accounting standards.  5.  Insufficient funding. Resources must be aligned to the scope and  scale of the FIAR effort.  6.  Information system control weaknesses. Many processes and controls  reside entirely in software applications, and therefore these systems  and interfaces must support complete and accurate records.", "DOD did not have written policies and procedures or a documented  process for identifying these risks; however, DOD officials told us that  they held internal management meetings, brainstormed with internal and  external stakeholders, and reviewed prior GAO and DOD Inspector  General (IG) reports. While DOD\u2019s identification of risks was a positive  step, DOD did not identify sufficient information about these risks, such as  the source, root cause, the audit area(s) the risk will impact, and potential  consequences to the program if the risk is not effectively mitigated\u2014all  critical to properly analyze and prioritize risk. Further, DOD\u2019s risk  identification process did not identify all significant risks to achieving its  auditability goals.", "DOD officials told us that risk management practices were embedded  throughout the FIAR process and that these six risks were identified in  whole or in part through this process. Specifically, they said that monthly  and quarterly meetings of the various FIAR oversight committees  included ongoing discussions with DOD components regarding their  progress in meeting FIAR goals and milestones. According to guiding  principles, agencies should generate a comprehensive list of risks based  on those events that might create, enhance, prevent, degrade,  accelerate, or delay the achievement of objectives. In addition, guiding  principles state that risk identification is an iterative process where  program stakeholders continually forecast the outcomes of current  strategies, plans, and activities and exercise their best judgment to  identify new risks as the program progresses throughout its life cycle.  Although DOD indicated that risks are discussed on an ongoing basis  during various meetings, the risks it initially identified were not  comprehensive, and it did not provide evidence of efforts to identify  additional risks.", "We identified additional risks based on prior audit work. For example,  DOD did not identify risks related to (1) the components\u2019 reliance on  service providers for significant aspects of their financial operations, such  as processing and recording financial transactions, and (2) the lack of a  department-wide effort to follow documentation retention standards to  ensure that required audit support can be provided to auditors. We did not  attempt to identify all significant risks to DOD\u2019s audit readiness effort, but  these two examples indicate that DOD did not identify all significant risks  to the FIAR effort. Conducting a risk identification process in accordance  with guiding principles would have increased the likelihood of DOD  identifying additional risks that could impede the department\u2019s ability to  achieve its auditability goals. As noted previously, the guiding principles  are interdependent, and deficiencies in the identification of risks will  hinder implementation of other guiding principles, such as risk mitigation.", "Reliance on service providers: The Marine Corps received a disclaimer  of opinion on its fiscal years 2010 and 2011 SBRs because of its inability  to provide timely and complete responses to audit documentation  requests. Specifically, the DOD IG reported that DFAS\u2014the service  provider responsible for performing accounting, disbursing, and financial  reporting services for the Marine Corps\u2014did not have effective  procedures in place to ensure that supporting documentation for  transactions was complete and readily available to support basic audit  transaction testing. In December 2011, we reported that the Navy and  Marine Corps could not reconcile their Fund Balance with Treasury  accounts in large part because they depend on DFAS to maintain the  data necessary for the reconciliation, and DFAS did not maintain  reliable data or the documentation necessary to complete the  reconciliation.", "DOD officials stated that although they did not identify the reliance on  service providers as a risk, they recognized it as a challenge and, as a  result, developed requirements in the FIAR Guidance. The FIAR  Guidance requires the service providers to have their control activities  and supporting documentation examined by the DOD IG or an  independent auditor in accordance with Statement on Standards for  Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 16 so that reporting entities  (components) have a basis for relying on the service provider\u2019s data for  their financial statement audits. To prepare for an SSAE 16 examination, the FIAR Guidance requires a service provider first to  evaluate its control activities and supporting documentation, take  corrective actions as necessary, and then assert audit readiness to the  FIAR Directorate. Once the FIAR Directorate validates that the service  provider has sufficient controls and supporting documentation, the service  provider can then engage an auditor to conduct an SSAE 16 audit  examination.", "The FIAR Guidance states that service providers should identify the  reporting components\u2019 audit readiness assertion dates so that they can  complete SSAE 16 examinations in time to meet the components\u2019 needs.  However, the November 2012 FIAR Plan Status Report indicates that key  service providers will not have SSAE 16 examinations completed until  sometime in fiscal year 2014. DOD components need to rely on the  results of SSAE 16 examinations of key service providers so that the  components can effectively assess their own controls in accordance with  the FIAR Guidance. In light of the expected completion dates of SSAE 16  examinations, it is not clear if components will have sufficient time to carry  out the activities necessary to test and validate their own controls and  assert audit readiness for their SBRs by September 2014.", "For these reasons, the requirements in the FIAR Guidance have not fully  mitigated the risk associated with the reliance on DOD\u2019s service  providers. Although DOD recognized this issue as a challenge, the  reliance on service providers was not identified by DOD management as  a significant risk to DOD achieving audit readiness. If DOD formally  identified the reliance on service providers as a risk, it is more likely to  manage and monitor this risk in accordance with risk management  guiding principles.", "Need for supporting documentation: Document retention and the  ability to provide supporting documentation for transactions have been  pervasive problems throughout DOD. For example, during the Marine  Corps audits, the DOD IG found that DFAS had only retained selected  pages of the documents supporting payment vouchers, such as the  voucher cover sheet, and did not have critical items, such as the  purchase order, receiving report, and invoice, to support that payments  were made as required. In addition, we reported in March 2012 that the  Army did not have an efficient or effective process or system for providing  supporting documentation for its military payroll expenses and, as a  result, was unable to locate or provide supporting personnel documents  for our statistical sample of fiscal year 2010 Army military pay accounts.", "DOD officials told us that they recognized document retention as a  challenge, and that this issue was addressed in the FIAR Guidance as  well as in DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation (FMR) and  requirements established by the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA). Both the FIAR Guidance and the FMR refer to  NARA for guidance on record retention, and the FIAR Guidance also refers to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.However, neither the FIAR Guidance nor the FMR was specific enough to  ensure that the documents needed to support audit readiness were  retained and available in a timely manner. For example, the FIAR  Guidance and the FMR did not address which types of documentation to  retain and the required time frames for retaining these documents, thus  leaving these decisions to the judgment of DOD component personnel  responsible for preparing for audit readiness. DOD officials informed us  that they were in the process of updating the FMR to address  documentation types and retention periods; however, the updated  guidance was not yet available at the time of our review. As a result, we  could not determine how and to what extent a revised FMR would  address document retention issues.", "Continuous and comprehensive risk identification is critical because, if a  risk is not formally identified, it is less likely to be managed effectively and  in accordance with risk management guiding principles. The first step to  managing and mitigating risks is to identify them. For example, if DOD  had identified the reliance on service providers and the need for  document retention standards as risks, it might have implemented actions  to address these risks sooner so that they would not have been major  impediments to Navy, Marine Corps, and Army audit readiness efforts. If  risks to the FIAR effort are not comprehensively identified, DOD is less  likely to take the actions necessary to mitigate or minimize the risks and  therefore less likely to meet its audit readiness goals.", "Both the Navy and DLA employed techniques that are consistent with  guiding principles for risk identification. For example, they collaborated  with stakeholders, experts, support personnel, and project managers on a  weekly or monthly basis to discuss potential new risks to the audit effort  using techniques such as brainstorming, interviewing key stakeholders,  diagramming, and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and  threats) analysis, and documented the results in risk registers or risk  databases.

He also stated that he did not use recommended  analytical techniques, such as (1) risk categorization, (2) risk urgency  assessment, or (3) sensitivity analysis. In addition, the FIAR Director did  not perform an assessment to determine the individual DOD components\u2019  ability to achieve audit readiness. For example, if one DOD component  has significantly more information technology system control weaknesses  or fewer skilled personnel than another DOD component, it is likely to  have a higher risk of not achieving audit readiness. Performing effective  risk analysis could enable DOD to develop appropriate risk mitigation  plans to address such concerns, including resource allocation among the  components.", "A probability and impact matrix is generally used for both communication  and prioritization. Guiding principles state that risk analysis is a vital part  of the risk management process because it helps management determine  the most appropriate methods and strategies for mitigating risks. In  addition, it allows management to better allocate resources to maximize  the likelihood of achieving objectives. By not analyzing risks in  accordance with guiding principles, DOD increased the likelihood that it  would not adequately address the most critical risks in a timely manner.", "Navy and DLA officials generally followed guiding principles for risk  analysis. For example, at both the Navy and DLA, project management  teams worked together to determine who was primarily responsible for  managing each identified risk. The Navy and DLA employed analytical  techniques to assess risk and documented the results of their analyses\u2014 such as the impact each risk has or could have on the objectives and the  risk\u2019s priority\u2014in risk registers.
