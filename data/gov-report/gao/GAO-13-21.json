Before issuing a final rule, agencies are generally required to publish an NPRM in the Federal Register. Agencies must then respond to public comments when issuing final rules. Agencies may use exceptions in certain circumstances to forgo this NPRM process to expedite rulemaking. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has authority to provide guidance on regulatory issues. GAO was asked to provide information on the rulemaking process. This report addresses (1) how often agencies issued final rules without an NPRM; (2) which exceptions agencies used to do this; and (3) whether agencies took certain actions when issuing major rules without an NPRM, including voluntarily requesting and responding to public comments. GAO reviewed a generalizable random sample of 1,338 final rules published during calendar years 2003 through 2010. The sample contained rules by 52 agencies, including all cabinet departments issuing regulations. GAO completed more detailed analyses of 123 major rules without an NPRM, including every such rule published from 2007 through 2010, to obtain additional information to answer the objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies did not publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), enabling the public to comment on a proposed rule, for about 35 percent of major rules and about 44 percent of nonmajor rules published during 2003 through 2010. A major rule has significant economic impact and may, for example, have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. Agencies published a total of 568 major rules from 2003 through 2010. Agencies also published about 30,000 nonmajor rules during this period, which have less economic significance and can involve routine administrative issues.", "Agencies frequently cited the \"good cause\" exception and other statutory exceptions for publishing final rules without an NPRM. Agencies in GAO's sample used the \"good cause\" exception for 77 percent of major rules and 61 percent of nonmajor rules published without an NPRM. Agencies may use the good cause exception when they find that notice and comment procedures are \"impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\" In practice, agencies may find an NPRM \"impracticable\" when the rule must be issued by a statutory deadline, \"unnecessary\" when the rule pertains to technical corrections, and \"contrary to the public interest\" in an emergency situation. To a lesser extent, agencies also used other statutory exceptions to issue a rule without an NPRM. For example, in 84 of the 123 major rules that GAO analyzed, agencies described circumstances in which a statute: (1) either required or authorized them to issue the rule without an NPRM, (2) prescribed the content of the rule, or (3) set a deadline for a rule or program which the agency stated did not allow sufficient time to issue an NPRM.", "GAO found that agencies, though not required, often requested comments on major final rules issued without an NPRM, but they did not always respond to the comments received. Agencies may solicit comments through the Federal Register when publishing a final rule without an NPRM, but the public does not have an opportunity to comment before the rule's issuance, nor is the agency obligated to respond to comments it has received. For example, agencies requested comments on 77 of the 123 major rules issued without an NPRM in GAO's sample. The agencies did not issue a follow-up rule or respond to comments on 26 of these 77 rules. This is a missed opportunity, because GAO found that when agencies did respond to public comments they often made changes to improve the rules. In addition, each of these 26 rules is economically significant and some of these rules have an impact of a billion dollars a year or more. These rules also cover important issues ranging from national health care policies to manufacturing incentive programs. For example, in one of the 26 rules, an agency defined a pre-existing condition to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and sought public comment. The agency received 4,627 comments, but has not published a response to them. When agencies do not respond to comments requested, the public does not know whether the agency considered their comments, or if it intends to change the rule. As the courts have recognized, the opportunity to comment is meaningless unless the agency responds to significant points raised by the public."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB issue guidance to encourage agencies to respond to comments on final major rules, for which the agency has discretion, that are issued without a prior NPRM.

Regulation is one of the primary tools federal  agencies use to implement and enforce U.S. laws. Agencies also use  regulations to implement programs that provide federal assistance,  grants, and other subsidies. The total costs of these regulations are  estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and the estimated  benefits are even higher. Given the significant costs and benefits of  regulations, Congress and the President have focused considerable  attention on the rulemaking process, especially in recent years, and  lawmakers continue to consider legislative proposals to amend the  process.", "The basic process by which agencies develop and issue regulations is   APA generally  spelled out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).requires agencies to (1) publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)  in the Federal Register; (2) allow interested persons an opportunity to  comment on the rulemaking process by providing \u201cwritten data, views, or  arguments;\u201d (3) issue a final rule accompanied by a statement of its basis  and purpose (including the agency\u2019s response to comments received on  the NPRM); and (4) publish the final rule at least 30 days before it  becomes effective. This process, referred to as notice-and-comment  rulemaking, gives the public an opportunity to provide information to  agencies on the potential effects of a rule or to suggest alternatives for  agencies to consider. The benefits of public participation in notice-and- comment rulemaking have been cited by the courts and others to include:  generating higher quality rules; ensuring the fair treatment of persons  affected by the rules, since all parties potentially affected have a chance  to participate; and promoting the political accountability of the agency by  giving affected parties the ability to comment at an early stage and having  a public record of the agency\u2019s response to those comments.", "Prior notice and public comment is not always required, however.  Congress sometimes enacts laws that direct an agency to issue rules  without notice and comment. In addition, APA recognizes that there are  circumstances, such as responding to an emergency situation like a  natural disaster, when providing for notice and comment might not be  appropriate before issuing a final rule, because expediting the rulemaking  process is important to the efficiency and effectiveness of agencies\u2019  activities. Therefore, APA allows agencies to issue final rules without the  use of an NPRM in certain cases, including when the agency determines  for \u201cgood cause\u201d that notice and comment procedures are \u201cimpracticable,   Agencies often invoke  unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\u201d \u201cgood cause,\u201d for example, when Congress prescribes the content of a  rule by law, such that prior notice and public comment could not influence  the agency\u2019s action and would serve no useful function.", "5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(B).", "In order to retain the benefits of public participation that may be lost when  issuing rules without an NPRM, agencies sometimes solicit public  comments on such rules, though not required to do so. If an agency  solicits comments in these cases, the public\u2019s opportunity to comment  does not occur in advance of the rule\u2019s issuance or, in some cases, the  effective date for complying with the rule\u2019s provisions. One common type  of rule often issued without an NPRM is the interim final rule, which  generally is effective immediately but provides an opportunity for public  comment after the rule\u2019s issuance.

In  response to public comments, the agency removed two provisions of the  original interim rule regarding air cargo screening requirements. These  changes reduced the costs of the rule. In a similar example, in June 2011,  the Department of the Treasury, DOL, and HHS followed up on a jointly- issued July 2010 rule on group health plans and health insurance  issuers. The agencies stated that the amendments in the subsequent  rule were being made in response to public comments received on the  prior rule and that the primary effect of the amendments was to reduce  the costs of compliance.", "Over the years, the Administrative Conference of the United States  (ACUS), an advisory agency in administrative law and procedure, has  also highlighted the potential benefits of following up on final rules issued  without an NPRM. In particular, to ensure public participation and limit  undesirable effects regarding final rules issued without notice and  comment, ACUS recommended that agencies request comments  whenever they invoke the \u201cimpracticable\u201d or \u201ccontrary to the public  interest\u201d reasons under the good cause exemption and publish a  responsive statement on significant and relevant issues raised by such  comments. ACUS noted that in such cases public comments could provide both useful information to the agency and enhanced public  acceptance of the rule. Although this recommendation has not been  implemented, ACUS continues to support it in an effort to improve  transparency and public participation in rulemaking."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies issue thousands of final rules each year that affect many  aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. The rulemaking procedures that agencies follow  balance the public\u2019s right to be involved in the rulemaking process against  agencies\u2019 need to carry out their missions in an efficient and effective  manner. When rulemaking is expedited, there is a trade-off between  obtaining the benefits of advanced notice and comment and the goal of  issuing the rule quickly. The consequences of such trade-offs could be  most significant for major rules issued without an NPRM, given their  substantial annual effects on society.", "Agencies often lessened this trade-off by requesting public comments on  rules issued without an NPRM for which they had some discretion. This is  a positive practice that promotes the benefits of public participation.  However, if agencies and the public are to fully benefit from the process  of public comments, what matters is not simply providing an opportunity  for comment but also public understanding of whether comments were  considered. For more than a third of the major rules published without an  NPRM between 2003 and 2010 where agencies had discretion and  requested comments, the agencies did not respond to comments  received. Some of these rules related to significant national issues such  as health care. When agencies solicit but leave unclear whether  comments were considered, the public record is incomplete. Though such  follow-up is not required, agencies may be missing an opportunity to fully  obtain for themselves, and provide to the public, the benefits of public  participation. Further, agencies may create the perception that they are  making final decisions about the substance of major rules without  considering data, views, or arguments submitted in public comments. The  benefit of follow-up efforts is demonstrated by our finding that, when  agencies did issue follow-up rules, they often made substantive changes  to the original rules, usually in response to public comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better balance the benefits of expedited rulemaking procedures with  the benefits of public comments that are typically part of regular notice- and-comment rulemakings, and improve the quality and transparency of  rulemaking records, we recommend that the Director of OMB, in  consultation with the Chairman of ACUS, issue guidance to encourage  agencies to respond to comments on final major rules, for which the  agency has discretion, that are issued without a prior notice of proposed  rulemaking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Director of OMB and the  Chairman of ACUS for their review and comment. We received written  comments on the draft report from OMB, which are reprinted in Appendix  V. OMB also provided a technical comment which we incorporated as  appropriate. ACUS provided technical comments, which we also  incorporated as appropriate.", "OMB disagreed with our recommendation to issue guidance to encourage  agencies to respond to comments on final major rules, for which the  agency has discretion, that are issued without a prior notice of prior  rulemaking. OMB stated that it does not believe it is necessary to issue  guidance on this topic at this time. In its response, OMB reiterated the  value of public participation during the rulemaking process and noted that  it routinely encourages agencies to establish procedures to consider  public comments received on interim final rules. However, OMB believes  that the timing and extent of an agency\u2019s responses is a discretionary  matter that an agency must consider in the context of the nature and  substance of the particular rulemaking, as well as the particular agency\u2019s  resource constraints and competing priorities. OMB further stated that this  case-specific approach is generally appropriate\u2014especially given the  often unique circumstances faced by agencies issuing rules without a  prior notice of proposed rulemaking\u2014and that it is not aware of  compelling evidence that a more general, undiscriminating policy, set out  in guidance, would offer substantial benefits.", "We continue to believe that enhanced guidance would improve the quality  and transparency of rulemaking procedures. We recognize the fact that  OMB encourages agencies to establish procedures to consider public  comments but believe that OMB needs to go further to encourage all  agencies to respond to public comments on the record. We believe that  there is compelling evidence that such guidance would offer substantial  benefits. ACUS identified this as an issue of concern in 1995, and our  current review confirmed that agencies still do not always follow up on  rules issued without an NPRM. For more than a third of the major rules  published without an NPRM between 2003 and 2010 where agencies had  discretion and requested comments, we found that the agencies did not  respond to comments received. As our evidence demonstrated, some of  these rules had economic impacts in the billions of dollars, attracted over  4,000 comments, and addressed significant national issues, such as  health care. When it is unclear whether agencies considered comments,  rulemaking is less transparent to the public, and, as courts have  recognized, the opportunity to comment is meaningless unless the  agency responds to significant points raised by the public. Further, we  disagree with OMB\u2019s characterization of the scope of our  recommendation. We are not suggesting an undiscriminating policy,  instead we are recommending that OMB work with ACUS to develop  appropriate guidance. Such guidance could maintain the flexibility for  agencies that OMB believes is necessary. Also, following up on rules  issued without an NPRM is not necessarily resource intensive. For  example, an agency could simply post a summary response to public  comments on regulations.gov.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Identify how often agencies issued final rules, including interim rules,  without a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), whether this  changed over time, and which agencies most often issued such rules. 2.  Identify which exceptions agencies used when issuing final rules  without an NPRM.  3.  Assess whether agencies, when issuing final major rules without an  NPRM (a) provided information on the rule\u2019s economic effects, (b)  solicited public comments, and (c) responded to public comments.", "To address each of these objectives, we selected and reviewed a  representative sample of final regulatory actions published during  calendar years 2003 through 2010 to estimate the prevalence of certain  characteristics in this population. We used the Government Printing  Office\u2019s (GPO) Federal Digital System database on the Federal Register  to compile a list of 30,583 final regulatory actions published in the Rules  and Regulations section during those years. We defined our units of  analysis as \u201cactions\u201d rather than \u201cfinal rules,\u201d because not all of the  individual documents published in the Rules and Regulations section of  the Federal Register are rules (e.g., some extended comment periods or  made editorial corrections). Further, one published action may include  multiple rules, and there is no way to determine the total number of rules  published short of reviewing each action. However, for simplicity of  presentation, we use the term \u201cfinal rules\u201d instead of \u201cfinal regulatory  actions\u201d throughout this report. We supplemented information from GPO\u2019s  Federal Register database with information from our database on rules  submitted to us under the CRA.used to generate our list of all final rules by reviewing related  documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, testing for  missing data, and tracing a sample of entries to source documents.

Since each sample could  have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval (for example, plus or minus 7 percentage points). This is the  interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of  the samples we could have drawn.", "We reviewed the published text of all selected final rules to determine if  they had been published in whole or in part without NPRMs (referred to in  the rest of this report simply as rules without NPRMs). Our analysis  included rules where only a part of the rule was issued without an NPRM  to ensure that our results reflected all instances when agencies cited an  exception to notice and comment. To address our third objective we  focused primarily on whether agencies issuing major rules without an  NPRM: (a) provided information on the economic effects of the rules, (b)  solicited public comments when issuing final rules without an NPRM, and  (c) responded to comments received on major rules without an NPRM by  June 30, 2012. We used standardized data collection instruments and  applied criteria from the Administrative Procedure Act, Regulatory  Flexibility Act, Unfunded Mandates Act, and Executive Order 12866 to  collect and analyze information to address each key question. If the final  rule in our sample was not itself a rule, but was related to a rulemaking  (e.g., if it extended a comment period) we used the underlying rule to  address our questions if sufficient information was provided to identify the  underlying rule. In addition to using our sample to generate estimates for  the entire population on these objectives, we also did additional content  analyses of the major rules without NPRMs in our sample to help address  the objectives. Unlike the generalizable results from our reviews of the  broader sample of rules, the results of these content analyses are not  generalizable to the entire population. They only represent the facts and  circumstances of the specific rules we reviewed. We also met with  officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and  Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) who are  knowledgeable about federal regulatory and administrative law  procedures.", "We did not assess the agencies\u2019 decisions regarding claims of good  cause and other exceptions or their determinations regarding the effects  of their rules; instead, we are providing information about what the  agencies published in the Federal Register as the basis for their findings.  Further, we limited our analysis to only what agencies specifically stated  in Federal Register notices. For example, we counted a particular  exception only if the agency specifically cited it or quoted from part of  APA\u2019s description. We did not assume that an agency meant to claim a  particular exemption based on the general content of the rule. Therefore,  our results may understate the frequency with which APA\u2019s good cause  and categorical exceptions applied.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2011 to December 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In our 1998 report on final actions without  NPRMs, we had estimated that agencies published about 400 interim  final rules per year from 1992 to 1997 (out of approximately 4,000 total  final rules each of those years).", "Overall, agencies appeared to use interim rulemaking infrequently.  Between 2003 and 2010, agencies published about 4 (plus or minus 2)  percent of nonmajor rules as interim rules. There was relatively little  variation across the individual years in the percentage of nonmajor interim  rules (see fig. 14). However, for major rules, we found that 15 percent  (actual) of all major rules from 2003 through 2010 were issued as interim  rules. The number of major interim rules increased starting in 2008 and  was highest in 2010, when 23 of 100 major rules were an interim rule or  included an interim rule among other final rules.

All other agencies in our sample accounted  for less than 7 percent each of the total major interim rules we reviewed.  For the nonmajor interim rules, four agencies accounted for  approximately two-thirds of these rules, with USDA accounting for 22  percent, DHS 22 percent, the Department of Defense (DOD) 14 percent,  and HHS 11 percent.
