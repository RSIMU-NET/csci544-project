Stewardship contracting involves the use of contracting authorities--such as the exchange of goods for services--first authorized in 1998 and intended to help the agencies achieve land management goals that meet community needs. GAO was asked, among other things, to determine (1) the contracting and financial controls the agencies use to ensure accountability in managing stewardship contracting projects and (2) the steps the agencies have taken to involve communities in the projects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the Forest Service provided limited initial guidance on establishing contracting and financial controls, the eight stewardship projects GAO visited had incorporated such controls. (BLM was first granted stewardship authority in 2003 and had no projects under way at the time of GAO's review.) The projects generally used pre- and post-award controls, such as reviews of contractor bids using preestablished criteria, and performance and payment bonds to ensure completion of required activities. GAO's review of selected financial controls at the projects we visited showed that they appeared to have procedures in place to account for retained receipts, including tracking funds received and expended, and had incorporated procedures designed to ensure the completion of specific work tasks before contractors were paid. Both the Forest Service and BLM issued guidance in January 2004 containing such controls for future projects. The Forest Service initially provided minimal guidance on soliciting and incorporating public involvement in stewardship contracting projects and, as a result, the type and extent of efforts to involve communities varied considerably among the projects GAO reviewed. However, managers who did not incorporate public input may have missed valuable opportunities to strengthen their projects. For example, one project manager said that public involvement led to more stringent criteria for protecting water quality, and another reported that public involvement improved agency access to public lands needing fuel reduction. Although most managers GAO spoke with said they wanted additional guidance on public involvement, the Forest Service's recently issued stewardship contracting handbook does not contain specific guidance for obtaining community input--and BLM's recent guidance is similarly lacking. Without such guidance, each project manager must independently determine the type and extent of community involvement to solicit and then develop and implement community involvement procedures--an inefficient process that could lead to variation in community involvement across stewardship contracting projects in both agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent severe wildfire seasons have focused attention on the state of our  nation\u2019s forests. Many of these forests have become dense with small,  tightly spaced trees and thick brush, which\u2014combined with drought, wind,  and other adverse weather conditions\u2014have fueled extensive wildland  fires in recent years. Both the Forest Service in the Department of  Agriculture (USDA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the  Department of the Interior are placing greater emphasis on thinning forests  and rangelands to help reduce the buildup of potentially hazardous fuels,  partly in response to the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Among  other things, the act directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior  to give priority to hazardous fuel reduction projects that provide for the  protection of at-risk communities or watersheds, or that implement  community wildfire protection plans. The Forest Service and BLM, which  together manage a total of about 450 million acres of federal land, are  focusing on a new tool they consider essential to their efforts to reduce  fuels:  stewardship contracting.", "Stewardship contracting involves the use of any of several contracting  authorities that were first authorized for use by the Forest Service on a  pilot basis in October 1998. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations Act for 1999 established stewardship  contracting authority to achieve national forest land management goals  that meet local and rural community needs. Prominent among the  stewardship contracting authorities is the ability to (1) trade goods\u2014 timber, for example\u2014for contract services, such as thinning of small trees  and brush; and (2) retain for use in future stewardship projects any receipts  generated through selling forest products such as timber, rather than  returning the receipts to the Department of the Treasury, which is required  under traditional timber sales. The law stated that the land management  goals of stewardship contracts include road and trail maintenance,  watershed restoration, and prescribed burning and noncommercial tree  removal to improve forest health. Although stewardship contracting was  initially established as a demonstration project that involved a limited  number of individual projects within the Forest Service and was to end in  2002, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003, among other  things, extended the use of stewardship contracting authority to 2013,  eliminated the limit on the number of projects, authorized commercial tree  removal for forest health purposes as a project purpose, and extended the  authority to BLM.", "Because of your interest in the status of the Forest Service\u2019s and BLM\u2019s  implementation of stewardship contracting authority, you asked us to  determine (1) the status of stewardship contracting projects and the land  management goals they address; (2) the extent to which the agencies have  contracting and financial controls in place that ensure accountability in  managing stewardship contracting projects; (3) the steps the agencies have  taken to involve communities in designing, implementing, and evaluating  stewardship contracting projects; and (4) each agency\u2019s plans for future  stewardship contracting activities.

They also frequently contract to sell forest resources such as timber or  firewood. Traditionally, these contracts have been executed separately\u2014 service contracts have generally been funded with appropriated funds from  the agencies\u2019 budgets, while timber has been sold through contracts with  private purchasers. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 authorized the Forest Service to  combine these contracting mechanisms by entering into \u201cstewardship end  result contracts,\u201d under which the agency could use the value of forest  products sold to offset the cost of contracted services. Under such goods- for-services contracts, the Forest Service could, for example, pay for  thinning operations by using the proceeds from any commercial timber  removed as part of the project. Additional contracting authorities were also  included in the legislation; the full list of authorities follows. (Stewardship  contracting authority was initially granted only to the Forest Service; in  2003 it was extended to BLM.)", "Goods for services allows the agency to use the value of commercial  products, such as timber, to offset the cost of services received, such as  thinning, stream improvement, and other activities.", "Designation by description or prescription allows the agency to  conduct a timber harvest by providing the contractor with a description  of the desired end result of the harvest. For example, the Forest Service  might require that all ponderosa pine less than 10 inches in diameter be  harvested. Ordinarily, cutting any standing tree before a Forest Service  employee has marked or otherwise designated it for cutting is  prohibited.", "Multiyear contracting allows the agency to enter into stewardship  contracts of up to 10 years in length.

Receipts are  to be applied only to stewardship contracting projects.", "Less than full and open competition exempts the agency from the  requirement under the National Forest Management Act that all sales of  timber having an appraised value of $10,000 or more be advertised.   This allows the Forest Service to favor local contractors when soliciting  contract bids.", "Supervision of marking and harvesting of timber sales exempts the  agency from the requirement that USDA employees supervise the  harvesting of trees on Forest Service lands. This has allowed the Forest  Service to use one state agency to assist in stewardship contracting.", "Best-value contracting requires the agency to consider other factors\u2014 such as past performance or work quality\u2014in addition to price when  making stewardship contract award decisions.", "The law authorized 28 stewardship contracts by the Forest Service, of  which 9 were to be in the Forest Service\u2019s Northern Region. The authority  of the Forest Service to enter into these contracts was to end on September  30, 2002. Contracts were to \u201cachieve land management goals for the  national forests that meet local and rural community needs.\u201d  The goals  listed in the legislation included, but were not limited to,  maintaining or obliterating roads and trails to restore or maintain water   maintaining soil productivity, habitat for wildlife and fisheries, or other   setting prescribed fires to improve the composition, structure,  condition, and health of stands or to improve wildlife habitat;  noncommercially cutting or removing trees or other activities to  promote healthy forest stands, reduce fire hazards, or achieve other  noncommercial objectives;  restoring and maintaining watersheds;  restoring and maintaining wildlife and fish habitat; and  controlling noxious and exotic weeds and reestablishing native plant  species.", "The law also required that the Forest Service establish a multiparty  monitoring and evaluation process to assess each stewardship contract.", "Several subsequent laws modified the requirements of the initial  stewardship contracting authority. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2000 changed the requirement from 28 stewardship contracts to 28  stewardship projects, allowing for the possibility that individual projects  may involve more than one contract. The following year, the Department  of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2001 doubled  the number of authorized projects for a total of 56, requiring that at least 9  of the newly authorized projects be in the Forest Service\u2019s Northern Region  and at least 3 in the agency\u2019s Pacific Northwest Region. Similarly, a year  later, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act of 2002 authorized an additional 28 projects (for a total of 84), again  requiring that at least 9 of the newly authorized projects be in the Northern  Region and at least 3 in the Pacific Northwest Region. This law also  changed the end date of the demonstration project from 2002 to 2004. Most  recently, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 extended the  authority to enter into stewardship contracts to 2013, extended  stewardship contracting authority to BLM, removed the restriction on the  number of projects that could be implemented under this authority,  removed the emphasis on noncommercial activities among the land  management goals listed, and replaced the requirement for multiparty  monitoring and evaluation of each project with a requirement to monitor  and evaluate the overall use of stewardship contracting.", "Stewardship contracting projects are subject to environmental and  resource management laws\u2014such as the National Environmental Policy  Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act, and others\u2014that also apply to  nonstewardship projects. Responsibility for administering stewardship  contracting authority at the Forest Service lies within two agency offices:   the Forest and Rangeland Management Group and the Acquisition  Management Group. Each of the nine Forest Service regions has  established a stewardship contracting coordinator to facilitate stewardship  contracting activities within each region.

For example, one  project we visited\u2014the Baker City Watershed Rehabilitation project\u2014 involved thinning trees on Forest Service land that served as the watershed  for an Oregon town. The water provided by the watershed was so pure that  the town did not need a filtration facility, according to project and town  officials. However, the watershed was at high risk for fire, which officials  told us would degrade the watershed to the extent that a multimillion- dollar treatment facility would be required. The watershed was thinned to  reduce the density of fuels and thus the risk of fire, with the cost of logging  partially offset by the value of timber removed. Logging was done by  helicopter to avoid degrading the watershed by building roads. Figure 3  shows a helicopter using a cable to lift and transport trees that were cut by  workers on the ground.", "Another project we visited\u2014the Burns Creek project in southwestern  Virginia\u2014involved cutting timber on Forest Service land and using an  elevated cable harvesting system to transport the cut logs across a steep  ravine to a sorting area, where they were stacked and sold. Forest Service  officials decided against using a traditional logging approach because of  the risk of environmental damage to the stream and drainage system in the  ravine. After the timber was removed, the cable system was used to  transport limestone to the creek at the bottom of the ravine to reduce the  creek\u2019s acidity. Project officials told us that without the cable system, the  Forest Service would have had to spend considerably more money to  transport the limestone to the creek by helicopter. Figure 4 shows the cable  system used to transport timber and limestone on this project.", "Across all stewardship contracting pilot projects, the most common  activities were removing timber to improve forest health or reduce fuels  and cutting slash, while other frequently cited activities included road  maintenance and prescribed burning.

Other guidance was provided by  the Pinchot Institute for Conservation\u2014with which the Forest Service  had contracted to review stewardship contracting implementation,  including the design and management of monitoring, evaluation, and  reporting processes. For example, the Pinchot Institute facilitated  stewardship contracting workshops at Forest Service headquarters and  several field locations to explain the nature of the stewardship contracting  authority. The Pinchot Institute also provided technical assistance and  general program guidance through its three subcontracted partners.  Because of the limited guidance available to them, some project managers  also sought project design assistance from staff in the Forest Service\u2019s  Northern Region, which had the greatest number of pilot projects and  which had experience in and knowledge of stewardship contracting  techniques.", "Because of the lack of specific centrally issued guidance, some projects  were slow to begin. Project managers attributed this delay to the need to  independently determine how to design and implement their projects using  their understanding of stewardship contracting and the need to coordinate  the efforts of timber sale and acquisition contracting officers in developing  a single contract. Under traditional contracts, timber sales are handled by  timber sale contracting officers, while service acquisitions are handled by  acquisition contracting officers. With the exchange of goods for services  under stewardship contracting, only one contracting officer is needed for  both activities; but close cooperation and coordination between the timber  sale and acquisition offices are needed, which can be difficult and time  consuming. For example, one contracting officer at the Antelope  stewardship project said developing a contract combining a timber sale  with various services took approximately 6 months, in contrast to the  approximately 2 to 3 months that this official said were required for a  standard timber sale or service contract.

Such solicitations are intended to  maximize the number of potential contractors aware of the project, and  thus the pool of potential bidders. When solicitations did not result in any  bidders, the solicitations were sometimes expanded to include a broader  geographic area. The project managers also held conferences with  potential contractors before they submitted bids or proposals, and  sometimes potential contractors made trips to the proposed project sites.  These \u201cscoping\u201d sessions served to clarify project objectives and contract  terms and schedules, as well as to solicit ideas from contractors and to  increase local awareness of projects.

The contracts we reviewed contained clear definitions of contract  requirements, including work-site locations, access points, and the size of  work units. The contracts also generally defined the roles of the various  Forest Service staff, including those responsible for oversight activities,  such as the contracting officers and the contracting officers\u2019  representatives. Before commencing work under the contract, Forest  Service project managers generally held orientations with the contractors  to clarify contract terms, work performance requirements, and work  progress schedules. These meetings sometimes resulted in amendments to  the solicitations and clearer contract language.", "Nearly all of the stewardship contracts we reviewed included payment and  performance bond clauses to ensure the satisfactory performance of  contract requirements. These bonds are written instruments executed by  the contractor to ensure fulfillment of its obligations. If the obligations are  not met, the bonds ensure payment, to the extent stipulated, of any loss  sustained. In particular, payment bonds, also known as advance deposits or  cash deposits, ensure that the government receives payment for timber  harvested. In the event that a contractor harvests timber but then defaults  on the contract or goes out of business before paying for it, the agency can  keep the cash value of the bond as payment for the timber. Similarly,  performance bonds ensure that, in the event the government is required to  conduct work to remediate damage done by the contractor, the agency can  use the value of the performance bond to finance remediation activities.  Although most contracts included bonds, some did not. The Winiger Ridge  Restoration project, for example, did not include payment or performance  bonds. The project manager told us that she believed such bonds were too  onerous for small contractors, and agency officials wanted to make the  project as attractive as possible to small local contractors. Additionally,  according to the project  manager, there was little incentive for the  contractor to cut commercially valuable timber and then default on the  remainder of the services because there was very little valuable timber  included in the project. This manager characterized the contract as  \u201c$190,000 worth of services and $500 worth of timber.\u201d  Another project\u2014 Antelope\u2014did not require a performance bond because of the expense and  burden it would place on the contractor, according to the project manager.", "The stewardship contracts also included valuation clauses to establish the  volume and value of the forest materials to be removed and the services to  be provided. Volume is determined by a \u201ccruise\u201d of the project area, which  involves staff examining the area in different locations to estimate the  timber that is to be removed. Forest Service managers at the projects we  examined established the value of timber through government cost  estimates or appraisals. Government cost estimates are simply indications  of what the timber will bring on the market based on previous sales,  according to Forest Service staff. Appraisals, on the other hand, involve  calculations of not only what the timber will bring on the market but also  the cost of cutting and hauling the timber, constructing or improving roads,  and so forth, and are thus more detailed, time consuming, and expensive.  According to staff, government cost estimates are appropriate when the  value of the material is known to be low, because in such cases the cost of a  full appraisal can exceed the value of the material. Of the eight projects we  reviewed, five conducted full appraisals while three used government cost  estimates.", "The stewardship contracts we examined also included provisions for on- the-ground inspections of contracted work to ensure that the work was  conducted in accordance with contract requirements and Forest Service  expectations. At the projects we reviewed, the contracting officers and the  designated contracting officers\u2019 representatives who served as on-the- ground administrators documented their observations on inspection forms  and contract daily logs, which we examined. These logs included  information on whether the work was performed in an acceptable manner,  and the measures necessary to correct any deficiencies.", "Additional effort was sometimes required to ensure that contractors  performed according to Forest Service expectations. For example, the  Winiger Ridge Restoration stewardship project contracting officer told us  that the project\u2019s initial contract had to be revised to make the designation  by description specifications clearer to the contractor, after it became  evident that the specifications as written did not lead to the expected  results. (Designation by description allows the agency to conduct a timber  harvest by providing the contractor with a description of the trees to be cut  or the desired end result of the harvest, rather than by marking individual  trees.)  At this project, the initial description directed the contractor to,  among other things, cut all trees with a certain level of dwarf mistletoe  infestation. However, project officials realized that it was impossible to  verify that the contractor had cut only infected trees, and contract  provisions regarding mistletoe infestation were eliminated. Similarly,  contracting officers and contractors at other locations also told us that the  contractors sometimes had difficulty interpreting the language in  designation by description contracts, or that the language was not specific  enough to ensure that Forest Service expectations were met. This unclear  language sometimes required additional project oversight to ensure that  contractors were meeting contract requirements. At the Clearwater  stewardship project, for example, the project manager told us that although  they had planned periodic project inspections, the use of designation by  description authority required them to have inspectors on site virtually  every day for several weeks.", "Finally, the stewardship contracts we reviewed also included breach or  default and dispute resolution clauses. These mechanisms allow the Forest  Service to address any issues or problems by issuing default notices and  stop work orders. However, aside from work delays, which generally  resulted from uncontrollable events such as excessive snow or fire  seasons, there were no significant problems with the contracts we  examined. In fact, several Forest Service contracting officers we  interviewed praised the relative ease of administering the contracts once  they were developed and awarded. Similarly, the contractors conducting  the work told us that, although the stewardship contracts and the  contracting process were somewhat new and time consuming to them,  implementation of the contracts themselves was relatively straightforward."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "We Observed Established Financial Procedures at the Projects We Visited", "paragraphs": ["During our project site visits, we observed evidence of established  procedures in place for accounting for project funds, including procedures  for receiving and tracking timber payments and tracking retained receipts  and expenditures, as well as other steps taken to provide financial  accountability.

The TSA tracks data  such as the name of the purchaser and the quantity and species of timber to  be harvested, and is the principal system for recording revenues related to  timber sales. However, the TSA reflects only a portion of stewardship  contracting activity. While the TSA includes timber-specific information  such as species, it does not reflect the services contracted for as part of  stewardship contracting projects; instead, these services are recorded and  tracked at the local forest or regional office. The FFIS, which incorporates  some TSA data, is the system of record supporting Forest Service billing  and collection functions. As with traditional timber sale contracts, actual  payments are received and processed through an independent  \u201clockbox\u201d  system in San Francisco. The payment receipts are recorded by job code  in a specified distribution account within the FFIS.", "At each location, we observed adequate separation of duties and  supervisory review responsibilities being handled by officials in the timber  and financial groups. For example, a project official at each location was  responsible for verifying the accuracy of all the charges to the project  account, and the financial group manager was responsible for monitoring  the project account balances. At the end of each month, timber and  accounting clerks completed reconciliations between the timber and  financial system data and their detailed local records. When discrepancies  were identified, the problems were researched and corrected in a timely  manner. For those projects we looked at, several monthly reports were  generated by the TSA and FFIS systems, which managers in each group  used to track project activities and to review and verify the accuracy of the  charges against project funds.", "Two projects we visited, the Clearwater and Fernow Experimental Forest  projects, had expended retained receipts on additional stewardship  contracting activities. At these projects, we examined payment vouchers,  receipts, and other expenditure-related documentation to ensure that  retained funds had been spent on stewardship-related activities, as  required, and the funds appeared to have been spent appropriately. Another  project we visited, the Burns Creek project, passed all retained receipts on  to another stewardship project, the Wayah Contract Logging project, in the  same region; however, the Wayah Contract Logging project (which we also  visited) did not need to use the funds because receipts and appropriated  funds associated with that project were sufficient to cover project  expenditures. As a result, the retained receipts were being passed on yet  again to a third stewardship project, the Sand Mountain project, also in the  same region. At the time of our review, a portion of these funds had been  obligated to cover the cost of a contract for work on this project, but had  not yet been expended.", "Forest Service staff at the locations we visited took additional steps to  provide financial accountability. For example, we noted procedures in  place to prevent timber harvesting activities from significantly exceeding  service activities under goods for services contracts. To this end, two  projects (the Clearwater and Warm Ridge/Glide projects) established \u201cland  management credits\u201d to record service activities completed. Once the  contractor earned such credits, they were then applied to the value of the  timber being harvested. At these projects, contractors were not permitted  to harvest timber until they had earned the required credits through service  work\u2014thus preventing contractors from harvesting commercially valuable  timber and then failing to perform needed restoration activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service and BLM Recently Developed Stewardship Contracting Guidance That Includes Contracting and Financial Controls", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service and BLM issued jointly developed guidance in January  2004 to provide direction in implementing stewardship contracts.

According to  an official with the Forest Service\u2019s Forest and Rangeland Management  Group, their handbook is intended to be a working document that will  change as necessary. For example, if the results of ongoing monitoring of  stewardship contracting show a need for changes, the handbook will be  revised accordingly.", "The agencies\u2019 guidance includes some of the same elements we examined  during our site visits to provide project accountability. For example, both  agencies\u2019 guidance includes provisions requiring appropriate valuation of  service work to be performed and timber to be harvested. To this end, the  Forest Service handbook states, \u201cThe appraisal for timber and other forest  products shall be conducted using appraisal methods as specified in the  Timber Sale Preparation Handbook . . . and Regional guidelines.\u201d Both  agencies also provide guidance on required bonding. For example, the BLM  guidance states that \u201cpayment protection in the form of payment bonds  should be used to protect the value of the byproduct to be removed when  the product will be removed prior to cash payment or the contractor\u2019s  earning of conservation credits.\u201d BLM\u2019s guidance further states that  \u201ccontracting officers are encouraged to strive toward the concept of a  single bond to cover \u2018performance,\u2019 which would include the product value  (payment) and the service work rolled into one bond.\u201d", "The agencies\u2019 guidance also provides expanded discussions on the use of  two additional authorities\u2014designation by description and less than full  and open competition. Regarding designation by description, the guidance  specifies that the amount of material removed from the forest must be  verifiable and accountable. For example, the Forest Service handbook  generally requires that for commercial material (such as sawtimber), trees  to be removed must be identified based on characteristics that can be  verified after removal\u2014for example, the contractor might be required to  remove all lodgepole pine less than a specified stump diameter. Agency  personnel could subsequently measure remaining stumps to verify that  contract provisions were met. For noncommercial material, the handbook  allows less specific designations setting forth the desired end result of  treatment (sometimes referred to as designation by prescription)\u2014for  example, the contractor might simply be required to leave a certain number  of trees on each acre, with an average spacing between them.", "Regarding less than full and open competition, which exempts the agency  from the requirement that all sales of timber having an appraised value of  $10,000 or more be advertised, the Forest Service handbook specifies that  forest supervisors must document and submit to regional foresters the  reasons for the selection process used. Documentation must include the  level of competition to be used in the contracting process.", "As part of their guidance, the agencies also are developing contract  templates that field staff can use as examples when developing their own  contracts\u2014potentially improving the efficiency and applicability of  stewardship contracts. These are standard contract formats that  incorporate timber sale and service components. The Forest Service has  also conducted additional training sessions, and staff from both agencies  told us they plan to expand their intranet sites to provide more ongoing  stewardship contracting project information, including details about  successful stewardship contracting projects that can serve as models for  staff who are developing projects.", "The agencies\u2019 guidance also contains direction on financial accountability.  According to the Forest Service handbook, the proper use and  management of stewardship contracting receipts must be assessed as a  normal part of regional- and forest-level renewable resource program and  activity reviews. Through the guidance, both agencies have assigned  responsibility for various financial activities, including providing technical  advice, reviewing and approving retention of project receipts, and ensuring  that associated financial data are accurate and reconciled to the financial  statements. In addition to specifying responsibility for various activities,  the agencies\u2019 guidance notes the approved funding source for project- related activities. For example, stewardship contracting preparation,  overhead, and project-level monitoring costs normally are to be funded  through appropriated funds. According to the guidance, stewardship  contracting retained receipts shall not be used for overhead,  administrative, or indirect costs or for the completion of environmental  studies. The guidance indicates these retained receipts can be used for  another stewardship project or to fund national programmatic multiparty  monitoring. Although both agencies\u2019 guidance states that multiparty  monitoring of individual projects is encouraged, the Forest Service  handbook states that it is inappropriate to conduct project monitoring with  revenues received from a stewardship contract.", "Finally, both agencies\u2019 guidance outlines the responsibilities of the various  headquarters, regional, and state office officials in the implementation,  monitoring, and evaluation of stewardship contracting projects. The  agencies also have appointed stewardship contracting coordinators at each  Forest Service regional office and at each BLM state office. These staff  serve as resources for all projects under the respective Forest Service  regional offices and BLM state offices and are expected to enhance  communication between the agencies\u2019 headquarters and the field.

Managers told us that  little or no formal training on involving the community had been provided,  and in some cases reported that the only guidance they had received was in  the form of a brief discussion of the topic during a meeting. The most  frequently identified source of community involvement guidance was in the  form of advice from the Pinchot Institute for Conservation\u2019s regional  subcontractors, which reportedly provided some consultation on  community involvement efforts. The managers\u2019 desire for guidance or  training resulted primarily from two concerns:  first, that they were wasting  time \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d because they were unaware of effective or  innovative community involvement strategies developed by managers of  other projects, and second, that they were potentially violating the Federal  Advisory Committee Act (FACA) by incorporating community involvement  into their projects.", "Because of the lack of guidance, the steps taken by Forest Service  managers to involve communities varied widely. Most of the community  involvement we learned about was incorporated through multiparty  monitoring teams, which were required by the stewardship contracting  legislation. However, the legislation did not specify, and the Forest Service  provided little guidance on, the teams\u2019 roles and responsibilities, leading to  uncertainty among field staff about what was expected and how to  proceed. Some projects simply did not have monitoring teams, and some  managers told us they did not realize such teams were required. The  project managers who assembled monitoring teams did so using very  different approaches. For example, some managers formed teams of  primarily Forest Service employees, while others sought to involve a cross  section of the community. The Yaak project manager in Montana even  transferred the responsibility for assembling the project monitoring team  and completing an annual report on the project to the contractor, by  making these efforts a requirement in the contract. Some managers formed  small teams composed of a few interested local individuals, while the  manager at the Priest-Pend Orielle project in Idaho formed a large  monitoring team consisting of about 30 members organized into several  specialized subcommittees focusing on specific issues such as roads,  watershed, wildlife, and noxious weeds. This project manager also  coordinated with the team to ensure that a Forest Service specialist was  available to consult with each of the subcommittees as needed.", "The project monitoring teams also played varying roles and undertook  varying activities. Team members included university professors, local  government officials, environmental advocates, industry representatives,  and other interested citizens, and the composition of the team often helped  to determine the level and type of work the team undertook. For example,  several project managers noted that their teams focused on assessing the  effectiveness of specific ecological work or evaluating the project\u2019s impact  on the local economy, while other teams focused on assessing the  stewardship contracting process, believing that their assessment of the tool  would help the Congress evaluate the pilot program. The monitoring teams  conducted such activities as inspecting project sites, testing soils and  water, establishing photo points, and gathering and analyzing economic  information. Figure 15 shows a multiparty monitoring team meeting at a  project site.", "In a few instances we noted other forms of community involvement. Some  managers took steps such as meeting with local contractors and  environmentalists to hear their concerns and answer questions, or setting  up demonstration areas that would show local residents how the project  site would look once the work was done. However, such steps were not  common, and in fact some managers told us that the NEPA process alone  allows for sufficient public participation in their projects. They said that  as a result\u2014and without guidance to the contrary\u2014they did not feel that  additional efforts to involve communities were necessary or justified. In  fact, one Forest Service official at the Burns Creek project site in Virginia  told us that management of the forest might be better left to forestry  professionals than to a collaborative group of well-meaning\u2014but  untrained\u2014community members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Agency Officials Believe Collaboration Enhances Project Effectiveness and Provides Other Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Some project managers may be missing opportunities to improve their  projects, as the majority of the project managers we spoke with touted the  benefits of involving the community in stewardship contracting projects.

Several project managers indicated that they valued the project monitoring  teams\u2019 expertise and input, and some noted improvements to their projects  as a result of team and other community input. For example, the manager  of the Upper Blue project in Colorado told us that public involvement in  her project led to the development of more stringent criteria for protecting  water quality during project activities. The Main Boulder project manager  in Montana told us that public involvement in his fuels reduction project  led to improved relations with the public, which in turn persuaded a  neighboring landowner to offer the agency access across his land to an  isolated parcel of public land needing fuel reduction. This allowed the  manager to add an additional 40 acres to the project\u2019s planned fuel  reduction activities.", "Some managers viewed their interaction with the project monitoring team  as an opportunity to get back in touch with the community and improve the  agency\u2019s credibility, and some sought to involve a cross section of the  community\u2014including environmentalists and loggers\u2014on their monitoring  teams to improve the agency\u2019s relationship with the community. The  manager of the Sheafman Restoration project in Montana said she wanted a  cross section of the community on her project\u2019s team because she believes  \u201cany time you can get people from different sides of an issue together to  talk, good things happen.\u201d  The Priest-Pend Orielle project manager  observed that in his community\u2014as in so many others\u2014the Forest Service  had lost touch with the local community. He sees tremendous benefits in  the agency\u2019s new collaboration process with the community, and suggested  the agency will have greater opportunities to build credibility with the  community on future projects because local individuals have seen the  agency responding to their input. The manager of the Red-Cockaded  Woodpecker Habitat project in Georgia told us that by attending the  meetings of other community organizations and taking an active interest in  what those groups are doing, she has improved communications with the  community\u2014leading to increased public input on Forest Service projects,  which in turn helps the agency better focus its projects to meet community  needs.", "However, benefits were often limited because most of the monitoring  teams were formed after the projects completed NEPA requirements,  meaning that these teams generally participated only during the  implementation phase of the projects rather than during project design.

The area was included in a timber sale in order to  remediate the slide area; the sediment savings resulting from this  remediation were to offset the increased sediment that would result from  logging activities. The timber sale is currently being implemented, but the  slide area has not yet been treated, so it was included in the Meadow Face  project.
