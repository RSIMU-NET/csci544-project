Federal contractors owe some of the taxes that contribute to the tax gap, and, since 2015, federal law prohibits agencies, under certain circumstances, from using appropriated funds to contract with those who have qualifying tax debt. The IRS also has authority to levy certain payments of contractors with qualifying federal tax debt.", "GAO was asked to review issues related to federal contractors and tax debt. Among other things, GAO examined whether, in calendar years 2015 and 2016, (1) selected federal agencies had control activities that ensured contractors' reported federal tax debts were considered before contract award and (2) the IRS levied selected federal contractors' payments. GAO analyzed contract and IRS data from 2015 and 2016 (the most-recent data available), reviewed five agencies that represent 51 percent of contract obligations, and reviewed seven awards to contractors reporting tax debt."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The five selected agencies GAO reviewed have control activities\u2014such as policies and procedures\u2014to help ensure they consider qualifying federal tax debts as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \u00a7 52.209-11 and \u00a7 52.209-5 before awarding contracts. However, these controls were potentially ineffective in ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. According to GAO's analysis, in 2015 and 2016 the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs, and the Army and Navy, awarded 1,849 contracts to contractors that reported qualifying federal tax debts, such as delinquent debts over $3,500 (see table). When a contractor reports qualifying tax debts under these regulations, the contracting officer must take several actions, including notifying the agency suspension and debarment official (SDO). However, SDOs at all five agencies told GAO they did not receive any notifications of contractors reporting tax debt in this period. As a result, these contracts may have been awarded without potential required actions, indicating potential violations of federal regulations and, in some cases, appropriations law.", "GAO's nongeneralizable review of seven contracts illustrate two cases where contractors were collectively awarded more than $510,000 in contract obligations while having more than $250,000 in tax debt, including tax penalties for willful noncompliance with tax laws. Officials from the selected agencies were unable to explain why their control activities were potentially ineffective without reviewing each contract to determine whether FAR requirements were applicable and whether control activities were applied. Understanding why existing control activities did not operate effectively will help these agencies enhance controls to avoid future misuses of appropriated funds. GAO plans to provide information on the instances of potential noncompliance GAO identified to the selected agencies.", "Of the over 2,700 executive-branch contractors GAO found to have likely qualifying federal tax debt as of December 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had identified over 2,000 for levy through its automated Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP). However, the FPLP cannot levy all contractors because not all payments are processed by the system the FPLP uses. The data the IRS receives from agencies does not allow it to readily identify payments made using other systems\u2014information the IRS needs for agency outreach about inclusion in the FPLP and to more quickly initiate a manual levy.

Businesses, including those that receive federal  contracts, are responsible for paying their share of taxes including  employment and income tax, which results in billions of dollars in tax  revenue each year. Some taxes are not paid voluntarily and on time,  however, leading to what is known as a \u201ctax gap.\u201d A portion of the tax  gap is owed by individuals and businesses receiving payments from the  federal government. In its most-recent estimate, the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) stated that the average annual gross tax gap was $458  billion for tax years 2008\u20132010. The IRS estimated that it would  eventually collect $52 billion of this amount, leaving a net tax gap of $406  billion in unpaid taxes for each of those 3 years. In an effort to help close  the tax gap, Congress gave the IRS the authority to collect assets or  payments, including federal contract payments, to collect unpaid taxes,  and these collections are referred to as a levy. IRS enforcement of tax laws is vital to promote compliance by giving taxpayers confidence that  others are paying their fair share. Because of the challenges that the IRS  faces in its enforcement of tax laws, we continue to include it as a high- risk area.", "Our prior work, as well as that of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration, identified thousands of federal contractors that abused the  federal tax system, causing significant loss of tax revenue. For example,  in 2007 we found that thousands of federal contractors had substantial  amounts of unpaid federal taxes. Specifically, about 63,000 federal  contractors owed approximately $7 billion in unpaid taxes. At the time of  that report, there was no requirement that contracting officers consider  most instances of unpaid federal taxes prior to the award.", "Since as early as 2008, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),  certain prospective contractors have been required to report delinquent  federal tax. Furthermore, since fiscal year 2015, appropriations statutes  have included a government-wide provision prohibiting federal agencies,  under certain circumstances, from using appropriated funds to enter into  contracts with corporations that have certain federal tax debts.  Specifically, fiscal years 2015 and 2016 appropriations statutes contain a  government-wide provision stating that funds may not be used to enter  into a contract with any corporation that has any unpaid federal tax  liability (1) that has been assessed, (2) for which all judicial and  administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and (3)  that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with  the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, when the awarding  agency is aware of the unpaid tax liability, unless a federal agency has  considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and has made a  determination that further action is not necessary to protect the interests  of the government. To implement the appropriations requirement and  avoid misuse of appropriated funds, in 2016 the FAR was revised to  require contracting officers to include a new tax debt\u2013related provision in  all solicitations regardless of contract value. Further, the revised  regulation required that prospective contractors respond to this tax  provision in the System for Award Management (SAM) as part of their  annual representations and certifications.", "You asked us to review issues related to federal contractors and tax debt.  This report first examines the extent to which, in calendar years 2015 and  2016, (1) selected federal agencies had control activities that ensured  contractors\u2019 reported federal tax debts were considered before contract  award. The remainder of the report assesses the same period; however,  it focuses on all executive-branch agencies and examines the extent to  which (2) federal contracts were awarded to contractors with federal tax  debt, including the characteristics of those contracts and contractors, and  (3) the IRS identified selected federal contractors\u2019 payments for levy.", "To identify the extent to which selected federal agencies had control  activities that ensured contractors\u2019 reported federal tax debts were  considered before contract award (including task orders), we analyzed  contract obligation information from the Federal Procurement Data  System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and selected for our review the five  agencies with the highest contract obligations associated with contract  awards for 2015 and 2016. We selected this 2-year period because it  included the most-recent contract award data available at the time of our  review and covered a period in which the newest FAR tax-debt provision  was implemented. Specifically, we selected the three civilian agencies  with the highest obligations\u2014the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health  and Human Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014and, within the  Department of Defense, the two agencies with the highest obligations\u2014 the Departments of the Army and Navy. The results of our review of  these five selected agencies are not generalizable to all federal agencies.

Specifically, we met with agency officials who supervise  contracting officers, such as the Head of Contracting Activity, Director of  Contracts, or other contracting managers, policy and procurement  officials, and suspension and debarment officials (SDO) from the selected  agencies. Additionally, we reviewed and analyzed applicable laws,  regulations, and policy memorandums, as well as applicable policies and  procedures, from DOE, HHS, VA, the Navy, and the Army for considering  contractors\u2019 reported federal tax debt when awarding federal contracts.  We interviewed officials from the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the Interagency Suspension and  Debarment Committee, and the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council to  obtain an understanding of how the law is implemented through the FAR.  We also met with the General Services Administration (GSA) to obtain an  understanding of SAM, including the registration of prospective  contractors and their reporting of certain federal tax debt pursuant to the  representation requirement of FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 and the certification  requirement of \u00a7 52.209-5.", "As part of this work, we analyzed FPDS-NG contract award and SAM  contractor registration data to identify instances where contractors  reported having certain federal tax debt and received a contract award.  Specifically, we electronically matched FPDS-NG contract award data  from 2015 and 2016 to the relevant contractors\u2019 SAM registration. We  then analyzed the relevant contractors\u2019 representations and certifications  most recently updated in SAM before the relevant contract award to  identify all instances where contractors reported that they had a federal  tax debt as defined in FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 or \u00a7 52.209-5 within our time  frame. From the resulting list, we identified the contracts that selected  agencies awarded to contractors that reported these federal tax debts. In  addition, we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 15 contract awards  from the five selected agencies to provide illustrative examples of the  extent to which these agencies\u2019 control activities ensured required actions  were taken before contract award. These 15 contract awards were  selected based on numerous criteria, including the prospective  contractors\u2019 (1) responses under FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 or \u00a7 52.209-5 in SAM  and (2) having tax debts as of December 15, 2016, that were not in a  repayment agreement with the IRS. Further, when selecting contract  awards that had a \u00a7 52.209-5 certification we considered only contractors  having at least $3,500 in tax debts as of December 15, 2016. We  reviewed seven contract awards made to contractors that reported that  they had certain tax debts and eight contract awards made to contractors  that reported that they did not have certain tax debts as part of their \u00a7  52.209-11 representations and \u00a7 52.209-5 certifications in SAM. For  these 15 contract awards, we reviewed pre\u2013contract award  documentation and copies of historical tax transcripts and other records,  such as revenue officers\u2019 notes obtained from the IRS.", "To determine the extent to which executive-branch agency contracts were  awarded in 2015 and 2016 to federal contractors with federal tax debt and  characteristics of those contract awards and contractors, we electronically  matched data from FPDS-NG on contract awards with (1) data from SAM  on contractors\u2019 representations and certifications of their tax debt and (2)  data from the IRS on tax debts owed by these contractors. Our analysis  included all of the executive-branch agencies. Further, our analysis  describes some characteristics of these debts, including the total amount  of debt outstanding and whether or not contractors had unpaid taxes that  were timely paid or appeared to be finally determined as of December 15,  2016, which was the time of our data extract. We also analyzed whether  contractors that were assessed unpaid taxes in the IRS data reported  having certain tax debts as part of their \u00a7 52.209-11 representations and  \u00a7 52.209-5 certifications in SAM.

We then determined  whether the tax debt had ever been identified for levy by the Federal  Payment Levy Program (FPLP) as of December 15, 2016, according to  IRS data.

Beginning February 26, 2016, contracting officers are required to include  a provision in all contract solicitations that require contractors to report  information about unpaid federal taxes regardless of the contract value.  Specifically, FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 incorporates the language from the fiscal  years 2015 and 2016 appropriations acts that prohibits the government  from entering into contracts with corporations with unpaid federal taxes  that have been assessed,  for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been  exhausted or have lapsed, and  that are not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement  with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, where the awarding agency is aware of the unpaid tax liability, unless an agency has considered suspension or debarment of the  corporation and made a determination such action is not necessary to  protect the interests of the government.", "If the prospective contractor reports having unpaid federal taxes under  this provision, the contracting officer must  request additional information from the prospective contractor;  in accordance with agency procedures, notify the officials responsible  for debarment and suspension actions, commonly referred to as the  suspension and debarment officials (SDO); and not award to the corporation unless an agency SDO has considered  suspension or debarment of the corporation and has made a  determination that suspension or debarment is not necessary to  protect the interests of the government.", "Additionally, the FAR requires that contracting officers include in certain  contract solicitations another provision for prospective contractors to  report delinquent taxes. Specifically, contracting officers are also required  to include FAR \u00a7 52.209-5 in contract solicitations in which the contract  value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, which  was generally $150,000 at the time of our review, under which  prospective contractors report delinquent federal taxes owed. This  requirement has been in place since 2008. Under this provision, the  prospective contractor must report whether it or any of its principals have,  within the preceding 3-year period, been notified of \u201cdelinquent federal  taxes\u201d in an amount that exceeds $3,500. For purposes of this  provision, \u201cdelinquent federal taxes\u201d are those for which  the tax liability is finally determined and assessed, with no pending  administrative or judicial challenge, and all judicial appeal rights are  exhausted; and  the taxpayer is delinquent in making payment, unless enforced  collection action is precluded (the taxpayer is not delinquent if the  taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement and is making  timely payments in compliance with the agreement terms).", "If the prospective contractor reports having federal tax debt under this  provision, the contracting officer must (1) request additional information  from the prospective contractor and (2) in accordance with agency  procedures notify the officials responsible for debarment and suspension  actions. Further, the contracting officer is not required to receive a  suspension and debarment determination before contract award for tax  debt reported under this certification.", "In addition, the FAR generally requires prospective contractors to register  in SAM before a contract can be awarded. As part of registering in SAM,  prospective contractors must make up to 54 representations and  certifications, which must be updated as necessary but at least  annually. Included among these is the federal tax debt FAR \u00a7 52.209-11  representation and \u00a7 52.209-5 certification.

Contracting officers rely on the contractors\u2019  representations and certifications in SAM to identify qualifying federal tax  debts. Federal tax law generally prohibits the IRS from disclosing  taxpayer data to other federal agencies for the purpose of determining  whether potential contractors owe qualifying federal tax debt.

As one of these responsibilities, the contracting  officer is to identify the FAR provisions and clauses required to be  included in contract solicitations based on various criteria, such as the  contract type and contract value. For example, contracts expected to be  above the simplified acquisition threshold are required to include \u00a7  52.209-5 in the solicitation. After the solicitation is issued and prospective  contractors\u2019 offers are obtained, the contracting officer, among other  tasks, generally must verify that the prospective contractor is registered in  SAM, and that the contractor is not suspended or excluded from doing  business with the federal government prior to contract award.", "The contracting officer must also determine whether the prospective  contractor is \u201cresponsible.\u201d FAR \u00a7 9.104-1 requires that to be determined  responsible, prospective contractors must have adequate financial  resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them; have a  satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; and be otherwise  qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and  regulations, among other things. As part of the responsibility  determination, the contracting officer must also access, review, and  document the prospective contractor\u2019s applicable representations and  certifications, including qualifying federal tax debt reported under \u00a7  52.209-11 and \u00a7 52.209-5.

These class deviations generally required  contracting officers to include an alternative provision in solicitations  and, if a contractor reported having qualifying tax debt, to not award  the contract without a written suspension and debarment  determination from an agency SDO. For example, the Department of  Defense, DOE, HHS, and VA issued class deviations as early as 2012  that required contracting officers to take two actions: (1) insert an  alternate provision when issuing solicitations using appropriated funds  and (2) obtain an SDO determination that suspension or debarment is  not necessary to protect the interests of the government before  awarding a contract to a contractor who reported qualifying tax  debts.", "Policies and Procedures: VA, DOE, and HHS issued policies and  procedures to varying degrees that generally direct contracting  officers to the relevant sections of the FAR when assessing contractor  responsibility.

For example, contracting  officer supervisors and policy officials at these agencies told us that  contracting officers use agency contract-writing systems to assist with  identifying and inserting required FAR provisions and clauses in the  contract solicitation. HHS and VA contracting officer supervisors  also told us contracting officers use contract-file checklists to ensure  required FAR provisions and clauses are included in the contract  solicitation. In addition, some of the five selected agencies\u2019 contract- file checklists or memorandums we reviewed generally document that  the contracting officer verified the prospective contractor\u2019s SAM  registration, and suspension and debarment status, and retrieved the  relevant SAM representations and certifications before contract  award.

Qualifying federal tax debts reported under this certification do not  automatically disqualify the prospective contractor from receiving a  contract, but rather are used as part of the contracting officer\u2019s  responsibility determination. Further, contracting officers are to insert this  FAR provision in solicitations where the value of the contract is expected  to be greater than the simplified acquisition threshold. If a prospective  contractor reports qualifying tax debt, contracting officers must request  such additional information as the contractor deems necessary in order to  demonstrate responsibility, and, prior to proceeding with the award, notify  the agency\u2019s SDO in accordance with agency procedures.", "While we cannot readily determine whether all 1,706 contract awards  were out of compliance with federal regulations due to limitations in the  data, as discussed earlier, our review of seven contract awards with  reported qualifying tax debt under either provision identified an instance  under this certification where we confirmed that the solicitation was above  the simplified acquisition threshold and the contracting officer did not take  follow-up actions to ensure compliance with federal regulations (see  sidebar to the left).", "As mentioned, agency contracting officer supervisors we interviewed from  the five agencies told us that they were not aware of any instances in  which a contracting officer identified a prospective contractor\u2019s reporting  qualifying federal tax debt under \u00a7 52.209-5 and notified the SDO during  this period.

To do so, some of these officials told us that they would need  to review the contract files for each of the 1,849 instances of potential  noncompliance we identified. Specifically, the agency must confirm that  (1) a solicitation was issued, and (2) the estimated value of the contract  award was above the simplified acquisition threshold, when applicable, to  determine whether the regulatory requirements applied.

The FPLP was developed as an automatic and efficient means  for the IRS to collect delinquent taxes as payments were processed  through the Fiscal Service. Accordingly, the FPLP can only levy federal  agency payments processed by the Fiscal Service, but not all federal  agencies process their payments through the Fiscal Service. As a result,  payments disbursed by other means\u2014such as payments that agencies  make directly to contractors\u2014are not included in the FPLP, although they  can be levied by the IRS through other manual methods (see fig. 5).", "The IRS cannot readily identify which payments are made outside of the  Fiscal Service, and such payments cannot be levied through the FPLP.  While the IRS receives some information about contractor payments from  agencies, it does not receive information that would allow it to  comprehensively determine which payments are processed by the Fiscal  Service and can be levied through the FPLP and which payments are not  and must be levied manually. Specifically, executive-branch agencies,  including those that do and do not process payments through the Fiscal  Service, are required to report information to the IRS about some federal  contracts through the IRS Form 8596 information return. Reporting  agencies identify themselves on the Form 8596, and the IRS uses data  from this form to identify federal contractors for potential levy. However,  the Form 8596 information return lacks information on whether payments  to federal contractors are processed by the Fiscal Service or through  some other means. Without visibility into the payments made outside the  Fiscal Service, the IRS is limited in its ability to identify nonparticipating  agencies for outreach about the efficiencies of leveraging the FPLP to  collect contractors\u2019 unpaid taxes, as opposed to manual levies. Further,  without information on agencies\u2019 payment methods, the IRS cannot  quickly identify payments that must be levied through manual methods.  Expanding Form 8596 to include payment-method information could help  the IRS identify which agencies to target for outreach and avoid delays in  identifying contractor payments requiring manual levy. IRS officials told us  the IRS has the legal authority to expand Form 8596 reporting  requirements and would have to determine whether a change to add  information on Fiscal Service processing of agency payments was  warranted.", "In addition, we found the IRS is missing an opportunity to further enhance  the FPLP levy process for certain contractor payments. Within the FPLP,  the IRS has an expedited process to levy federal contractors and, as  noted above, the IRS uses data from Form 8596 to identify federal  contractors for potential levy. However, Form 8596 reporting  requirements do not apply to federal contracts for which the amount  obligated is $25,000 or less. When Form 8596 reporting requirements  were initially established, this threshold was consistent with Federal  Procurement Data System (FPDS) contract reporting requirements for  agencies at the time. However, subsequent FAR amendments revised the  reporting threshold from contracts over $25,000 to contracts over the  micropurchase amount, which is currently set at $10,000. Because the  Form 8596 reporting threshold is higher than FPDS reporting  requirements, information about contracts in the $10,000 to $25,000  range is available in FPDS, but is not required to be shared with the IRS.  Such information could help the IRS identify and use expedited levy  procedures on federal contractors with contract obligations in the  $10,000\u2013$25,000 range.

The IRS further noted that it will review the potential benefits and  costs that would result from changing the current reporting threshold for  contract payments, and submit its findings to the Office of IRS Chief  Counsel to consider this addition to the IRS Priority Guidance Plan.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

The remainder of the report assesses the same period; however,  it focuses on all executive-branch agencies and examines the extent to  which (2) federal contracts were awarded to contractors with federal tax  debt, including the characteristics of those contracts and contractors, and  (3) the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identified selected federal  contractors\u2019 payments for levy.", "To identify the extent to which selected federal agencies had control  activities that ensured contractors\u2019 reported federal tax debts were  considered before contract award (including task orders), we analyzed  contract obligation information from the Federal Procurement Data  System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and selected for our review the  five agencies with the highest contract obligations associated with  contract awards for 2015 and 2016, which is the period when contract  award data were available at the time of our review. In addition, the  revised FAR tax-debt provision went into effect during this period.  Specifically, we selected the three civilian agencies with the highest  obligations\u2014the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human  Services (HHS), and Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014and, within the Department  of Defense, the two agencies with the highest obligations\u2014the  Departments of the Army and Navy. The results of our review of these  five selected agencies are not generalizable to all federal agencies.  However, these five selected agencies awarded about 51 percent of  contract obligations associated with contract awards for 2015 and 2016,  which were the most-recent contract award data available at the time of  our review, and during this period the newest Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) tax-debt provision was implemented. We reviewed  selected agencies\u2019 policies and procedures related to awarding contracts  to prospective contractors that report they owe certain tax debts and met  with agency officials to discuss how their agencies consider contractors\u2019  reported federal tax debt before awarding a federal contract. Specifically,  we met with agency officials who supervise contracting officers, such as  the Head of Contracting Activity, Director of Contracts, or other  contracting managers, policy and procurement officials, and suspension  and debarment officials from the selected agencies. Additionally, we  reviewed and analyzed applicable laws and regulations, as well as  applicable policies and procedures from DOE, HHS, VA, the Navy, and  the Army for considering contractors\u2019 reported federal tax debt when  awarding federal contracts. In addition, we interviewed staff from the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy  and officials from the Interagency Suspension and Debarment  Committee, and the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council to obtain an  understanding of how the law is implemented through the FAR. We also  met with the General Services Administration (GSA) to obtain an  understanding of the System for Award Management (SAM), including  the registration of prospective contractors and their reporting of certain  federal tax debt to the representation requirement of FAR \u00a7 52.209-11  and the certification of \u00a7 52.209-5.", "As part of this work, we analyzed FPDS-NG contract award and SAM  contractor registration data to identify instances where contractors  reported having certain qualifying federal tax debt and received a contract  award (including task orders). Specifically, we electronically matched  FPDS-NG contract award data from 2015 and 2016 to the relevant  contractors\u2019 SAM registration. We then analyzed the relevant contractors\u2019  representations and certifications most recently updated in SAM before  the relevant contract award to identify all instances where contractors  reported that they had a federal tax debt as defined in FAR \u00a7 52.209-11  or \u00a7 52.209-5 within our time frame. From the resulting list, we identified  the contracts that selected agencies awarded to contractors that reported  these qualifying federal tax debts. In addition, we reviewed a  nongeneralizable sample of 15 contract awards selected from the five  selected agencies to provide illustrative examples of the extent to which  these agencies\u2019 control activities ensured required actions were taken  before contract award. These 15 contract awards were selected based on  numerous criteria, including the prospective contractors\u2019 (1) responses  under FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 or \u00a7 52.209-5 in SAM before the new contract  award, and (2) having tax debts as of December 15, 2016, that were not  in a repayment agreement with the IRS. Further, when selecting  contract awards that had a \u00a7 52.209-5 certification, we considered only  contractors having at least $3,500 in tax debts as of December 15, 2016.", "We identified the relevant contractor population and then considered the  following factors simultaneously to select the 15 case examples: unique contractor Taxpayer Identification Number across selected agency contracting office locations,  the amount of tax debt owed by the prospective contractor,  the amount of award obligations, and  IRS assessment of a Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (TFRP).", "We selected case examples that represent a variety of these factors. We  reviewed seven contract awards made to contractors that reported that  they had certain tax debts and eight contract awards made to contractors  that reported that they did not have certain tax debts as part of their \u00a7  52.209-11 representations and \u00a7 52.209-5 certifications in SAM. For  these 15 contract awards, we reviewed pre\u2013contract award  documentation, which included tax debt\u2013related representations and  certifications retrieved by the selected agencies from SAM, and copies of  historical tax transcripts and other records, such as revenue officers\u2019  notes obtained from the IRS. For the case examples presented in this  report, we rounded tax debt and contract obligation amounts, did not  identify the awarding agency, and did not meet with awarding agency  officials to discuss each contract award to protect sensitive taxpayer  information.", "To determine the extent to which executive-branch agency contracts were  awarded in 2015 and 2016 to federal contractors with federal tax debt,  and characteristics of those contract awards and contractors, we  electronically matched data from FPDS-NG on contract awards (including  task orders) for all executive agencies with (1) data from SAM on  contractors\u2019 representations and certifications of their tax debt, and (2)  data from the IRS on tax debts owed by these contractors. Specifically,  we used the Data Universal Numbering System number to match data  from FPDS-NG with contractor registration data from SAM to obtain  additional information on these contractors, such as the contractors\u2019  Taxpayer Identification Numbers and their representations and  certifications of tax debt. Using the contractor Taxpayer Identification  Number from SAM, we then matched our list of contractors with IRS data  to identify our population of contractors that received a contract award  and had unpaid federal tax debts. Our analysis included all of the  executive-branch agencies. Further, our analysis describes some of  characteristics of these debts, including the total amount of unpaid taxes,  whether the contractors had a TFRP, and whether or not contractors had  unpaid taxes that were timely paid or appeared to be finally determined,  as of December 15, 2016, which was the time of our data extract. We  also analyzed whether contractors that were assessed unpaid taxes in  the IRS data reported having certain tax debts as part of their \u00a7 52.209- 11 representations and \u00a7 52.209-5 certifications in SAM. We reviewed the  most-recent \u00a7 52.209-11 representation and \u00a7 52.209-5 certification prior  to the relevant contract award. Our analysis may understate the  population of contractors with tax debt to the extent that contractors  repaid their tax debts before the timing of our data extract. Specifically,  our analysis does not include any contractors that may have owed federal  taxes at the time of a new contract award during this period, but that paid  or otherwise resolved their tax debts before December 15, 2016.  Additionally, our analysis focuses on contract awards made in 2015 and  2016, and not contract modifications made during this period. In 2015 and  2016, federal agencies obligated $400 billion in modifications to contracts  made in 2014 or earlier, almost half of all federal contract obligations in  this period. We identify contractors who potentially may have had federal  tax debt meeting the definitions of tax debt under FAR \u00a7 52.209-11 and \u00a7  52.209-5 before the contract award, but cannot verify whether that was  the case.", "To determine the extent to which the IRS identified selected federal  contractors\u2019 payments made for levy in 2015 and 2016, we identified the  population of contractors that owed taxes at the same time they received  a contract award during our period by matching FPDS-NG, SAM, and IRS  Unpaid Assessment data, as described above. We then determined  whether the tax debt had ever been levied or blocked by the Federal  Payment Levy Program (FPLP) as of December 15, 2016, according to  IRS data. We also interviewed IRS officials about levying federal  contractor payments and reviewed Internal Revenue Manual sections and  other relevant documents from the IRS.", "We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG, SAM, and IRS Unpaid  Assessment data by reviewing relevant documentation, interviewing  knowledgeable agency officials, and performing electronic testing to  determine the validity of specific data elements in the databases.
