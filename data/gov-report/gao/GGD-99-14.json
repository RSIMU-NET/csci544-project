Unless corrected, such failures could have a costly, widespread impact. The problem is rooted in how dates are recorded and computed. For the past several decades, systems have typically used two digits to represent the year\u2014such as \u201c97\u201d for 1997\u2014to save electronic storage space and reduce operating costs. In such a format, however, 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900. Software and systems experts nationwide are concerned that this ambiguity could cause systems to malfunction in unforeseen ways, or to fail completely.", "As we reported to you and testified to Congress earlier this year, the public faces a risk that critical services could be severely disrupted by the Year 2000 computing crisis. Financial transactions could be delayed, airline flights grounded, and national defense affected. Also, the many interdependencies that exist among governments and within key economic sectors could cause the failure of a single system to have adverse repercussions across the nation and internationally. While managers in the government and the private sector are taking many actions to mitigate these risks, a significant amount of work remains, and time frames are unrelenting.", "One key concern in addressing the Year 2000 problem is the availability of trained information technology personnel. We reported in April 1998, that while various agencies stated that they or their contractors had problems in obtaining or retaining information technology personnel, no governmentwide strategy existed to address recruiting and retaining the personnel with the appropriate skills for Year 2000-related work. We recommended that the Chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion develop a personnel strategy which includes (1) determining the need for various information specialists, (2) identifying any administrative or statutory changes that would be required to waive reemployment penalties for former federal employees, and (3) identifying ways to retain key Year 2000 staff in agencies through the turn of the century. We reemphasized the need for such a strategy in a June 1998 testimony.", "Within the executive branch, several executive councils and agencies are responsible for the human resources aspect of the Year 2000 effort. These councils and agencies, and their respective Year 2000 responsibilities are described below:", "The President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion is chaired by an Assistant to the President and is comprised of one representative from each of the executive departments and from other federal agencies as determined by the chair. The chair of the Conversion Council is tasked with the following Year 2000 roles: (1) overseeing federal agencies\u2019 Year 2000 activities, (2) acting as chief spokesperson in national and international forums, (3) providing policy coordination of executive branch activities with state, local, and tribal governments, and (4) promoting appropriate federal roles with respect to private sector activities.", "To date, the Conversion Council has established several working groups to address Year 2000 concerns. One of these is the Workforce Issues working group, which began meeting in May 1998. The working group is chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Labor, and includes officials from the Departments of Labor, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Defense, as well as OPM and the Small Business Administration. The group\u2019s main objective is to determine what the federal government can do to help meet the country\u2019s needs for technically skilled personnel to address the Year 2000 problem, with special attention to small businesses, local governments, and organizations in rural areas.", "The CIO Council is comprised of CIOs and Deputy CIOs from 30 federal departments and agencies, representatives from OMB, and the chairs of the Government Information Technology Services Board and Information Technology Resources Board. It is the principal interagency forum for improving the design, modernization, use, sharing, and performance of information technology resources. The Council\u2019s role includes: (1) developing recommendations for information technology management policy, procedures, and standards, (2) identifying opportunities to share information resources, and (3) assessing and addressing the needs of the federal government for an information technology workforce. One of the committees reporting to the CIO Council, the Education and Training Committee, is charged with addressing issues in hiring, training, and maintaining an effective federal information technology workforce.", "OMB is responsible for overseeing federal agencies\u2019 responses to the Year 2000 problem. In early 1997, OMB issued a broad Year 2000 strategy for the federal government and required that 24 major agencies submit quarterly reports on their Year 2000 progress. On January 20, 1998, OMB added new quarterly reporting requirements, specifically asking agencies to provide a narrative description of progress, including a description of any problems affecting progress and, in particular, any problems in acquiring or retaining skilled personnel. In March and April 1998, OMB requested that an additional 31 small agencies report their progress to OMB by April 30, 1998, and another 10 small agencies and other entities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the United States Postal Service, report by May 15, 1998.

For example, in May 1998, the Department of Agriculture reported that several of its agencies expressed particular concern that the loss of staff would affect their ability to meet Year 2000 deadlines. Specifically, the Farm Services Agency reported that it lost 28 (7 percent) of its 403 information technology staff in the first 6 months of fiscal year 1998.", "Agencies have also reported that recruiting replacements for information technology personnel is difficult. The Department of Veterans Affairs noted that recruiting is very competitive for Year 2000 professionals in some geographic areas, and stated the concern that with lucrative finders fees being advertised, government employees may leave for the private sector. Also, the National Credit Union Administration reported that it had experienced difficulties in hiring senior Year 2000 program officials.", "Among the various types of information technology workers needed, computer programmers are reported to be in the shortest supply. For example, in February 1998, the Justice Department reported that it had difficulty hiring and retaining skilled COBOL programmers.

These agencies reported that they are having to increase the hourly rate they pay for contractor staff because contractors are increasing their own staff salaries. For example, the Department of Agriculture indicated that its agencies are experiencing contracting delays as vendors find it increasingly difficult to bring on more contract employees without substantial increases in contract dollars. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that some of its contractors are losing personnel to higher salaries with other contractors. When replacing these personnel, the contractors are increasing their hourly rates.", "Four agencies reported delays on six system development efforts because of problems they had encountered in obtaining contractors to address the Year 2000 problem. For example, the State Department reported that the loss of key contractor personnel had delayed the completion of one of its mission critical systems, the Management, Policy and Planning Information System, by 3 months. The Department of Commerce also reported that its Patent and Trademark Office experienced a 3-month delay on one of its mission-critical system development efforts, the Classified Search and Image Retrieval system, when the contractor was unable to place qualified staff on the task.

In return for this lump-sum payment, the employee must sign a service agreement with the agency to complete a specified period of employment.", "Superior qualifications appointments: Agencies have the authority to set pay for new appointments or reappointments of individuals to General Schedule (GS) positions above step 1 of the grade on the basis of the candidate\u2019s superior qualifications or the agency\u2019s special need.", "Pay at highest previous rate: Upon reemployment, transfer, reassignment, promotion, or change in type of appointment, agencies can set an employee\u2019s basic pay by taking into account the employee\u2019s previous pay rate while employed in another civilian federal position (with certain exceptions).", "Temporary and term appointments: Agencies can use temporary appointments in the competitive service for positions not expected to last longer than 1 year, but which can be extended for 1 additional year. Agencies can use term appointments when positions are expected to last longer than 1 year but not more than 4 years.", "Retention allowances for individual employees: Agencies have the authority to make continuing payments of up to 25 percent of basic pay if the agency determines that (1) the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee or the agency\u2019s special need for the employee\u2019s services makes it essential to retain the employee and (2) the employee would be likely to leave federal service in the absence of a retention allowance. Retention allowances must be paid in accordance with the agency\u2019s previously established retention allowance plan and must be reviewed and certified annually.", "Performance and incentive awards: Agencies can provide employees a lump-sum cash award on the basis of a fully successful or better rating of record or in recognition of accomplishments that contribute to the improvement of government operations. Awards based on the rating of record can be up to 10 percent of salary, or up to 20 percent for exceptional performance, provided the award does not exceed $10,000 per employee. With OPM review and approval, agencies can grant awards over $10,000, up to $25,000.
