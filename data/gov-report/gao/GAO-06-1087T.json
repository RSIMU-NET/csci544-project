Specifically, in 2005, GAO reported that DHS had initiated efforts to fulfill 13 key cybersecurity responsibilities, but it had not fully addressed any of them. For example, DHS established forums to foster information sharing among federal officials with information security responsibilities and among various law enforcement entities, but had not developed national threat and vulnerability assessments for cybersecurity. Since that time, DHS has made progress on its 13 key responsibilities--including the release of its National Infrastructure Protection Plan--but none have been completely addressed. Moreover, in 2006, GAO reported that DHS had begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill its responsibility to develop an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery, but these efforts were not complete or comprehensive. For example, DHS established working groups to facilitate coordination among government and industry infrastructure officials and fostered exercises in which government and private industry could practice responding to cyber events, but many of its efforts lacked timeframes for completion and the relationships among its various initiatives were not evident. DHS faces a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to fulfill its cybersecurity responsibilities, including establishing effective partnerships with stakeholders, demonstrating the value it can provide to private sector infrastructure owners, and reaching consensus on DHS's role in Internet recovery and on when the department should get involved in responding to an Internet disruption. DHS faces a particular challenge in attaining the organizational stability and leadership it needs to gain the trust of other stakeholders in the cybersecurity world--including other government agencies as well as the private sector. In May 2005, we reported that multiple senior DHS cybersecurity officials had recently left the department. In July 2005, DHS undertook a reorganization which established the position of the Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security and Telecommunications--in part to raise the visibility of cybersecurity issues in the department. However, over a year later, this position remains vacant. To strengthen DHS's ability to implement its cybersecurity responsibilities and to resolve underlying challenges, GAO has made about 25 recommendations over the last several years. These recommendations focus on the need to (1) conduct threat and vulnerability assessments, (2) develop a strategic analysis and warning capability for identifying potential cyber attacks, (3) protect infrastructure control systems, (4) enhance public/private information sharing, and (5) facilitate recovery planning, including recovery of the Internet in case of a major disruption. These recommendations provide a high-level road map for DHS to use to help improve our nation's cybersecurity posture.

In  recent years, the sophistication and effectiveness of cyberattacks  have steadily advanced. These attacks often take advantage of flaws  in software code, circumvent signature-based tools that commonly  identify and prevent known threats, and use social engineering  techniques designed to trick the unsuspecting user into divulging  sensitive information or propagating attacks.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about attacks from  individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as crime,  terrorism, foreign intelligence-gathering, and acts of war. As greater  amounts of money are transferred through computer systems, as  more sensitive economic and commercial information is exchanged  electronically, and as the nation's defense and intelligence  communities increasingly rely on commercially available  information technology, the likelihood increases that information  attacks will threaten vital national interests.", "Recent attacks and threats have further underscored the need to  bolster the cybersecurity of our government's and our nation's  computer systems and, more importantly, of the critical operations  and infrastructures they support. Recent examples of attacks  include the following:  In March 2005, security consultants within the electric industry  reported that hackers were targeting the U.S. electric power grid  and had gained access to U.S. utilities' electronic control  systems. Computer security specialists reported that, in a few  cases, these intrusions had \"caused an impact.\" While officials  stated that hackers had not caused serious damage to the  systems that feed the nation's power grid, the constant threat of  intrusion has heightened concerns that electric companies may  not have adequately fortified their defenses against a potential  catastrophic strike.", "In January 2005, a major university reported that a hacker had  broken into a database containing 32,000 student and employee  social security numbers, potentially compromising their  identities and finances. In similar incidents during 2003 and 2004,  it was reported that hackers had attacked the systems of other  universities, exposing the personal information of over 1.8  million people.", "In June 2003, the U.S. government issued a warning concerning a  virus that specifically targeted financial institutions. Experts said  the BugBear.b virus was programmed to determine whether a  victim had used an e-mail address for any of the roughly 1,300  financial institutions listed in the virus's code. If a match were  found, the software attempted to collect and document user  input by logging keystrokes and then provided this information  to a hacker, who could use it in attempts to break into the banks'  networks.", "In January 2003, the Slammer worm infected more than 90  percent of vulnerable computers worldwide within 10 minutes of  its release on the Internet by exploiting a known vulnerability for  which a patch had been available for 6 months. Slammer caused  network outages, canceled airline flights, and automated teller  machine failures. In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission confirmed that the Slammer worm had infected a  private computer network at a nuclear power plant, disabling a  safety monitoring system for nearly 5 hours and causing the  plant\u2019s process computer to fail.  The worm reportedly also  affected communication on the control networks of at least five  utilities by propagating so quickly that control system traffic was  blocked. Cost estimates on the impact of the work range from  $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion.", "In May 2005, we reported that federal agencies were facing a set of  emerging cybersecurity threats as a result of increasingly  sophisticated methods of attack and the blending of once distinct  types of attack into more complex and damaging forms. Examples  of these threats include spam (unsolicited commercial e-mail),  phishing (fraudulent messages used to obtain personal or sensitive  data), and spyware (software that monitors user activity without the  user's knowledge or consent). Spam consumes significant resources  and is used as a delivery mechanism for other types of cyberattacks;  phishing can lead to identity theft, loss of sensitive information, and  reduced trust and use of electronic government services; and  spyware can capture and release sensitive data, make unauthorized  changes, and decrease system performance. These attacks are also  becoming increasingly automated with the use of botnets\u2014  compromised computers that can be remotely controlled by  attackers to automatically launch attacks. Bots (short for robots)  have become a key automation tool that is used to speed the  infection of vulnerable systems.", "Federal law and regulation call for critical infrastructure protection  activities that are intended to enhance the cyber and physical  security of both the public and private infrastructures that are  essential to national security, national economic security, and  national public health and safety.

These responsibilities include developing plans, building  partnerships, and improving information sharing, as well as  implementing activities related to the five priorities in the National  Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. These priorities are (1) developing  and enhancing national cyber analysis and warning, (2) reducing  cyberspace threats and vulnerabilities, (3) promoting awareness of  and training in security issues, (4) securing governments\u2019  cyberspace, and (5) strengthening national security and  international cyberspace security cooperation. See table 1 for a list  of DHS\u2019s 13 key cybersecurity responsibilities. These  responsibilities are described in more detail in appendix I. To fulfill  its cybersecurity role, in June 2003, DHS established the National  Cyber Security Division to take the lead in addressing the  cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.", "In our 2005 report and testimony, we noted that while DHS initiated  multiple efforts to fulfill its responsibilities, it had not fully  addressed any of the 13 responsibilities, and much work remained  to fulfill them. For example, the department established the United  States Computer Emergency Readiness Team as a public/private  partnership to make cybersecurity a coordinated national effort, and  it established forums to build greater trust and information sharing  among federal officials with information security responsibilities  and law enforcement entities. However, DHS had not yet developed  national cyber threat and vulnerability assessments or  government/industry contingency recovery plans for cybersecurity.   Since that report was issued, DHS has made progress on its  responsibilities, but none have been completely addressed. For  example, in June 2006, the agency released the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan; however, supplemental sector- specific plans have not yet been finalized. Further, DHS reported  that it has expanded the use of a situational awareness tool that  supports cyber analysis and warning from one to seven federal  agencies. However, this does not yet comprise a national analysis  and warning capability.", "In our 2006 report and testimony, we focused particularly on one of  DHS\u2019s key cybersecurity responsibilities\u2014facilitating Internet  recovery. We reported that DHS had begun a variety of initiatives  to fulfill its responsibility for developing an integrated public/private  plan for Internet recovery, but that these efforts were not  comprehensive or complete. For example, DHS had developed high- level plans for infrastructure protection and incident response;  however, the components of these plans that address the Internet  infrastructure were not complete. Further, several representatives  of private-sector firms supporting the Internet infrastructure  expressed concerns about the plans, noting that the plans would be  difficult to execute in times of crisis. The department had also  started a variety of initiatives to improve the nation\u2019s ability to  recover from Internet disruptions, including establishing working  groups to facilitate coordination and exercises in which government  and private industry practice responding to cyber events. However,  progress to date on these initiatives had been limited, and other  initiatives lacked time frames for completion. Also, the relationships  among these initiatives were not evident. As a result, we reported  that the government was not yet adequately prepared to effectively  coordinate public/private plans for recovering from a major Internet  disruption. A private-sector organization subsequently reported that  our nation was unprepared to reconstitute the Internet after a  massive disruption, noting that there were significant gaps in  government response plans and that the responsibilities of the  multiple organizations that would plan a role in recovery were  unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Faces Many Challenges; Organizational Stability and Leadership Are Keys to Success", "paragraphs": ["DHS faces numerous challenges in fulfilling its cybersecurity-related  CIP responsibilities. Key challenges in fulfilling DHS\u2019s broad  responsibilities include increasing awareness about cybersecurity  roles and capabilities, establishing effective partnerships with  stakeholders, achieving two-way information sharing with these  stakeholders, and demonstrating the value it can provide to private  sector infrastructure owners. Key challenges to establishing a plan  for recovering from Internet disruptions include addressing innate  characteristics of the Internet that make planning for and  responding to disruptions difficult, achieving consensus on DHS\u2019s  role and on when the department should get involved in responding  to a disruption, addressing legal issues affecting DHS\u2019s ability to  provide assistance to restore Internet service, and overcoming  reluctance of many in the private sector to share information on  Internet disruptions with DHS. Further, the department faces a  particular challenge in attaining the organizational stability and  leadership it needs to gain the trust of other stakeholders in the  cybersecurity world\u2014including other government agencies as well  as the private sector.", "In May 2005, we reported that multiple senior DHS cybersecurity  officials had recently left the department. These officials included  the NCSD Director, the Deputy Director responsible for Outreach  and Awareness, the Director of the US-CERT Control Systems  Security Center, the Under Secretary for the Information Analysis  and Infrastructure Protection Directorate and the Assistant  Secretary responsible for the Information Protection Office.", "Infrastructure sector officials stated that the lack of stable  leadership has diminished NCSD's ability to maintain trusted  relationships with its infrastructure partners and has hindered its  ability to adequately plan and execute activities.

Together, the recommendations provide a high-level roadmap for  DHS to use to improve our nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture. Until it  addresses these recommendations, DHS will have difficulty  achieving results in its role as a federal focal point for cybersecurity  of critical infrastructures.", "Threat and Vulnerability Assessments: In May 2005, we reported  that while DHS had made progress in planning and coordinating  efforts to enhance cybersecurity, much more work remained to be  done for the department to fulfill its basic responsibilities\u2014 including conducting important threat and vulnerability  assessments. Specifically, we noted that DHS had participated in  national efforts to identify and assess cyber threats and had begun  to take steps to facilitate sector-specific vulnerability assessments,  but that it had not completed a national cyber threat assessment,  sector-specific vulnerability assessments, or the identification of  cross-sector interdependencies that are called for in the cyberspace  strategy. We made recommendations to strengthen the department's  ability to implement key cybersecurity responsibilities by  prioritizing and completing critical activities and resolving  underlying challenges. DHS concurred with our recommendation to  engage stakeholders in prioritizing its key cybersecurity  responsibilities, including performing a national cyber threat  assessment and facilitating sector cyber vulnerability assessments.  However, these efforts are not yet complete.", "Strategic Analysis and Warnings: In 2001, we reported on the  analysis and warnings efforts within DHS's predecessor, the  National Infrastructure Protection Center, and we identified several  challenges that were impeding the development of an effective  strategic analysis and warning capability. We reported that a  generally accepted methodology for analyzing strategic cyber-based  threats did not exist. Specifically, there was no standard  terminology, no standard set of factors to consider, and no  established thresholds for determining the sophistication of attack  techniques. We also reported that the Center did not have the  industry-specific data on factors such as critical systems  components, known vulnerabilities, and interdependencies.", "We therefore recommended that the responsible executive-branch  officials and agencies establish a capability for strategic analysis of  computer-based threats, including developing a methodology,  acquiring expertise, and obtaining infrastructure data.", "More recently, in 2005, we reported that DHS had established  various initiatives to enhance its analytical capabilities, including  intelligence-sharing through the US CERT and situational awareness  tools through the US CERT Einstein program at selected federal  agencies. However, we noted that DHS was still facing the same  challenges in developing strategic analysis and warning capabilities  and that our original recommendations had not been fully  implemented.", "Control Systems: In March 2004, we reported that several  factors\u2014including the adoption of standardized technologies with  known vulnerabilities and the increased connectivity of control  systems to other systems\u2014had contributed to an escalation of the  risk of cyber-attacks against control systems. We recommended  that DHS develop and implement a strategy for coordinating with  the private sector and with other government agencies to improve  control system security, including an approach for coordinating the  various ongoing efforts to secure control systems. DHS concurred  with our recommendation and, in December 2004, issued a high- level national strategy for control systems security. This strategy  includes, among other things, goals to create a capability to respond  to attacks on control systems and to mitigate vulnerabilities, bridge  industry and government efforts, and develop control systems  security awareness. However, the strategy does not yet include  underlying details and milestones for completing activities. In 2007,  we plan to evaluate federal efforts to enhance the protection of  critical control systems.", "Information Sharing: Over the years, we have issued a series of  reports, summarized below, on efforts to improve information  sharing in support of critical infrastructure protection. Further,  because of the importance of this topic, in January 2005, we  designated establishing appropriate and effective information- sharing mechanisms to improve homeland security as a new high- risk area in our report on federal programs and operations at risk.  We reported that the ability to share security-related information  can unify the efforts of federal, state, and local government agencies  and the private sector in preventing or minimizing terrorist attacks.", "In July 2004, we recommended actions to improve the effectiveness  of DHS's information-sharing efforts. We recommended that  officials within the Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection Directorate (1) proceed with and establish milestones for  developing an information-sharing plan and (2) develop appropriate  DHS policies and procedures for interacting with ISACs, sector  coordinators (groups or individuals designated to represent their  respective infrastructure sectors' CIP activities), and sector-specific  agencies and for coordination and information sharing within the  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate and  other DHS components. DHS stated that the report generally  provided an accurate analysis and planned actions to address these  recommendations. However, as of today, the recommendations have  not yet been implemented.", "More recently, in March 2006, we reported that more than 4 years  after September 11, the nation still lacked governmentwide policies  and processes to help agencies integrate a myriad of ongoing efforts  to improve the sharing of terrorism-related information that is  critical to protecting our homeland. Responsibility for creating  these policies and processes now lies with the Director of National   Intelligence\u2014and should include a cybersecurity focus. We made  several recommendations to the Director of National Intelligence to  strengthen information sharing efforts.", "Most recently, in April 2006, we reported on DHS\u2019s efforts to  implement the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002, which  was enacted to encourage nonfederal entities to voluntarily share  critical infrastructure information and established protections for  it. DHS has initiated several actions, including issuing interim  operating procedures and creating a program office to administer  the critical infrastructure protection program called for by the  Critical Infrastructure Information Act. The program office has also  begun to accept and safeguard critical infrastructure information  submitted voluntarily by infrastructure owners and is sharing it with  other DHS entities and, on a limited basis, with other government  entities. For example, as of January 2006, the program office had  received about 290 submissions of critical infrastructure  information from various sectors. However, DHS faces challenges  that impede the private sector\u2019s willingness to share sensitive  information, including defining specific government needs for  critical infrastructure information, determining how the information  will be used, assuring the private sector that the information will be  protected and who will be authorized to have access to the  information, and demonstrating to critical infrastructure owners the  benefits of sharing the information. We recommended that DHS  better define its own and other federal agencies\u2019 critical  infrastructure information needs and explain how it and the other  agencies will use the information they receive from the private  sector. We also recommended that DHS establish a specific deadline  for issuing its final operating procedures. DHS concurred with our  findings and recommendations and has made progress in selected  areas. Specifically, on September 1, 2006, DHS released its final  operating procedures.", "Recovery Planning: In May 2005, we reported that while DHS had  made progress in planning and coordinating efforts to enhance  cybersecurity, much more work remained to be done to fulfill its  responsibilities\u2014including facilitating government and  government/industry cybersecurity recovery plans. More recently,  in June 2006, we reported that DHS had begun a variety of initiatives  to fulfill its responsibility for developing an integrated public/private  plan for Internet recovery, but that these efforts were not complete  or comprehensive. Further, we reported that DHS faced key  challenges in establishing a plan for recovering from Internet  disruptions, including obtaining consensus on its role and on when  the department should get involved in responding to a disruption,  overcoming the reluctance of many in the private sector to share  information on Internet disruptions, addressing leadership  uncertainties within the department. We made recommendations to  strengthen the department's ability to help recover from Internet  disruptions. DHS concurred with our recommendations and  identified plans to begin addressing them.", "We also reported that the federal laws and regulations that address  critical infrastructure protection, disaster recovery, and the  telecommunications infrastructure provide broad guidance that  applies to the Internet, but it is not clear how useful these  authorities would be in helping to recover from a major Internet  disruption. Specifically, key legislation on critical infrastructure  protection does not address roles and responsibilities in the event of  an Internet disruption. Other laws and regulations governing  disaster response and emergency communications have never been  used for Internet recovery. We suggested that Congress consider  clarifying the legal framework guiding Internet recovery.", "In summary, while DHS has initiatives underway to fulfill its many  cybersecurity responsibilities, major tasks remain to be done. These  include assessing and reducing cyber threats and vulnerabilities and  coordinating incident response and recovery planning efforts. In  fulfilling its cybersecurity responsibilities, DHS has many challenges  to overcome, several of which will be difficult without effective  leadership. Effective leadership is essential in order to fulfill key  government responsibilities and to partner and build credibility with  the private sector. Addressing this leadership void starts with DHS  naming its Assistant Secretary of Cyber Security and  Telecommunications. Once that position is filled, our  recommendations in the areas of threat and vulnerability analysis,  analysis and warning, control systems protection, information  sharing, and recovery planning can help prioritize efforts to secure  our nation\u2019s public and private infrastructures.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
