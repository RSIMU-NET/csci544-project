The amendments were designed largely to strengthen bank supervision and to help avoid a taxpayer bailout of the BIF similar to the nearly $105 billion in taxpayer funds that Congress provided between 1989 and 1993 to the Resolution Trust Corporation to protect the depositors of failed thrifts. The amendments require the banking regulators to take specified supervisory actions when they identify unsafe or unsound practices or conditions. For example, the regulators can close banks whose capital levels fall below predetermined levels.

Although the Treasury IG office plans to divert staff to work on MLRs as needed, other mandated work could limit their ability to do so. For example, the IG is required to do audit work on the Treasury Department\u2019s compliance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO). The Treasury IG also has developed a comprehensive training module on how to conduct MLRs for its current staff. The module includes separate student and teacher instructions so Treasury IG staff with banking experience can train staff with limited banking experience. The modules are also designed to be self-taught and can be used without assistance.

The guidelines direct the IG staff to obtain and review basic documents about these troubled banks\u2014such as examination reports dating back several years; enforcement actions; and historical financial data, such as asset growth over time. When a bank fails and causes a material loss, the IG staff are to interview responsible bank examiners and other regulatory officials and meet with former bank officials and FDIC closing personnel.

These reasons may include rapid growth; poor loan underwriting and documentation; loan concentrations, such as in real estate; and insider abuses.", "The Federal Reserve and FDIC IGs\u2019 MLR audit guidelines differ from the Treasury IG audit guidelines in that they generally call for the staff to review failed bank loan portfolios when loan losses are determined to be the primary cause of failure. FDIC IG officials we contacted said that they need to review loan portfolios to arrive at an independent judgment as to why the banks failed. The officials said that they do not rely solely on documents generated by the bank regulators\u2014such as examination reports and supporting workpapers\u2014to determine the cause of failure.", "Although the Federal Reserve IG follows a similar procedure to the FDIC IG for selecting a sample of loans to review, Federal Reserve IG officials said that they perform loan reviews primarily to assess the quality of bank supervision. These Federal Reserve IG loan review procedures are discussed later in this section.", "Under the loan review audit guidelines, FDIC IG staff are to select a sample of the loans on the books of banks whose failures result in material losses. The sample is to include classified (troubled) loans and nonclassified loans as well as a mixture of commercial, real-estate, and consumer loans. Once a bank fails and causes a material loss, the staff are to visit the bank and review the sampled loans.

By reviewing information in the loan files dating back several years, for example, he said the staff could determine whether bank management had adopted an aggressive growth strategy without adequate regard for maintaining credit standards.", "Unlike the FDIC IG guidelines, the MLR audit guidelines developed by the Treasury IG do not call for loan reviews even if loan losses were the primary cause of failure. As a result of the time and resources necessary to complete a MLR, the guidelines state that the Treasury IG staff should generally rely on OCC examination reports and workpapers and discussions with examiners to assess the causes of a bank\u2019s failure. However, the guidelines do direct the IG staff to initiate loan reviews similar to those done by the FDIC and Federal Reserve IG staff in certain situations. The Treasury IG staff are to do a loan review if they determine that OCC\u2019s records do not adequately address or develop the problem(s) that resulted in a bank\u2019s failure.

For example, the IG staff are to determine whether the regulators complied with their policies and procedures in supervising the banks. Among other requirements, the IG staff are directed to determine whether the bank regulators selected an adequate sample of loans to evaluate at each bank examination and made determinations about the bank\u2019s financial condition. The IG staff are also to review the supporting workpapers for each examination to determine whether the regulators had adequate support for their findings on the quality of each bank\u2019s loan portfolio.", "The guidelines also direct the IG staff to determine whether the bank regulators had taken timely and effective enforcement actions\u2014such as Memorandums of Understanding, Cease and Desist Orders (C&D), and Civil Money Penalties\u2014against banks that engage in unsafe or unsound practices. For example, the Treasury IG guidelines direct the staff to focus their analysis on problems that the bank regulators identified during the course of examinations, particularly those that resulted in the bank\u2019s failure. The IG staff are to determine what enforcement actions, if any, were taken against the bank by OCC to get the bank to correct these problems, and the guidelines direct the IG staff to determine why OCC did not take particular enforcement actions against a bank. Moreover, the guidelines call for the IG staff to evaluate OCC\u2019s oversight of banks that are subject to enforcement actions to ensure that bank managers comply with the provisions of such actions. Once this analysis has been completed, the IG staff are to reach a conclusion about the timeliness and forcefulness of the OCC\u2019s enforcement actions. The FDIC IG and Federal Reserve IG MLR guidelines contain similar provisions.", "Federal Reserve IG officials we contacted said they primarily use the loan review process discussed earlier to assess the adequacy of the Federal Reserve\u2019s examinations of bank lending activities. In the recent MLR audit of Pioneer Bank, the officials said they reviewed a sample of 40 large commercial and commercial real estate loans in the bank\u2019s portfolio. The staff reviewed these loans in a manner similar to that done by bank examiners. For example, the staff determined, from a review of information in the files, whether they believed each loan should be classified as \u201csubstandard,\u201d \u201cdoubtful,\u201d or \u201closs.\u201d The staff used the regulatory examination standards that were in place at the time the loans were originated to make these classifications.", "Next, the staff compared their loan review findings to the findings of the Federal Reserve examiners who actually examined the bank in the years before the bank\u2019s failure. The IG officials said they tried to determine the reasons that their loan classifications differed from those of the Federal Reserve examiners and assess whether the examiners had adequate justification for their classifications. The IG staff concluded that the Federal Reserve examiners overlooked substantial weaknesses in the bank\u2019s lending practices over the years. Although the Federal Reserve IG officials said this type of analysis is complicated and time consuming, they believe it is often necessary for assessing the overall quality of the bank\u2019s supervision.", "However, FDIC IG officials said that when they conduct a loan review they use it for the purposes of determining the causes of bank failures rather than determining the adequacy of bank supervision.

The report concluded that the bank failed as a result of a massive securities fraud perpetrated by its investment adviser; the fraud resulted in a $43 million loss for the bank. The IG staff decided not to do a loan review for the JBT investigation because trading in government securities, rather than loan losses, caused the bank\u2019s failure. Instead, the IG staff focused its investigation on reviewing JBT\u2019s securities trading activities and the Federal Reserve\u2019s oversight of this trading.", "On April 29, 1994, the FDIC IG issued a report on TBSD, which failed on October 29, 1993. The report concluded that the bank failed as a result of poor loan underwriting, excessive real estate lending, high expenses, and poor management. As part of the MLR, FDIC staff reviewed a sample of 60 of TBSD\u2019s loans, including 41 real-estate loans. The IG staff identified many of the deficiencies in the bank\u2019s lending practices through the loan analysis.", "We reviewed the workpapers the IGs developed to support the JBT and TBSD reports to (1) ensure that the IGs complied with the MLR guidelines and (2) verify the basis for the reports\u2019 conclusions about the causes of the banks\u2019 failures. We also interviewed officials from the IGs\u2019 offices, as well as examination officials from the Federal Reserve and FDIC, respectively.

In addition, IG audit teams traveled to the banks\u2019 locations to review bank records and interview bank officials.", "The IGs also identified certain deficiencies in Federal Reserve and FDIC supervisory practices. For example, the Federal Reserve IG, in the JBT report, identified specific steps that the Federal Reserve could take to improve its oversight of bank securities trading activities. Moreover, the FDIC IG, in the TBSD report, recommended that FDIC evaluate on a case-by-case basis the need to collect better data about the quality of bank assets before approving the merger of weak banks. The FDIC IG further recommended that FDIC develop examination guidance to ensure that banks place reasonable limits on the financing of speculative real-estate projects.", "The IGs also obtained and reviewed copies of enforcement action documents that were taken against JBT and TBSD and summarized those actions in the MLR reports. However, we found that the FDIC IG did not fully evaluate whether FDIC ensured that TBSD complied with outstanding enforcement actions as provided in the MLR audit guidelines. We did such an analysis of FDIC supervision\u2019s follow-up efforts of its enforcement actions against TBSD. From our review, we determined that TBSD continued its aggressive real-estate lending activities even though FDIC had initiated an enforcement action intended to limit the bank\u2019s exposure. We also found that FDIC supervision did not ensure its enforcement actions were effective to get bank management to better control its real-estate lending. These additional insights may have strengthened the FDIC IG\u2019s recommendations to include supervisory follow-up of the effectiveness of actions taken.", "In 1985, FDIC issued a C&D against TBSD that, among other provisions, required the bank to improve its lending standards. On May 9, 1988, FDIC lifted the C&D, but the bank continued to have problems, such as high loan losses and high overhead expenses. According to the TBSD report workpapers, in September 1988, a FDIC examiner recommended that FDIC sign a Memorandum of Understanding with TBSD that would require the bank to correct its lending and operational problems. However, in April 1989, FDIC agreed to a resolution by TBSD\u2019s Board of Directors, in lieu of a Memorandum of Understanding, that required changes in the bank\u2019s operations. For example, the resolution called on the bank to assess its loan exposure to the commercial real-estate construction industry and the financial consequences for the bank in the event of a downturn in that industry. The resolution further directed TBSD management to consider capping its commercial real-estate loans as a percentage of the bank\u2019s total loans, assets, and capital.", "Despite the board resolution, bank management continued to pursue an aggressive commercial real-estate lending strategy, and FDIC did not take forceful actions to correct these problems for 2 years. The FDIC TBSD report showed that the bank\u2019s construction and commercial real-estate loans increased by nearly 75 percent from about $47 million to $82 million between year-end 1988 and year-end 1991. Many of these real-estate loans contributed to the bank\u2019s failure in 1993. California state banking regulators examined TBSD in 1989 and 1990 and gave its overall operations relatively high ratings: i.e., an overall CAMEL rating of \u201c2\u201d in 1990. FDIC officials did not begin to discover the extent of TBSD\u2019s loan loss problems until their examinations of the bank in late 1990 and in 1991. On the basis of these exam findings, FDIC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TBSD in April 1991 that required the bank to improve its operations.", "TBSD also disregarded the board resolution\u2019s provisions that it consider capping total commercial real-estate loans as a percentage of its assets and capital. Specifically, commercial real-estate loans grew from 35 percent of banks total assets to 42 percent between year-end 1988 and year-end 1991. In the same period, commercial real-estate loans increased from 423 percent of TBSD\u2019s total capital plus reserves to 597 percent.

In the 4 MLRs initiated as of February 28, 1995, by the FDIC and Federal Reserve IGs, between 5 to 11 staff visited the banks\u2019 premises within the first several weeks of their failures. These staff conducted initial interviews with regulatory and bank personnel, reviewed bank examination records, and conducted loan reviews. For example, in one recent FDIC IG MLR, six staff spent 2 weeks reviewing loan files on the bank\u2019s premises. A FDIC IG official said that the number of staff needed to perform MLRs should decline in the future as the organization gains experience in this type of work.", "IG officials also said that the resources necessary to complete a MLR report within the 6-month deadline can have temporary but disruptive effects on their normal operations. Treasury IG officials said that approximately 30 percent of their staff are already dedicated to assessing executive agency financial systems as required by the CFO Act. The Treasury IG officials estimate that 50 percent of their staff resources would be dedicated to CFO work by 1996. Therefore, an increasing MLR workload could hinder the Treasury IG\u2019s ability to devote sufficient staff resources to meet its CFO Act and other audit obligations. Similarly, Federal Reserve and FDIC IG officials said that the resources necessary to complete the JBT and TBSD reports within the 6-month deadline caused certain operational challenges. For example, these officials said they had to pull staff from other ongoing studies to assist in the material loss investigations.", "We believe that these disruptive effects on the IGs\u2019 operations could be magnified should there be a substantial increase in the number of costly bank failures, particularly in the case of the Treasury IG, which did not receive additional staffing to do MLRs. Although the Federal Reserve and FDIC IGs have increased their staffing in recent years, they could also face substantial pressures to complete MLR reports within 6 months should numerous banks fail simultaneously. For example, a FDIC IG official estimated that the organization could handle a maximum of about 14 MLRs per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MLRs Do Not Always Allow for Use of FDIC Investigators\u2019 Reports", "paragraphs": ["Another potential limitation of the current MLR process is that it does not always allow time for the IGs to review reports prepared by FDIC\u2019s Division of Asset Services (DAS) investigators who also investigate the causes of bank failures. Like MLR reports, these reports provide information about individual bank failures. However, Federal Reserve and FDIC IG officials question whether it would be beneficial to review these DAS reports and mentioned that these reports were often not available until months after banks failed.", "DAS is responsible for recovering a portion of FDIC\u2019s outlays to resolve bank failures by selling each failed bank\u2019s assets to private sector bidders. DAS also sends investigators to failed banks to determine whether FDIC could pursue civil claims against any bank officials culpable for the losses to help offset the costs of the failure. It is the policy of the DAS investigators to issue a report within 90 days of a bank failure\u2014although the process can take longer\u2014that documents their findings. This report is called a Post Closing Report (PCR). DAS has issued PCRs on JBT and TBSD.", "In our discussions, a Treasury IG official said that PCRs provide information that could be useful in doing MLR reports. The official also said it may make sense for the IGs to wait until DAS has issued PCRs before initiating MLRs. If the IGs initiated MLRs after PCRs, this could allow the IGs to avoid duplicating the work of the DAS investigators and it would allow the IGs to plan the scope of their MLR audit work on the basis of information contained in the PCRs.", "However, Federal Reserve and FDIC IG officials said that there is no significant relationship between MLRs and the DAS investigations. The officials said that DAS investigations are more narrowly focused than MLRs and, therefore, have limited use. For example, Federal Reserve IG officials pointed out that PCRs, unlike MLR reports, do not assess the quality of bank supervision. IG officials also said that they consult with FDIC DAS investigators during the course of MLRs to obtain information. Finally, the FDIC and Federal Reserve officials said that PCRs were often not available until months after a bank failure. For example, the JBT PCR was completed nearly 4 months after the failure, and the TBSD PCR was completed about 7 months after the failure. As discussed earlier, MLR reports must be completed within 6 months of a bank\u2019s failure.", "Although the PCR\u2019s primary purpose is to assess whether FDIC should pursue civil actions against former bank officials, the reports contain some information that is similar to that found in MLR reports. For example, we reviewed PCRs that were issued for JBT and TBSD. Like the MLR reports, these PCRs provide historical information about each bank and the results of regulator exam findings.

However, the current MLR requirements may not be the most cost-effective means of achieving improved bank supervision.", "The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Treasury IGs have made substantial efforts in preparation for performing MLRs as required by section 38(k). The IGs have also developed detailed and comprehensive MLR guidelines that, if effectively implemented, are adequate for meeting the IGs\u2019 responsibilities under section 38(k). The Federal Reserve and FDIC IGs have each used the guidelines to prepare MLR reports that fully described the causes of the JBT and TBSD failures. However, the FDIC IG could have gained greater insights on bank supervision if it had expanded its analysis of the effectiveness of the enforcement actions that FDIC took against TBSD.", "Although the MLR process can produce important benefits in understanding the circumstances surrounding individual bank failures, these benefits have been limited and are achieved at certain costs. IG officials we contacted said that the two MLR reports completed during the first year that section 38(k) went into effect did not provide an adequate base of evidence to assess the overall quality of bank supervision.", "The limited benefits may have been outweighed by the costs associated with producing the MLR reports, which include IG personnel and financial expenditures; temporary disruptions in IG office operations; and potential duplication of effort among the IGs and FDIC DAS. However, if the IGs had more flexibility to determine the number and timing of MLRs to perform each year, they could (1) have more flexibility to utilize their resources, particularly in years when there are numerous bank failures; (2) potentially take advantage of PCRs issued by DAS; and (3) do broader analysis of the overall quality of bank supervision. A more flexible approach could still maintain the original intent of section 38(k), which was to hold the bank regulators accountable for their actions. Thus, Congress may wish to consider whether the currently required approach remains the best available. Similarly, we believe that requiring us to perform annual reviews of MLRs may no longer add sufficient value to the MLR or bank supervisory processes to warrant continuation.", "We do not make any recommendations for improving overall bank supervision in this report because we agree with the IG officials that the limited number of reports produced so far does not provide an adequate base for identifying improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Inspector General of FDIC, in future MLR reports, take steps to more fully assess the effectiveness of FDIC\u2019s enforcement actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress may wish to consider whether the current MLR requirement, which requires the IGs to report on bank and thrift failures costing the deposit insurance funds in excess of $25 million, is a cost-effective means of achieving the requirement\u2019s intended benefit\u2014to help improve bank supervision. If it determines that the requirement is not cost effective, Congress can choose to either repeal or amend the requirement.

We also conducted a round table discussion session with representatives from each of the IG offices to share their views on some of the MLR issues and concerns. Additionally, we met with bank supervision officials and bank examiners from the Federal Reserve and FDIC to obtain their views on the MLR process. We also reviewed the legislative history of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, pilot studies completed by the IGs, and our previous reports on bank failures and bank supervision.", "To assess the adequacy of the IGs MLR audit guidelines, we reviewed them for their completeness and relevance to the MLR objectives. We also compared the MLR audit guidelines to audit guidelines that we had developed for investigating costly bank failures. We developed these guidelines to (1) understand why so many depository institutions failed in the late 1980s and early 1990s causing substantial Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) losses and (2) recommend improvements in depository institution supervision. These guidelines produced report findings that were praised as complete and accurate even by bank regulators whose examination practices were sometimes criticized in the reports. The guidelines involve obtaining and reviewing copies of historical financial data, which is available from the bank regulators, showing information such as the growth in the bank\u2019s loan portfolio over time; regulatory examinations and their supporting workpapers that had been done on a particular bank 5 to 10 years before its failure; enforcement actions that the regulators had taken against the bank for unsafe and unsound practices, such as Memorandums of Understanding or Cease and Desist Orders; correspondence between the bank and the regulator primarily responsible for its supervision; and the Post Closing Reports that identify both the causes of bank failures and determine whether FDIC should pursue civil claims against bank officials to help compensate the BIF for any losses incurred in resolving the failures.", "Moreover, we reviewed the two MLR reports issued by the Federal Reserve IG and FDIC IG during the first year that section 38(k) went into effect: the reports on Jefferson Bank and Trust in Colorado and The Bank of San Diego in California, respectively.

The report concluded that JBT failed as the result of a massive securities fraud perpetrated by its investment adviser. The investment adviser diverted approximately $43 million worth of JBT\u2019s government securities for his own benefit and provided fictitious records to the bank so that it was not aware of the securities\u2019 diversion. In December 1991, JBT liquidated its account with the investment adviser. However, JBT was subsequently sued by the Iowa Trust, another client of the investment adviser, which claimed that a portion of its securities had been diverted to pay JBT. A U.S. District Court ruled in favor of Iowa Trust, and JBT was forced to turn over approximately $43 million in government securities. Colorado closed JBT on July 2, 1993, because the bank was no longer solvent. The investment adviser pled guilty to defrauding the bank, and other investors, and was sentenced to a federal prison term.", "The Federal Reserve IG\u2019s report on JBT also recommended steps that the Federal Reserve could take to improve its oversight of bank securities trading. For example, the report recommended that the Federal Reserve ensure compliance with a policy the IG contends limits the percentage of assets, such as government securities, that a bank can keep with a securities dealer. This policy, which is one of the recommendations for a bank\u2019s selection of a securities dealer included in the Board of Governors\u2019 Commercial Bank Examination Manual, sets guidelines for limiting the aggregate value of securities a bank should keep with a selling dealer. The IG concluded that if JBT had followed this recommendation with respect to the government securities diverted by its investment adviser, the bank would have sustained a loss of approximately $1.6 million instead of its loss of approximately $43 million.", "The Board disagreed with the IG\u2019s recommendation, contending that the policy does not apply to pure safekeeping arrangements, but only to those involving a credit risk arising from transactions between a bank and a securities dealer. Specifically, the Board maintained that the policy is an attempt to \u201climit banks\u2019 exposures to questionable securities transactions involving credit risks\u2014not safekeeping risks.\u201d Thus, according to the Board, the policy did not apply to the arrangement between JBT and its broker-dealer because they had purely a safekeeping relationship, rather than a credit relationship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bank of San Diego", "paragraphs": ["On April 29, 1994, the FDIC IG issued a MLR report on TBSD, which failed on October 29, 1993.

The report concluded that TBSD failed as a result of weak loan underwriting; concentrations in high-risk, real-estate loans; high overhead expenses; and inadequate oversight by bank management. The report stated that, in the 1980s, TBSD adopted a strategy of making high-risk loans to real-estate developers in southern California. By 1991, high-risk, real-estate loans comprised more than 50 percent of the consolidated bank\u2019s loan portfolio. The IG concluded that many developers defaulted on their loans in the early 1990s when the real-estate market declined in California. TBSD had inadequate capital and loan loss reserves to cover these losses, and California subsequently closed the bank.", "The report concluded that FDIC\u2019s supervision of TBSD was in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that it properly identified and addressed the conditions that caused the bank to fail. The report recommended that FDIC issue regulations to implement provisions in FDICIA that are designed to improve bank lending practices. The report also concluded that the FDIC\u2019s decision in 1992 to approve the merger between TBSD and its affiliates was reasonable. FDIC approved the merger so that the banks could reduce their expenses and so that managers responsible for their condition could be removed. However, the IG found that it may have been appropriate for FDIC to have obtained more current information about the banks\u2019 asset quality problems before it approved the merger.
