Lacking this information, NASA has been challenged to manage its programs and control program costs. The scientific and technical expectations inherent in NASA's mission create even greater challenges--especially if meeting those expectations requires NASA to reallocate funding from existing programs to support proposed new efforts. Because cost growth has been a persistent problem in a number of NASA programs, GAO was asked to examine NASA's cost estimating for selected programs, assess NASA's cost-estimating processes and methodologies, and describe any barriers to improving NASA's cost-estimating processes. To conduct GAO's work, GAO analyzed a total of 27 NASA programs--10 of which GAO reviewed in detail."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Considerable change in NASA's program cost estimates--both increases and decreases--indicates that NASA lacks a clear understanding of how much its programs will cost and how long they will take to achieve their objectives. For example, the development cost estimates for more than half of the 27 programs that GAO reviewed have increased and for some programs this increase was significant--as much as 94 percent. Cost estimates changed for each of 10 programs that GAO reviewed in detail. For 8 of the 10 programs, the estimates increased. Although NASA cited specific reasons for the changes, such as technical problems and funding shortages, the variability in the cost estimates indicates that the programs lacked the sufficient knowledge needed to establish priorities, quantify risks, and make informed investment decisions, and thus predict costs. Most notably, NASA's basic cost-estimating processes--an important tool for managing programs--lack the discipline needed to ensure that program estimates are reasonable. Specifically, GAO found that none of the 10 NASA programs that GAO reviewed in detail met all of GAO's cost-estimating criteria, which are based on criteria developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute. Moreover, none of the 10 programs fully met certain key criteria--including clearly defining the program's life cycle to establish program commitment and manage program costs, as required by NASA. In addition, only three programs provided a breakdown of the work to be performed. Without this knowledge, the programs' estimated costs could be understated and thereby subject to underfunding and cost overruns, putting programs at risk of being reduced in scope or requiring additional funding to meet their objectives. Finally, only two programs have a process in place for measuring cost and performance to identify risks. NASA has limited ability to collect the program cost and schedule data needed to meet basic cost-estimating criteria. For example, as GAO has previously reported, NASA does not have a system to capture reliable financial and performance data--key to using effectively the cost-estimating tools that NASA officials state that programs employ. Further, without adequate financial and nonfinancial data, programs cannot easily track an acquisition's progress and assess whether the program can meet its cost and schedule goals before it incurs significant cost and schedule overruns. NASA identified other barriers, including limited cost-estimating staff. According to NASA officials, several initiatives are under way to remove such obstacles and improve the agency's cost-estimating practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The lack of reliable financial and performance information has posed  significant challenges to the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration\u2019s (NASA) ability to manage its largest and most costly  programs effectively.

To assess NASA\u2019s cost-estimating processes and methodologies, we  conducted a more in-depth review of 10 of the 27 programs, which  generally had the highest development cost estimate within five of NASA\u2019s seven Enterprises.

NASA currently funds more than 100 programs and  projects in various phases of execution in 7 strategic Enterprises: Space  Science, Earth Science, Biological and Physical Research, Aeronautics,  Space Flight, Education, and Exploration Systems. Two NASA offices have  key responsibilities in ensuring the effective execution of these programs:  the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, which is responsible for providing  oversight and financial management of agency resources and establishing  related policy guidance, and the Office of Chief Engineer, which is  responsible for ensuring development efforts and mission operations are  planned and conducted using sound engineering practices.", "More than two-thirds of NASA\u2019s work force is made up of contractors and  grantees, and 90 percent\u2014or roughly $13 billion\u2014of NASA\u2019s annual budget  is spent on work performed by its contractors. Since 1990, we have  identified NASA\u2019s contract management as a high-risk area. This  assessment has been based in part on our repeated finding that NASA does  not have good cost-estimating processes or the financial information  needed to develop good cost estimates for its programs, making it difficult  for NASA to oversee its contracts and control costs. For example, in July  2002, we reported that an independent task force convened to assess the  management of the International Space Station concluded that the  program\u2019s fiscal year 2002 through fiscal 2006 budget was not credible  because of weaknesses in its cost-estimating processes. The task force  pointed out that these problems occurred because NASA had not instituted  or had ignored many of the program\u2019s control and contract oversight  procedures\u2014such as preparing a full life-cycle cost estimate\u2014that should  have alerted the agency to the growing cost problem and the need for  mitigating actions. According to the cost analysis team that supported the  task force, NASA\u2019s focus on staying within annual budgets instead of  managing total program costs was perhaps the single greatest factor in the  program\u2019s cost growth.", "NASA\u2019s unreliable cost estimates have significant implications for potential  future endeavors, such as those outlined by the President in January of this  year. Specifically, the President called for a shift in NASA\u2019s long-term focus,  envisioning that NASA will retire the shuttle program as soon as assembly  of the International Space Station is completed, planned for the end of the  decade; develop a new crew exploration vehicle as well as launch human  missions to the moon between 2015 and 2020, and build a permanent lunar  base as a stepping stone for more ambitious missions. To achieve these  goals, the President proposed spending $12 billion over the next 5 years\u2014 about $1 billion of which would come from an increase in NASA\u2019s budget,  currently $15.4 billion\u2014with the remaining $11 billion being reallocated  from existing NASA programs.", "Developing reliable cost estimates has been difficult for agencies across  the federal government. The need for reliable cost estimates is at the heart  of two of the five-governmentwide initiatives in the 2002 President\u2019s  Management Agenda (PMA); the two are \u201cimproved financial performance\u201d  and \u201cbudget and performance integration.\u201d These initiatives are aimed at  ensuring that federal financial systems produce accurate and timely  information to support operating, budget, and policy decisions and that  budgets are performance-based. As part of these initiatives, the President  calls for changes to the budget process to better measure the real cost and  performance of programs.

The  baseline development cost estimates for each of the 10 programs we  reviewed in detail were rebaselined\u2014that is, recalculated to reflect new  costs, time frames, or resources associated with program changes in  program objectives, deliverables, or scope and plans. Although NASA  provided specific reasons for the increased cost estimates and  rebaselinings\u2014such as delays in the development or delivery of key  system components and funding shortages\u2014it does not have guidance for  determining when rebaselinings are justified. Such criteria are important to  instilling discipline in the cost-estimating process.", "Most of the 27 programs we reviewed experienced a change in their  development costs estimates. While 8 of the 27 programs experienced  slight decreases in their development cost estimates, 17 experienced  cost growth\u2014as much as almost 94 percent. The remaining two programs  had no change. Ten of the 17 programs\u2019 cost growth was greater than  25 percent.

Two of  MERs\u2019 three rebaselinings were also the result of inadequate reserves.  According to NASA officials, without the rebaselinings, the development  cost \u201cto go\u201d would have drained the program\u2019s reserves.", "The increase in CLCS\u2019s development cost estimate and rebaselining was  the result of poorly defined requirements and design, software  integration problems, and fundamental changes in the project\u2019s  management structure and contractors\u2019 approach to the work. The  project, which experienced an almost 94 percent increase in its baseline  development cost estimate, was ultimately terminated.", "The GP-B program\u2014which was rebaselined four times\u2014experienced  significant schedule slippages due to repeated technical problems,  including failures in the probe\u2019s heat exchanger, the need for additional  testing, payload electronics delays, and thermal vacuum test failures.", "Schedule slippages in the SIRTF program\u2014which contributed to  increases in the program\u2019s baseline development cost estimate and four  rebaselinings of the estimate\u2014were caused by delays in the delivery of  components, flight software, and the mission operation system as well  as launch delays that resulted from a handling accident involving a  global positioning system payload and concerns of delamination on the  launch vehicle\u2019s solid rocket motors.", "Changes in development cost estimates for the CAU program were  primarily the result of the program\u2019s expanded scope, which occurred in  October 2002, to produce modification kits that would allow the CAU  upgrade to be installed into the orbiters.", "The Hyper-X program experienced three rebaselinings, and according to  the project manager, the program will be rebaselined again in the near  future. The rebaselinings were due to schedule slippages resulting from  the need to fund an investigation of the problems experienced in the  first Mach 7 flight vehicle\u2014which was destroyed in flight\u2014and related  corrective actions to the second Mach 7 flight.", "Revised contract requirements, funding changes, or the realization that  program goals are not achievable may require a formal rebaselining.  However, NASA has not defined or provided guidance or restrictions on  rebaselining to ensure that programs consistently and appropriately apply  rebaselinings and do not adjust their baseline cost estimates whenever the  estimates become unmanageable. Further, NASA lacks a process for  systematically identifying and assessing programs that are not achieving  their cost, schedule, and performance goals. Such a process has been  employed by the Department of Defense (DOD), which also relies heavily  on contractors to deliver complex, cutting-edge technologies to meet its  mission. Specifically, DOD must report to the Congress programs that incur  a cost growth of 15 percent or more in the program baseline. Moreover,  DOD must justify the continuation of acquisition programs that incur a cost  growth of 25 percent or more in the program baseline by certifying that  specific criteria have been met\u2014including that the new cost estimates are  reasonable. Under such a process, 5 of the 10 programs that we reviewed  in detail would have been required to report to the Congress, and 4 of  the 5 programs would have had to certify that their new cost estimates  were reasonable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poor Estimating Processes and Methodologies Contributed to Wide Variations in Baseline Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["NASA has yet to implement a well-defined process for estimating the  cost of its programs\u2014a weakness we and NASA\u2019s Inspector General have  repeatedly reported. Recognizing the need for such a process, NASA  developed a cost-estimating handbook in 2002\u2014the first such guidance  provided to its cost-estimating community and program and project  managers. Despite this effort, the programs we reviewed failed to follow  key cost-estimating processes, including developing and documenting full  life-cycle cost estimates, summarizing estimates according to the current  breakdown of work to be performed, conducting an uncertainty analysis,  performing an independent review of contractors\u2019 cost estimates, and later  using earned value management (EVM) to assess progress.", "Reflecting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and best  practices of government and industry leaders, NASA requires that full  life-cycle cost estimates be prepared using full cost accounting, that  estimates be summarized according to the current breakdown of work to  be performed, and that major changes be tracked to the life-cycle cost. In  its draft cost-estimating handbook, NASA lists a number steps that are  integral to preparing a reliable life-cycle cost estimate, including  preparing or obtaining a cost analysis requirements description (CARD),  developing ground rules and assumptions, and developing cost range and  risk assessments.", "Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) echoes  the need for reliable cost-estimating processes in managing software  implementations\u2014identifying tasks to be estimated, mapping the estimates  to the breakdown of work to be performed, and identifying and explaining  assumptions are among SEI\u2019s requisites for producing reliable cost  estimates. To evaluate the cost-estimating processes of the 10 NASA  programs that we reviewed in detail, we selected 14 criteria based on SEI  checklists (see table 2). Many of these criteria are included in NASA\u2019s  cost-estimating guidance.", "Despite NASA requirements and OMB and SEI guidance, few of the  10 programs that we reviewed in detail met even a third of these criteria;  only one met half. Further, none of the programs fully met certain key  criteria. For example, none provided a complete life cycle with definitions  or a complete description of the methodology used to generate the  complete cost estimate, such as data sources and uncertainties. According  to the draft NASA cost-estimating handbook, a reliable life-cycle cost  estimate is critical to making realistic decisions about developing or  producing a system and to determining the appropriate scope or size of a  program. NASA guidance also calls for breaking down the work to be  performed into smaller units to facilitate cost estimating and program and  contract management and to help ensure relevant costs are not omitted.  However, only 3 of the 10 programs provided a complete breakdown of the  work to be performed. Table 3 shows for each program the applicable  criteria that were met, partially met, or not met. (See app. II for a program  by program assessment.)", "Failing to meet these criteria puts programs at certain risk. For example,  underestimating a program\u2019s full life-cycle costs creates the risk that a  program could be underfunded and subject to major cost overruns, which  would ultimately result in the program being reduced in scope or additional  funding being requested and appropriated to ensure the program meets its  objectives. Conversely, overestimating life-cycle costs creates the risk that  a program will be deemed unaffordable and would, therefore, go unfunded.  Without a complete WBS, NASA programs cannot ensure that the life-cycle  cost estimates have captured all relevant costs, which again can result in  underfunding and cost overruns. Further, inconsistent WBS estimates  across programs can create problems of double counting or, worse,  underestimating costs when using historical program costs as a basis for  projecting future costs on similar programs.", "Despite the uncertainty inherent in estimating the cost of emerging  technologies, all of the 10 programs we reviewed also failed to conduct  an uncertainty analysis to assess risks associated with the cost  estimates. Instead, the programs expressed their cost estimates as  point values\u2014which implies certainty\u2014not as ranges or numbers with  confidence levels. Performing an uncertainty analysis, such as a Monte Carlo simulation, quantifies the amount of cost risk within a program.  Only by quantifying the cost risk can management make informed  decisions about risk mitigation strategies. Quantifying cost risks also  provides a benchmark against which future progress can be measured.  Without this knowledge, NASA may have little specific basis to  determine adequate financial reserves, schedule margins, and technical  performance margins to provide managers the flexibility needed to  address programmatic, technical, cost, and schedule risks, as required by  NASA policy.", "Seven of the 10 programs also failed to have an independent review of  contractors\u2019 cost estimates\u2014as required by NASA. Instead, programs  established their budgets based on contractor proposals\u2014particularly  problematic since many contractors could bid low in order to win the  contract. To ensure contractor costs are realistic, NASA procedures and  guidelines specifically require programs to ensure that independent  reviews are conducted and that these reviews address project life-cycle  costs, risk management plans, as well as technical issues. Without such  reviews, NASA decision makers lacked the benchmarks needed to assess  the reasonableness of the contractors\u2019 proposed costs, limiting NASA\u2019s  ability to make sound investment decisions and accurately assess  contractor performance.", "Finally, only two programs used EVM\u2014an approach used by DOD and  leading companies to provide meaningful assessments of a program\u2019s  progress by comparing the value of work performed to its costs, rather  than the traditional management approach of comparing budgeted and  actual costs, which can provide a distorted view of a program\u2019s progress.  (For a detailed discussion of EVM, see app. IV.) By using the value of  completed work as a basis for estimating the cost and time needed to  complete the program, EVM can alert program managers to potential  problems early in the program. NASA requires that EVM be used on all  significant contracts\u2014that is, research and development contracts with  a total anticipated final value of $70 million or more, and production contracts with a total anticipated final value of $300 million or more\u2014 which includes all of the 10 programs we reviewed in detail. Although the  program managers for all 10 programs stated that EVM was used in their  projects, only two programs provided cost performance reports, indicating  a true EVM process was in place. The remaining eight programs relied on  NASA Form 533, which captures planned and actual obligations and  expenditures\u2014not the value of the work performed. Without a true EVM  process, programs cannot readily determine if a program is at risk of cost  and schedule overruns until it is too late to make programmatic changes to  avoid these risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Has Begun to Address Certain Barriers to Effective Cost Estimating", "paragraphs": ["There are several impediments that NASA needs to overcome to implement  effective cost-estimating practices.

For example, NASA officials told us that  commercial-off-the-shelf models have been used to estimate hardware and  software acquisition costs and quantify the level of uncertainty surrounding  cost estimates. However, these cost-estimating tools are only as good as the  data they rely on to develop the estimates. For more than a decade, we  have reported that NASA has failed to develop a system to capture reliable  financial and performance information, posing significant challenges to  NASA\u2019s ability to estimate and control program costs. Over the past year  alone, we issued numerous reports on NASA\u2019s Integrated Financial  Management Program (IFMP)\u2014the agency\u2019s third and most recent effort to  implement a modern, integrated financial management system. Specifically,  we found that IFMP\u2014which is under the responsibility of the Program  Executive Officer for IFMP\u2014will not, as it is being implemented, routinely  provide program managers and other key stakeholders and decision  makers\u2014including the Congress\u2014with the financial related information  needed to measure program performance and ensure accountability. For  example, the core financial module (considered the backbone of the  system) does not appropriately capture property, plant, and equipment, as  well as material in its general ledger at the transaction level\u2014which is  needed to provide independent control over these assets. In addition,  NASA implemented the system before it had the capability to capture the  full costs of its programs and projects.

These officials  stated that EVM has been applied to the International Space Station  Program and with varying levels of emphasis to other programs and  projects at different NASA centers.

According to officials, resource constraints  have prevented the agency from staffing many project offices with  appropriate personnel to fulfill all project functions. In addition, there has  been little or no priority to include a trained EVM analyst, even if one were  available. Headquarters officials also noted that EVM has been hampered  by the lack of a practical automated software data analysis tool. Without  such a tool, analyzing the contractors\u2019 EVM cost performance reports,  which contain significant amounts of data, became a cumbersome  undertaking that often resulted in incomplete and untimely analyses,  providing little usefulness to inform management decisions. A lack of  incentive to support EVM has further undermined its use. Some project  managers whom we spoke with are skeptical about the benefits of EVM  and argue that it has failed to help them manage or control program costs.  According to NASA headquarters officials, during proposal and contract  negotiation phases, contractors have also suggested not using EVM as a  way to reduce contract costs. While EVM was included in most contracts  for the 10 programs we reviewed in detail\u2014as required by NASA policy\u2014it  was used only in two programs as a cost-estimating tool.

First,  the systems engineers generally conduct systems analyses to help ensure  that a program\u2019s requirements are properly established and that the design  and validity meet the requirements.

Nevertheless, the  need to choose among competing alternatives within limited budget  resources makes it essential that the agency and the Congress clearly  understand the costs and uncertainties of programs proposed for  authorization and funding. Yet, NASA does not have the disciplined  cost-estimating process needed to make informed acquisition decisions,  nor does the agency have processes and tools for capturing, monitoring,  and managing program costs and schedules within an implementation plan  on a timely basis. This makes it difficult for senior NASA officials, program  and project managers, and other key stakeholders to measure performance  and initiate mitigation measures when needed. Taken together, the lack of  disciplined and established cost-estimating processes and tools can cause  program officials to restructure projects to available resources rather than  develop realistic cost estimates and implementation plans for projects. As  a result, programs may have to be modified to accommodate emerging  technical, cost, and schedule realities. Ultimately, programs cost more, fail  to meet their schedules, or deliver less than originally envisioned. To help  minimize project costs increases and implementation delays identified in  this report, NASA needs to instill disciplined cost-estimating processes  into its project development and approval activities and to ensure such  processes are integrated with its implementation of an integrated  financial management system. Without a process that prevents programs  from proceeding before they have sufficiently demonstrated that key  cost-estimating criteria have been met, NASA programs will continue to  be at risk of cost and schedule overruns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Improvements to NASA\u2019s cost-estimating processes will partly depend on  the agency\u2019s ability to address recommendations that we made in  November 2003 to help ensure NASA effectively implements a modern,  integrated financial management system. Notwithstanding the need to  address those recommendations, to better position NASA to ensure its  recent initiatives result in sound cost-estimating practices agencywide,  we are making three recommendations with minimum suggested courses  of action. First, we are recommending that the NASA Administrator direct  the Program Executive Officer for IFMP, the Chief Financial Officer, and  the Chief Engineer to develop an integrated plan for improving cost  estimating that, at a minimum, includes specific actions for ensuring that  guidance is established on rebaselining and that rebaselining is  consistently applied to provide accountability among programs,  true earned value management is used as an organizational management  tool to bring cost to the forefront in NASA\u2019s management decision- making process,  acquisition and earned value management policies and procedures are   staff and support for cost-estimating and earned value analyses are  effectively used.", "In addition, we recommend that the NASA Administrator direct the Chief  Financial Officer to establish a standard framework for developing life-  cycle cost estimates. At a minimum the framework should require each  program or project to  base its cost estimates on a full life cycle for the program\u2014including all  direct and indirect costs for operations and maintenance and disposal as  well as planning and procurement\u2014and on a work breakdown structure  that encompass both in-house and contractor efforts,  prepare a cost analysis requirements description,  prepare an independent government estimate at each milestone of the   conduct a cost risk assessment that identifies the level of uncertainty  inherent in the estimate.", "Further, we recommend that the NASA Administrator develop procedures  that would prohibit proposed projects from proceeding through the review  and approval process when they do not address the elements of the  recommended cost-estimating practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, NASA\u2019s Deputy Administrator  stated that the agency concurs with the recommendations, adding that the  recommendations validate and reinforce the importance of activities  underway at NASA to improve cost estimating and program management.", "Notwithstanding agreement with our recommendations, the Deputy  Administrator believes NASA has made substantive changes and achieved  significant improvements in its cost-estimating processes. For example,  NASA\u2019s comments on a draft of this report cite a 1992 GAO report  (GAO/NSIAD-93-97) that found a median 77 percent increase in NASA  program costs. According to the Deputy Administrator, this contrasts with  a 13 percent cost growth in this present study. While there may be  improvements in the percent of cost growth of some projects, such  declines in cost growth are often achieved by rescoping and rebaselining  projects to remain within available resources, as was demonstrated in a  number of projects discussed in this report. We do not believe other  examples cited by the Deputy Administrator, namely termination of the  Checkout and Launch Control System and cost control measures imposed  on the International Space Station, demonstrate that NASA has made  substantive changes and achieved significant improvements in its cost- estimating processes. Rather, we believe these examples demonstrate what  happens when projects are undertaken without a full understanding of the  potential costs and management challenges inherent in many of the  programs NASA proposes and then implemented without adequate  financial management systems in place.", "With regard to our recommendation to develop guidelines for rebaselining  and ensure effective use of earned value management, the Deputy  Administrator cited the development of revised direction on program and  project management and a refocus on risk and cost-risk analysis. NASA  also now requires the establishment of cost thresholds that, if exceeded,  will require a rebaselining review. Further, because much of NASA\u2019s work is  performed through grants and contracts, NASA\u2019s revised procedures will  emphasize how risk and technical complexity affect contractor  performance. New earned value management and acquisition policies and  procedures will be implemented through program management councils  that will review and approve programs and projects regularly through each  step of their development. Also, a new Cost Analysis Division has been  established, and cost-estimating staff has been added to it and NASA\u2019s  Independent Program Assessment Office. NASA also noted the importance  of training needed to match the new requirements.", "NASA\u2019s Deputy Administrator also concurred with our recommendation to  establish a standard framework for developing life-cycle cost estimates.  According to the Deputy Administrator, NASA\u2019s new processes and  procedural requirements document will define the full life-cycle cost to  include development, operations, maintenance, disposal, and all NASA in- house direct and indirect costs to eliminate ambiguity and ensure  consistency. NASA\u2019s revised cost-estimating handbook will provide further  guidance for life-cycle cost estimates. Also, project managers will be  responsible for developing and maintaining a cost analysis requirements  document similar to a tool DOD uses that will include the equivalent of a  project and technical description; key performance parameters, including  documentation of actual work breakdown structure cost elements; and  initial and annual updates of the life-cycle cost estimates. NASA guidance  will also require periodic independent cost estimates on major programs  and approval by the respective program management council to enter into  implementation after an independent estimate has been completed.", "Lastly, NASA\u2019s Deputy Administrator concurred with our recommendation  to prohibit proposed projects from proceeding through the review and  approval process when they do not address the elements of the  recommended cost-estimating practices. Accordingly, NASA\u2019s forthcoming  procedural requirements will define the authority of the program  management councils that will, according to NASA, enforce the  requirements, including the required information, documentation, and  management methods needed for proceeding through the review and  approval process. The Deputy Administrator also noted the availability of  recent management information system improvements that enhance  visibility over project and program performance. In his general comments,  the Deputy Administrator also stated that NASA had recently taken steps to  address issues raised in the draft report and suggested a report title that  would better reflect that progress.", "We agree that NASA has initiated number of reforms to its project  development and implementation processes that, if properly implemented,  would be positive steps to addressing many of the problems noted in this  report. However, we also note that some of these problems have been  long-standing in the projects discussed in this report and in a number of  other projects we and NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General have reviewed.  Furthermore, planned improvements in the past have fallen short of  agencywide implementation. For example, poor or inadequate cost  estimates and management oversight have been central to the problems  that plagued several programs, including those intended to develop new  space transportation and the International Space Station programs. A  reliable financial management structure is central to the success of many  measures noted by the Deputy Administrator in his reply. We recently  reported and testified on the impediments that exist in achieving such a  capability. Finally, we note that contract management has been a long- standing problem at NASA. In 1990, we identified NASA\u2019s contract  management function as an area at high risk. During that time, there was  little emphasis on end results, product performance, and cost control.  NASA found itself procuring expensive hardware that did not work  properly. This report shows that these types of problems still exist.  Regarding the Deputy Administrator\u2019s suggestion that we revise the title of  our report to reflect recent progress that NASA has made towards  addressing issues that we raise, we believe NASA\u2019s improvements have  been properly reflected in our report\u2019s title. We considered the concerns  expressed in the Deputy Administrator\u2019s comments, and consistent with  our stated position that NASA\u2019s improvements are positive steps but that its  problems still persist, we revised the title accordingly.", "Finally, until NASA\u2019s integrated financial management system, which is  central to providing effective management and oversight, is fully  implemented, performance assessments relying on cost data may be  incomplete and full costing will be only partially achieved. And until these  problems are resolved and the measures the Deputy Administrator noted in  commenting on a draft of this report are fully implemented and integrated  into the way the agency does business, NASA\u2019s contract management  function will continue to be an area of concern.", "As agreed with your office, unless you announce its contents earlier, we  will not distribute this report further until 30 days from its date.

Our selection was generally based on programs with the  highest current development cost estimates within an Enterprise. We  compared the initial development cost estimates NASA provided to the  current development cost estimates for the programs. The initial  development estimates generally reflect the projected costs at the time a  new program was first approved by the Congress.

SEI developed checklists with these criteria to help  evaluate software costs and schedule; however, SEI states that these  checklists are equally applicable to hardware and systems engineering  projects.

Our selection of the 14 criteria from the SEI  reports was based, in part, on their commonality with NASA cost- estimating procedures and guidelines. Finally, using the cost-estimating  documentation provided by NASA for the 10 programs, we determined the  extent to which the programs met the 14 criteria. If a program provided  substantiating evidence for a criterion, we determined that the program  \u201cfully met\u201d the criterion.

In 1996, in response to  acquisition reform initiatives, the Department of Defense (DOD) adopted  32 criteria for evaluating the quality of management systems. In general  terms, the 32 criteria require contractors to (1) define the contractual  scope of work using a work breakdown structure; (2) identify  organizational responsibility for the work; (3) integrate internal  management subsystems; (4) schedule and budget authorized work;  (5) measure the progress of work based on objective indicators; (6) collect  the cost of labor and materials associated with the work performed;  (7) analyze any variances from planned cost and schedules; (8) forecast  costs at contract completion; and (9) control changes. The criteria have  become the standard for EVM and have been adopted by major  U.S. government agencies, industry, and the governments of Canada and  Australia. The full application of EVM system criteria is appropriate for  large cost reimbursable contracts where the government bears the cost  risk. For such contracts, management discipline prescribed by the criteria  is essential. In addition, data from an EVM system have been proved to  provide objective reports of contract status, allowing numerous indices  and performance measures to be calculated. These can then be used to  develop accurate estimates of anticipated costs at completion, providing  early warning of impending schedule delays and cost overruns.", "Table 5 lists the 32 criteria, organized into five basic categories:  organization, planning and budgeting, accounting considerations, analysis  and management reports, and revisions and data maintenance.", "The standard format for tracking earned value is through a cost  performance report (CPR). The CPR is a monthly compilation of  cost, schedule, and technical data, which displays the performance  measurement baseline, any cost and schedule variances from that baseline,  the amount of management reserve used to date, the portion of the  contract that is authorized unpriced work, and the contractor\u2019s latest  revised estimate to complete the program. As a result, the CPR can be used  as an effective management tool because it provides the program manager  with early warning of potential cost and schedule overruns.", "Using data from the CPR, a program manager can assess trends in cost and  schedule performance. This information is useful because trends tend to  continue and can be difficult to reverse. Studies have shown that once  programs are 15 percent complete, the performance indicators are  indicative of the final outcome. For example, a CPR showing a negative  trend for schedule status would indicate that the program is behind  schedule. By analyzing the CPR, one could determine the cause of the  schedule problem such as delayed flight tests, changes in requirements, or  test problems because the CPR contains a section that describes the  reasons for the negative status. A negative schedule can be a predictor of  later cost problems because additional spending is often necessary to  resolve problems. CPR data also provide the basis for independent  assessments of a program\u2019s cost and schedule status and can be used to  project final costs at completion in addition to determining when a  program should be completed.", "Examining a program\u2019s management reserves is another way that a  program can use a CPR to determine potential issues early on. Management  reserves, which are funds that may be used as needed, provide flexibility to  cope with problems or unexpected events. EVM experts agree that  transfers of management reserves should be tracked and reported because  they are often problem indicators. An alarming situation arises if the CPR  shows that the management reserves are being used at a faster pace than  the program is progressing toward completion.
