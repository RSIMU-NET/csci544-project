To monitor the implementation of these projects, USAID has assigned monitoring roles and responsibilities to staff, is developing country monitoring plans and monitoring tools, and is working to verify information that partners have provided through actions such as conducting site visits, and speaking with beneficiaries. To ensure that assistance is delivered according to their procedures and to the targeted beneficiaries, implementing partners monitor distributions, and interview beneficiaries regarding the distribution of the assistance. In addition, implementing partners conduct postdistribution surveys to gather information about the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of the assistance (see figure).", "Incomplete reporting and weaknesses in certain performance indicators limit USAID's ability to use monitoring data to evaluate cash transfer and food voucher projects' performance. GAO's review of 14 final reports, which USAID requires for each project, found that a majority of the reports lacked required data elements, such as prices for key staple foods. Only 1 report included all 12 required data elements, and the other reports were missing up to 8 elements. As a result, USAID has limited ability to assess the overall performance of these projects. Further, GAO found weaknesses in USAID's indicators for measuring cash and voucher projects' timeliness, cost-effectiveness, and appropriateness. USAID's indicator for timeliness does not track delays in implementation. In addition, the indicator for cost-effectiveness does not include a standardized unit for measuring project costs. Further, the indicator for project appropriateness does not have associated benchmarks for measuring cash transfer and food voucher projects' impact on local markets. As a result, USAID lacks information that would be useful for evaluating the projects' effectiveness relative to that of in-kind food aid.

In recent years, this assistance  has been used to address food emergencies resulting from, among  others, the Ebola crisis in West Africa, the Syria humanitarian crisis, and  drought in countries stricken by the effects of El Ni\u00f1o. For more than 60  years, the United States provided this assistance primarily in the form of  in-kind food aid (i.e., commodities purchased in the United States and  transported overseas). More recently, the U.S. government has also  provided several modalities of cash-based assistance: cash transfers and  food vouchers, which recipients can use to purchase food on their own,  as well as locally and regionally procured food aid (LRP).", "According to the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s (USAID)  Office of Food for Peace (FFP), which manages the majority of U.S.  international food assistance, it uses cash-based assistance when, for  example, U.S. in-kind assistance cannot arrive in time to respond to an  emergency and when cash transfers or food vouchers may be more  appropriate because of local market conditions and beneficiaries\u2019  preferences. In fiscal year 2015, FFP provided about $432 million for  cash transfer and food voucher projects through its emergency cash- based food assistance program, the Emergency Food Security Program  (EFSP), with funding from the International Disaster Assistance  account. In the same year, USAID provided about $1.07 billion for  emergency food aid, primarily in-kind assistance, authorized by Title II of  the Food for Peace Act. For fiscal year 2017, the administration has  requested additional flexibility to respond to international food  emergencies by expanding the use of cash-based assistance.", "In light of proposals for U.S. food aid reform that call for expanded use of  cash-based assistance, monitoring and evaluation are fundamental to  assessing and demonstrating\u2014with timely and credible evidence\u2014the  effectiveness of the various approaches that the United States employs to  deliver such assistance. This is the second of two reports that you  requested on USAID\u2019s use of cash transfers and food vouchers. In this  report, we (1) examine USAID\u2019s and implementing partners\u2019 processes for  monitoring cash transfer and food voucher projects; (2) analyze the extent  to which monitoring data that partners reported to USAID can be used to  evaluate the performance of such projects; and (3) review studies that  examined the relative impacts of cash transfers, food vouchers, and food  transfers on food security outcomes and the relative costs of these  modalities.", "To address our objectives, we analyzed data and reviewed documents  provided by USAID and its implementing partners, including the United  Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and selected nongovernmental  organizations (NGO). We met in Washington, D.C., with USAID officials  and with implementing partner officials representing NGOs that received  USAID EFSP grants. We also met in Rome, Italy, with officials from WFP  and the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. In addition, we visited Kenya  and Liberia, where we conducted reviews of cash and voucher projects  implemented by USAID partners in three countries\u2014Kenya, Liberia, and  Somalia. We selected these countries using criteria that included the  amount of EFSP funding received, the type of project (cash transfer or  food voucher), and the type of implementing partner. While in Kenya and  Liberia, we met with USAID officials from the U.S. missions; with  representatives of implementing partners, vendors, and financial  institutions; and with beneficiaries, among others.

In each report, we reviewed data  responding to minimum programmatic reporting requirements in  USAID\u2019s 2013 Annual Program Statement (APS) and grant  agreements. Because the 14 projects represent a nonprobability  sample, our findings may not be generalized to all USAID EFSP  projects.

These  studies\u2014examining projects in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic  of the Congo (DRC), Ecuador, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mexico, Niger, Sri  Lanka, Yemen, and Uganda\u2014evaluated whether cash transfers, food  vouchers, or food transfers were more successful in achieving  intended impacts on food security outcomes in situations where at  least two modalities were implemented and could be compared. Our  review of the studies was not intended to assess any individual donor  such as USAID, and thus the conclusions we analyzed cannot be  inferred to assess the performance of USAID\u2019s projects. In addition,  several of the projects examined were pilots conducted to assess the  comparative performance of multiple modalities on household food  security. We analyzed the 14 studies using a data collection  instrument that examined the studies\u2019 design, quality, and major  findings. Further, after determining that 11 of the 14 studies  considered the modalities\u2019 costs, we reviewed those studies\u2019  conclusions regarding the least expensive modality.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to September 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Since 2011,  USAID\u2019s APS has required that the final report for each cash or voucher  project include, as an indicator of cost-effectiveness, the cost per  beneficiary.

In these 8 reports, the reported costs ranged widely, from $10 to $219 per  beneficiary. According to USAID, per-beneficiary costs may range widely  for a number of reasons, including variance in the size of the transfers,  the frequency of the transfers, the presence of complementary services,  the overall scale of the projects, and overhead costs for each project. For  example, given economies of scale, a project that prints vouchers for  50,000 beneficiaries may have lower overhead costs than a project that  prints vouchers for 10,000. Also, indirect costs, such as for security or  transportation, may be higher for projects that require additional security  or are located in remote, less accessible districts. In addition, according to  an implementing partner responsible for a cash transfer project and a  food voucher project in Liberia, its cost-per-beneficiary calculation for the  voucher project did not include indirect costs because they were included  in its calculation for the cash transfer project. USAID officials  acknowledged that without a standardized cost unit, partners have  applied different methods to calculate the cost per beneficiary for cash  transfer and food voucher projects.", "To weigh the cost-effectiveness of various food aid modalities during  project design, one of USAID\u2019s implementing partners, the United Nations  World Food Programme (WFP), uses a method that compares different  modalities\u2019 costs for delivering the same numbers of calories and for  delivering the same nutritional values. Using this method\u2014known as the  Omega tool analysis\u2014to compare potential costs, WFP determined that  in Burkina Faso and Niger, food transfers could deliver the same  nutritional value at a lower cost than cash transfers or food vouchers.  However, WFP\u2019s analysis show that in both cases, combining modalities  could deliver the same nutritional value at a lower cost than using a single  modality. In Senegal, WFP determined that food vouchers or a  combination of food transfers and cash transfers or food vouchers could  deliver the same nutritional value at a lower cost than food transfers.

We selected these projects using the following  criteria, intended to ensure a diverse sample of implementing partners:  (1) the funding was awarded for NGO projects in fiscal years 2013 and  2014 or for WFP projects in fiscal year 2014, all of which were subject to  USAID\u2019s 2013 APS; (2) the award was at least $2 million for NGO  projects or at least $3 million for WFP projects; and (3) the projects  closed by October 31, 2015.

We screened the studies identified by these  sources to determine whether any of the studies met the following  criteria: (1) compared cash transfers, food vouchers, or food  transfers with at least one other modality; (2) evaluated at least one  food security outcome; and (3) considered food security outcomes by  means of randomized control trials or groups, carefully selected  comparison groups, or a quasi-experimental design that used  statistical techniques to make precise comparisons. This process  resulted in our selecting 14 rigorous studies, made public since 2006,  that evaluated whether cash transfers, food vouchers, or food  transfers were more successful in achieving intended impacts on food  security outcomes in situations where at least two modalities were  implemented and could be compared. These 14 studies examined  projects in 10 countries: Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the  Congo, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mexico, Niger, Sri Lanka, Yemen,  and Uganda. (See app. II for a list of these studies.)", "To review the 14 studies we selected, we used a data collection  instrument (DCI) designed to examine the studies\u2019 design, quality, and  major findings. (App. II lists the studies we reviewed and provides a  detailed summary of the results of our review.)", "We developed the following eight key food security outcomes based  on our analysis of the metrics in the 14 selected studies and on our  discussions with researchers with relevant expertise: value and  volume of food, caloric intake, dietary diversity, food consumption  score, nutrient number and levels, caloric value, experiential  measures, and nutritional status. We reviewed each study\u2019s results to  determine whether any modality demonstrated a statistically  significant improvement in one or more of these outcomes compared  with the other modality, or modalities, that the study examined. Two  independent analysts used the DCI to review the studies, discussing  and reconciling any differences in their initial assessments. In some  instances, studies presented the results for several metrics for the  same outcome, such as a household dietary diversity score and a  household dietary diversity index. In those instances, our decision rule  was that one modality had to demonstrate a statistically significant  improvement over all other modalities examined for all metrics that the  outcome comprised. If this criterion was not met, we determined that  the modalities\u2019 impacts were comparable. We did not consider results  for subpopulations, such as by region, income group, gender, or age  range, except when results for a particular outcome were reported  only for a subpopulation. We also did not consider impacts on factors  that did not qualify as costs or food security outcomes, such as  beneficiaries\u2019 income, assets, and overall consumption. When  examining findings about dietary diversity, we relied on indices and  metrics that had been created for this purpose; we did not assess  results for individual food groupings, as these varied greatly between  studies and did not lend themselves to the overall methodology that  we employed. (App. II summarizes the results of our review.) The  researchers who helped us identify relevant studies that met our  criteria generally stated that they believed the 14 studies we selected  constituted a reasonable body of evidence that no one modality  significantly outperforms the other and that all modalities can lead to  improvements in food security. However, one researcher reported that  the evidence base does not allow for generalizable conclusions about  the situations in which specific modalities are most appropriate.", "We also considered whether the 14 studies examined the relative  costs of the modalities, and in the studies that did, we considered  which modality was found to be least expensive at delivering the  same level of assistance. The studies employed a variety of data and  methods to estimate relative costs. For example, some studies  examined cost-efficiency, others examined cost-effectiveness, and  still others examined both. In addition, some studies used a costing  method adapted from the health economics field that involves  identifying the costs of specific \u201cactivities\u201d required to implement a  modality, such as staffing, banking, and production. Meanwhile, three  studies comparing cash and food transfers examined the costs of both  delivering the modalities and purchasing the food beneficiaries  consumed. If more than one method was used to estimate costs in a  study, we considered the results for all methods used and reported  that one modality was the least expensive only if all methods used  found it so. Otherwise, we reported that the results were mixed. In one  instance, a study examined four projects in one country: one project  provided food transfers, another provided cash transfers, and two  others provided a mix of cash and food transfers. This study  examined both the costs and the cost-efficiency of the transfers. In  that instance, because the results differed by project and method  used, we could not determine which modality was least expensive.", "Our review of the 14 studies was not intended to assess any individual  donor such as USAID and thus the conclusions we analyzed cannot be  inferred to assess the performance of USAID\u2019s projects. In addition,  several of the projects examined were pilots conducted to assess the  comparative performance of food and cash on household food security.", "The projects that the studies examined varied in terms of contextual  factors such as the projects\u2019 purposes and goals, projects\u2019 design and  outcomes examined. While the studies demonstrate that no modality  consistently outperformed the others across a range of settings and  situations, this variance does not allow us to determine the precise  conditions in which one modality might outperform the others. To obtain  context and background, we also considered additional studies on cash- based assistance that did not meet our criteria for inclusion in our  systematic review but provided insights into projects that used cash  transfers, food vouchers, food transfers, or a combination of these  modalities. (See app. III for a list of these additional studies.)", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to September 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary Results of GAO Literature Review", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Additional Studies Examining Food Aid Modalities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to reviewing 14 rigorous studies that compared the impacts of  cash transfers, food vouchers, and food transfers on food security  outcomes, we consulted the following 23 studies for insights into projects  that included one or more of these modalities.
