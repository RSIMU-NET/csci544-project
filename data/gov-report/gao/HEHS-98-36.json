Some of this revenue targeted poor students. Research has shown that these students generally begin school less prepared than their grade-level peers and need additional educational resources to succeed academically. Using a variety of approaches, states have targeted additional funding to the growing number of poor students despite the many other student needs to consider, such as those for students with disabilities. Although providing a much smaller share of public school funding than states, the federal government has also targeted its financial aid (in fact, most of it) to disadvantaged and poor students through title I, child nutrition, and other programs.", "Despite this common commitment, little is known about the extent to which states target their funds to districts with poor students, state targeting efforts compared with federal targeting efforts, and the effects of these efforts. Many policymakers have debated whether title I funds could be better targeted to high-poverty districts and schools. Some have also urged consolidating some federal education funding into grants that give states more discretion in using these funds.", "In an earlier report, we examined state school finance policies for funding low-wealth school districts and the wealth-related funding gaps among districts. This report focuses on targeting to poor students and the funding gaps between districts with high and low proportions of poor students. Specifically, you asked us to determine (1) the extent to which state and federal funding is targeted to districts on the basis of the number of poor students and (2) the effect of state and federal funding on the amount of funds available to high-poverty compared with low-poverty districts.", "To answer these questions, we relied mainly on Department of Education district-level data for school year 1991-92, the most recent available, to analyze each state except Hawaii, Vermont, and Wyoming. We supplemented this information by interviewing state and federal education officials to determine how changes in the states\u2019 school finance systems and federal funding programs since the 1991-92 school year would affect funding to poor students. To measure the state and federal targeting efforts, we developed a way to estimate the additional funds allocated to districts on the basis of the number of poor students. To measure the effect of state and federal funding on the amount of funds available to high-poverty compared with low-poverty districts, we measured the relative change in district funding as districts\u2019 poverty rates increased.", "We adjusted our analysis to account for geographic cost differences in teacher salaries and for student need. We accounted for revenue for all purposes from all sources in our funding amounts, including revenue for capital expenditures and debt service. Federal revenues included funds from several federal agencies, including the Departments of Education, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services (HHS). We measured a district\u2019s ability to raise local education revenues as income per pupil.We used the percentage of children in a district living in households below the poverty level in 1989 to measure the percentage of poor students in a district and enrollment as of October 1991 as the measure of a district\u2019s students.

However, the state share of total public funding varied by state from about 9 percent in New Hampshire to about 76 percent in New Mexico in the 1991-92 school year.", "Localities raise revenue for education mainly through property taxes, and the amount of local funds depends on both property values and local tax rates. This has produced local funding disparities because school districts\u2019 property tax bases vary widely. Localities with high property values can generally raise large amounts of local revenue per pupil even with relatively low tax rates; localities with low property values usually raise less local revenue per pupil even with higher tax rates. In an earlier report, we found that poorer districts in 35 states tended to make a greater tax effort than wealthier districts in school year 1991-92, but this effort was not sufficient to eliminate the funding gaps between poor and wealthy districts in 23 of these states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State School Finance Systems", "paragraphs": ["When allocating revenue to districts, states typically consider these tax base differences as well as educational need factors. States use various equalization strategies to address the funding gaps that arise from tax base differences. Such strategies include targeting more funds to districts with lower tax bases and increasing the state\u2019s share of total education funds. Meanwhile, states typically consider districts\u2019 educational needs, including the number of pupils in a district, the cost of educating different types of pupils (for example, students with disabilities), and other educational cost factors beyond the districts\u2019 control such as costs related to sparsity or enrollment growth.", "The educational needs of poor students are one of the states\u2019 considerations when making funding decisions. Poor students risk academic failure because their homes or communities lack the resources to prepare them academically and because, among other factors, they have considerable health and nutrition problems. Children living below the poverty level are more likely than nonpoor children to have learning disabilities and developmental delays. As a result, poor students\u2019 academic achievement tends to be low, and they have high rates of dropping out of high school.", "To help low-achieving poor students, 28 states funded compensatory programs in school year 1993-94, according to a national study on school finance programs. States may have funded such programs by directly allocating funds for this purpose, incorporating the funding into other programs, or including weights in their basic support formulas that provide funds for school districts\u2019 daily operations. Funding for state compensatory programs that directly targeted poor students represented up to 11 percent of total state school aid. The total spent for compensatory programs ranged from about $1 million in Wyoming to about $785 million in Texas in school year 1993-94.", "The lawsuits filed since the early 1970s challenging the constitutionality of state school finance systems based on the inequitable distribution of education revenues between districts within states demonstrate that ensuring a fair distribution of funds is a complex and difficult undertaking. States are under constant pressure from both poor and wealthy districts, education interest groups, and anti-tax groups to modify their state school finance systems. For example, in our 1995 study of three states involved in equity lawsuits, we found that the state remedies for improving the equity of their school finance systems had to respond to citizens\u2019 concerns about increased taxes and to concerns of wealthy districts that want to maintain spending levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Funding for Education", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1997, the federal government spent about $37 billion on elementary and secondary education.

Department of Education funding provided directly to districts included impact aid, bilingual education, and Indian education. Among other federal agencies that spend substantial amounts on elementary and secondary education are USDA through its child nutrition programs and HHS through its Head Start and other programs.", "Most federal funding for elementary and secondary education is targeted to disadvantaged and poor children. For example, the Department of Education\u2019s title I grants that provide compensatory services for disadvantaged students accounted for about $7.2 billion of the federal funding for education in fiscal year 1997, and USDA\u2019s child nutrition programs for low-income students accounted for about $8.3 billion. Title I has anchored the Elementary and Secondary Education Act since it was first enacted in 1965. USDA began providing child nutrition programs with the enactment of the National School Lunch Act of 1946 and later expanded its effort under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.", "Members of the Congress have recently considered more flexible approaches for funding federal education programs as a way to possibly consolidate duplicative programs and eliminate regulations seen as unnecessarily limiting local flexibility. Education programs serving disadvantaged students, including title I, are possible candidates for this approach.

States also generally try to offset differences in localities\u2019 ability to raise education revenues. The states\u2019 wide range in targeting to poor students indicates that different states balance the needs of poor students with all other needs in different ways. Furthermore, the many lawsuits alleging inequities in state school finance systems illustrate that states are under constant pressure to meet the needs of many and often conflicting interest groups. In this context, any proposal to consolidate federal education funding into grants that give more discretion to states would need to consider that the targeting of those federal funds might become more like that of the state funds.
