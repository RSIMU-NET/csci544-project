In May 2009, we issued a report that  described the Intelligent Mail\u00ae program and stated that key management  actions were not taken, such as developing a comprehensive strategic  plan; preparing information about the program\u2019s costs, including its  anticipated savings or cost reductions; and establishing a risk mitigation  plan.

However, USPS officials  currently plan to deliver the program in multiple phases in lieu of the  original plan, which was to deliver the entire Full Service program by  January 2009. As a result, the first of two planned phases of the program  was deployed in May 2009, and the second phase is expected to be  implemented by the end of November 2009. In addition, key functionality  (including automating aspects of the mail acceptance process) that was  originally intended to be delivered in these two planned phases has been  deferred. Program officials have recently stated that they plan to have  future phases to incorporate the deferred functionality; however, they  have not made any commitments to do so. In addition, the life-cycle cost  that program officials prepared does not capture all the costs associated  with the acquisition and implementation of the program, such as costs to  integrate several USPS systems. Finally, the first deployed phase is  currently experiencing operational problems, thus requiring program  officials to develop patches to resolve the issues.", "While the Intelligent Mail\u00ae Full Service program has implemented initial  acquisition management activities, it does not have the full set of  capabilities it needs to fully manage the acquisition. For example, the Full  Service program has established a program office and assigned a USPS  project manager, but the program has not developed an overall project  plan that identifies the full scope of the Full Service program or identified  key deliverables beyond release 2. Also, the program office tracks the  milestones and dependencies of the program; however, a conflict of  interest exists because the prime contractor for the development of the  Full Service program also manages program management office activities.  Although USPS officials have told us they use strategies to avoid potential  conflicts, such as utilizing a separate program management team from the  system development team, they have not provided us with evidence that  they have a formal mitigation plan in place to address the conflict that  exists. In addition, the program office has defined initial business  requirements for releases 1 and 2, but USPS has not finalized or validated a  complete set of requirements for the Full Service program, which would  include high-level requirements that USPS plans to deliver in future  releases. Also, although the program office has assigned responsibility for  managing the risks, it has not established a risk management process that  ensures a comprehensive list of risks is maintained and complete  mitigation strategies are developed. Additionally, while the program office  has identified approximately 30 systems that will need to be integrated in  the Full Service program, it has not developed a Systems Integration Plan  describing the plan for conducting product integration for the entire Full  Service program.

The agency further stated that it has  and will continue to enable these capabilities. In previously commenting  on our briefing slides, USPS disagreed with aspects of our findings on  these issues or provided additional information that we incorporated as  appropriate. USPS\u2019s subsequent written comments on this draft report,  which recognize the need to implement these recommendations, provide  greater assurance of program success.", "The Senior Vice President stated that the disagreement with three of our  recommendations may be the result of our use of the 2003 Intelligent  Mail\u00ae strategy document to measure the program\u2019s performance.  However, we reviewed and analyzed many documents to form the basis of  our findings and conclusions on the program\u2019s performance. The 2003  strategy was just one of the many documents we used, as it represented  the original baseline and justification for the program. To report on the  progress of the program since its inception, we measured the program  against original plans, while acknowledging that USPS has made multiple  modifications to the implementation dates.", "USPS also stated that we relied on the 2003 strategy to determine delays to  the program. This comment is inaccurate. As we stated in this report, we  relied on the January 2008 Intelligent Mail\u00ae Advance Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking in the Federal Register to identify the originally proposed  implementation time frame. We also reported the subsequent revisions  that USPS made to the program\u2019s implementation schedule.", "The Senior Vice President disagreed with our recommendation to develop  a comprehensive cost estimate. He stated such an activity would consume  a significant amount of funding, time, and resources, while providing little  or no value. However, as stated in our GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide, developing a realistic cost estimate is essential  because it enables program officials to evaluate resource requirements at  key decision points, develop performance measurement baselines, and  establish effective resource allocations. Additionally, cost estimates  should be comprehensive and should include both government and  contractor costs throughout the program\u2019s full life cycle, from the  inception of the program through design, development, deployment, and  operation and maintenance to retirement. While we acknowledge that  preparing a realistic cost estimate may require some amount of effort, we  believe the benefits of having an accurate total cost estimate for the entire  program to make better informed resource allocation decisions, clearly  merit its completion.", "With regard to our recommendation to complete an overall program plan  for the entire Full Service program, the Senior Vice President stated that,  while USPS plans to start updating the Intelligent Mail\u00ae strategy on an  annual basis, it plans to remain focused on its clearly defined actions for  the current releases, rather than planning for future releases. However,  industry best practices specifically state that a project plan is the essential  document used to manage and control the execution of a project. In order  for the project plan to be an effective and useful document, it should  consider all phases of the project\u2019s life cycle. Program officials should also  ensure that all plans affecting the project are consistent with the overall  project plan to ensure that all releases and associated functionality  seamlessly fit together. As we state in our report, without such a plan that  describes the full scope of the program, including how many releases are  envisioned, USPS lacks an overarching approach for incorporating future  releases into the program. Additionally, without this information, USPS  may not be able to ensure the program is accomplishing its complete set of  goals within the specified cost and schedule objectives.", "Regarding our recommendation to define a core set of requirements for  the entire program and use them to develop reliable cost estimates, the  Senior Vice President stated that the program must remain dynamic and  that any attempt to define the entire program and its associated cost is a  waste of funding and resources. We are not recommending that USPS  define all detailed system-level requirements at the outset of the program;  rather, we are recommending that USPS develop a roadmap of the  program\u2019s high-level requirements. As we state in this report, without a  core set of high-level requirements, it will be difficult for USPS to focus  appropriately on the next release and to hold itself accountable for  delivering a system that meets USPS\u2019s and mailers\u2019 needs. Defining these  requirements is especially important given the functionality that is being  deferred in the first two releases.", "USPS program officials did not state whether they agreed or disagreed  with our recommendation that USPS include in its Technical Solution Life  Cycle policy guidance for programs to develop (1) complete program  plans, (2) specific requirements for programs to establish a robust risk  management process, and (3) a system integration plan.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date.
