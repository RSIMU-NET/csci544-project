In 2010, the  Secretary of Defense announced a department-wide efficiency initiative to  reduce overhead costs and reinvest the savings in sustaining DOD\u2019s  current force structure and modernizing its weapons portfolio. Since  then, the department has pursued reductions in the size of staff within  headquarters activities. DOD has multiple layers of headquarters  activities with complex, overlapping relationships among them. Such  layers include the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint  Staff, and the military services\u2019 secretariats and staffs. These  headquarters activities across the department have responsibilities that  include developing guidance, reviewing performance, allocating  resources, and conducting mid- to long-range budgeting as they oversee,  direct, and control subordinate organizations or units.", "The congressional defense committees have recognized DOD\u2019s efforts to  identify and implement headquarters-related efficiencies. In doing so, the  defense committees have also raised questions about whether the  department implements these efficiencies based on assessments of  functions, which they believe could result in identification of greater cost  savings, and about DOD\u2019s poor visibility into resources being devoted  across organizations to similar functions and missions. The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 directs the Secretary of  Defense to conduct a comprehensive review of DOD headquarters,  among other things, for purposes of consolidating and streamlining  headquarters functions. The department\u2019s functional review is to address  the extent to which certain groupings of DOD headquarters  organizations\u2014such as OSD, the military departments, the defense  agencies, and other organizations\u2014have duplicative staff functions and  services and could therefore be consolidated, eliminated, or otherwise  streamlined. In addition, the act also directs the Secretary of Defense to  modify the headquarters reduction plan required by section 904 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 to ensure it  achieves savings in the total funding available for major DOD  headquarters activities by fiscal year 2020 that are not less than 25  percent of the baseline amount. The act defines major DOD  headquarters activities, which include organizations such as OSD; the  Joint Staff; military service secretariats and staff; and headquarters  elements of the combatant commands, defense agencies, and DOD field  activities. Finally, the act allows documented savings achieved pursuant  to the 25 percent headquarters reduction to be counted toward another of  the act\u2019s requirements, namely, that the Secretary of Defense implement  a plan to ensure the department achieves not less than $10 billion in cost  savings from the headquarters, administrative, and support activities of  the department by fiscal year 2019.", "Accounting for the resources devoted to headquarters has been a long- standing challenge for DOD, as our body of work on these issues has  shown. In October 1997, as part of our review on the mid-1990s military  drawdown, we found that total personnel and costs of defense  headquarters were significantly higher than were being reported.  Specifically, we found that three-fourths of subordinate organizations  excluded from management headquarters accounting were actually  performing management or management support functions, and such  accounting masked the true size of DOD\u2019s headquarters organizations.  We recommended that the Secretary of Defense revise DOD\u2019s guiding  headquarters instruction\u2014DOD Instruction 5100.73\u2014to expand its  coverage to include personnel assigned to all noncombat organizations  that are subordinate to DOD management headquarters. DOD partially  concurred with this recommendation and revised its headquarters  instruction in 1999, 2007, and again in 2012. However, our more recent  work has found that DOD\u2019s challenges in identifying and tracking  headquarters personnel and other resources devoted to headquarters  have continued. For example, in March 2012, we found that DOD\u2019s  headquarters instruction does not identify all current major DOD  headquarters activity organizations or address the tracking of contractors  that perform headquarters functions. Accordingly, we recommended that  the department update DOD Instruction 5100.73. DOD partially concurred  with this recommendation. DOD stated that it has established a revised  definition of major DOD headquarters activities in an August 2015  memorandum from the Deputy Secretary of Defense. However, DOD has  not updated the instruction to include the organizations, or portions of  organizations, that should be included in its count of headquarters  activities in accordance with this definition. Further, DOD has not  specified how contractors performing headquarters functions will be  identified and included in headquarters reporting. Finally, in January  2015, we found that selected DOD headquarters organizations neither  determined their personnel requirements as part of a systematic  requirements-determination process, nor had procedures in place to  ensure periodic reassessments of these requirements to help them  proactively identify efficiencies and limit personnel growth. We therefore  recommended that DOD conduct a systematic determination of personnel  requirements for these organizations; submit these personnel  requirements, among other things, to Congress; and establish and  implement procedures to conduct periodic assessments of these  personnel requirements. DOD partially concurred with these  recommendations but has not yet implemented them. See appendix I for  a discussion of our prior work since 2012 on accounting for defense  headquarters resources and on our related recommendations and their  respective status.", "House Report 113-446 and Senate Report 113-176 accompanying  proposed bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2015 include provisions that we identify DOD\u2019s headquarters reduction  efforts to date and any trends in personnel and other resources being  devoted to selected functional areas within and across related  headquarters organizations.

We obtained documentary and testimonial evidence  from senior officials in the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer  to determine the scope and status of these headquarters-related  efficiency efforts and what actions, if any, DOD has taken as a result of  the efforts.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has reliable data to assess  headquarters functions and their associated costs, we took two main  steps.", "First, we identified and reviewed DOD-wide information sources that  would provide data on the department\u2019s workforce in terms of whether  the workforce is performing headquarters work, and the specific  headquarters functions that the workforce is performing. We  discussed these sources with officials from the Office of the Deputy  Chief Management Officer, the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and the Office of the Director  of Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation. For this report, we analyzed  data and information related to the Inherently Governmental /  Commercial Activities (IGCA) Inventory because it was the only  DOD-wide data set identified that allowed us to determine the military  and civilian workforce\u2014in the form of authorized positions\u2014by both  headquarters and function. Specifically, we obtained data from  each of the military services\u2019 manpower databases used to populate  DOD\u2019s IGCA Inventory for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, which  was the most recent 5-year period available during our review. We  then identified and analyzed these headquarters positions for each  service and for each fiscal year by number of military and civilian  positions, function, grade, and location. We discussed the data, and  the reasons for any patterns or changes we observed in them, with  military service representatives. DOD was unable to provide similar  data for organizations outside the military departments known as the  Fourth Estate in time for our review, so we collected data on the  Fourth Estate\u2019s military and civilian positions directly from the IGCA  Inventory for fiscal years 2012 to 2014. We assessed the data we  received against federal standards for internal control, which call for  an agency to have relevant, reliable, and timely information in order to  run and control its operations.", "Second, we attempted to calculate the approximate costs of the  headquarters positions and associated functions. Because the IGCA  Inventory does not contain estimated costs for positions, we used the  service databases\u2019 pay grade and location information assigned to the  military and civilian positions in an attempt to determine the estimated  cost to DOD of filling headquarters positions. We were unable to do a  similar calculation for the Fourth Estate because Fourth Estate data  on positions came from the IGCA Inventory, which does not contain  pay grade and location information needed for a cost calculation. We  assessed our and DOD\u2019s efforts to calculate headquarters-related  costs against federal standards for internal control regarding having  relevant, reliable, and timely information, and noted the importance of  a key step that we have previously identified for conducting  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication reviews.", "We assessed the reliability of the IGCA-related data sets by reviewing  responses to data questionnaires sent to knowledgeable service and  Fourth Estate officials, discussing the data with these officials, and  conducting our own cross-checks of the data to assess their  reasonableness. We found the data to be insufficient for identifying trends  in the number and type of headquarters positions and for estimating costs  associated with headquarters positions, as discussed in this report.  However, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for presenting 1  year\u2019s worth of data for purposes of illustrating the types of analyses of  department-wide headquarters functions that could be conducted if DOD  improved the reliability of these data. Finally, we were unable to obtain  data on contracted services personnel, either their positions or associated  costs, because DOD does not identify contracted services personnel by  the type of headquarters function they perform. More details on our  objectives, scope, and methodology can be found in appendix III.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to June 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Through this review, ODCMO identified $62 billion to $84 billion in  potential cumulative savings opportunities across the six business  processes for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. The review identified that  these potential savings opportunities could be achieved through civilian  personnel attrition and retirements to occur without replacements over the  next 5 years, matching labor productivity in comparable industries or  sectors, and improving core processes such as rationalizing  organizational structures to reduce excessive layers, optimizing contracts,  and using information technology to eliminate or reduce manual  processes.

Navy guidance specifically notes that the IGCA Inventory  may be used as a total force shaping tool and a starting point for future  manpower reviews or initiatives. For an example of the type of  information that reliable data on headquarters functions could produce,  see appendix V, which provides our analysis of the headquarters  functions with the highest number of positions for each military service  and Fourth Estate component in fiscal year 2014.", "However, we found that because the data in this data set were not  aligned with headquarters definitions, they were not sufficiently reliable to  assess these functions. IGCA Inventory guidance calls for components  to assign headquarters-related DOD function codes to positions based on  a headquarters definition that, while derived from DOD Instruction  5100.73, does not include all elements of the definition in that instruction.  As a result, we found that the data on the number and functions of DOD\u2019s  military and civilian headquarters positions have varying levels of  accuracy. For example, in fiscal year 2014, only 79 percent of authorized  positions in OSD were considered headquarters within the IGCA  Inventory, even though OSD is considered a headquarters organization in  its entirety under both the definition provided in DOD Instruction 5100.73  and the new definition. Officials from all four military services informed us  that, from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014, they discovered  some positions that had been incorrectly coded as headquarters and  undertook varying efforts to correct them. As a result, we have more  confidence in data presented in the later years of the 2010 to 2014 period  we reviewed, but data limitations in the earlier years covered by our  review precluded us from assessing trends of these functions over time.", "While service officials told us they had taken steps to improve  consistency of the headquarters-related DOD function codes in the IGCA  Inventory, DOD does not have plans to update the data set to ensure that  the headquarters-related DOD function codes in the IGCA Inventory are  also consistent with the new headquarters definition. According to OSD  officials, they have no plans to do so because the IGCA Inventory is not  the department\u2019s authoritative source for headquarters data. However,  DOD and service officials have noted that, over time, officials have  inconsistently interpreted what should be counted as headquarters  according to the instruction, resulting in varying counts of headquarters  positions depending on the source of the data. For example, in its Fiscal  Year 2015 Defense Manpower Requirements Report, DOD included an  estimate for fiscal year 2014 of 108,073 headquarters positions across  the department, that is, OSD, the military services, the Joint Staff and  combatant command headquarters, and the defense agencies and DOD  field activities. In contrast, for these same organizations, DOD reported a  total of 74,221 headquarters positions in its IGCA Inventory for fiscal year  2014 and a total of 61,046 headquarters positions in a May 2015  headquarters-related report, known as the Section 904 report. We  believe that alignment of data sets containing headquarters-related  codes, such as the IGCA Inventory, with the department-wide  headquarters definition will provide senior DOD officials with the relevant,  reliable, and timely information they need to make operating decisions,  monitor performance, and allocate resources. Without alignment of data  on department-wide military and civilian positions that have headquarters- related DOD function codes with the authoritative, revised definition of  major DOD headquarters activities, the department will not have reliable  data to enable senior officials to accurately assess headquarters  functions, target specific functional areas for further analysis, or identify  potential streamlining opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Plan to Collect Information on Functions with Headquarters Organizations", "paragraphs": ["ODCMO officials stated that, once they have finalized the headquarters  definition, they plan to complete an effort to improve the accuracy of the  resource levels attached to headquarters organizations by ensuring that  organizations are appropriately designated as headquarters in the FYDP  and, as needed, breaking these organizations down into smaller  headquarters and nonheadquarters program element codes. However,  these actions will not provide reliable information on the costs associated  with the various functions within those headquarters organizations.  According to ODCMO officials, the department does not have plans to  collect such information because it believes that improving the accuracy  of the resources associated with headquarters organizations will be  sufficient to support any future DOD assessments of headquarters. We  believe, however, that, detailed information that provides visibility into the  costs associated with functions within headquarters organizations would  better facilitate identification of opportunities for consolidation or  elimination across organizational boundaries.", "Moreover, the defense committees have previously noted that, to achieve  significant savings, the department must focus on consolidating and  eliminating organizations and personnel that perform similar functions and  missions. Army officials have also noted that being able to track the  Army\u2019s manpower by function could be useful to understand cost drivers  in the budget, and could provide a starting point to help them determine  the best application of structure and manpower. In addition, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 directs the Secretary of  Defense to conduct a comprehensive review of DOD headquarters,  among other things, for purposes of consolidating and streamlining  headquarters functions. This functional review is to address the extent to  which certain groupings of DOD headquarters organizations\u2014such as  OSD, the military departments, the defense agencies, and other  organizations\u2014have duplicative staff functions and services and could  therefore be consolidated, eliminated, or otherwise streamlined. We have  previously identified key steps to help analysts and policymakers conduct  reviews to identify and evaluate instances of duplication, fragmentation,  and overlap. One step in conducting such a review is to identify the  potential positive and negative effects of any duplication, fragmentation,  or overlap by assessing program implementation, outcomes and impact,  and cost-effectiveness. In particular, we found that assessing and  comparing the performance and cost-effectiveness of programs can help  analysts determine which programs, or aspects of programs, to  recommend for actions such as consolidation or elimination.", "In the absence of reliable data on the costs of functions with headquarters  organizations, we obtained data from each of the military services\u2019  manpower databases on all military and civilian headquarters positions  for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. However, we could not reliably  calculate the estimated costs to DOD of filling those positions due to  inconsistencies and incomplete information in the pay grade data we  collected from the Army and the Air Force. For example, the Army could  not provide data to distinguish whether the 15 percent of its headquarters  positions allocated to its reserve components in 2014 were full- or part- time\u2014a factor needed to estimate costs. In the Air Force, we were unable  to match civilian pay scales to 16 percent of Air Force civilian  headquarters positions in 2014. For the Fourth Estate headquarters  positions, DOD was unable to provide pay grade and location information  from its Fourth Estate data system in time for our review due to other  ongoing, headquarters-related initiatives. However, according to our  analysis of data-reliability questionnaires sent to Fourth Estate  organizations, 25 of the 38 Fourth Estate organizations, or 66 percent,  reported that their data in the Fourth Estate data system for the period  from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014 were incomplete or  inaccurate.", "Once the definition of major DOD headquarters activities is published in  DOD guidance, without reliable information on the costs associated with  functions within headquarters organizations\u2014through revisions to the  IGCA Inventory or another method\u2014the department will not be able to  accurately estimate resources associated with specific headquarters  functions, which in turn could help senior officials identify streamlining  opportunities, make decisions, monitor performance, and allocate  resources."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As it faces a potentially extended period of fiscal constraints, DOD has  concluded that reducing the resources it devotes to headquarters is an  area where cost savings can be achieved. The defense committees  agree, but have expressed concern about DOD\u2019s ability to identify  significant cost savings given the department\u2019s poor visibility into the total  resources being devoted across organizations to similar functions and  missions. Further, Congress has recently directed the Secretary of  Defense to ensure that the department achieves savings in the total  funding available for major DOD headquarters activities by fiscal year  2020 that are not less than 25 percent of the baseline amount, and to  implement a plan to ensure the department achieves not less than $10  billion in cost savings from its headquarters, administrative, and support  activities by fiscal year 2019. Since 2014, DOD has undertaken  concurrent initiatives of varying scope that include improving the  efficiency of headquarters organizations and identifying related cost  savings, but, because they are not yet completed, it is unclear to what  extent these initiatives will help the department to achieve the $62 billion  to $84 billion in cost savings opportunities that it has identified. DOD\u2019s  limited information on which positions perform which headquarters  functions and their associated costs hinders its ability to identify potential  cost savings associated with opportunities to consolidate and streamline  these headquarters functions. While the department has taken steps to  respond to a new headquarters definition and has begun to align its key  resource database\u2014the FYDP\u2014to better reflect the new definition, these  efforts are not yet completed and the department does not have plans to  align these efforts with the existing data on department-wide military and  civilian positions that have headquarters-related DOD function codes or to  collect information on the costs associated with functions within  headquarters organizations. Without such alignment and such  information, the department will not be well-positioned to reliably conduct  an assessment of its headquarters workforce by function to identify  opportunities for streamlining and related cost savings. Conducting such  functional analysis could allow DOD officials to raise questions about the  number and types of positions with particular headquarters functions and  to better understand cost drivers and identify efficiency-related  opportunities within the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To further DOD\u2019s efforts to identify opportunities for more efficient use of  headquarters-related resources, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Deputy Chief Management Officer, in coordination with  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretaries of the military  departments, and the heads of the defense agencies and DOD field  activities, to take the following two actions: align DOD\u2019s data on department-wide military and civilian positions  that have headquarters-related DOD function codes with the revised  definition of major DOD headquarters activities in order to provide the  department with reliable data to accurately assess headquarters  functions and identify opportunities for streamlining or further analysis;  and once this definition is published in DOD guidance, collect reliable  information on the costs associated with functions within headquarters  organizations\u2014through revisions to the IGCA Inventory or another  method\u2014in order to provide the department with detailed information  for use in estimating resources associated with specific headquarters  functions, and in making decisions, monitoring performance, and  allocating resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

The department stated that this effort includes  updating data architecture for coding major DOD headquarters activities,  by program element code, in the Future Years Defense Program, and  noted that this data architecture will serve as the authoritative  methodology to account for headquarters manpower and resources in the  future. Further, DOD stated that, once those efforts are complete and the  new framework is codified in an update to DOD Instruction 5100.73, the  department will determine how best to align the function code taxonomy,  which is the source of data for the IGCA Inventory, with the revised  framework and definitions. We agree that determining how to align the  data set from the IGCA Inventory with the revised framework and  definitions is an important first step and, if implemented, would address  the intent of our first recommendation.", "Finally, DOD stated in its comments that the updated data architecture  will enable the department to collect consistent, comprehensive, and  authoritative information on the costs associated with major DOD  headquarters activities. We also agree that updating the data architecture  for coding major DOD headquarters activities will help improve the  department\u2019s visibility of headquarters-related resources. As the  department works to complete this effort, we believe that it should  develop a means of collecting reliable information on the costs associated  with functions within headquarters organizations.

We also found that DOD\u2019s data on its  headquarters personnel lacked the completeness and reliability  necessary for use in making efficiency assessments and decisions.", "Recommendations: We recommended that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretaries of the military departments and the heads of the  DOD components to continue to examine opportunities to consolidate  commands and to centralize administrative and command support  services, functions, or programs. Additionally, we recommended that  the Secretary of Defense revise DOD Instruction 5100.73, Major DOD  Headquarters Activities, to include all headquarters organizations;  specify how contractors performing headquarters functions will be  identified and included in headquarters reporting; clarify how  components are to compile the information needed for headquarters- reporting requirements; and establish time frames for implementing  actions to improve tracking and reporting of headquarters resources.  DOD concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred  with the second recommendation in this report.", "Status: DOD officials have stated that, since 2012, several efforts  have been made to consolidate or eliminate commands and to  centralize administrative and command support services, functions, or  programs. For example, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)  officials said that DOD has begun efforts to assess which  headquarters organizations are not currently included in its guiding  instruction on headquarters, and will update the instruction. However,  as of June 2016, DOD has not completed its update of the instruction  to include all major headquarters activity organizations. OSD officials  stated that they would begin updating this instruction upon completion  of the effort to assess headquarters organizations. In addition, DOD  has not specified how contractors will be identified and included in  headquarters reporting, and has not identified a time frame for action.", "In May 2013, we found that authorized military and civilian positions at the  geographic combatant commands\u2014excluding U.S. Central Command\u2014 had increased by about 50 percent from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal  year 2012, primarily due to the addition of new organizations, such as the  establishment of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Africa Command, and  increased mission requirements for the theater special operations  commands. We also found that DOD\u2019s process for sizing its combatant  commands had several weaknesses, including the absence of a  comprehensive, periodic review of the existing size and structure of these  commands and inconsistent use of personnel-management systems to  identify and track assigned personnel.", "Recommendations: We recommended that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to revise its guiding  instruction on managing joint personnel requirements\u2014Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 1001.01A, Joint Manpower and  Personnel Program\u2014to require a comprehensive and periodic  evaluation of whether the size and structure of the combatant  commands meet assigned missions. DOD did not concur with this  recommendation, but we continue to believe that institutionalizing a  periodic evaluation of all authorized positions would help to  systematically align manpower with missions and add rigor to the  requirements process. The department concurred with the remaining  three recommendations, namely, that the Secretary of Defense: (1)  direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to revise Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 1001.01A to require the combatant  commands to identify, manage, and track all personnel and to identify  specific guidelines and time frames for the combatant commands to  consistently input and review personnel data in the system; (2) direct  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in coordination with the  combatant commanders and Secretaries of the military departments,  to develop and implement a formal process to gather information on  authorized manpower and assigned personnel at the service  component commands; and (3) direct the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) to revise volume 2, chapter 1, of DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation 7000.14R to require the military  departments, in their annual budget documents for operation and  maintenance, to identify the authorized military positions and civilian  and contractor full-time equivalents at each combatant command and  provide detailed information on funding required by each command for  mission and headquarters-support, such as civilian pay, contract  services, travel, and supplies.", "Status: With regard to the recommendation to revise the instruction to  require the commands to improve visibility over all combatant  command personnel, DOD has established a new manpower tracking  system, the Fourth Estate Manpower Tracking System, that is to track  all personnel data, including temporary personnel, and identify  specific guidelines and timelines to input/review personnel data. With  regard to the recommendation to develop and implement a formal  process to gather information on authorized manpower and assigned  personnel at the service component commands, as of August 2015,  the process outlined by DOD to gather information on authorized and  assigned personnel at the service component commands is the same  as the one identified during our prior work. With regard to the  recommendation to revise DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation,  in December 2014 DOD indicated that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) had reinstituted an existing  budgetary document, the President\u2019s Budget 58, Combatant  Command Direct Funding, and directed the military services to use  this budget exhibit in its guidance on submission of the fiscal years  2016 through 2020 program and budget. The President\u2019s Budget 58  provides the department\u2019s justification and visibility for changes in the  level of resources required for each combatant command. While the  President\u2019s Budget 58 does not provide detailed information on the  number of authorized military or civilian positions and contractor full- time equivalents at each combatant command, it does identify the  funding required by each combatant command for mission and  headquarters support, which, in general, satisfies the intent of our  recommendation.", "In June 2014, we found that DOD\u2019s functional combatant commands  have shown substantial increases in authorized positions and costs to  support headquarters operations since fiscal year 2004, primarily to  support recent and emerging missions, including military operations to  combat terrorism and the emergence of cyberspace as a warfighting  domain. Further, we found that DOD did not have a reliable way to  determine the resources devoted to management headquarters as a  starting point for DOD\u2019s planned 20 percent reduction to headquarters  budgets, and thus we concluded that actual savings would be difficult to  track. We recommended that DOD reevaluate the decision to focus  reductions on management headquarters to ensure meaningful savings  and set a clearly defined and consistently applied baseline starting point  for the reductions. Further, we recommended that DOD track the  reductions against the baselines in order to provide reliable accounting of  savings and reporting to Congress.", "Recommendations: We recommended that the Secretary of Defense  reevaluate the decision to focus reductions on management  headquarters to ensure the department\u2019s efforts ultimately result in  meaningful savings. DOD partially concurred, questioning, in part, the  recommendation\u2019s scope. We agreed that the recommendation has  implications beyond the functional combatant commands, which was  the scope of our review, but the issue we identified is not limited to  these commands. We also recommended that the Secretary of  Defense (1) set a clearly defined and consistently applied starting  point as a baseline for reductions; and (2) track reductions against the  baselines in order to provide reliable accounting of savings and  reporting to Congress. DOD concurred with these two  recommendations.", "Status: To address the two recommendations with which it concurred,  DOD said that it planned to use the Future Years Defense Program  data to set the baseline going forward. DOD stated that it was  enhancing data elements within a DOD resource database to better  identify management headquarters resources to facilitate tracking and  reporting across the department. A December 2014 Resource  Management Decision directed DOD components to identify and  correct inconsistencies in major headquarters activities in authoritative  DOD systems and reflect those changes in the fiscal year 2017  program objective memorandums or submit them into the manpower  management system, but this effort has not yet been completed.", "In January 2015, we found that, over the previous decade, authorized  military and civilian positions have increased within the DOD  headquarters organizations we reviewed\u2014OSD, the Joint Staff, and the  Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force secretariats and staffs\u2014but the  size of these organizations has recently leveled off or begun to decline.  In addition, we found that the DOD headquarters organizations we  reviewed do not determine their personnel requirements as part of a  systematic requirements-determination process, nor do they have  procedures in place to ensure that they periodically reassess these  requirements as outlined in DOD and other guidance. Current personnel  levels for these headquarters organizations are traceable to statutory  limits enacted in the 1980s and 1990s to force efficiencies and reduce  duplication. However, we found that these limits have been waived since  fiscal year 2002 and have little practical utility because of statutory  exceptions for certain categories of personnel, and because the limits  exclude personnel in supporting organizations that perform headquarters- related functions.", "Recommendations: We recommended that the Secretary of Defense  direct the following three actions: (1) conduct a systematic  determination of personnel requirements for OSD, the Joint Staff, and  the military services\u2019 secretariats and staff, which should include  analysis of mission, functions, and tasks, and the minimum personnel  needed to accomplish those missions, functions, and tasks; (2) submit  these personnel requirements, including information on the number of  personnel within OSD and the military services\u2019 secretariats and staffs  that count against the statutory limits, along with any applicable  adjustments to the statutory limits, to Congress, along with any  recommendations needed to modify the existing statutory limits; and  (3) establish and implement procedures to conduct periodic  reassessments of personnel requirements within OSD and the military  services\u2019 secretariats and staffs. DOD partially concurred with all of  these recommendations. In addition, we raised a matter for  congressional consideration, namely, that Congress should consider  using the results of DOD\u2019s review of headquarters personnel  requirements to reexamine the statutory limits. Such an examination  could consider whether supporting organizations that perform  headquarters functions should be included in statutory limits and  whether the statutes on personnel limitations within the military  services\u2019 secretariats and staffs should be amended to include a  prohibition on reassigning headquarters-related functions elsewhere.", "Status: With regard to the recommendation that DOD conduct a  systematic determination of personnel requirements for OSD, the  Joint Staff, and the military services\u2019 secretariats and staff, the  department stated that it will continue to use the processes and  prioritization that are part of the Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  and Execution process, and will also investigate other methods for  aligning personnel to missions and priorities. However, DOD did not  specify whether any of these actions would include a workforce  analysis. With regard to the recommendation related to conducting  periodic reassessments of personnel requirements within OSD and  the military service secretariats and staffs. DOD said that it supports  the intent of the recommendation but that such periodic  reassessments require additional resources and personnel, which  would drive an increase in the number of personnel performing major  DOD headquarters activities. Specifically, DOD stated it intends to  examine the establishment of requirements determination processes  across the department, to include the contractor workforce, but this  will require a phased approach across a longer timeframe. In  December 2014, the Secretary of Defense directed the Deputy Chief  Management Officer to develop and implement a manpower  requirements validation process for OSD, the defense agencies, and  DOD field activities for military and civilian manpower, but, as of June  2016, this effort has not yet been completed. With regard to the  recommendation related to the submission of the personnel  requirements to Congress, along with any applicable adjustments and  recommended modifications. DOD stated that it has ongoing efforts to  refine and improve its reporting capabilities associated with these  requirements, noting that the department has to update DOD  Instruction 5100.73, Major DOD Headquarters Activities, before it can  determine personnel requirements that count against the statutory  limits. We previously recommended that the department update this  instruction, and, according to DOD officials, they intend to begin  updating the instruction in June 2016. In addition, we noted that DOD  did not indicate whether the department would submit personnel  requirements that count against the statutory limits in the Defense  Manpower Requirements Report, as we recommend, once the  instruction is finalized. We continue to believe that submitting these  personnel requirements to Congress in this DOD report would provide  Congress with key information to determine whether the existing  statutory limits on military and civilian personnel are effective in  limiting headquarters personnel growth. With regard to the matter for  congressional consideration, the Senate Armed Services Committee  markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2017 includes a provision that would allow the OSD and the military  departments to increase their number of military and civilian personnel  by 15 percent in times of national emergency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Descriptions of Headquarters- Related Department of Defense Function Codes", "paragraphs": ["In the Inherently Governmental / Commercial Activities (IGCA) Inventory  for fiscal years 2010 through 2014, there are 38 functions, each  designated by a specific DOD function code, that have a headquarters  designation; of these, 35 are labeled \u201cManagement Headquarters,\u201d while  3 are labeled \u201cCombatant Headquarters.\u201d For the purposes of this report,  we use the term \u201cheadquarters,\u201d rather than \u201cmanagement headquarters\u201d  or \u201ccombatant headquarters,\u201d when referring to the titles of these 38  functions in the body of the report.

This report (1) describes the status of  DOD\u2019s initiatives since 2014 to improve the efficiency of headquarters  organizations and identify related cost savings; and (2) assesses the  extent to which DOD has reliable data to assess headquarters functions  and their associated costs.", "To describe the status of DOD\u2019s initiatives to improve the efficiency of  headquarters organizations and identify related cost savings, we  identified and reviewed DOD headquarters-related efficiency efforts  begun since 2014. We obtained documentary and testimonial evidence  from senior officials in the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer  to determine the scope and status of these headquarters-related  efficiency efforts and what actions, if any, DOD has taken as a result of  the efforts.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has reliable data to assess  headquarters functions and their associated costs, we took two main  steps.", "First, we identified and reviewed DOD-wide sources of information  that would provide data on the department\u2019s workforce in terms of  whether the workforce is performing headquarters work and the  specific headquarters functions that workforce is performing. We  discussed with officials from the Office of the Deputy Chief  Management Officer, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, and the Cost Analysis and Program  Evaluation office, and reviewed data from, several department-wide  sources, specifically, the Future Years Defense Program, the  Defense Manpower Data Center, the Inherently Governmental /  Commercial Activities (IGCA) Inventory, and the Inventory of  Contracted Services. For this report, we analyzed data and  information related to the IGCA Inventory because it was the only  DOD-wide data set identified that allowed us to determine the military  and civilian workforce\u2014in the form of authorized positions\u2014by both  headquarters and function. However, we found that the data in the  IGCA Inventory were submitted by the various DOD organizations at  different points in a given fiscal year. To ensure that the data would be  as close to the end of each fiscal year as possible, we obtained data  from each of the military services\u2019 manpower databases used to  populate DOD\u2019s IGCA Inventory for fiscal years 2010 through 2014,  which was the most recent 5-year period available during our review.  For each service database, we identified the subset of military and  civilian positions considered headquarters according to IGCA  guidance. We then analyzed these headquarters positions for each  organization and for each fiscal year by number of military and civilian  positions, function, grade, and location. We discussed the data, and  the reasons for any patterns or changes we observed in them, with  military service representatives. DOD was unable to provide similar  data for organizations outside the military departments known as the  Fourth Estate in time for our review, so we collected data on the  Fourth Estate\u2019s military and civilian positions directly from the IGCA  Inventory for fiscal years 2012 to 2014. We assessed the data we  received against federal standards for internal control, which call for  an agency to have relevant, reliable, and timely information in order to  run and control its operations.", "Second, we attempted to calculate the approximate costs of the headquarters positions and associated functions. Because the IGCA Inventory does not contain estimated costs for positions, we used the service databases\u2019 pay grade and location information assigned to the military and civilian positions in an attempt to determine the estimated cost to DOD of filling headquarters positions. Specifically, we applied DOD\u2019s military composite standard pay rates and civilian fringe benefits rates to the pay grades we had collected for each position identified in the service databases. We were unable to do a similar calculation for the Fourth Estate because Fourth Estate data on positions came from the IGCA Inventory, which does not contain pay grade and location information needed for a cost calculation. We assessed our and DOD\u2019s efforts to calculate headquarters-related costs against federal standards for internal control on having relevant, reliable, and timely information, and noted the importance of a key step that we have previously identified for conducting fragmentation, overlap, and duplication reviews. Specifically, one of the steps in conducting such a review is to identify the positive and negative effects of any fragmentation, overlap, and duplication by assessing  program implementation, outcomes and impact, and cost- effectiveness.", "We assessed the reliability of the IGCA-related data sets by reviewing  responses to data questionnaires sent to knowledgeable service and  Fourth Estate officials, discussing the data with these officials, and  conducting our own cross-checks of the data to assess their  reasonableness.
