This report reviews the ongoing development of a potential method for obtaining such information: the \"grouped answers\" approach. In 1998, GAO devised the approach and recommended further study. In response, the Census Bureau tested respondent acceptance and recently reported results. GAO answers four questions. (1) Is the grouped answers approach acceptable for use in a national survey of the foreign-born? (2) What further research may be needed? (3) How large a survey is needed? (4) Are any ongoing surveys appropriate for inserting a grouped answers question series (to avoid the cost of a new survey)? For this study, GAO consulted an independent statistician and other experts, performed test calculations, obtained documents, and interviewed officials and staff at federal agencies. The Census Bureau and DHS agreed with the main findings of this report. DHS agreed that the National Survey of Drug Use and Health is not an appropriate survey for inserting a grouped answers question series."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The grouped answers approach is designed to ask foreign-born respondents about their immigration status in a personal-interview survey. Immigration statuses are grouped in Boxes A, B, and C on two different flash cards--with the undocumented status in Box B. Respondents are asked to pick the box that includes their current status and are told, \"If it's in Box B, we don't want to know which specific category applies to you.\" The grouped answers approach is acceptable to many experts and immigrant advocates--with certain conditions, such as (for some advocates) private sector data collection. Most respondents tested did not object to picking a box. Research is needed to assess issues such as whether respondents pick the correct box. A sizable survey--roughly 6,000 or more respondents--would be needed for 95 percent confidence and a margin of error of (plus or minus) 3 percentage points. The ongoing surveys that GAO identified are not appropriate for collecting data on immigration status. (For example, one survey takes names and Social Security numbers, which might affect acceptance of immigration status questions.) Whether further research or implementation in a new survey would be justified depends on how policymakers weigh the need for such information against potential costs and the uncertainties of future research."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As greater numbers of foreign-born persons enter, live, and work in the  United States, policymakers and the general public increasingly place high  priority on issues involving immigrants. Because separate policies, laws,  and programs apply to different immigration statuses, valid and reliable  information is needed for populations defined by immigration status.  However, government statistics generally do not include such information.", "The information most difficult to obtain concerns the size, characteristics,  costs, and contributions of the population referred to in this report as  undocumented or currently undocumented. Such information is needed  because, for example, large numbers of undocumented persons arrive  each year, and the Census Bureau has realized that information on the size  of the undocumented population would help estimate the size of the total  U.S. population, especially for years between decennial censuses. More  generally, information about the undocumented population\u2014and about  changes in that population\u2014can contribute to policy-related planning and  evaluation efforts.", "As you know, in 1998, we devised an approach to surveying foreign-born  respondents about their immigration status. This self-report, personal- interview approach groups answers so that no respondent is ever asked  whether he, she, or anyone else is undocumented. In fact, no individual  respondent is ever categorized as undocumented. Logically, however,  grouped answers data can provide indirect estimates of the undocumented  population. Generally, grouped answers questions on immigration status  would be asked as part of a larger survey that includes direct questions on  demographic characteristics and employment and might include questions  on school attendance, use of medical facilities, and so forth; some surveys  also ask specific questions that can help estimate taxes paid. Potentially,  combining the answers to such questions with grouped answers data can  provide further information on the characteristics, costs, and  contributions of the undocumented population.", "We reported the first results of preliminary tests of the grouped answers  approach, primarily with Hispanic farmworkers, in 1998 and 1999; the  majority of the preliminary test interviews were fielded by Aguirre  International of Burlingame, California. We also recommended that the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Census Bureau  further develop and test the method. In response, the Census Bureau  contracted for a test as part of the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS),  which is fielded by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the  University of Chicago, with \u201ccore funding\u201d provided by a grant from the  National Science Foundation (NSF). The Census Bureau\u2019s analysis of the  2004 GSS data became available in 2006.", "In this report, we respond to your request that we review the ongoing  development of the grouped answers approach and related issues. We  address four questions: (1) Is the grouped answers approach \u201cacceptable\u201d  for use in a national survey of the foreign-born population? (2) What kinds  of further research are or may be needed, based on the results of tests  conducted thus far and expert opinion? (3) How large a survey is needed  to provide \u201creasonably precise\u201d estimates of the undocumented  population, using grouped answers data? (4) Are there appropriate  ongoing surveys in which the grouped answers question series might  eventually be inserted (thus avoiding the costs of fielding a new survey)?", "To answer these questions, we    consulted private sector experts in immigration issues and studies,  including immigrant advocates, immigration researchers, and  others;    consulted an independent statistical expert, Dr. Alan Zaslavsky, and  other experts in statistics and surveys;  reanalyzed the data from the 2004 GSS test and subjected both our  analysis and the Census Bureau\u2019s analysis to review by the  independent statistical expert;    performed test calculations, using specific assumptions; and  identified ongoing surveys that might be candidates for  piggybacking the grouped answers question series, gathered  documents on those surveys, and met with officials and staff at the  federal agencies that conduct or sponsor them.", "We also met with other relevant federal agencies. Appendix I describes  our methodology and the scope of our work in more detail. We conducted  our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards between July 2005 and September 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grouped Answers Reduce \u201cQuestion Threat\u201d and Allow Indirect Estimates of the Undocumented", "paragraphs": ["Survey questions about sensitive topics carry a \u201cthreat\u201d for some  respondents, because they fear that a truthful answer could result in some  degree of negative consequence (at a minimum, social disapproval). The  grouped answers approach is designed to reduce this threat when asking  about immigration status.", "Three key points about the grouped answers approach are that  1.  no respondent is ever asked whether he or she, or anyone else, is  2.  two pieces of information are separately provided by two subsamples  of respondents (completely different people\u2014no one is shown both  immigration status cards); and  3.  taking the two pieces of information together\u2014like two different  pieces of a puzzle\u2014allows indirect estimation of the undocumented  population, but no individual respondent (and no piece of data on an  individual respondent) is ever categorized as undocumented.", "We discuss each point in some detail.   1.  No respondent is ever asked whether he or she is in the  undocumented category. Unlike questions that ask respondents to  choose among specific answer categories, the grouped answers approach  combines answer categories in sets or \u201cboxes,\u201d as shown in figure 1.", "Box B includes the sensitive answer category-\u2014currently  \u201cundocumented\u201d\u2014along with other categories that are nonsensitive.", "Each respondent is asked to \u201cpick the Box\u201d\u2014Box A, Box B, or Box C\u2014 that contains the specific answer category that applies to him or her.  Respondents are told, in effect: If the specific category that applies to you  is in Box B, we don\u2019t want to know which one it is, because right now we  are focusing on Box A categories.", "By using the boxes, the interview avoids \u201czeroing in\u201d on the sensitive  answer. The specific categories shown in the boxes in figure 1 are grouped  so that one would expect many respondents who are here legally, as well  as those who are undocumented, to choose Box B, and   there is virtually no possibility of anyone deducing which specific  category within Box B applies to any individual respondent.   2. Two pieces of information are provided separately by two  subsamples of respondents (no one is shown both immigration  status cards). Respondents are divided into two subsamples, based on  randomization procedures or rotation (alternation) procedures conducted  outside the interview process. (For example, a rotation procedure might  specify that within an interviewing area, every other household will be  designated as subsample 1 or subsample 2.)", "This \u201csplit sample\u201d procedure has been used routinely for many surveys  over the years. As applied to the grouped answers approach, the two  subsamples are shown alternative flash cards. Immigration Status Card 1,  described above, represents one way to group immigration statuses in  three boxes. A second immigration status flash card (Immigration Status  Card 2, shown in figure 2) groups the same statuses differently.", "The alternative immigration-status cards can be thought of as \u201cmirror  images\u201d in that  the two nonsensitive legal statuses in Box A of Card 1 appear in Box  B of Card 2 and   the two nonsensitive legal statuses in Box B of Card 1 appear in Box  A of Card 2.", "However, the undocumented status always appears in Box B.", "Interviewers ask survey respondents in subsample 1 about immigration  status with respect to Card 1. They ask survey respondents in subsample   2 (completely different persons) about immigration status with respect to  Card 2. Each respondent is shown one and only one immigration-status  flash card. There are no highly unusual or complicated interviewing  procedures.", "Because the two subsamples of respondents are drawn randomly or by  rotation, each subsample represents the foreign-born population and, if  sufficiently large, can provide \u201creasonably precise\u201d estimates of the  percentages of the foreign-born population in the boxes on one of the  alternative cards.", "Incidentally, a respondent picking a box that does not include the sensitive  answer\u2014for example, a respondent picking Box A or Box C in figure 1\u2014 can be asked follow-up questions that pinpoint the specific answer  category that applies to him or her. Thus, direct information is obtained on  all legal immigration statuses. The data on some of the legal categories can  be compared to administrative data to check the reasonableness of  responses. Additionally, these data provide estimates of legal statuses,  which are useful when, for example, policymakers review legislation on  the numbers of foreign-born persons who may be admitted to this country  under specific legal status programs.   3. No individual respondent is ever categorized as undocumented,  but indirect estimates of the undocumented population can be  made. Using two slightly different pieces of information provided by the  two different subsamples allows indirect estimation of the size of the  currently undocumented population\u2014by simple subtraction.", "The only difference between Box B of Card 1 and Box A of Card 2 is the  inclusion of the currently \u201cundocumented\u201d category in Box B of Card 1.  Figure 3 shows both cards together for easy comparison.", "Thus, the percentage of the foreign-born population who are currently  undocumented can be estimated as follows:    Start with the percentage of subsample 1 respondents who report  that they are in Box B of Card 1 (hypothetical figure: 62 percent of  subsample 1).", "Subtract from this the percentage of subsample 2 who say they are  in Box A on Card 2 (hypothetical figure: 33 percent of subsample 2).", "Observe the difference (29 percent, based on the hypothetical  figures); this represents an estimate of the percentage of the  foreign-born population who are undocumented.", "Alternatively, a \u201cmirror-image\u201d estimate could be calculated, using Box B  of Card 2 and Box A of Card 1.", "To estimate the numerical size of the undocumented population, a  grouped answers estimate of the percentage of the foreign-born who are  undocumented would be combined with a census figure. For example, the  2000 census counted 31 million foreign-born, and the Census Bureau  issued an updated estimate of 35.7 million for 2005. The procedure would  be to simply multiply the percent undocumented (based on the grouped  answers data and the subtraction procedure) by a census count or an  updated estimate for the year in question.", "These procedures ensure that no respondents\u2014and no data on any  specific respondent\u2014are ever separated out or categorized as  undocumented, not even during the analytic process of making indirect,  group-level estimates.", "To further ensure reduction of \u201cquestion threat,\u201d the grouped answers  question series begins with flash cards that ask about nonsensitive topics  and familiarize respondents with the 3-box approach. For each  nonsensitive-topic card, interviewers ask the respondent which box  applies to him or her, saying: If it\u2019s Box B, we do not want to know which  specific category applies to you.", "In this way, most respondents should understand the grouped answers  approach before seeing the immigration-status card.", "To help ensure accurate responses, respondents who choose Box A can be  asked a series of clarifying questions. (No follow-up questions are  addressed to anyone choosing Box B.) The questions for Box A  respondents are designed to prompt them to, essentially, reclassify  themselves in Box B, if that is appropriate.", "The grouped answers question series can potentially be applied in a large- scale general population survey, where the questions on immigration  status would be added for the foreign-born respondents\u2014provided that an  appropriate survey can be identified. If a new survey of the general  foreign-born population were planned, it would involve selecting a general  sample of households and then screening out the households that do not  include one or more foreign-born persons.", "Finally, we note that while the initial version of the grouped answers  approach involved three alternative flash cards (and was termed the  \u201cthree-card method\u201d), we recently devised the version described here,  which uses two cards rather than three. The two-card method is simpler, is  easier to understand, and provides more precise estimates. All cards are  alike in that they feature three boxes in which specific answer categories  are grouped."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics, Costs, and Contributions Can Potentially Be Estimated", "paragraphs": ["Generally, grouped answers questions on immigration status would be  asked as part of a larger survey that includes direct questions on  demographic characteristics and employment and might include questions  on school attendance, use of medical facilities, and so forth; some surveys  also ask specific questions that can help estimate taxes paid.

Additionally, when combined with separate quantitative data (for example,  data on program costs per individual), grouped answers data can be used  to estimate quantitative information (such as program costs) for the  undocumented population as a whole\u2014or, again, depending on sample  size, for specific subgroups.", "The procedures for deriving these more complex indirect estimates are  described in appendix II.

These figures represent substantial increases over  the prior 15 years. For example, in 1990 the foreign-born population  totaled fewer than 20 million; only 3 states had a population more than  one-tenth foreign-born. One result is that as the Department of Labor has  testified, foreign-born workers now constitute almost 15 percent of the  U.S. labor force, and the numbers of such workers are growing.", "A new paper from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) puts the  \u201cunauthorized\u201d immigrant population at 10.5 million as of January 2005  and indicates that if recent trends continued, the figure for January 2006  would be 11 million. The Pew Hispanic Center\u2019s indirect estimate of the  undocumented population as of 2006 is 11.5 million to 12 million. These  estimates represent roughly one-third of the entire foreign-born  population. DHS has variously estimated the size of the undocumented  population as of January 2000 as 7 million and 8.5 million . Government  and other estimates for 1990 numbered only 3.5 million.", "These various indirect estimates of the undocumented population are  based on the \u201cresidual method.\u201d Residual estimation (1) starts with a  census count or survey estimate of the number of foreign-born residents  who have not become U.S. citizens and (2) subtracts out estimated  numbers of legally present individuals in various categories, based on  administrative data and assumptions (because censuses and surveys do  not ask about legal status). The remainder, or residual, represents an  indirect estimate of the size of the undocumented population.", "To illustrate the role of administrative data and assumptions, residual  estimates draw on counts of the number of new green cards issued each  year. But they also require assumptions to account for emigration and  deaths among those who received green cards in earlier years.", "A recent DHS paper providing residual estimates of the undocumented  population includes ranges of estimates based on alternative assumptions  made for two key components. For example, \u201cby lowering or raising the  emigration rates 20 percent . . . the estimated unauthorized immigrant  population would range from 10.0 million to 11.0 million.\u201d The DHS paper  also lists assumptions that were not subjected to alternative specifications.  We believe the DHS paper represents an advance because, up to now,  analysts producing residual estimates have generally not made public  statements regarding the precision of the estimates. (Some critics have,  however, indicated that residual estimates are likely to lack precision.)", "While the residual approach has been used to profile the undocumented  population on two characteristics\u2014age and country of birth\u2014it is limited  with respect to estimating (1) current geographic location and (2) current  employment and benefit use. The reason is that current characteristics of  legally present persons are not maintained in administrative records;  analysts must therefore rely largely on assumptions . In contrast, the  grouped answers method does allow for the possibility of estimating  current characteristics based on current self-reports.", "During the mid-1990s, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform  determined that better statistical \u201cinformation on legal status and type of  immigrant  crucial\u201d to assessing immigration policy. Indeed, the  Commission called for a variety of improvements in estimates of the costs  and benefits associated with undocumented immigration. NRC\u2019s  Committee on National Statistics further emphasized the need for better  information on costs, especially state and local costs. (If successfully  fielded, the grouped answers method might help provide general  information on such costs\u2014and, potentially, specific information for large  states such as California. Sample size limitations would be likely to  prohibit separate analyses for specific local areas, small states, and states  with low percentages of foreign-born or undocumented.)", "Over the years, we have received numerous congressional requests related  to estimating costs associated with the undocumented population.  Recent Census Bureau research and conferences reflect the realization  that undocumented immigration is a key component of current population  growth and that there is a resultant need for information on this group.  Additionally, some of the immigrant advocates we interviewed expressed  an interest in being able to better describe the contributions of the  undocumented population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Surveys Are a Key Information Source", "paragraphs": ["Various national surveys ask foreign-born respondents to provide  information about themselves and, in some cases, other persons in their  households.

The reason is that persons selected for  interview are clustered in a limited number of areas or neighborhoods  (and residents of a particular neighborhood may tend to be similar). It is  possible that the design for selecting subsamples 1 and 2 could increase  precision; however, it is not possible to predict by how much.", "With respect to the third factor, existing residual estimates point to a fairly  even 3-way split between three main categories\u2014undocumented, U.S.  citizen, and legal permanent resident. However, there is some uncertainty  associated with these estimates, the distribution may vary across  subgroups, and the percentages may change in future.

The precision of the grouped  answers percentage is taken into account by using a percentage range   (for example, the estimate plus or minus 3 percentage points) when  multiplying.
