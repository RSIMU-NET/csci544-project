The federal government provides states with funding and other support to help them prepare for and respond to disasters. Because of congressional interest in these issues, GAO examined (1) federal agencies' actions to help states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters and (2) states' experiences obtaining and using grants from the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) to respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters. CCP is a program of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). GAO reviewed documents and interviewed program officials from federal agencies and conducted additional work in six states with experience responding to catastrophic disasters: Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, Texas, and Washington."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have awarded grants and conducted other activities to help states prepare for the psychological consequences of catastrophic and other disasters. For example, in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provided grants to mental health and substance abuse agencies in 35 states for disaster planning. In 2007, SAMHSA completed an assessment of mental health and substance abuse disaster plans developed by states that received a preparedness grant. SAMHSA found that, for the 34 states with plans available for review, these plans generally showed improvement over those that had been submitted by states as part of their application for its preparedness grant. The agency also identified several ways in which the plans could be improved. For example, about half the plans did not indicate specific planning and response actions that substance abuse agencies should take. Similarly, GAO's review of the plans available from six states found varying attention among the plans to covering substance abuse issues. SAMHSA officials said the agency is exploring methods of determining states' individual technical assistance needs. Other federal agencies--the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and DHS--have provided broader preparedness funding that states may use for mental health or substance abuse preparedness, but these agencies' data-reporting requirements do not produce information on the extent to which states used funds for this purpose. States in GAO's review experienced difficulties in applying for CCP funding and implementing their programs following catastrophic disasters. CCP, a key federal postdisaster response grant program to help states deliver crisis counseling services, is administered by FEMA in collaboration with SAMHSA. State officials said they had difficulty collecting information needed for their CCP applications and experienced lengthy application reviews. FEMA and SAMHSA officials said they have taken steps to improve the application submission and review process. State officials also said they experienced problems implementing their CCPs. For example, they said that FEMA's policy of not reimbursing states and their CCP service providers for indirect costs, such as certain administrative expenses, led to problems recruiting and retaining service providers. Other FEMA postdisaster response grant programs allow reimbursement for indirect costs. A FEMA official said the agency had been considering since 2006 whether to allow indirect cost reimbursement under CCP but did not know when a decision would be made. States also cited difficulties assisting people who needed more intensive crisis counseling services than those traditionally provided through state CCPs. FEMA and SAMHSA officials said they plan to consider options for adding other types of crisis counseling services to CCP, based in part on states' experiences with CCP pilot programs offering expanded crisis counseling services. The officials did not know when they would complete their review and reach a decision."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In this report, we consider disasters that are unusually devastating and require extensive  federal support to be catastrophic.", "PTSD is an often debilitating and potentially chronic disorder that can develop after  experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event and includes such symptoms as distressing  dreams and intrusive memories.", "GAO, Hurricane Katrina: Status of Hospital Inpatient and Emergency Departments in  the Greater New Orleans Area, GAO-06-1003 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 29, 2006), 13.

Within HHS the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA) helps integrate mental health and substance  abuse services into these federal efforts. Federal agencies may carry out  these responsibilities through a variety of efforts, including the following  activities: the provision of grants to states for preparedness efforts,  development of training and guidance related to preparedness, assessment  of state activities, and development of plans for utilizing federal staff and  medical supplies to assist states.", "For postdisaster response, DHS and HHS efforts may include providing  states with funding to assist their response to the psychological  consequences of the disaster.

A state\u2019s application for CCP funds must demonstrate that the  need for crisis counseling in the affected area is beyond the capacity of  state and local resources. If awarded funds, states typically contract with  community organizations to provide the crisis counseling services,  including outreach and public education, individual and group counseling,  and referral for other services. We and others have reported on difficulties  with CCP. In 2005, for example, we reported that following the September  2001 attack on the World Trade Center (WTC), limited financial oversight  of New York\u2019s CCP by FEMA and SAMHSA made it difficult to determine  whether program funds were being used efficiently and effectively to help  alleviate psychological distress.

These include children and survivors of  past traumatic events. Others who may be especially vulnerable include  people who had a preexisting mental illness at the time of a disaster.  Research has also shown that disaster responders may be especially  vulnerable because of the direct and protracted nature of their exposure to  traumatic experiences, extended working hours, and sleep deprivation.

FEMA regulations require that, as a condition of receiving CCP funds to  respond to a disaster, states agree to include mental health disaster  planning in their overall plans. The regulations do not require that state  mental health and substance abuse agencies develop their own disaster  plans, but such plans are recommended by SAMHSA as important  components of disaster preparedness. In 2003, SAMHSA issued mental  health disaster planning guidance to help state and local mental health  agencies create or revise disaster plans. The agency recommends, for  example, that plans describe the specific responsibilities of state mental  health agencies and other organizations in responding to a disaster and  responsibilities for maintaining and revising a disaster plan.

For example, these plans  did not include specific information about providing methadone treatment  for people with a drug abuse disorder following a disaster\u2014information  that was provided in the separate substance abuse plans. In addition, we  found that disaster plans of the states in our review did not always identify  specific actions or responsibilities related to serving the mental health and  substance abuse needs of certain special populations.

One observation that state mental health officials  made was that schools could be an important local resource for providing  postdisaster services to children but that relationships between state  mental health agencies and schools are sometimes not in place prior to a  disaster. Officials from several states described benefits from meeting  other states\u2019 officials at SAMHSA\u2019s regional training conferences, but told  us that resource limitations or the need to first plan within their own state  made it difficult to continue these relationships.", "SAMHSA\u2019s report recommended that the agency conduct state-specific  needs assessments to identify individual states\u2019 technical assistance needs  for mental health and substance abuse disaster planning.

Additional  problems that state officials cited were related to assisting people in need  of more intensive counseling services and making referrals for mental  health and substance abuse treatment.

Officials said that the amount of information  required for their applications was difficult to collect because of the scope  of the disasters and the necessity for responding on other fronts, such as  ensuring the safety of patients and personnel at state-run mental health  facilities. For example, Texas officials estimated that the state hosted  more than 400,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees and that they had to collect  information for over 250 counties to estimate how many people might  need crisis counseling services. Furthermore, several state officials said  that some of the information required for the ISP application, such as that  on preliminary damages and the location of people who might need  services, was not always available or reliable immediately following a  catastrophic disaster. According to SAMHSA, because information from  traditional sources was lacking following Hurricane Katrina, states were  allowed to use other sources\u2014such as newspaper reports and anecdotal  evidence\u2014to complete their applications. However, Louisiana and  Mississippi officials told us that obtaining the information required by  SAMHSA to complete the application was difficult and was sometimes  unavailable in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane. Officials in three  states we contacted said that the difficulty of completing their applications  on time was exacerbated because multiple disasters affected the same  jurisdictions in close succession and they were required to submit a  separate application for each one. Louisiana, for example, had to submit  separate ISP applications following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, even  though the hurricanes affected overlapping areas and occurred less than   1 month apart.", "State officials also told us that the CCP application\u2019s needs assessment  formula, which they are to use to estimate the number of people who  might need crisis counseling services, created problems in estimating  needs following catastrophic disasters in their states. The needs  assessment formula includes several categories of loss, including deaths,  hospitalizations, homes damaged or destroyed, and disaster-related  unemployment. State officials told us that the formula\u2019s loss categories  did not capture data that they considered critical to assessing mental  health needs following a catastrophic disaster, such as estimates of  populations at increased risk for psychological distress, including children  and the elderly, or information on destroyed or damaged community  mental health centers. While states can include such information in a  narrative portion of their application, several state officials told us it was  not clear to them how this narrative information is factored into funding  decisions. NCPTSD\u2019s evaluation of CCP for SAMHSA described concerns  similar to those noted by states in our review about the accuracy of the  results produced by using the formula. Moreover, NCPTSD concluded that  the formula could be a contributing factor in discrepancies it found  between states\u2019 estimates of people in need and the numbers of people  actually served.", "Preparing the sections of the application on plans for providing CCP  services and on program budgets also was difficult, according to state  officials. For example, state officials said the application guidance did not  provide sufficient detail to indicate what federal officials would consider  reasonable numbers of supervisors, outreach workers, and crisis  counselors to hire. Several officials also said it was difficult to use the  fiscal guidance to determine what agency officials would consider a  reasonable budget for various CCP activities, such as use of paid television  and radio advertisements for outreach. State officials said that having  more detailed guidance would help them develop better proposals and  minimize the need to revise their applications during the review process.", "Federal program officials told us they have taken steps to address various  difficulties that states experienced in collecting information and preparing  their CCP applications. Agency officials told us that they recently made  changes intended to reduce the amount of information required in the ISP  and RSP applications, modified the needs assessment formula, and  clarified the applications and supporting guidance. For example, in the  revised needs assessment formula the weights assigned to most of the loss  categories have been adjusted for estimating the number of people who  could benefit from CCP services. According to SAMHSA, the revised ISP  and RSP applications were approved in September 2007; the agency made  these available to states in November 2007. In 2006, in response to  feedback from states regarding difficulties with the application process,  FEMA and SAMHSA revised their 4-day CCP basic training course for  states to increase its focus on preparing CCP applications. According to a  FEMA program official, the course was also revised in 2007 to reflect  recent changes to the applications and supporting guidance, and FEMA  program officials have requested that FEMA\u2019s Emergency Management  Institute offer the course annually instead of every other year. This  program official also told us that a Web-based CCP orientation course was  developed and that it is required for all those who attend the basic training  course."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Experienced Lengthy Application Reviews following Catastrophic Disasters, and FEMA and SAMHSA Have Taken Steps Intended to Shorten the Review Process", "paragraphs": ["State officials told us that FEMA and SAMHSA\u2019s CCP application review  process was lengthy after catastrophic disasters, especially for RSP  applications submitted following Hurricane Katrina. A FEMA official  estimated that for CCP applications submitted in 2002 through 2006 it had  generally taken the agencies about 14 days to review and make funding  decisions for ISP applications and about 28 to 70 days to review and make  funding decisions for RSP applications. Our analysis of CCP applications  for the catastrophic disasters in our review showed that it took FEMA and  SAMHSA from 5 to 39 days to review and make funding decisions for ISP  applications and 58 to 286 days to review and make funding decisions for  RSP applications. (See table 1.)", "State officials told us that the lengthy reviews and the resulting delays in  obtaining RSP funding created difficulties for their CCPs. According to  state officials, delays in application approval contributed to delays in  executing contracts with service providers, delays in hiring staff, and  problems retaining staff. They told us they needed to obtain a decision on  their RSP application as quickly as possible so they could better plan and  implement their programs.", "Federal program officials told us that several factors contributed to the  time it took to review applications following these catastrophic disasters.  These factors included an unanticipated high volume of CCP applications  following Hurricane Katrina. CCP applications submitted by states that  were directly affected by Hurricane Katrina, as well as by 26 states hosting  people who had evacuated after Hurricane Katrina, created unanticipated  demands that were well beyond the normal capacity of their CCP staff to  handle. FEMA officials told us that the two agencies typically reviewed  an average of 17 new ISP applications and 13 new RSP applications each  year from fiscal year 2002 through 2006, but that they reviewed 31 ISP  applications and 20 RSP applications in response to Hurricane Katrina  alone. According to SAMHSA officials, the agency had not planned for the  surge of applications created by FEMA\u2019s decision to allow host states to  apply for CCP funding and had no policies in place at the time to enable  SAMHSA\u2019s CCP and grants management staff to adapt quickly to the  submission of so many CCP applications within a few weeks. To respond,  some SAMHSA staff had to handle double the number of applications they  usually process, and the agency supplemented its six CCP reviewers by  using six staff from other parts of the agency to help review CCP grant  applications. FEMA hired three temporary staff to assist with the  application review process after Hurricane Katrina. However, a report  prepared for SAMHSA on its response to Hurricane Katrina noted that  some agency staff who assisted with the review of applications did not  have sufficient knowledge of CCP and the grant review process and  therefore required training.", "SAMHSA and FEMA have taken actions to be prepared for such a surge in  applications in the future. A SAMHSA official told us that the agency sent  five staff from various parts of the agency to the August 2007 4-day CCP  basic training course to help them gain a better understanding of the CCP  application process. In December 2007, the agency hired a staff person,  whose position was funded by FEMA, in its grants management office to,  among other things, assist in the review of CCP applications and the fiscal  monitoring of CCP grants. They expect the addition of this employee to  help to shorten application review times for RSP grants.", "SAMHSA officials told us that the need to obtain further information from  the states also contributed to the length of the reviews following  Hurricane Katrina. In examining various CCP applications submitted by  the states in our study after Hurricane Katrina and related  correspondence, we noted instances in which SAMHSA sent letters to  states informing them that their applications contained errors, were  incomplete, or required clarification for the agency to proceed with its  review. In some instances, the agency made multiple requests to a state to  clarify a specific part of its application. For example, SAMHSA found that  Louisiana did not provide complete information in its RSP application  related to the process the state planned to use to identify the local service  providers with which it would contract\u2014a process that was different from  the one traditionally used to contract for CCP services. According to  federal officials, issues related to this process resulted in Louisiana not  submitting a complete application until 6 months after its initial  application, which in turn created enormous delays in the application  review process.", "SAMHSA officials told us that another reason for the need to obtain  additional clarification was that the agency had established a more  stringent CCP application review process in July 2005. According to  SAMHSA officials, the revised CCP applications and guidance should help  reduce the need for states to revise their applications during the review  process. In addition, agency officials told us that the 2007 CCP basic  training course for applicants included information on the application  process and on the new review standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Faced Difficulties in Implementing Their CCPs after Catastrophic Disasters, including Problems Related to Lack of Indirect-Cost Reimbursement and Need for Expanded Services", "paragraphs": ["State officials said they faced difficulties in implementing their CCPs  following catastrophic disasters.

However, state officials told us  that it can be difficult for their agencies and service providers to determine  what proportion of their overall administrative costs is attributable to CCP  activities. In addition, several state officials also told us that CCP service  providers often have limited capacity in their overall agency budgets to  redirect funds from other services to cover the indirect costs associated  with their CCP work.", "State officials told us that the inability to obtain reimbursement for  indirect costs contributed to difficulties in recruiting and retaining service  providers. According to Louisiana officials, for example, that inability  contributed to the decision of one of its largest Hurricane Katrina CCP  contractors providing services in New Orleans to withdraw from the  state\u2019s program in 2007. While CCP guidance precluded reimbursement for  indirect costs, the provider decided to request reimbursement. In a June  2006 letter to the state mental health office, the provider stated that  participating in the state\u2019s CCP had created a financial burden that  included moving funds from other services to its CCP contract. In July  2006, FEMA declined the provider\u2019s request to include indirect costs in its  budget, stating that under CCP guidelines all budget charges must be  direct and that the provider should work with the state to see whether any  of these costs could be reclassified as direct costs in the provider\u2019s budget.", "Officials in FEMA\u2019s grants management office told us that although CCP  policy prohibits reimbursement for indirect costs, they were unaware of  statutory or regulatory prohibitions on the reimbursement of such costs.  Furthermore, they told us that other FEMA disaster response grant  programs do allow indirect cost reimbursement. For example, grantees  can be reimbursed for indirect costs under FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance  Program and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Other federal  postdisaster response grant programs also allow grantees to be  reimbursed for indirect costs, including the SAMHSA Emergency  Response Grant (SERG) program and the Department of Education\u2019s  Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program.", "Concern about the exclusion of indirect costs from CCP reimbursement  has been a long-standing issue. In 1995, FEMA\u2019s Inspector General issued a  report on CCP that said that the reimbursement of indirect costs appeared  allowable under applicable federal law and regulations. The Inspector  General recommended that FEMA review its policy on reimbursement for  indirect costs. FEMA and SAMHSA officials told us that reimbursement  for indirect costs was a recurring concern for states and service providers  and that states have advocated for a change in this policy. SAMHSA  officials said that allowing indirect cost reimbursement would promote  participation of a broader array of local service providers.", "A FEMA official told us that the agency had been considering whether to  develop a new CCP policy to allow reimbursement for such costs.  According to this official, FEMA had been examining this issue since June  2006, when it received the letter from the Louisiana CCP service provider.", "This official also told us that SAMHSA provided recommendations in  March 2007 on potential modifications to CCP guidance and application  materials to allow reimbursement for indirect costs. According to this  official, however, FEMA still needed to examine various implementation  issues, including which types of indirect costs might be reimbursed and  what changes to the application review process might be needed.

According to New York, Louisiana, and Mississippi officials, some CCP  clients who did not display symptoms suggesting they needed a referral for  mental health or substance abuse treatment nevertheless could have  benefited from more intensive crisis counseling than was provided in the  CCP model. Furthermore, in the case of Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi  officials told us that they wanted to able to serve as many people as  possible within their CCPs because the devastation resulted in fewer  mental health and substance abuse providers being available to accept  referrals for treatment.", "To assist these people, officials in New York, Louisiana, and Mississippi  asked FEMA and SAMHSA to allow their state CCPs to offer expanded  types of services after catastrophic disasters in their states. In response to  the states\u2019 requests, FEMA and SAMHSA officials allowed the existing  state CCPs to develop pilot programs offering expanded crisis counseling  services consistent with the nonclinical, short-term focus of the CCP  model. New York\u2019s expanded services, known as \u201cenhanced services,\u201d  were offered through the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) and  through community-based providers for both adults and children. FDNY\u2019s  services started in September 2002, about 12 months after the WTC attack.  The community-based services started in spring 2003. Provided by mental  health professionals, these expanded services were based on cognitive  behavioral approaches. These services included helping clients recognize  symptoms of postdisaster distress and develop skills to cope with anxiety,  depression, or other symptoms. Individuals referred for expanded services  were offered a series of up to 12 counseling sessions. New York\u2019s  community-based expanded services for adults ended in December 2003;  its community-based services for children ended in December 2004, as did  the FDNY\u2019s services.", "In November 2006, FEMA and SAMHSA allowed Louisiana and Mississippi  to plan for providing expanded crisis counseling services, known as  \u201cspecialized crisis counseling services,\u201d to supplement CCP services  offered to people affected by Hurricane Katrina. Each state developed and  implemented expanded services based on operating principles developed  by SAMHSA and tailored to the needs of its population. Louisiana and  Mississippi began offering their expanded services in January 2007, about  17 months after the hurricane. In contrast to New York\u2019s series of up to 12  sessions, the expanded services offered by Louisiana and Mississippi were  designed to be delivered in a single stand-alone session by mental health  professionals, although clients could obtain additional sessions. The  states\u2019 CCPs used a standardized assessment and referral process to  determine whether to refer people for expanded services, such as stress  management. Louisiana and Mississippi used providers with prior mental  health training to refer expanded services clients for mental health and  substance abuse treatment services. In addition, the states used  paraprofessionals to link clients with other disaster-related services and  resources, such as financial services, housing, transportation, and child  care. According to a SAMHSA official, Louisiana\u2019s CCP is scheduled to  stop providing expanded services to adults and children in February   2008. Mississippi, which focused on providing expanded services to  adults, stopped providing services in April 2007.", "Several state officials said that it would be beneficial if the CCP model  could be expanded to include more intensive crisis counseling services  and if states could make these types of services available sooner. For  example, several officials told us that if expanded services were a  permanent part of CCP it would enable states responding to catastrophic  disasters to incorporate expanded services at an earlier stage in their CCP  service plans, training programs, and budgets. A New York official told us  that after the state received approval for the general concept of expanded  services, it took the state a few additional months to prepare a proposal,  obtain federal approval, and contract with and train the providers.  Because the state did not begin offering expanded services until it started  phasing down its delivery of traditional CCP services, fewer crisis  counselors were available to refer clients from traditional services to  expanded services. NCPTSD\u2019s 2005 evaluation of CCP for SAMHSA  recommended that, at least on a trial basis, expanded services should  become a well-integrated part of state CCPs that is implemented relatively  early in state programs. NCPTSD also recommended evaluating the  efficacy of such services. FEMA and SAMHSA officials told us that after  completion of Louisiana\u2019s program they planned to examine which  elements of Louisiana\u2019s, Mississippi\u2019s, and New York\u2019s expanded services  programs might be beneficial to incorporate into CCP. FEMA and  SAMHSA officials also said that NCPTSD has begun to develop an  additional approach to providing postdisaster counseling services that  they would also like to examine after it has been developed.

Officials said there was a  constant need to provide staff with training on CCP assessment and  referral techniques to ensure that they could identify people who needed a  referral. In its evaluation of CCP for SAMHSA, NCPTSD also reported  concerns by states related to the ability of paraprofessionals to identify  people needing a referral. According to SAMHSA, a CCP trainer\u2019s toolkit  that was completed in August 2007 includes information on proper  techniques for conducting CCP assessments and referrals. The agency is  planning to distribute the toolkit to states in spring 2008 when it holds a  planned training.", "Officials we spoke to in all six states in our review told us that their CCPs  were constrained by FEMA\u2019s policy of not allowing CCP funds to be used  to provide some case management services. According to CCP guidance,  case management is not typically an allowable program service. Several  state officials told us that it would be beneficial if state CCPs could  provide some form of case management after catastrophic disasters, when  many survivors are likely to have numerous needs and may require  additional support to obtain services necessary for their recovery. State  officials said that Hurricane Katrina highlighted the difficulties that  disaster survivors can have negotiating complex service and support  systems. Louisiana officials said, for example, that many people who  experienced extraordinary levels of stress because of the hurricane had  low literacy skills and clearly needed support to make connections to  additional services and resources. One state official also told us that  because the practical difficulties of meeting needs involving housing can  often be a cause of the emotional distress that CCPs are trying to alleviate,  they would like CCP crisis counselors to be able to more directly help  people connect with disaster-related services to meet these needs.", "State officials also told us that it was difficult to identify people in need of  crisis counseling services because FEMA does not give state CCPs access  to specific information on the location of people registered for federal  disaster assistance. NCPTSD\u2019s evaluation of CCP also noted that the  unavailability of this information made it difficult for state CCPs to locate  people who might need services. Several state officials told us that FEMA  had provided them with some counts of disaster registrants at the state,  county, or Zip Code levels but that they also needed information on the  specific locations of disaster survivors to conduct effective outreach.

While CCP is a key component of the federal  government\u2019s response to the psychological consequences of disasters, we  have identified two important limitations that can affect states\u2019 ability to  use CCP to respond to the special circumstances of catastrophic disasters.  First, state officials responding to the WTC attack and Hurricane Katrina  identified the need to provide expanded crisis counseling services through  CCP. FEMA and SAMHSA recognized such a need when they permitted  three state CCPs to expand their programs to provide more intensive  short-term crisis counseling than the CCP model generally allows. FEMA  and SAMHSA officials told us they intended to consider incorporating  certain types of expanded services into CCP. Promptly determining what  types of expanded services should become a permanent part of CCP  would enable states to more effectively develop their CCP proposals and  provide their populations with needed counseling services in the event of  future catastrophic disasters.", "Second, FEMA\u2019s policy of precluding states and their CCP service  providers from obtaining reimbursement for indirect costs associated with  managing and monitoring their CCPs has made it difficult for states to  effectively administer their CCPs. State officials reported that the lack of  reimbursement for indirect costs made it more difficult to recruit and  retain service providers and contributed to a major contractor\u2019s  withdrawal from Louisiana\u2019s Hurricane Katrina CCP. Other FEMA disaster  response grant programs allow reimbursement for such costs. Although  FEMA had been examining this issue for over a year, an agency official did  not know when the agency would reach a decision on whether to revise  CCP policy to allow coverage of indirect costs. Including indirect costs in  CCP and not requiring service providers to absorb these costs could  expand the pool of providers willing to participate in this program.

HHS stated that the draft report  accurately reflected concerns regarding the exclusion of indirect costs and  that SAMHSA had previously given FEMA a recommendation supporting a  change in this policy. Although DHS and HHS indicated that they are  working on a revision of the policy to allow reimbursement of such costs,  they did not provide a timeline for completing this activity. As our report  notes, FEMA has been examining this issue since 2006, and it is important  to complete this work expeditiously so that in the event of a future  disaster, state CCPs could be in a better position to attract the  participation of a broad array of service providers.", "In response to our recommendation to expeditiously determine what types  of expanded crisis counseling services should be formally incorporated  into CCP, HHS and DHS commented that, as our draft report indicated,  they plan to wait until Louisiana has completed its pilot expanded services  program before making this determination.

We  believe, however, that federal program officials already have a  considerable amount of information about these pilots\u2014New York and  Mississippi have completed their programs and Louisiana has been  providing information on an ongoing basis. We believe that it is important  for FEMA and SAMHSA to expeditiously review the experience of the pilot  programs and other relevant information so they can expeditiously  determine which expanded services should be formally incorporated into  CCP. This will help ensure that states responding to a disaster will be able  to provide the appropriate range of CCP services to assist people who are  in need of crisis counseling services.

We clarified our discussion of  host states\u2019 ability to apply for CCP funds to note that FEMA allowed them  to submit an abbreviated ISP application.

We spoke with researchers  from the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress at the University of  California, Los Angeles, and the National Center for Disaster Preparedness  at Columbia University. We also interviewed officials from national  organizations, including the American Red Cross, National Alliance on  Mental Illness, National Association of State Mental Health Program  Directors, National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Directors, and National Emergency Management Association. In addition,  we reviewed relevant literature.", "We conducted additional work in six judgmentally selected states that had  experience responding to the psychological consequences of three  catastrophic disasters during fiscal years 2002 through 2006 that we  included in our scope: the World Trade Center (WTC) attack in 2001,  Hurricane Charley in 2004, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. We included  New York because it responded to the WTC attack; Florida because it  responded to Hurricane Charley; and Louisiana and Mississippi because  they responded to Hurricane Katrina. We included Texas in our review  because it hosted a large number of people displaced by Hurricane  Katrina, and we included Washington because it hosted people displaced  by Hurricane Katrina and has features, such as large ports, that make it  vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters. Results from this  nongeneralizable sample of six states cannot be used to make inferences  about other states.", "To examine actions by federal agencies to help states prepare for the  psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters, we reviewed key  federal preparedness and response documents\u2014such as the National  Response Plan, the Interim National Preparedness Goal, and FEMA\u2019s  Guide for All-Hazard Emergency Operations Planning\u2014and recent reports  on the federal government\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina. We identified  federal grant programs and other activities that were related to disaster  preparedness and were funded during fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year  2006 by reviewing relevant documents and through discussions with  federal and state officials. For key HHS and DHS preparedness grant  programs, we reviewed relevant documentation, such as application  guidance, and interviewed federal program officials. We obtained disaster  plans for the mental health and substance abuse agencies in the six states  included in our review and examined the plans we received. We also  interviewed mental health and substance abuse officials from these six  states about their preparedness activities. In addition, we examined  SAMHSA\u2019s 2007 report on mental health and substance abuse disaster  plans developed by states that received its preparedness grant.", "To examine states\u2019 experiences in obtaining and using federal Crisis  Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) grants to respond to  the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters, we reviewed  program documentation, including the applicable statute, regulations,  guidance, and grantee reports. We also reviewed CCP applications or  other relevant documentation that the six states submitted to FEMA for  declared counties in response to one of the three catastrophic disasters in  our review. We reviewed documentation to obtain information on states\u2019  experiences in applying for CCP funding and on FEMA\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s  processes for reviewing applications, including examining the length of  time it took the agencies to review applications and make funding  decisions for the selected catastrophic disasters. In addition, we  interviewed state mental health officials from the six states to obtain  additional information on their experiences applying for CCP funding and  implementing their CCPs following these three disasters. We interviewed  FEMA and SAMHSA officials to obtain their perspectives on states\u2019  applications and states\u2019 experiences implementing their CCPs to respond  to catastrophic disasters and to obtain information pertaining to FEMA\u2019s  and SAMHSA\u2019s administration of the program. Furthermore, we examined  the 2005 report on CCP prepared for SAMHSA by NCPTSD.", "To identify other federal programs that have supported mental health and  substance abuse services in response to catastrophic disasters, we  reviewed GAO reports, Congressional Research Service reports, the  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, and pertinent legislation and  program regulations. We interviewed federal program officials about these  programs and obtained available information, including grantee  applications, award data, and reports, to determine how the programs  were used to respond to mental health or substance abuse needs following  the three catastrophic disasters included in our review. We present  information on the use of various federal programs to respond to needs  following the catastrophic disasters in our review; the list we present is  not exhaustive. To determine the amount of Deficit Reduction Act of 2005  funds used by the 32 states that had been approved by CMS for  demonstration projects following Hurricane Katrina, we analyzed data in  CMS\u2019s Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System (MBES), which includes  claims data for health care services, including inpatient mental health care  services. We analyzed MBES claims data available as of June 27, 2007, for  services provided August 24, 2005, or later to eligible people affected by  Hurricane Katrina. To assess the reliability of the MBES data, we  discussed the database with an agency official and conducted electronic  testing of the data for obvious errors in completeness. States submit all  claims data to the system electronically and must attest to the  completeness and accuracy of the data. These data are preliminary in  nature, in that they are subject to further review by CMS and are likely to  be updated as states continue to submit claims for Deficit Reduction Act  funding. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our report.", "We conducted our work from March 2006 through February 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Additional Federal Programs Used to Respond to Psychological Consequences of Catastrophic Disasters", "paragraphs": ["In addition to CCP, federal agencies have used other programs following  catastrophic disasters to help states and localities provide mental health  and substance abuse services to disaster survivors. The following list  presents information on the use of various federal programs to respond to  needs following the catastrophic disasters in our review; it is not an  exhaustive list.", "Federal agencies have used established grant programs to help states  respond to the psychological consequences of catastrophic disasters,  some of which are generally intended to be used following smaller-scale  emergencies.", "SAMHSA awarded funds through its Emergency Response Grant (SERG)  program following Hurricane Katrina. The agency provided a total of  $900,000 to Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to help meet the  overwhelming need for assistance. For example, Texas was awarded  $150,000 and helped evacuees in the Houston Astrodome and other  shelters who needed methadone medication because of opiate addiction.", "The Department of Education awarded funds through its Project School  Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program following the  2001 terrorist attacks and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The agency  provided about $14 million and $7 million following these respective  disasters to help local education agencies respond by providing services  that could include crisis counseling, mental health assessments, and  referrals. For example, following the 2001 terrorist attacks, New York  used Project SERV funds to provide counseling and after-school mental  health services.", "The Department of Justice provided funds through its Antiterrorism and  Emergency Assistance Program to help states and localities respond to  victims\u2019 mental health needs following mass violence and acts of  terrorism. Following the WTC attack, for example, New York used   $5 million of its grant award from the Department of Justice to provide  additional funding to 15 service providers providing crisis counseling  services through the state CCP.", "HHS has also temporarily modified or expanded ongoing federal health  care and social service programs to help states provide mental health and  substance abuse services after specific catastrophic disasters.", "CMS allowed states to temporarily cover certain health care costs  associated with catastrophic disasters through Medicaid and the State  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). For example, following  Hurricane Katrina, the Congress appropriated $2 billion to cover certain  health care costs related to Hurricane Katrina through Medicaid and  SCHIP. CMS allowed 32 states that either were directly affected by the  hurricane or had hosted evacuees to temporarily expand the availability of  coverage for certain people affected by the hurricane. CMS allowed states  to submit claims for reimbursement for health care services that were  provided August 24, 2005, or later. As of June 27, 2007, these states had  submitted claims to CMS for health care services totaling about   $1.7 billion, of which about $15.7 million was for mental health services  provided in inpatient facilities\u2014such as hospitals, nursing homes, and  psychiatric facilities. (See table 2 for information on the amount of claims  submitted by states, including four states that were in our review.)", "HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families awarded $550 million in  supplemental Social Services Block Grant funds following the 2005 Gulf  Coast hurricanes to temporarily expand the program to help 50 states and  the District of Columbia meet social and health care service needs. The  funds could be used for providing case management and counseling,  mental health, and substance abuse services, including medications. States  could also use the funds for the repair, renovation, or construction of  community mental health centers and other health care facilities damaged  by the hurricanes. For example, Mississippi was awarded about   $128 million in supplemental funding and used about $10 million of the  funding in part to restore services to mental health treatment facilities for  adults and children and provide transportation to mental health services.", "Federal agencies also awarded funding outside of these established  programs to help states provide disaster-related mental health and  substance abuse services after specific catastrophic disasters in our  review. Some of these programs focused on specific at-risk groups, such  as disaster responders, while others were established to meet the mental  health needs of broader populations.", "HHS is coordinating federally funded programs for responders to the WTC  disaster\u2014including firefighters, police, other workers or volunteers, and  federal responders\u2014that provide free screening, monitoring, or treatment  services for physical illnesses and psychological problems related to the  disaster. We have previously reported on the progress of these programs.", "SAMHSA provided $28 million to nine states most directly affected by the  September 11 attacks to provide various substance abuse and mental  health services for people directly affected by the attacks. These services  included assessments, individual counseling, group therapy, specialized  substance abuse treatment, and case management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Helene F.
