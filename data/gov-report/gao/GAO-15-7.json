On the other hand, a larger number of satellites may be needed to provide the same level of capability, and the transition from existing system designs could increase costs. Experts agree that decisionmaking would benefit from assessments that look beyond a single satellite program and consider the broad range of potential effects of disaggregation. Benefits and limitations aside, there are longstanding barriers to implementation. For instance, disaggregation could exacerbate delays in the delivery of user equipment and ground systems. As GAO has reported, such delays, tied to management and oversight shortcomings, have resulted in expensive satellites being in orbit for years with limited use.", "DOD is examining whether disaggregation should be used for some of its space systems, but significant uncertainty\u2014including how to quantify a broad range of potential effects\u2014remains.

Moreover, DOD does not have common measures for resilience\u2014a key space system consideration\u2014which may limit the effectiveness of these assessments. Additionally, while technology demonstrations are providing an avenue for gaining knowledge about disaggregation, they have been limited, concentrating more on technical than operational feasibility.

These systems provide the  government with communication methods, critical intelligence information,  weather data, and other capabilities vital to military and civilian agencies  and commercial operations. DOD is rethinking its approach to building  large, complex, multi-mission satellites. As satellites have become more  complex, they have required larger investments of money and time to  develop, produce, and launch. In addition, these satellites face growing  threats from adversary attacks, such as anti-satellite weapons and  communications jamming, to environmental hazards, such as orbital  debris. A single launch failure, on-orbit problem, or adversary attack on  one of these large satellites could result in the loss of billions of dollars of  investment and a significant loss of capability. The time it takes to  develop and construct a complex satellite can also be very lengthy. Some  satellites, which have taken more than a decade to develop, contain  technologies that have become obsolete by the time they are launched.", "To address these challenges, DOD has begun considering alternative  approaches for acquiring space-based capabilities and plans to decide on  an acquisition approach over the next two to three years. One such  approach involves disaggregating, or breaking up, large satellites into  multiple, smaller satellites or payloads.

The size, capability, and complexity of DOD\u2019s satellites have  tended to increase over the years, making them more costly to build. For  example, Milstar, the protected communications satellite that preceded  AEHF, weighed about 10,000 pounds, whereas the AEHF satellite weighs  about 13,600 pounds and provides ten times the communications  capacity. Additionally, SBIRS satellites are more capable than the  Defense Support Program satellites they are to replace, offering greater  sensor sensitivity and supporting a broader set of missions. According to  DOD officials, it has made economic sense to maximize satellite  capabilities as much as launch vehicle constraints would allow to fully  utilize the capacity of the selected launch vehicle\u2014which can cost well  over $100 million for the vehicles DOD primarily uses. Additionally,  certain requirements were consolidated to more efficiently provide  capabilities, that is, fewer but more capable satellites could execute more  missions than in the past.", "This approach of building large, multifunctional satellites also increased  acquisition risks since the design and manufacturing of satellites became  more complex. Total acquisition costs for the AEHF satellite  constellation, for example, have more than doubled, from $6.7 billion at  program inception in 2001 to $14.5 billion currently. This was partially  due to the acquisition of an additional satellite, but also due to technical  challenges and associated schedule delays of about 6 years for the  launch of the first satellite. Our reports over the years have found that the  significant cost and schedule growth for AEHF, SBIRS, and the  environmental satellites DOD was acquiring in a similar fashion were  partly due to design and manufacturing complexity. We also reported  that DOD\u2019s tendency to build large, monolithic satellites limited its ability  to provide capabilities sooner and contributed to higher costs through  developing extensive new designs, custom-made spacecraft, and  payloads to meet the needs of multiple users. At the same time, other  issues drove up costs for these programs including immature  technologies, requirements instability, concurrent development and  production, poor management and oversight, and reduced testing. We  have reported that DOD has taken actions to address many of these  issues, and in recent years, DOD has largely overcome cost and  schedule problems for the programs currently in production, and  additional satellites of the same design are now being launched.", "Reducing acquisition cost and risk are not the only reasons DOD is  considering new approaches. According to Air Force Space Command,  U.S. space systems face intentional and unintentional threats, which have  increased rapidly over the past 20 years. These include radio frequency  interference (including jamming), laser dazzling and blinding, kinetic  intercept vehicles, and ground system attacks. Additionally, the hazards  of the already-harsh space environment (e.g., extreme temperature  fluctuations and radiation) have increased, including numbers of active  and inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, and other fragments and  debris. In response, recent governmentwide and DOD strategic and  policy guidance have stressed the need for U.S. space systems to be  survivable or resilient against such threats.", "According to the Air Force, to maintain protected satellite communications, SBIRS, and space based  environmental monitoring capabilities, new satellites and/or payloads would be needed beginning in  2024, 2025, and 2015, respectively. impacts of decisions could reach far beyond the space segment, affecting  ground control systems, satellite user equipment, and communications  networks.", "While this report is focused on the concept of disaggregation, it is  important to note that DOD officials we spoke with stressed that  disaggregation is only one of a number of approaches DOD is  considering for its future space system designs.

DOD has had limited experience with  disaggregating satellites and is still in the relatively early stages of  quantifying the costs and benefits of disaggregating its satellites. The  potential benefits of disaggregation, such as reduced costs associated  with shorter development cycles and simpler designs, have been  discussed in various Air Force publications. But less has been said about  potential limitations, such as changes that would need to be made to  interconnect systems\u2014such as ground stations, user equipment, and  communications networks\u2014and the investment those changes would  require. Moreover, many potential benefits can also be accompanied by  drawbacks. For instance, with capabilities distributed across multiple  platforms, rather than centralized onto just a few satellites, it may be more  difficult for an adversary to target all assets to attack full system  capabilities. However, with increased numbers of satellites, the space  environment becomes more congested, increasing risk of radio frequency  interference and the potential for on-orbit contact with and damage from  debris or other assets. Given the breadth of impacts disaggregation can  have, it may not be possible to have complete knowledge of its effects.  But experts agree that decisionmaking would benefit from assessments  that look well beyond a single satellite program.", "Further, even if DOD concludes disaggregation would have net positive  effects, there are significant longstanding barriers to implementation. For  instance, our work continues to find that there are time gaps\u2014sometimes  years\u2014in aligning the delivery of satellites with associated user  equipment and ground systems, which means that satellites may be in  orbit for a long time with limited use. Without resolving the leadership,  management, and oversight issues that have led to these delays, time  gaps may well be exacerbated by disaggregation.

Because these potential effects are dependent on  various disaggregation approaches and have not yet been validated in  practice for large, complex space systems, some points may appear to  contradict one another. Further, some potential effects may not be unique  to disaggregation, but may also apply to other changes from the current  approach.

Disaggregation may offer a more affordable approach to providing  capabilities because of the potential for reduced per-satellite costs over  the long term. Acquiring smaller, less complex satellites may require less  time and effort to develop and produce, for example. This may be in part  due to improved requirements discipline, as more frequent production  rates may allow program managers to delay new requirements to the next  production cycle instead of incorporating them into ongoing timelines mid- stream. However, a larger number of small satellites may be needed to  provide the same level of capability overall, and the transition from  existing system designs to disaggregation could increase costs in the  near term. Additionally, given the current budget environment facing  DOD, the transition to a new approach may be cost prohibitive, as  resources may not be available to maintain and operate a legacy system  and develop and field a new system at the same time. Table 1 describes  how affordability could be impacted by disaggregation.", "Another main driver experts cited for examining disaggregation is the  potential for increased resilience\u2014the ability of a system to support the  functions necessary for mission success in spite of hostile action or  adverse conditions, according to one DOD definition\u2014of space systems.  Distributing capabilities across more satellites will increase the number  and diversity of potential targets for an adversary and may make it more  difficult for an adversary to decide which assets to attack, though some  argue an adversary may be more likely to attack disaggregated satellites  because they may be considered lower risk in terms of escalating  hostilities. Potential effects of disaggregation in terms of resilience are  listed in table 2.", "Experts also cite capability\u2014the ability to execute specified actions\u2014as a  key driver for considering disaggregation.

Yet, we have reported that DOD\u2019s culture has generally been  resistant to changes in space acquisition approaches and that fragmented  responsibilities have made it very difficult to coordinate and deliver  interdependent systems. At present, although some improvements in  leadership have been made, there is still no single person or organization  that is held accountable for balancing needs against wants, ensuring  coordination among the many organizations involved with space systems  acquisitions, and ensuring that resources are directed where they are  most needed.

In some cases, gaps in delivery can add up  to years, meaning that a satellite is launched but not effectively used for  years until ground systems become available. One reason DOD has been  unable to align the delivery of space system segments is because  budgeting authority for the segments is spread across the military  services and there is no single authority to ensure programs are funded in  a manner that would align their deliveries. There are other reasons that  have contributed to gaps in the delivery of space system segments,  including poor acquisition management (requirements instability,  underestimation of technical complexity, and poor contractor oversight),  program funding instability, and changing information security  requirements.

In response, we revised our  recommendation to focus on the need for common measures for  resilience. DOD stated it is beginning to implement resilience measures  into space systems requirements and acquisition processes, and that it  agrees the development of metrics to measure space system resilience is  needed.", "In partially concurring with our third recommendation, DOD agreed that  disaggregation requires continued analysis as one method of providing  increased space system resilience and emphasized that disaggregation is  just one approach. DOD stated the challenges of a disaggregated ground  system are well-known and demonstrated in existing architectures.  However, our work found that multiple stakeholders\u2014including DOD  officials\u2014are concerned about the unknown impacts of disaggregation on  ground systems, such as whether existing systems could support it.  Further assessment of the potential effects on the ground system\u2014 including how interconnected systems could be impacted and whether  changes would be needed\u2014will be necessary to ensure DOD has a  complete understanding of the challenges it may face. DOD also stated it  is well-versed in managing constellations with many satellites and  networks with diverse users. However, disaggregation, depending on how  it is carried out, could represent a significant departure from DOD\u2019s  current space system architectures, operational experience, as well as  acquisition strategy and oversight. Consequently, we continue to maintain  that gaining experience on the operational feasibility of disaggregation  through expanded demonstrations could provide DOD with valuable  knowledge for deciding a way forward for its space system acquisitions.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Secretary of Defense.

Outside of DOD, we met with government officials from the  Department of Commerce, including the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration. We also interviewed representatives from contractors  representing work in a range of mission areas (e.g., satellite  communications, weather monitoring, etc.), product and service types  (e.g., building satellites, integrating systems, etc.), and level of  involvement in military space systems within the scope of our review. In  addition, we spoke with third-party organizations such as non-profit  research and industry organizations. Based on these document reviews  and discussions, we compiled a list of potential benefits and limitations  that experts determined to be important factors for consideration  regarding disaggregation and subsequently verified the list with those  experts. Each of the potential benefits and limitations identified in our  report are supported by statements from at least two experts, generally  representing multiple types of organizations (i.e., DOD, civilian agency,  industry, and third-party). Further, we reviewed prior GAO work to  determine if longstanding space system acquisition challenges pose  potential barriers to implementing a disaggregated approach.", "To assess the extent to which DOD is ready to make informed decisions  regarding disaggregating AEHF, SBIRS, and WSF, we reviewed prior  GAO work on DOD space systems acquisitions and identified criteria for  early acquisition planning and development efforts to minimize cost and  schedule growth.
