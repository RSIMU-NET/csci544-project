To help achieve these goals, recipients are to report every 3 months on their award activities and expected outcomes, among other things. This information is available on Recovery.gov, the government's official Recovery Act Web site. As requested, this report covers 11 federal programs focused on broadband, energy, transportation, federal buildings, and civil works activities, representing $67 billion in Recovery Act funding. Primarily, the report (1) describes how the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies implemented the act to report funds' uses and (2) assesses the extent to which descriptions of awards meet GAO's transparency criteria. It also describes reported uses of funds for the 11 programs. GAO reviewed requirements for reporting in the act and OMB's guidance. Based on these requirements, GAO developed a transparency assessment and applied it to a probability sample of descriptions from 14,089 recipient reports. In addition, GAO reviewed 52 projects in detail in states that it had contacted as part of its bimonthly reviews and interviewed federal, state, and local officials about their experiences with reporting descriptions of awards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["This report focuses on one aspect of transparency and accountability: the extent to which descriptions of awards found on Recovery.gov foster a basic understanding of award activities and expected outcomes. Section 1512 of the act created broad requirements for recipient reporting. The act does not further explain these requirements. To implement the act, OMB provided generic guidance instructing recipients to report narrative information, among other things, that captures the overall purpose of the award and expected results. GAO estimates that, for the nine programs with funds awarded by December 31, 2009, 25 percent of the descriptions met its transparency criteria; that is, they had sufficiently clear and complete information on the award's purpose, scope and nature of activities, location, cost, outcomes, and status of work. Two factors may have influenced what GAO found. First, GAO's results were somewhat more positive for programs in which the federal agencies provided program-specific materials that supplemented OMB's guidance with detailed information on what recipients should include in the narrative fields. The highway, transit, and geothermal programs that GAO reviewed tended to have more transparent descriptions compared with programs that only supplied general guidance. Second, officials in many programs told GAO that they did not typically include the narrative fields in their data quality reviews. While an estimated three-quarters of the recipient-reported information did not fully meet GAO's transparency criteria--thus potentially hampering understanding of what is being achieved with Recovery Act funding--GAO found that federal and state Recovery Act Web sites, in some cases, provided additional information that could aid the public in understanding what its tax dollars are being spent on and what outcomes are expected. GAO collected information on the reported uses of funds from federal agencies for the 11 programs it reviewed. These uses ranged from improving infrastructure to improving Internet access. Agencies have obligated program funds at different rates, which may be due, in part, to whether the programs were new, existing, or received sizable funding increases. GAO also asked the federal agencies and selected state agencies in its review about how they make Recovery Act project information available to the public and what feedback they have received. Each agency has established a Recovery Act Web site, as have states, some state auditors and Inspectors General, and some recipients. These sites contain varying amounts of information, such as program objectives, lists of projects, and interactive maps."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To further public understanding of what Recovery Act funds are being spent on and the expected results, GAO recommends that the Director, OMB, (1) revise the agency's recipient reporting guidance to remedy the unclear examples and enhance instructions for completing narrative fields; (2) work with agencies to determine whether supplemental guidance is needed to meet the intent of the act and whether that supplemental guidance or other technical assistance proposed by agencies dealing with narrative descriptions of awards provides for transparent descriptions of funded activities; and (3) periodically review, in partnership with federal agencies, the recipients' descriptions of awards to determine whether the information provides a basic understanding of the uses of the funds and expected outcomes, and, if not, encourage agencies to develop or improve program-specific guidance, as well as work with the Recovery Board as the board reviews the results of agencies' data quality reviews to further reinforce actions to meet transparency goals. In commenting on a draft of this report, OMB agreed with GAO's recommendations. OMB and the federal agencies provided a number of specific comments, many of which GAO incorporated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) was  enacted to (1) help preserve jobs and promote economic recovery from the  current economic recession, (2) invest in technology to spur technological  advances, and (3) invest in infrastructure to provide long-term economic  benefits, among other things. The act was a massive response to the  economic crisis; the cost of that response is now estimated at about $862  billion in funding and tax provisions. It is expected that the act will be  carried out with an unprecedented level of transparency, so that the public  can see how its money is being spent and what is being achieved.", "Both Members of Congress and the President have emphasized the need for  accountability, efficiency, and transparency in the expenditure of Recovery  Act funds and have made it a central principle of the act. As Congress  finished work on the act, the House Appropriations Committee released a  statement saying, \u201cA historic level of transparency, oversight and  accountability will help guarantee taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and  Americans can see results for their investment.\u201d To do so, Congress built  into the act numerous provisions to increase transparency and  accountability over spending that require recipients of Recovery Act  funding to report quarterly on a number of measures, as contained in  section 1512 of the act. Nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funded  grants, contracts, or loans are required to submit reports with information  on each project or activity, including descriptive information on the uses of  Recovery Act awards. In addition, the act called for the establishment of a  Web site through which the public could gain easy access to recipient- and  agency-reported information on Recovery Act spending. Through  Recovery.gov, the government\u2019s official Web site, users can search the site a  number of different ways for information about individual Recovery Act  awards in their neighborhood and throughout the country, as well as for  summary information.

We met with officials from those  agencies to gain an understanding of these requirements.", "To assess the extent to which descriptions of awards transparently  described how funds were being used, we developed a transparency  assessment (described later in this report) based on the Recovery Act;  OMB\u2019s guidance, including OMB\u2019s Recipient Reporting Data Model; the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act; and professional  judgment. Based on these considerations, we considered descriptions of  awards transparent if they conveyed, in a manner understandable to the  general public, a basic understanding of the activities to be carried out and  the expected outcomes. This effort was meant to be an assessment of  transparency only with regard to the aspects we reviewed, not to  Recovery.gov as a whole or to the administration\u2019s efforts to make this  information available frequently and in a timely manner.", "In assessing transparency, we took probability (random) samples of 467 of  the 14,089 prime recipient award records on Recovery.gov as of February  10, 2010, from 9 of the 11 programs listed above. Prime recipients are  nonfederal entities that receive Recovery Act funding as awards in the form  of contracts, grants, or loans directly from the federal government. In  order to determine which records to sample from Recovery.gov, we used  the definition of an \u201caward\u201d\u2014the prime recipient\u2019s record for a contract,  grant, or loan\u2014as defined by OMB and the Recovery Board for the  purposes of recipient reporting. We selected 12 key fields required for  recipient reporting that describe the uses of Recovery Act funds, including  3 narrative fields. To apply this general definition to award information\u2014 hereafter referred to as descriptions of awards or descriptions\u2014we used  the following specific attributes that were either explicitly stated or  inherent in the Recovery Act or OMB\u2019s guidance:   general purpose of the award (e.g., construction or fire protection);  nature of activities being conducted (e.g., dredging waterways or  installing security cameras);  location (where award activities are being conducted);  cost (amount awarded);  status (percentage complete); and  outcome (what is expected to be achieved; e.g., increased safety or  reduced congestion as a result of a redesigned highway intersection or  increased energy efficiency from the installation of a new heating,  ventilation, and air conditioning system).", "To these six specific attributes, we used our professional judgment to add a  seventh that in our view, was needed to provide a complete description:  scope (i.e., information on the magnitude or extensiveness of an award).  For example, scope could be the number of homes to be weatherized  statewide or the number of miles (or lane miles) of a road to be repaved.  Using these seven attributes and our professional judgment, we assessed  information in the 12 data fields collectively, for understandability, clarity,  and completeness. Two analysts independently reviewed information on  each award from the 12 fields and then compared results to reach a  consensus on the overall score (e.g., met the transparency criteria). If they  could not agree, a third analyst reviewed the award information without  regard to the original determinations and made a deciding assessment.  Those that were understandable, clear, and complete we considered to be  \u201ctransparent.\u201d For those that were not fully transparent, we searched  publicly available information from federal, state, and recipient Web sites,  and reviewed publicly available documents to complete the descriptions.", "We also reviewed in-depth 52 judgmentally selected energy and  infrastructure awards in five programs, primarily from programs that are  already covered as part of our bimonthly reviews on Recovery Act  spending: Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, Weatherization  Assistance Program, Grants-in-Aid for Airports, Highway Infrastructure  Investment, and Transit Capital Assistance. For these awards, we spoke  with federal, state, and local officials responsible for developing or  reviewing award information about federal transparency requirements and  any feedback that they have received on these awards from the public, and  assessed the accuracy of select information from source documents (such  as award documents).", "In addition to the review described above, we discussed with federal and  state officials how they make information on awards available to the  public. We also gathered information on the nature and scope of awards (or  potential awards) for the 11 programs by reviewing documentation  supplied by the federal agencies and discussing the programs with agency  officials. (See apps. I-XI for this information.)   Finally, for the nine  programs with recipient reports at the time of our review, we (1) performed  a number of electronic edit checks on the awards for the prime recipients,  including any associated subrecipients, in our probability sample to  determine whether there were possible anomalies in the award information  and (2) discussed with federal agencies and reviewed federal Inspectors  General efforts to ensure the reliability of the data reported by recipients.  (See app XII.)", "We did not assess how federal agencies or prime recipients selected the  awards discussed in this report to ensure that the awards met the purposes  of the act or whether the awards met the act\u2019s eligibility requirements. We  conducted this performance audit from September 2009 through May 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

To implement these  requirements, OMB worked with the Recovery Board to deploy a  nationwide system at FederalReporting.gov for collecting data submitted  by the recipients of funds. OMB set the specific timeline for recipients to  submit reports and for agencies to review the data. Recipients are required  to submit the reports in the month after the close of a quarter, and, by the  end of the month, the reports are to be reviewed by federal agencies for  significant errors and missing information before being posted to  Recovery.gov. For the programs discussed in this report, information was  submitted by recipients for the quarter ending December 31, 2009 (second  round reporting) and posted on Recovery.gov on January 30, 2010.", "While OMB\u2019s role was to provide governmentwide guidance, one of the  functions of the Recovery Board was to establish the Web site and to  publish a variety of data, including recipient data once it was reviewed by  the federal agencies. These data, collected through  www.FederalReporting.gov, are made available to the public for viewing  and downloading on www.Recovery.gov. The Recovery Act set a  demanding schedule for implementing Recovery.gov, requiring the  Recovery Board to establish the Web site within 30 days. The Recovery  Board\u2019s goals for this Web site were to promote accountability by providing  a platform to analyze Recovery Act data and serving as a means of tracking  fraud, waste, and abuse allegations by providing the public with accurate,  user-friendly information.", "This was an extensive undertaking across the federal government. OMB,  the Recovery Board, and federal agencies, among others, worked to design  a Web site, develop the capability to handle tens of thousands of  submissions, develop guidance on reporting, and assist recipients in  meeting reporting requirements. More specifically, within a short period of  time, OMB and the Recovery Board implemented a recipient reporting  system that covered a wide-range of programs and provided detailed and  up-to-date information on the use of Recovery Act funds. Our fieldwork  and initial review and analysis of recipient data from www.Recovery.gov  indicated that there was a range of significant reporting and quality issues  that needed to be addressed, including issues with interpretations of  reporting guidance. OMB told us that achieving the promised degree of  transparency will be an iterative process, during which the reporting  process and submitted information will improve.", "The Recovery Act required recipients to report specific information,  including descriptive information on each award, which we discuss further  in the following section. In the accountability and transparency section of  the act, transparency is not specifically defined. However, the act requires  that the award information on Recovery.gov be made available to enhance  public awareness of the use of funds. Furthermore, both Members of  Congress and the President have asserted the need for accountability,  efficiency, and transparency in Recovery Act spending, with the  administration pledging that the Recovery Act would \u201cbreak from  conventional Washington approaches to spending by ensuring that public  dollars are invested effectively and that the economic recovery package is  fully transparent and accountable to the American people.\u201d Thus, the  transparency of award information on Recovery.gov, particularly in  narrative fields (the focus of this review) is particularly important.", "For this report, we reviewed the 11 energy and infrastructure programs  introduced previously.

Specifically, starting for the period ending  September 30, 2009 (and repeated for the quarter ending December 31),  OMB\u2019s reporting instructions for the Recipient Reporting Data Model  specified that recipients would provide, among other things,  the project name, which should be brief and descriptive;   a project description that captures the overall purpose of the award and  expected outputs and outcomes or results;  an award description that describes the overall purpose, expected  outputs, and outcomes or results of the award, including significant  deliverables and, if appropriate, units of measure;   the project status, which was specified as not started, less than 50  percent complete, completed 50 percent or more, or complete;   an activity description, which categorizes projects and activities; the amount of the award; and   the primary place of performance, which is the physical location of  award activities.", "Three of these fields\u2014project name, project description, and award  description\u2014are narrative fields. OMB\u2019s Recipient Reporting Data Model  does not specifically address the clarity of such descriptions, although  OMB, in its December 2009 guidance to heads of executive departments  and agencies, has stated that the narrative information must be sufficiently  clear to facilitate understanding by the general public.", "Several of these fields are defined in ways that are inconsistent with  reporting award project and activity information as required by the  Recovery Act. Where, for example, funds are awarded using a single award  to cover multiple projects, requiring a project description that captures the  overall purpose of the award is not consistent with the requirement in the  act to report a detailed list of all projects and activities each having its own  name, description, completion status, and potential outcomes. Requiring  that status, outcomes, or other information covered be reported in single  fields on an award-by-award rather than a project-by-project or activity-by- activity basis may convey an incomplete impression if multiple projects or  activities are being included. Officials from OMB agreed with this  assessment but said that the agency, in creating its guidance and reporting  data model, weighed the level of reporting detail required against the  potential reporting burden.", "OMB created the guidance to require general information that could be  applied broadly across a wide range of recipients. OMB defined the three  narrative fields to solicit high-level information that is not overly specific to  a single program. In this regard, the guidance had to be applicable to  awards that  are for discrete activities at a single location and for a single purpose.", "For example, under the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s (FHWA)  Highway Infrastructure Investment program, an award might be for a  single project to widen a section of a road or to replace a substandard  bridge.  bundle several discrete activities at different locations. For example,  under the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) Transit Capital  Assistance Program, a transit agency could receive an award that has  different purposes at different locations.  are like block grants in which recipients (i.e., states, territories, and  tribes) receive funds for a broad purpose and make subawards to local  entities, which then decide the specific uses for which funds are to be  spent. For example, under the Department of Energy\u2019s Weatherization  Assistance Program, recipients receive funding to enable low-income  families to reduce their energy bills by making energy-efficiency  improvements to their homes. In turn, the recipients provide grant funds  to a number of local agencies to actually carry out the purposes of the  program, which might involve modernizing heating equipment in one  home and installing insulation in another.  are components of a larger project, but are not linked to the larger  project for reporting purposes. For example, under the Civil Works  Program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) may enter into a  contract (the award) with one company to dredge a river channel and  with another company to build a seawall, all for the purpose of  improving navigable waters at a specific location. Each recipient reports  on the activities conducted under the individual award but not the  overall project being funded as each recipient works on only a piece of  the larger project.", "OMB officials also told us the agency created generic reporting guidance  because they expected the guidance to be a baseline, with agencies  providing supplemental guidance that was more specific to unique program  characteristics and situations that OMB\u2019s one-size-fits-all guidance could  not effectively address. According to OMB, the agencies would be better  sources of program-specific individualized guidance, tailored to the awards  made under their programs. As discussed in the next section of this report,  most agencies included in our review did provide some type of technical  assistance or supplemental materials to aid recipients in reporting.  However, most did not develop formal, program-specific supplemental  guidance that was approved by OMB, and OMB did not require agencies to  do so. For agencies that do develop program-specific supplemental  guidance, OMB officials told us that they primarily review this guidance for  consistency with their agency\u2019s general guidance, and review the  supplemental guidance to ensure its overall sufficiency. OMB officials did  not indicate if their review includes whether agencies developed guidance  on their narrative fields. Also, while OMB reviews formal guidance, it does  not monitor other forms of agency supplemental material or technical  assistance provided to recipients. (See apps. I-XI for additional information  on the agencies\u2019 reporting assistance and its possible effects on the  transparency of descriptions).", "OMB continues to update its guidance based on lessons learned from early  reporting experiences, recognizing that the reporting process is a work in  progress. For example, OMB clarified its guidance on calculating jobs  created or retained to address issues with the jobs data reported by  recipients during the first reporting round. During the course of our review,  OMB officials signaled that they are willing to revise their guidance should  our assessment or other input suggest that changes are needed, but would  need to balance any changes in guidance against additional reporting  burdens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB\u2019s Guidance on Narrative Fields Was Not Clear", "paragraphs": ["We found two instances in which OMB\u2019s guidance on narrative fields was  unclear. First, for the award description field, the guidance provided that  recipients of grants should describe the overall purpose of the award;  recipients of contracts should provide a description of the overall purpose  and expected outcomes including significant deliverables. OMB provided  three examples of how to fill in the field, at least two of which do not  conform to OMB\u2019s expectations: \u201ccommunity development\u201d and \u201cspecial  education \u2013 part B/preschool.\u201d These examples provide only high-level  titles but do not identify the purpose or outcomes. Furthermore, OMB  allowed recipients to enter descriptions of up to 4,000 characters, providing  space for more robust descriptions. As a result, based on our assessment of  award descriptions, recipients are reporting widely varying types of  information in this field\u2014some of it very detailed, while other reporting is  quite limited and uninformative. This issue is discussed more fully in the  following section and can be seen in award information from Recovery.gov  that we reproduced in appendixes I through XI.", "Second, for the quarterly activities/project description field, OMB  instructed grantees to provide a description of the overall purpose and  expected outputs and outcomes or results of the award. As mentioned,  project description, as that term is used in the act, refers to listed projects  or activities, not awards. Instead, OMB's guidance anticipated that, for  contracts, recipients were supposed to provide a description of all  significant services or supplies delivered in the current calendar quarter.  The example OMB provided in its Recipient Reporting Data Model,  \u201cPowers and Gold Beach Ranger Districts Curry County OR Has Fuels Item  1 Chetco Area and Item 3 \u2013 Powers Area\u201d is, in our opinion, unclear, and it  does not meet the general requirements that OMB laid out.", "As discussed in the next section, the inconsistency and lack of clarity in  OMB\u2019s guidance may have contributed to the level of transparency in some  of the award description information that we reviewed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Quarter of the Descriptions of Awards Provide Sufficient Information for Transparency; Some Additional Information Is Publicly Available for Those That Did Not", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that about a quarter of the awards on Recovery.gov for the  nine programs we reviewed were transparent\u2014that is, had sufficiently  clear and understandable information on the award\u2019s purpose, scope,  location, cost, nature of activities, outcomes, and status of work.

We also considered the extent to which  information in the fields was clear and understandable. We drew a  probability (simple random) sample of prime recipient awards to review  for each of the nine energy and infrastructure programs that had awards in  Recovery.gov for the second round of recipient reporting and compared the  descriptions of these awards to our transparency criteria.

Importantly, the descriptions of awards that  partially met our transparency criteria varied widely. Some of these award  descriptions had much of the information needed to make them  transparent, but might be missing one important aspect, such as the  expected outcomes. Other descriptions contained much less information  and provided sufficient detail to meet only a few attributes of our criteria,  such as purpose and location. Finally, an estimated 7 percent of the  descriptions provided little or no information on nature, scope, purpose,  location, or outcomes of the award.", "Recipient-reported information varied widely in its transparency. For  example, a Napa, California, transit recipient provided clear information in  sufficient detail for the general public to understand the award\u2019s purpose,  scope, location, cost, nature of activities, outcomes, and status of work.  Specifically, the description of the award states that it will be used to  purchase four hybrid buses and construct a multimodal park-and-ride  facility and, as a result, the transit fleet will be modernized, and the park- and-ride facility will allow hundreds of commuters to make more efficient,  safe, and timely transit connections. (See table 3.) Thus, we determined  that this description met our transparency criteria.", "Other recipient-reported information was less transparent and partially met  our transparency criteria. For example, a weatherization program  description for the Commonwealth of Virginia partially met our  transparency criteria because it contained some, but not all of the  attributes needed to make the use of funds transparent to the public. (See  table 4.) For example, the description did not provide information on the  scope of the award because it did not indicate how many homes would be  weatherized in the state. From publicly available information on other  federal and state Web sites, we found information that would have made  this description more complete. Specifically, we found that approximately  9,193 homes throughout the state of Virginia will undergo weatherization  activities such as tests for carbon monoxide, heating/cooling equipment  inspection and repair, domestic water heater insulation, and refrigerator  and stove replacement.

Although OMB  initially focused on quickly designing a reporting system that covered a vast  array of Recovery Act programs delivered in different ways, now that such  requirements are largely in place, OMB can begin focusing on other  important aspects of its transparency efforts. Specifically, ensuring that the  narrative portions of Recovery.gov award descriptions prepared by  recipients are understandable is an important aspect of OMB\u2019s  transparency effort. These descriptions provide a key mechanism through  which the public can understand clearly how their tax dollars are being  spent and what is likely to be achieved from these expenditures.", "Looking forward, OMB has an opportunity to improve the transparency of  the recipient-reported narrative information on Recovery.gov by revising its  guidance to remedy the problems we found. Assuredly, the more difficult  task is having tens of thousands of recipients follow this guidance and  report on their awards in a way intended by the act and the administration.  In our view, one promising approach is for OMB to work with the executive  departments and agencies that seek to provide supplemental guidance on  narrative description information. In doing so, OMB can use its central  position to further mission agencies' efforts to tailor resulting guidance to  their individual situations in a way that furthers the transparency goals  discussed in this report. A second approach is for OMB, in partnership with  federal agencies, to periodically review the descriptions of awards  submitted by recipients and to work with the Recovery Board on the  board\u2019s assessments of agencies\u2019 data quality reviews to gain a sense of  whether the information reported is meeting the administration\u2019s  expectations.", "We are not making recommendations to individual agencies at this time  because we believe that there are actions that OMB can take which may  lead to substantial improvements in recipient reporting of narrative  information.

Third, OMB officials  suggested that we state more clearly that we assessed the transparency of  award information collectively\u2014that is, from reviewing the 12 data fields  as a whole rather than from looking at the information contained in each  field individually\u2014since some information that might not appear in one  data field could show up in another field.

This project, conducted on behalf of the State of Illinois, seeks to employ GIS  toolsets and experienced personnel to deliver comprehensive broadband mapping data,  develop state-level broadband maps, aid in the development and maintenance of a national  broadband map, and fund statewide initiatives directed at broadband planning, in a manner  compliant with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration?s (NTIA)  Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for the State Broadband Data and Development Grant  Program. The ensuing deliverables will include datasets as required by the NTIA as well as  web-based, interactive broadband maps to inform state and local government officials,  consumers, broadband providers, community development organizations, researchers, and  other stakeholders. This interactive web site (www.ConnectIllinois.org) will be critical to  ensure accessibility of the broadband data, but it will also be key to increasing awareness of  the mapping program and the benefit of broadband. It will also play an important role in  ensuring local verification of the mapping data. Data will be compiled directly from network  providers with protection to the proprietary aspects of that data provided by non-disclosure  agreements. Connect Illinois partner Connected Nation will utilize the value of long-standing  relationships with providers to negotiate the non-disclosure agreements, receive datasets  from individual providers, develop comprehensive datasets of Illinois providers of all  platforms excluding satellite, then incorporating those datasets into informative GIS mapping  that will be the first of its kind in Illinois. The end product of the mapping activities will be that  of a highly interactive and accessible mapping suite called BroadbandSTAT. This product will  allow easily functional search activity at street levels and will be combined with U.S. Census  and research data to provide users with the ability to drill down to neighborhoods, see which  companies provide service in their areas, determine the density of households and  populations, and county-level adoption rates. Also of great value will be the collection of  datasets reflecting the presence of community anchor institutions throughout the state.  Teams are already at work identifying the locations of various health care providers, K-12  schools, public and private colleges and universities, public safety answering points  (PSAP?s), fire departments, police departments, and ambulance services, and, to the extent  permissible, other local emergency services agencies. Community anchor institution data,  including connectivity information, will be submitted as datasets to NTIA, but it will also be  overlaid within a mapping context to create a remarkable graphic depiction of the locations of  these critical connection points from a statewide to a local level. Community anchor  institutions tend to be key junctures in the development of telecommunications systems  nodes that provide greater access to households and businesses in unserved and  underserved areas. Lastly, SBDD funding under this award will provide for five years of  planning activities that relate to the consistent and steady communication of the  ?messages? of the mapping products throughout the state, including instruction on the use  of the mapping tools. Through strategic relationships with various organizations including the  Illinois Resource Network, the Governor?s Broadband Deployment Council, the Illinois  Library Association, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, and  the Connect Illinois Broadband Resource Development Council, this project envisions a  steady flow of communication and information that will ensure full statewide penetration of  awareness of the mapping artifacts and how to employ them at their best and highest uses.", "Teams are already at work identifying the locations of various health care providers, K-12  schools, public and private colleges and universities, public safety answering points  (PSAP?s), fire departments, police departments, and ambulance services, and, to the extent  permissible, other local emergency services agencies.

The objectives of this project are to (1) improve image resolution for  fracture detection, (2) image the flow in the fractures with super-resolution imaging, and (3)  quantify fluid flow and temperature changes during and after stimulation. This research will  provide vastly improved, high-resolution images of pre-existing and created fractures and fluid  flow in EGS reservoirs. Focusing on the data available from short term-stimulation treatments,  while developing imaging and modeling technology of importance to the long-term operation  of an EGS system, we will integrate LANL?s and NETL?s unique capabilities in seismic  imaging, fluid flow modeling, and laboratory measurements. ? Develop a super-resolution,  seismic imaging method for imaging fractures and fluid flow using time-lapse  microearthquake (MEQ) and vertical seismic profiling data. ? Improve fracture and flow  imaging using MEQ and double-difference tomography. ?

Typically, the  use of microseismic data has been restricted to mapping gross flow paths affected by  stimulation.

Reservoir simulation software has evolved in the  past decades to a point where complete reservoirs can be efficiently simulated with a single  model. Thermal hydrologic mechanical (THM) software has also progressed to the point  where large scale simulations including fluid flow, heat transfer, and stress changes can be  made. This capability allows ground displacement measurements and micro earthquake  (MEQ) analysis to be used to calibrate and constrain reservoir models and thereby help  predict future field behavior. In the THM modeling of geothermal reservoirs, relating the  fracture permeability to fracture aperture and fracture aperture to changes in stress or  displacement is the key to realistic and efficient computations. We surveyed the literature and  found several conceptualizations of permeability-aperture-stress relationships. We like a  paper by Bai et. al. (Rock. Mech. Rock Engng., 32, 195-219, 1999) because it can represent  compressive, tensile, and shear stresses. We converted this to a displacement formulation  and added a thermal stress term. We are testing the model on grids we developed for this  purpose. In addition, we met and discussed with our collaborators at Berkeley Lab,  GeothermEx, and Ormat: one meeting at LBNL and another at San Francisco during the AGU  meeting.

For the Recovery Act, FHWA created a new database called  the Recovery Act Data System (RADS) to help fulfill Recovery Act  reporting requirements.  In addition to oversight and agency reporting  requirements, highway recipients\u2014state highway departments\u2014can use  RADS to complete their recipient reports. RADS information, including  descriptive information, can be uploaded by recipients into  FederalReporting.gov. FHWA officials told us that highway recipients can  also use RADS information to check the accuracy of their own state  highway award data before submitting the data as part of their recipient  reports. Several highway recipients we interviewed said they relied heavily  on FWHA guidance, specifically RADS guidance, to fulfill their recipient  reporting requirements.", "RADS includes several data fields to describe highway awards, including  one specifically designed to provide descriptions more understandable to  the public. After a state certifies a highway project, the highway recipient  submits descriptive information to the database.  FHWA\u2019s guidance for  RADS provides specific instructions on this information; for example, the  project name data field in RADS should be consistent with the name used  in state planning documents. In fall 2009, FHWA added a narrative field to  RADS to describe awards in plain terms to facilitate public understanding.  FHWA division offices in each state were tasked with submitting this  information to RADS. In several cases, state highway department officials  we spoke to helped division offices generate this information. Colorado  and Ohio state highway officials, for example, told us they generated the  information from various sources, such as state databases and project  managers.", "In some cases, the addition of this plain-language description field in RADS  may have improved the narrative information in recipient reports to make  it more understandable for the second reporting round. For state highway  recipients that used RADS data to complete recipient reports, the new  RADS description field was reported on Recovery.gov.  The Ohio highway  department submits RADS data to fulfill its reporting requirement, and for  one pavement improvement project in Ohio, the narrative information  changed between reporting rounds as follows:  First round project description:  \u201cIt is proposed to widen SR104 from  US35 to the new relocated SR207 by adding additional thru traffic lanes  and a center turn lane.

The project consists of widening approximately three miles  of roadway from two to four lanes. It also provides for adding traffic  signals at two intersections, the rerouting of Pleasant Valley Road and  the upgrading of entrances to the two state prisons located on the route.  One of the signals will serve Moundsville Road, a main artery for Union  Scioto Schools and one of the largest districts in the county; the other  signal will serve Gateway Industrial Park.\u201d", "As state highway recipients can choose whether to use RADS data for  recipient reporting, the addition of this plain-language description field will  not affect all highway recipient reports. Moreover, FHWA is still working to  gather plain-language descriptions in all states. FHWA officials told us they  regularly check that the new field in RADS contains information for each  award and subsequently work with FHWA division officials in each state to  get the necessary information when it is missing.", "Because of the fluid nature of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) guidance, FHWA officials told us that aligning their agency\u2019s  supplemental guidance with OMB\u2019s has been a challenging process.  However, FHWA officials said communication with OMB has improved  over time. During the first two reporting rounds, FHWA worked with OMB  to revise its guidance in response to concerns over the agency\u2019s definitions  for the award amount fields, including amounts received and expended.  However, OMB did not provide formal approval of this guidance. For the  third reporting round, FHWA officials told us they did receive written  approval for FHWA\u2019s supplemental guidance, after again working with OMB  to address problems with the award amount fields, though it took 2 to 3  months to finalize and gain approval of this guidance.", "In addition to the RADS database and guidance, FHWA provided other  reporting assistance to recipients. First, FHWA held webconferences for  recipients prior to the second reporting round. FHWA also provided  targeted assistance to state highway recipients to discuss specific problems  or concerns with recipient reporting.", "Some state-specific factors may also have affected the transparency of  recipient-reported information. For the state\u2019s transparency Web site, the  Massachusetts Recovery and Reinvestment Office required the state  highway department to write detailed descriptions understandable to the  public. Massachusetts highway officials told us that creating these  descriptions was time-consuming for the first round of reporting but that  descriptions did not change for second round of reporting. In Georgia, the  state highway department typically develops both a short and an extended  description for a highway project. According to Georgia highway officials,  the extended descriptions are written in nontechnical terms and include  details beyond the project\u2019s name and location. Georgia officials told us  they used these extended descriptions in FHWA\u2019s RADS database and used  them to fulfill recipient reporting requirements.", "Regarding award location, several recipients we interviewed said they  experienced problems entering information into FederalReporting.gov.   Recipients faced difficulty entering zip code and congressional district  information for awards. While highway projects can occur in more than  one locality or congressional district, FederalReporting.gov allows only  one zip code and congressional district per award. In these cases, highway  officials in Colorado and Pennsylvania told us that multiple entries for  location would be useful. In Pennsylvania, for example, a project to  construct curb ramps compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act in  Chester County spanned two congressional districts, forcing the state  department of transportation to select a single zip code\u2014the geocenter of  the county\u2014and one congressional district\u2014the lowest number\u2014to report  for the award."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Ways Award Information Is Made Available to the Public", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Transportation and FHWA make highway award  information available to the public in several forms.

In Massachusetts, for example, the state highway Web site made  award information available through an interactive map. Other state  highway departments provided more extensive award information. For  most Recovery Act awards to the state, the Ohio highway department  provides cost, location, and status information, as well as a description and  photos. For highway awards administered at the local level, some localities  also used Web sites and other tools to promote award information.

As they  have no data for comparison, FHWA officials told us that they could not  determine whether Recovery Act awards received more public feedback  than regular awards. Based on their experience, public feedback on the  Recovery Act often involves requests for a definition of a transportation  enhancement and an explanation for why it is included in a highway  program. At the recipient level, state highway departments experienced  varying levels of feedback from the public and the media. Massachusetts  highway officials told us they were surprised at the level of inquiry received  on the Recovery Act. By contrast, New Jersey and Colorado highway  officials said they had received little public feedback on Recovery Act  awards. According to Colorado officials, the state highway department has  not had to respond to many inquiries, since award information is available  on the department\u2019s Web site. At the local level, officials from the City of  Olmsted Falls in Ohio told us that they had received both positive and  negative comments on the bridge project.

Finally, Corps headquarters officials told us that  the Recovery.gov system was designed for reporting on grants and loans  and was adapted for contracts; therefore, it may have been difficult for  recipients to report certain information.  For example, certain contract  actions such as modifications to existing contracts or task orders\u2014which  can include multiple activities across multiple locations\u2014are reported in  the system as a single award, and recipients may have been unsure how to  indicate this information when reporting.

The objectives  of the project are as follows: 1. To enhance the capability of the Corps of Engineers offices  nationwide to make well informed decisions for managing reservoirs and water control  systems. This will be achieved by expanding, at an accelerated pace, the availability of  advanced information technology resources for hydrometeorological data management,  display, and dissemination; watershed runoff forecasting; flood stage prediction; reservoir  operation analysis; and flood impact analysis. 2. To create and maintain jobs for US citizens,  in keeping with the goal of the ARRA. This will be achieved by using HEC?s BPA contractors  to undertake the work and manage its successful completion. Those contractors, in turn, may  use local consulting resources if appropriate and useful to the project. The intended  deliverable of the overall project is, for critical Corps of Engineers watersheds, a fully  functional CWMS decision support system that will enhance water management. The CWMS  decision support system includes HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, HECResSim, and HEC-FIA. For  each watershed, software will be installed as needed and configured by a contractor, with  cooperation of HEC and Division or District staff. Contractors will configure and calibrate the  models, using data and information collected from District and Division staff. Contractors will  test the software under simulated real time high flow conditions, demonstrating the  deployment under a stress test. Contractors will document actions taken to deploy the  decision support system. Finally, contractors will transfer the technology to Corps staff in the  appropriate District or Division offices. This task order is for a ?lead contractor? (LC) to assist  HEC in managing rapid deployment of CWMS at Corps districts and coordinate the day-to- day activities of the blanket purchase agreement (BPA) contractors contributing to this effort.  This role includes working with HEC on selecting watersheds to be implemented, identifying  what models and tasks are necessary for each implementation, developing management  plans, and performance work statements. The LC will recommend assignments of tasks to  other BPA contractors through the Corps PM. The LC will facilitate the work of the BPA  contractors, clarifying statements of work, deliverables, and schedules with the PM. The LC  will monitor the progress of the BPA contractors, reporting to the PM and supply the weekly  reporting information to meet ARRA requirements. The LC will take all necessary actions to  ensure the project objective is met.", "Appendix XI Civil Works Program Task 1: Worked with HEC project manager (PM) to identify priority basins and locations for  accelerated CWMS deployment, and prepare list of candidate sites for deployment.

We took steps to minimize these  errors, such as by developing instructions for analysts to guide assessing  the transparency of award information; conducting a calibration exercise  on an initial selection of 70 awards (before drawing the probability sample)  to assess the transparency criteria and to ensure that all analysts were  interpreting the criteria consistently; having two analysts independently  review each award and reach agreement; and, after all results had been  entered, reviewing all results within a program for consistency of  interpretation.", "For descriptions that partially met or did not meet our transparency  criteria, we visited publicly available federal, state, and recipient Web sites,  and reviewed publicly available documents (e.g., state weatherization  plans) to attempt to obtain insight into the aspects of the award  information that we considered missing, nonspecific, or unclear. While we  were often able to \u201ccomplete\u201d the descriptions using this approach, for  some of the awards we had to call award officials to get the needed  information. In all these cases, we were able to get this information. We did  not attempt to quantify the proportion of awards for which we called award  officials. information was missing in any address fields, particularly for the city,  state, zip code, and country, but also for the award number, award date,  award amount, fiscal year, fiscal quarter, status, recipient name,  recipient Data Universal Numbering System (or DUNS) number, funding  agency code, funding agency name, awarding agency code, awarding  agency name, project status, or final report.", "Our second sample was a certainty sample of larger dollar awards. We  drew this sample because our probability sample did not consider the size  of awards. As a result, it is possible that the sample we drew contained a  disproportionate number of smaller awards compared with the entire  population of awards; therefore, we could not accurately determine the  amount of total award dollars for each of our three levels of transparency  (i.e. met, partially met, did not meet), and any association of dollars would  be misleading. In drawing our large dollar sample, we selected between 2  and 28 of the largest awards in each program, for a total of 70 awards.  Overall, the transparency results of this sample are consistent with those of  the probability sample (31 percent met, 63 percent partially met, and 6  percent did not meet). This gives us a reasonable level of confidence that  that the dollar amount of awards is not necessarily related to the level of  transparency of the description.", "Our third sample was a judgmental sample of 52 awards described at the  beginning of this appendix.  Much as we did for our probability sample, we  reviewed award information reported on Recovery.gov and used publicly  available information from state and federal agency Recovery Act Web sites  to complete the information, where needed. In addition, we gathered  source documentation, such as grant documents, to gain a sense of the  accuracy of the information being reported on Recovery.gov. We also  discussed with award officials the feedback that they have received from  the public and press. Finally, we contacted state and local auditors about  issues raised about these awards, if any. activities (such as a transit agency\u2019s purchasing buses and building transit  maintenance facilities) that are part of a self-contained Recovery Act  award. Other awards may be part of a larger project. For example, one  award may be to install a higher-efficiency heating, ventilation, and air- conditioning system and another award may be to install a new roof, both  for the same federal building under the Federal Buildings Fund Program.  The Corps\u2019 Civil Works program awards have the similar attribute of being  part of a larger whole. We assessed descriptions for these two programs  against the activities in the award. Because individual awards under these  two programs are not tied together to an overall project in any way on  Recovery.gov, we did not rate an award lower if it did not make reference  to the larger goal of which the award was a part. For example, we did not  mark down an award to install a seawall for the outcome of controlling  erosion if the description did not state that the award was part of an overall  effort by the Corps to make a waterway more navigable.", "As another aspect of our work to review transparency of award  information, for the 11 programs we covered, we discussed with federal  agency officials and reviewed efforts by federal Inspectors General to  assess the reliability and usefulness of the data reported by recipients.", "Finally, as discussed in appendixes I through XI, we determined the nature  and scope of Recovery Act funding, obligations, and expenditures for the  11 programs covered by our review. Regarding the nature and scope of  funding, for each program, we reviewed the act to determine the overall  level of funding. We obtained data from the program agencies on the  obligations, expenditures, and general purposes of funded awards (e.g.,  pavement improvements for highways). We chose to analyze information  from the federal agencies\u2019 databases because it offers greater ability to  parse program activities than do recipient-reported data on Recovery.gov.  Relatedly, because the federal agencies keep information on these awards  in different levels of detail, our ability to categorize it extends only as far as  the detail in the agencies\u2019 databases. The federal agencies update their data  at different frequencies. As a result, data for the 11 programs covered by  our review are as of different dates, although they all are recent. The  earliest data that we report are as of March 31, 2010, for the Weatherization  Assistance Program, the latest data are as of May 12, 2010, for the  Broadband Technology Opportunities Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Error Rates Associated with Estimates of the Extent to Which Awards Met Our Transparency Criteria", "paragraphs": ["This appendix presents the estimated error rates associated with the  results of our transparency assessment, on the extent to which awards  from our representative sample were transparent, presented in table 2 of  this report.
