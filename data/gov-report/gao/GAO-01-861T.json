In October 2000, federal agencies submitted GPEA implementation plans to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for executive branch oversight of GPEA. The plans submitted by the the Department of the Treasury and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) generally provide the kind of information that was specified in OMB's July 2000 guidance. However, the Department of Defense's (DOD) plan did not describe the department's overall GPEA strategy and, in some cases, the data provided for specific information collections may be inaccurate, incomplete or duplicative. Officials at all three agencies said that they faced challenges in complying with GPEA, particularly with regard to implementing adequate security assurances for sensitive electronic transactions and in planning for and implementing computer network infrastructures. Furthermore, OMB will be challenged in providing oversight of agency GPEA activities because the plans submitted by the agencies go not document key strategic actions, nor do they specify when they will be undertaken. Taken in isolation, the plans do not provide enough information to assess agencies' progress in meeting the objectives of the act.

For this hearing, you asked us to report specifically on the efforts of three agencies to meet the requirements of GPEA, as reflected in the plans they submitted to OMB. The three agencies are the Department of the Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). After describing the framework of OMB\u2019s GPEA guidance, I will discuss each agency\u2019s plan, including its overall strategy for complying with GPEA, as well as the data on information-collection activities provided as attachments to each of their plans.", "To prepare for this hearing, we obtained and analyzed the plans submitted by each of the three agencies and held discussions with cognizant officials on their progress and challenges in meeting GPEA\u2019s October 2003 deadline.

To increase the ability of citizens to interact with the federal government electronically, in 1998 the Congress enacted GPEA.", "GPEA makes OMB responsible for ensuring that federal agencies meet the act\u2019s October 21, 2003, implementation deadline. In May 2000, OMB issued GPEA implementation guidance, which lays out a process and principles for agencies to employ in evaluating the use and acceptance of electronic documents and signatures. The guidance calls for agencies to examine business processes that might be revamped to employ electronic documents, forms, or transactions; identify customer needs and demands; consider the costs, benefits, and risks associated with making the transition to electronic environments; and develop plans and strategies for recordkeeping and security. In September 2000, we concluded that OMB\u2019s GPEA guidance\u2014as well as the guidance and supplementary efforts being undertaken by Treasury, the National Archives and Records Administration, the Departments of Justice and Commerce and others\u2014 provided a useful foundation of information to assist agencies with GPEA implementation and the transition to electronic government (e- government). Our report also laid out information technology management challenges that are fundamental to the success of GPEA.", "OMB\u2019s May guidance also required each agency, by October 2000, to develop and submit a GPEA implementation plan and schedule.

Unlike the May 2000 guidance, which discussed a wide range of activities needed for an agency to comply with GPEA, this new guidance focused on specific kinds of data that OMB was expecting agencies to submit in the October 2000 plans. The new guidance specified that the plans be divided into four parts:", "First, agencies were to provide a cover letter describing their overall strategy and actions to comply with the act. This letter is the part of the plan that provides an agencywide perspective on GPEA compliance efforts.", "Second, agencies were required to provide data in tabular form regarding information-collection activities approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), which mandates that OMB review how agencies collect and use information. The data tables were to include a column showing when an electronic option would be completed (if one was being planned) and whether electronic signatures were to be used.", "Third, agencies were requested to provide an additional table showing interagency reporting, information-dissemination activities, and other agency-identified transactions. According to OMB\u2019s guidance, \u201cinteragency reporting\u201d encompasses ongoing, periodic reports, such as personnel and payroll reports, which are exchanged among agencies. \u201cInformation-dissemination activities\u201d refers to information products intended for the general public, such as the periodic release of labor statistics. Like the PRA-based inventory, this list was to include a column showing when an electronic option would be completed, if planned, and whether electronic signatures were to be used.", "Lastly, supplemental information was also to be provided about any of the previously listed transactions that the agency had determined to pose a \u201chigh risk,\u201d such as those involving particularly sensitive information or very large numbers of respondents.

According to Treasury\u2019s plan, the department\u2019s GPEA-related activities are a critical component of the overall departmental effort to fundamentally redefine the way it performs its critical missions. According to the plan, a key element of that effort was the development of an e-government strategic plan\u2014just published this month\u2014which Treasury is using as a framework for selecting and implementing electronic initiatives.", "In addition to its internal initiatives, Treasury\u2019s plan notes that the department has been involved in governmentwide actions to advance electronic government and comply with GPEA. A key example is Pay.gov, an Internet portal developed by its Financial Management Service. According to the plan, the services of Pay.gov can help agencies meet GPEA requirements to accept forms electronically by 2003 by offering a package of electronic financial services to assist agencies, such as enabling end-users to submit agency forms and authorize payments, presenting agency bills to end-users, and establishing the identity of end- users and reporting information about transactions back to the agencies. Once fully operational, this service could help agencies throughout the federal government to more easily reach the goals of GPEA.", "According to the department\u2019s deputy chief information officer (CIO), the progress of major GPEA-related initiatives at Treasury is being monitored through monthly CIO meetings with representatives from each of the department\u2019s various bureaus and by using an investment management tool.

According to the plan, 23 of these are scheduled for conversion to an electronic option in 2001, 36 are scheduled for 2002, and 84 are scheduled for 2003. Of the remaining initiatives, 80 were reported to already be converted, two are scheduled for conversion in 2004, and 111 were not assigned a completion date for conversion. In all but one case where the conversion date was beyond October 2003 or not assigned, Treasury included explanations, as required by OMB\u2019s guidance.", "Further, Treasury identified 105 initiatives offering an electronic option for interagency reporting, information-dissemination activities, and other transactions, and four transactions identified as high risk. For those initiatives included in Treasury\u2019s plan that did not specify completion dates, the department plans to include that information when it becomes available, according to the deputy CIO.

The first initiative is to establish a new rule that would permit electronic reporting and recordkeeping and establish the requirements necessary to ensure that electronic documents are valid and authentic. EPA has drafted the proposed new rule, and it is currently being reviewed by administration officials. Agency officials expect it to be approved this year, with a final rule to be published in 2002.", "The second major initiative is the development of a computer network facility known as the Central Data Exchange. This new facility is to be the central point of entry for all electronic reporting, and is expected to provide security, authentication, error detection, and distribution capabilities. EPA expects the facility to be fully operational by the fall of 2002.", "The third major initiative is to improve EPA\u2019s information security. We have previously reported on significant weaknesses in EPA\u2019s information security program. The October 2000 plan states that the agency has made significant progress in improving its cyber defenses by implementing security confidentiality protocols and procedures.

An EPA official said that this inventory and its related attachments include all of the information regarding plans for electronic interagency reporting, information dissemination activities, and high-risk transactions, as required by OMB.", "EPA identified 279 data-collection activities applicable to GPEA. Through iterative reviews, it determined that 108 of these were not candidates for electronic reporting for reasons such as that they involved interaction with only a few members of the public or because filling out a paper form was deemed to not be a significant burden. According to the agency\u2019s plan, of the 171 data collections that were considered suitable for electronic reporting, 21 have already been converted, 3 are scheduled for 2001, 13 are scheduled for 2002, and 96 are scheduled for 2003.", "The remaining 38 data collections that will not be ready for electronic reporting by the GPEA deadline all involve the reporting of confidential business information. The electronic transmission of this type of data poses additional risks that EPA does not plan to have fully addressed by October 2003. Agency officials state that they are in the process of assessing these data collections to determine how to collect these data centrally and in a secure form. By 2003 they expect that they will be testing methods of secure transmission but do not expect them to be operational until after the GPEA deadline.", "According to EPA officials, in anticipation of a request by OMB for updated information on the data-collection inventories, they sent a letter to the program offices asking for such updated information.

First, all three agencies have determined that the security assurances provided through the use of PKI technology will be needed to enable many of their sensitive electronic transactions. As I mentioned earlier, DOD\u2019s Office of the CIO is developing a departmentwide PKI, and the office is working with the General Services Administration (GSA) to make its PKI interoperable with GSA\u2019s governmentwide Access Certificates for Electronic Services program. EPA is also pilot-testing the use of electronic signatures and digital certificates through GSA\u2019s program, and has applied for a grant from GSA to conduct a PKI interoperability project. Treasury is also closely involved in the governmentwide effort to develop PKI, having recently chaired the CIO Council\u2019s Federal PKI Steering Committee. According to Treasury\u2019s deputy CIO, the department will be challenged to develop its own PKI because it will need to pool resources from, and coordinate activities with, all of its bureaus.", "Second, EPA and Treasury both commented about the importance of adequately planning for and implementing computer network and telecommunications infrastructures to provide the capacity and connectivity needed to support the electronic traffic generated by new or enhanced electronic offerings. According to agency officials, many types of transactions covered by GPEA will require the support of new enterprisewide infrastructure. For example, EPA\u2019s Central Data Exchange project is a major infrastructure undertaking that will be critical to enabling the electronic exchange of information between EPA and state environmental agencies. Likewise, Treasury is developing the Treasury Communications Enterprise to provide a common departmentwide communications infrastructure to support electronic government initiatives throughout the department.", "Third, agencies will need adequate capabilities for storing, retrieving, and disposing of electronic records. EPA officials expressed concern about the status of governmentwide electronic recordkeeping standards, which have not yet been finalized. Many electronic systems are already being developed and implemented that may be incompatible with future standards.", "As we reported last September, federal agencies face additional information management challenges that are also fundamental to the success of GPEA. Specifically, agencies will need to use disciplined investment management practices to ensure that the full costs of providing electronic filing, recordkeeping, and transactions prompted by GPEA are identified and examined within the context of expected benefits; and ensure that IT human capital needs are addressed so that staff can effectively operate and maintain new e-government systems, adequately oversee related contractor support, and deliver responsive service to the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Will Be Challenged in Overseeing Agency Strategic GPEA- Related Activities", "paragraphs": ["OMB will also be challenged in its oversight role of ensuring that agencies comply with GPEA.

A number of the prescribed procedures were focused on agencywide strategic actions, such as examining business processes that might be revamped to employ electronic documents, forms, or transactions; identifying customer needs and demands as well as the existing risks associated with fraud, error, or misuse; and evaluating electronic signature alternatives, including risks, costs, and practicality.", "However, the GPEA implementation plans submitted by federal agencies do not provide sufficient information with which to assess whether agencies have been engaging in these processes. While OMB\u2019s subsequent July reporting guidance called for a brief cover letter describing an agency\u2019s overall strategy and actions to comply with the act, it did not stipulate a full report on the variety of strategic activities and other tasks that agencies were expected to perform, and their schedules for carrying them out. Further, the format prescribed for the information-collection data tables does not provide for any indication of whether electronic implementation has been prioritized based on achievability and net benefit.", "OMB may wish to consider whether a more comprehensive agency status report is necessary in order to gain better insight into agencywide GPEA planning. Specifically, agencies could be asked to report on the status of the specific tasks outlined in OMB\u2019s May 2000 guidance, and provide milestones for completing tasks that are still underway.
