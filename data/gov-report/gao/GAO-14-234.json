The costs of the program to the government include administrative costs like loan servicing.

Some have questioned whether borrower interest rates can be more precisely set to cover these costs without generating excess federal income.

In addition, GAO worked with Education to illustrate how changes in variables such as government borrowing costs could affect Direct Loan subsidy costs. GAO also examined whether borrower rates could be set so the government could cover Direct Loan costs without generating excess revenue (known as a breakeven analysis). GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, guidance, and reports; and interviewed Education and other agency officials.", "GAO does not make recommendations in this report. The Department of Education agreed with our findings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Total Direct Loan administrative costs grew from $314 million to $864 million from fiscal years 2007 to 2012, but federal costs per borrower have generally remained steady or fallen. The increase in total administrative costs largely results from an increase of over 300 percent in the number of Direct Loans during that same time period. One key factor contributing to this loan volume increase was a law that ended student loan originations under a federally guaranteed loan program resulting in new originations being made under the Direct Loan program. Loan servicing--which includes activities like counseling borrowers on selecting repayment plans, processing payments, and collecting on loans in delinquent status--is the largest category of administrative costs, comprising 63 percent of total Direct Loan administrative costs in fiscal year 2012. While total administrative costs have increased, costs per borrower and other unit costs have remained steady or declined. For example, the servicing cost per borrower has remained roughly $25 over the six-year period we examined. However, a number of factors, including a new payment structure for loan servicing contracts to reward servicers for keeping more borrowers in repayment status, have created some uncertainty about the servicing cost per borrower in coming years.", "Separate from administrative costs, estimated subsidy costs vary by loan cohort--a group of loans made in a single fiscal year--and change over time. Based on the Department of Education's (Education) recent estimates, the government would generate subsidy income for the 2007 to 2012 Direct Loan cohorts as a group. However, estimates will change, because current subsidy cost estimates for these cohorts are based predominantly on assumptions about future revenue and costs. Actual subsidy costs will not be known until all cash flows have been recorded, generally after loans have been repaid. This may be as many as 40 years from when the loans were originally disbursed, because many borrowers do not begin repayment until after leaving school, and some face economic hardships that extend their payment periods. Subsidy cost estimates fluctuate over time due to the incorporation of updated data on actual loan performance and the government's cost of borrowing, as well as revised assumptions about future revenue and costs, through the annual reestimate process. As a result, there can be wide variations in the estimated subsidy costs for a given cohort over time. For example, the 2008 loan cohort was estimated to generate $9.09 of subsidy income per $100 of loan disbursements in one year, but in the next year that same cohort had an estimated subsidy cost of 24 cents per $100 of loan disbursements, a swing of $9.33. Volatility in subsidy cost estimates for a given cohort is generally expected to decrease over time as more actual loan performance data become available.", "Because Direct Loan costs fluctuate with changes in certain variables, borrower interest rates cannot be set in advance to balance government revenue with costs consistently over the life of the loans. In a simulation of how loan costs respond to changes in selected variables, the costs were highly sensitive to changes in the government's cost of borrowing. This, coupled with cost estimates regularly updated to reflect loan performance data, means the total costs associated with Direct Loans are in flux until updates are recorded through the end of the loans' life cycle, which takes several decades. Therefore, the borrower interest rates that would generate revenue to exactly cover total loan costs\u2014known as breaking even\u2014would change over time. To determine whether or not a set of conditions that would break even for one cohort would also break even for another cohort under different circumstances, GAO used data forecasted for future years to experiment with certain aspects of the borrower interest rate for two separate cohort years.", "\u2022 GAO selected cohort years 2014 and 2019 because economic conditions may be different several years apart.", "\u2022 For these cohorts, the following three aspects of the borrower interest rate were altered: the index (the base market rate to which student loan interest rates are pegged), the mark-up rate (the percentage-point increase over the base rate that students are charged), and the differences in the mark-up rates among loan types, including undergraduate, graduate student, and parent loans.", "\u2022 GAO looked at how these changes to the borrower rates would affect total government costs, taking into account both administrative and subsidy costs.", "\u2022 Changing the index and mark-up rates helped achieve a breakeven point based on current cost estimates for the 2014 cohort; however, cost estimates for this cohort will change as updated data become available over the life of the loans.", "\u2022 When GAO applied the same index and mark-up rates that temporarily resulted in a breakeven point for the 2014 cohort to the 2019 cohort, it resulted in a net cost to the government.", "\u2022 The difference in outcome for these two cohorts is because Direct Loan costs are sensitive to variables, such as government borrowing costs, that are projected to look very different for 2019 than they did for 2014.", "\u2022 As illustrated in the simulation, the borrower interest rates that are needed to cover costs at one point in time may not be effective at another point in time and cannot be precisely determined in advance to enable the government to break even consistently.", "Available information on Direct Loan costs illustrates the difficulties of accurately predicting what these program costs will be, and how much borrowers should ultimately be charged to achieve a particular outcome. Specifically, fluctuations in the actual and expected costs of the student loan program over time make it challenging to target a particular borrower interest rate that would consistently break even. Making frequent changes to the borrower interest rate could help program costs more closely match revenues in the short term, but it could confuse potential borrowers and complicate efforts to make the program transparent to students."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal student loans play a key role in ensuring access to  postsecondary education for millions of students each year.

As a result, borrower interest rates  that are needed to cover Direct Loan costs at one time may not cover  costs at another time.

In this case, setting a flat interest rate for  borrowers of all Direct Loan types is a notable divergence from  current law, which provides lower interest rates to eligible  undergraduates than to graduate students and parents. While there is  no mark-up above the 10-year Treasury Note in this scenario, the  government is still able to cover its estimated administrative and  subsidy costs because borrower interest rates (in this case, the index)  are higher than the government\u2019s cost of borrowing.", "Using the 5-year Treasury Note as the index instead of the 10-year   there can be slight differences in the interest rates  Treasury Note,borrowers pay for different loan types (unlike in the previous scenario  where rates were the same for all loan types), but in order to  approximately break even, the differences in the mark-up for each  loan type would need to be reduced by one half of the current rates  set for the 2014 cohort.

A difference in outcome for these  two cohorts emerges because Direct Loan costs are sensitive to variables  that are projected to look very different for 2019 than they did for 2014.  Specifically, while interest rates for the government\u2019s cost of borrowing  were unusually low for 2014, they are projected to more than double by  2019, beginning to approximate pre-recession rates. This decreases the  spread between the borrower interest rate and the government\u2019s cost of  borrowing, and therefore decreases the likelihood that the government  will generate income on the loans. Indeed, when we changed the index  and mark-up rates for the 2019 cohort in the same manner that  approximated a breakeven point for the 2014 cohort, the resulting  estimates show the government incurring costs that would not be covered  by revenues from Direct Loans. See figure 6.", "While it would appear that borrower interest rates could be reset  frequently to adjust to the continually-changing spread between the  government\u2019s cost of borrowing and the borrower interest rate that drives  costs, the fundamental issue of not having full cost information until the  end of the loan repayment period means that the breakeven point itself  cannot be accurately predicted beforehand.

Understanding how Direct Loan costs are estimated and change over  time\u2014and what factors drive those changes\u2014is instructive for setting  borrower interest rates. However, available information illustrates the  difficulties of accurately predicting what these program costs will be, and  how much borrowers should ultimately be charged to achieve a particular  outcome. Specifically, fluctuations in the actual and expected costs of the  student loan program over time make it impractical to establish a  particular borrower interest rate that would consistently break even. In  addition, the policy changes needed to influence the costs of the program  could conflict with other policy goals. For example, setting a flat interest  rate for borrowers of all Direct Loan types may help temporarily  approximate a breakeven point, but it would be a considerable shift from  current law, which provides a lower interest rate to eligible  undergraduates. Similarly, making frequent changes to the borrower  interest rate could help program costs more closely match revenue in the  short term, but it may confuse potential borrowers and complicate efforts  to make the program transparent to students. Moreover, it may be difficult  to anticipate how any future policy changes might affect program costs,  as shifting economic conditions and cost reestimates continually move  the breakeven target.

To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws  and guidance, as well as past GAO reports related to the Direct Loan  program, administrative costs, and subsidy costs. We interviewed officials  at Education and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regarding key  issues related to Direct Loan costs. In addition, we reviewed data from  Education on its Direct Loan administrative costs and analyzed data on  subsidy costs for fiscal years 2007 to 2012, including data generated from  Education\u2019s Activity Based Costing (ABC) model and Education\u2019s student  loan cash flow model. We assessed the reliability of data on Direct Loan  administrative costs to evaluate trends in costs by interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data and reviewing documentation on  the ABC model. In addition to aggregate cost data, Education calculates  both direct and full unit costs using the ABC model. In order to report  costs that include indirect costs, we used full unit cost data. Education  officials noted that, in some cases, these data cannot isolate costs  specific to the Direct Loan program, from costs related to other Education  loan programs, because such data have not been necessary for  management purposes.

Discount rate: This is the collection of interest rates used to calculate  the present value of cash flows that are estimated over a period of  years. This rate also represents Education\u2019s cost of borrowing from  Treasury.  2.  Percentage of subsidized Stafford loans: Subsidized Stafford  Loans are available only to undergraduate student borrowers with  demonstrated financial need. The government subsidizes these loans  by not charging student borrowers for the interest that accrues while  they are still in school and during a 6-month grace period after leaving  school.  3.  Percentage of risk category: These categories were created using  school type and academic level to determine the potential risk of  default, which can lead to higher subsidy costs for the loans.  4.  Percentage of income contingent repayment plans: This is the  percentage of loans that are structured to prorate the repayment plan  based upon the borrower\u2019s income.

Favorable scenario: This scenario used past variable rates that  represented more favorable conditions in terms of reducing costs to  the government.

Less-favorable scenario: This scenario used past variable rates that  represented less favorable conditions in terms of increasing cost to  the government.
