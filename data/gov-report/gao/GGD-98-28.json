However, CTAC\u2019s Chief Scientist, as well as some of the S&T Committee members, acknowledged that the latest counterdrug technology needs listing had not been recently reassessed and was not always updated annually. Furthermore, although CTAC had developed what it termed as priority listings of counterdrug R&D technology needs, there were far more items on these lists than could be funded, and no attempt had been made to rank the listed needs by their relative importance to agency end users. As a result, there is no way for CTAC to ensure that the projects it funds reflect the most current and highest priority of the otherwise unfunded counterdrug R&D technology needs of the law enforcement and demand reduction communities. In this regard, 8 of the 10 S&T Committee members we surveyed believed that their agencies\u2019 counterdrug technology needs were not adequately reflected in the CTAC-funded projects.", "A listing of priority law enforcement-related counterdrug technology needs was included in CTAC\u2019s first Blueprint Update in August 1992.

The workshop attendees produced an Investment Strategy for DOD Counterdrug S&T Programs. The S&T needs from that effort were added by CTAC to the counterdrug technology needs listing and updated with agency inputs for fiscal year 1994. The needs listing and updated data were included in CTAC\u2019s 1995 Blueprint Update. Since then, CTAC has not substantially changed the counterdrug technology needs listing.", "S&T Committee members told us that the latest counterdrug technology needs listing did not reflect contemporary agency needs. For example, in a July 1997 memorandum on the subject, an official of one federal law enforcement agency represented on the S&T Committee stated that, although some of the listed technological needs might still be current, the list did not represent current law enforcement needs from his agency\u2019s perspective.", "CTAC officials told us that they annually requested written updates to the needs listing, but they did not receive responses from most agencies.

For fiscal year 1997, according to a CTAC official, CTAC did not request an update to the S&T Committee needs listing. However, the Chief Scientist said CTAC did not follow up with the agencies to obtain their input or to determine why they did not respond and whether they had any additions or changes. Moreover, CTAC had not used the S&T Committee as a forum to obtain all input and reassess the list to ensure that it reflected the member agencies\u2019 current counterdrug technology requirements. The Chief Scientist told us that he planned to follow up on the agency needs update at the next S&T Committee meeting, which was scheduled to be held in February 1998.", "Regarding demand reduction technology needs, although legislation added the demand reduction area to CTAC\u2019s statutory responsibilities in 1993, CTAC did not begin developing a related needs listing until June 1997. CTAC delayed developing the list even though it had invested over $19 million in such technology research as of September 1997.

According to CTAC\u2019s Chief Scientist, CTAC operated on the assumption that state and local counterdrug R&D needs were the same as those of federal agencies; therefore, CTAC focused its process on federal agencies. In addition, CTAC did not consider the counterdrug technology needs of state and local law enforcement agencies as part of its formal process for selecting and funding projects. As a result, state and local projects were selected for funding independently of the process; some of these projects might not have been selected had they been considered in conjunction with federal needs.", "The Chief Scientist told us that NIJ was CTAC\u2019s link to the state and local law enforcement community.

However, according to NIJ\u2019s Director of Science and Technology, CTAC was not responsive to state and local counterdrug technology project proposals and concerns raised by NIJ. Like NIDA, NIJ only became a representative on the S&T Committee in December 1996. The Director of Science and Technology did not agree with CTAC\u2019s assumption that state and local needs were the same as those of federal agencies. Moreover, the President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) stated in his July 1997 monthly address to association members that state and local law enforcement practitioners needed to get more involved in the creation, advancement, and development of technology to ensure that their needs are communicated and met.", "As of October 1997, CTAC was funding six state and local law enforcement projects. Total CTAC funding for these projects was about $14.6 million, or about 24.0 percent of the funds CTAC distributed for R&D projects from fiscal years 1992 to 1997. However, these projects were not selected as part of CTAC\u2019s regular process for selecting and funding counterdrug projects, which as previously discussed focused on federal agencies\u2019 technology needs. Rather, these projects were selected outside of the process through more ad hoc means. Thus, CTAC had no systematic way of ensuring that projects selected and funded with available CTAC resources had the highest priority among state and local, as well as federal, agencies. For example, one state project receiving funding was initiated as a result of a contact at a federal agency; another project receiving funding was initiated as a result of contacts made at a law enforcement conference. In addition, by selecting projects outside of the formal process, CTAC has no assurance that they, to the extent possible, meet the needs of multiple local, state, and federal agencies. For example, a state and local project leader told us that two of the six CTAC-funded state and local projects were so specialized that they could not be transferred easily to other jurisdictions.", "According to the Chief Scientist, CTAC communicated and interacted with state and local law enforcement and demand reduction agencies primarily through regional workshops held principally to share counterdrug technologies in the test and pilot stages. According to the CTAC contractor responsible for managing the workshops, these workshops apparently increased state and local agencies\u2019 awareness of CTAC and its mission. In this regard, over 90 percent of the state and local agencies participating in CTAC\u2019s law enforcement counterdrug technology workshops said that they were not aware of CTAC before receiving notice of the workshops.

As discussed later in this report, outcome measures are required by GPRA as part of future performance measurement tasks.", "Some of the S&T Committee members we interviewed told us that their agencies were generally able to avoid duplicative research projects because they learned of each other\u2019s plans as a result of CTAC\u2019s efforts. Moreover, in a computer listing of ongoing National Counterdrug R&D Program projects distributed by CTAC for updating, one agency identified two projects being done by other agencies that would meet its needs; therefore, it dropped its plans to submit proposals for similar projects.", "Also, 3 of the 10 S&T Committee representatives we surveyed responded that they were aware of potentially duplicative efforts that CTAC had helped them to avoid. For example, one agency representative noted that CTAC\u2019s efforts helped avoid duplication in the demand reduction and nonintrusive inspection technology R&D areas.

In summary, these agency officials considered 10 of the 36 projects to be contributions because they had different criteria than CTAC for considering a project a contribution. Their criteria were that the technology resulting from those projects (1) had been successfully used and (2) was assisting their agencies in fulfilling their counterdrug missions. These 10 projects are described in appendix V.", "The remaining 26 projects did not meet these criteria in that they generally either were completed and not implemented or were still in progress. Specifically, 12 of these projects were categorized as completed, but they were not in use for a variety of reasons (e.g., the technology was not user friendly, was too expensive to use, had operational problems, or needed further development). For example, a project pertaining to narcotics detection in mail packages fell into this category because, although a prototype had been developed, the technology did not effectively detect cocaine. We were told by the agency contact persons that 11 of the 26 other projects were currently in development. For example, a transportable observation platform designed to provide long-range observation capability was still undergoing tests and evaluation. Finally, for the remaining three projects, the designated contact persons were not aware of the status of the projects and thus could not comment on whether they considered them to be contributions.", "The majority of the S&T Committee members we surveyed commented that CTAC\u2019s unique contribution to the counterdrug effort is that it provides a forum for interagency exchange of information. For example, respondents noted that S&T Committee meetings held to present project proposals facilitated professional communication among agency representatives. They noted that these meetings gave R&D agency representatives an opportunity to informally discuss current research and thereby identify technology gaps and to learn about technology acquisition on non-CTAC-funded projects.", "Another aspect of CTAC\u2019s coordination function and outreach efforts is CTAC-sponsored symposiums that bring together scientific and technical experts from academia, private industry, and government agencies. One S&T Committee member that we surveyed reported that his agency was able to bring together at a CTAC symposium all of the federal sponsors and most of the major customers of a new technology in the area of wide-area surveillance.

As previously discussed, we found a lack of agreement between CTAC and S&T Committee members regarding the criteria for CTAC project-related contributions.", "When we examined the contributions identified by CTAC, we found that they were more output-related than outcome-related. That is, CTAC focused more on quantifying specific activities and products than on assessing their effectiveness or impact on law enforcement and demand reduction counterdrug efforts. For example, CTAC generally considered completed projects (output) successful whether or not they resulted in the deployment of useful technology by law enforcement or demand reduction agencies. In addition, our review did not find that CTAC obtained periodic feedback from law enforcement or demand reduction agencies on the extent to which the technology resulting from CTAC-funded projects was useful in helping to reduce drug supply or the demand for drugs (outcome). Also, CTAC cited the number of symposiums and workshops it sponsored (output) but did not specifically measure the outcome of those forums in terms of, for example, the unnecessary duplicative R&D avoided and the technology developed and used (outcome).", "In addition, CTAC is responsible for coordinating counterdrug R&D activities to ensure that unnecessary duplication is avoided and that it supports otherwise unfunded projects with the highest priority. However, we found no indication that CTAC had developed a means for measuring the results and effectiveness of its coordination (outcome), such as obtaining feedback from the agencies with R&D missions whose activities it is charged with coordinating. Nor, as we previously discussed, has CTAC developed a means for measuring its effectiveness in identifying and avoiding unnecessary duplicative R&D efforts.", "Without measurable outcome indicators linked to its mission and identifiable goals and objectives, CTAC and others cannot reliably determine CTAC\u2019s impact on reducing the nation\u2019s drug problems through the development and deployment of useful counterdrug technologies.", "In September 1997, ONDCP and CTAC officials informed us that they were taking steps as part of two separate, but related, initiatives to develop long-term strategic goals. First, pursuant to statutory provisions requiring the development and submission of the National Drug Control Strategy, ONDCP has been developing a performance measurement system for the National Strategy. As part of this effort, CTAC officials said that CTAC and other federal R&D agencies have been developing performance targets and corresponding measures or indicators for each of the technology-related objectives for the National Strategy\u2019s goals. However, these indicators are intended to measure the administration\u2019s overall progress in achieving the national goals and objectives, which involves the input and efforts of various agencies, and not to measure CTAC\u2019s execution of its mission or its specific achievements and contributions.", "Secondly, pursuant to GPRA, ONDCP is developing a separate strategic plan with objectives, targets, and performance indicators specific to the operations of ONDCP and its components. ONDCP officials told us that in response to the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) comments on a draft of the plan, they and CTAC officials were developing specific objectives, targets, and performance indicators for CTAC that would be included in the strategic plan. They stated that these indicators or measures would be primarily output-oriented (e.g., number of projects funded, reports generated, or symposiums sponsored).

However, we found that CTAC\u2019s design and execution of the process did not allow CTAC or us to determine the extent to which its process was identifying and funding the otherwise unfunded highest priority technology needs. The primary reason for this situation appears to be a lack of regular communication between CTAC and counterdrug R&D agencies through the S&T Committee, which is their representative body. S&T Committee meetings have been infrequent, and the committee has not been used regularly and consistently in helping to make key decisions, such as which projects CTAC should fund with its limited available funds. According to S&T Committee members, when the committee has met more frequently, it was effective in enabling members to exchange information, avoid duplication, and foster better cooperation and coordination. By dealing with individual S&T Committee members or working groups, CTAC may not be taking full advantage of the interaction and deliberations among the members on decisions and advisory matters as intended. As a result, CTAC may not be funding the most critically needed counterdrug technologies.", "Moreover, the charter for the S&T Committee has not been revised to reflect changes in the committee\u2019s composition, responsibilities, and relationship to CTAC since 1990, which was before CTAC was established. Because of the changes in the S&T Committee\u2019s membership since the charter was originally written, it is important that the document be updated as needed.", "In addition, federal R&D agencies\u2019 counterdrug needs have not been regularly reassessed and updated; state and local technology needs, although funded in some cases, have not been systematically considered, along with federal needs, as part of CTAC\u2019s needs identification and project selection process; and agencies have often failed to include the transitional plans needed to help ensure that technologies successfully developed with CTAC funds are used. Also, while CTAC has established mechanisms to avoid duplicative R&D efforts, it has not gathered the necessary feedback from its constituent agencies to determine whether these mechanisms are working. Therefore, CTAC does not know to what extent it is fulfilling its mission objectives of helping the counterdrug R&D community to identify and avoid duplication.", "Recent efforts by CTAC and the S&T Committee\u2019s Technology Coordination Working Group to develop a 10-year counterdrug technology development plan with 5-year budget projections in support of ONDCP\u2019s 10-year National Drug Control Strategy are positive steps toward defining and addressing our nation\u2019s counterdrug technology needs. These efforts also are good examples of how CTAC could more effectively communicate and coordinate with the counterdrug technology R&D community in accomplishing its mission. However, CTAC may not be able to effectively implement and adjust as necessary the National Drug Control Strategy and the technology development plan from year to year, because of the shortcomings we found in its coordination process for annually identifying, selecting, and funding R&D projects to meet identified technology needs and gaps.", "CTAC has made some identifiable contributions to needed counterdrug technology development. However, the extent to which CTAC has achieved its mission of helping to develop and deploy needed counterdrug technology is unclear because it has not yet developed meaningful, measurable performance goals and outcome indicators. This situation is reflected in the varying perspectives on CTAC\u2019s contributions to counterdrug technology efforts held by CTAC and the other agencies involved in those efforts. Although both CTAC and the S&T Committee members we surveyed agreed that CTAC\u2019s outreach efforts had improved information-sharing among members of the counterdrug R&D community, many of the R&D projects that CTAC cited as contributions were not considered as such by the agencies that will ultimately use the technologies. One reason for this difference of opinion appears to be that, while CTAC counted the attainment of certain milestones in the development process as contributions, the lead agencies were interested primarily in implementing efficient and effective counterdrug technologies in the field.", "Until CTAC and the agencies it assists\u2014its customers and stakeholders\u2014concur in how CTAC\u2019s contributions to the development and deployment of counterdrug technology should be measured, it will be difficult to determine the extent to which CTAC is achieving its mission. ONDCP/CTAC has an opportunity to address this situation by coordinating closely with its key customers and stakeholders as it develops specific goals and performance measures under GPRA.
