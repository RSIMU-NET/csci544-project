In addition, the Army is developing new uniform options and estimates it may cost up to $4 billion over 5 years to replace its current uniform and associated protective gear. GAO was asked to review the services' development of new camouflage uniforms. This report addresses: 1) the extent to which DOD guidance provides a consistent decision process to ensure new camouflage uniforms meet operational requirements and 2) the extent to which the services have used a joint approach to develop criteria, ensure equivalent protection and manage costs. To do this, GAO reviewed DOD, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and GAO acquisition guidance and key practices, statutory requirements and policies, interviewed defense officials, and collected and analyzed records about uniform development."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The military services have a degree of discretion regarding whether and how to apply Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition guidance for their uniform development and they varied in their usage of that guidance. As a result, the services had fragmented procedures for managing their uniform development programs, and did not consistently develop effective camouflage uniforms. GAO identified two key elements that are essential for producing successful outcomes in acquisitions: 1) using clear policies and procedures that are implemented consistently, and 2) obtaining effective information to make decisions, such as credible, reliable, and timely data. The Marine Corps followed these two key elements to produce a successful outcome, and developed a uniform that met its requirements. By contrast, two other services, the Army and Air Force, did not follow the two key elements; both services developed uniforms that did not meet mission requirements and had to replace them. Without additional guidance from DOD on the use of clear policies and procedures and a knowledge-based approach, the services may lack assurance that they have a disciplined approach to set requirements and develop new uniforms that meet operational needs.", "The military services' fragmented approach for acquiring uniforms has not ensured the development of joint criteria for new uniforms or achieved cost efficiency. DOD has not met a statutory requirement to establish joint criteria for future uniforms or taken steps to ensure that uniforms provide equivalent levels of performance and protection for service members, and the services have not pursued opportunities to seek to reduce clothing costs, such as by collaborating on uniform inventory costs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 required the military departments to establish joint criteria for future ground combat uniforms. The departments asked the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board to develop the joint criteria, but the task is incomplete. If the services do not use joint criteria to guide their activities, one or more service may develop uniforms without certainty that the uniforms include the newest technology, advanced materials or designs, and meet an acceptable level of performance. Further, DOD does not have a means to ensure that the services meet statutory policy permitting the development of service-unique uniforms as long as the uniforms, to the maximum extent practicable, provide service members the equivalent levels of performance and protection and minimize the risk to individuals operating in the joint battle space. Without a policy to ensure that services develop and field uniforms with equivalent performance and protection, the services could fall short of protecting all service members equally, potentially exposing a number to unnecessary risks. Finally, the services may have opportunities for partnerships to reduce inventory costs for new uniforms. The Army may be able to save about $82 million if it can partner with another service. Under DOD guidance, the services are encouraged to actively seek to reduce costs. The Air Force has shown interest in the Army's current uniform development, but none of the services has agreed to partner with the Army on a new uniform. In the absence of a DOD requirement that the services collaborate to standardize the development and introduction of camouflage uniforms, the services may forego millions of dollars in potential cost savings.", ""]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD take four actions to improve the development of camouflage uniforms and enhance collaboration among the services: ensure that the services have and use clear policies and procedures and a knowledge-based approach, establish joint criteria, develop policy to ensure equivalent protection levels, and pursue partnerships where applicable to help reduce costs.

The primary goal of camouflage is to  reduce vulnerability of forces to detection in combat; however, over time  the services also have chosen camouflage patterns that are service  specific and distinguish one service from another. Since 2002, the  services have introduced seven new camouflage uniforms with varying  patterns and colors\u2014two desert, two woodland, and three universal. In  addition, each service has introduced a service-specific flame-resistant  uniform in response to urgent warfighter needs. Most of the services\u2019 new  camouflage patterns and colors replaced two Army-developed  camouflage patterns that all military services were using. Specifically, the  services replaced the Army\u2019s four-color woodland camouflage pattern  developed in 1981, known as the Battle Dress Uniform or Combat Utility  Uniform, and its three-color desert camouflage pattern developed in early  1990 and known as the Desert Camouflage Uniform. Further, as part of  the Army\u2019s ongoing camouflage study, the office responsible for uniforms,  Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, plans to present the results of  its camouflage testing to senior leadership by the end of December 2012  on future uniform options.

We reported that  combat uniform performance standards developed by some of the  services were not related to specific combat environments; the  introduction of flame-resistant fabric, insect repellent treatment, and the  increased pace of operations in Afghanistan accounted for increases in  uniform production and procurement costs; and government-owned  patents on elements of the Marine Corps\u2019 uniforms presented no legal  barrier to allowing other services to use these elements. In June 2011, we  reported on matters related to the supply of flame resistant fibers for the  production of military uniforms.

We reviewed key practices for  federal acquisitions that are included in the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidelines and GAO\u2019s framework for assessing  acquisition functions. We compared OMB\u2019s and GAO\u2019s key elements for acquisitions with the decision processes used by the services, and we  identified two elements that are essential for agencies to follow to  produce successful outcomes and were applicable to uniform- development programs. The two elements are clear policies and  procedures that are implemented consistently and a knowledge-based  approach that includes meaningful data to determine whether a product  will meet customer requirements. Additionally, we interviewed relevant  DOD and military service officials, including military service officials  responsible for the management of uniform development and acquisition  policy. Further, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics about the  relevance and flexibility of DOD\u2019s acquisition guidance and how the  services used this or other guidance in their development decisions. We  visited the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy offices responsible  for managing the development or acquisition of its camouflage uniforms  and gathered and analyzed data on the use of policies to support their  decision processes and the testing or cost data that guided decisions  during the development of their camouflage uniforms.", "To determine the extent to which the services have used a joint approach  to develop criteria, ensure equivalent protection and manage costs, we  reviewed requirements and policies found in DOD guidance and in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. We also  reviewed data and interviewed officials from the military services and  members of the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board to  determine if the services had established criteria for camouflage uniforms  using a joint approach. In addition, we assessed information from DOD  about how DOD officials plan to meet the statutory policy permitting future  uniforms to uniquely reflect the identity of the individual services, as long  as they provide equivalent levels of performance and protection to the  maximum extent practicable.

Improvements incorporated into the design of the services\u2019 new  uniforms include improved visual or near-infrared capabilities for  concealment and improved fabric technology. Additionally, each service  introduced a service-specific flame resistant uniform in response to urgent  need requests.

Under the decision authority of the Chief of Staff, the new uniform  included requirements to improve visual or near-infrared capabilities, to  improve morale, and to provide a universal camouflage pattern with  acceptable levels of performance in woodland, desert, and urban terrains.  The Army spent about $3.2 million to develop the ACU in the universal  camouflage pattern and began fielding its new uniform in February 2005.", "In 2009, based on concerns from soldiers in Afghanistan, a congressional  conference committee directed DOD to take immediate action to provide  personnel deployed to Afghanistan with a camouflage pattern that was  suited to that environment. The conference committee further directed  the Secretary of the Army to provide a report on the program plans and  budgetary adjustments necessary to provide appropriate uniforms to  deployed and deploying troops to Afghanistan. In response, the Army  developed the Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern (OCP)  to address current camouflage requirements and initiated a study of  camouflage for future uniforms. The Army spent about $3.4 million to  develop the OCP and began fielding the uniform in July 2010. As part of  its study of camouflage, the Army is reviewing camouflage to identify  three color variations\u2014desert, woodland, and transitional\u2014as future  uniform options. Additionally, the study will identify one camouflage  pattern for protective gear that blends well with all three uniforms. By the  end of December 2012, the Army plans to brief senior Army leadership on  the results of its study. The Army spent about $2 million through Fiscal  Year 2011 on the development of these uniforms, and reported in  February 2012 that it expects to spend an additional $5 million on  development costs through Fiscal Year 2017.

The primary  objective of defense acquisition is to acquire quality products that satisfy  user needs with measurable improvements to mission capability and  operational support, and to do so in a timely manner and at a fair and  reasonable price. The military departments have issued guidance to  implement the DOD guidance. According to DOD Directive 5000.01,  The Defense Acquisition System, an acquisition program is a directed,  funded effort that provides a new, improved or continuing materiel,  weapon or information system, or service capability in response to an  approved need. DOD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense  Acquisition System, establishes a flexible management framework for  translating capability needs and technology opportunities into acquisition  programs.", "In addition, the instruction identifies specific statutory and regulatory  reports and information\u2014such as an acquisition strategy, cost estimates,  test and evaluation activities, and risk assessments throughout the  process to support decisions from design to production.

It also  encourages DOD components to actively seek to reduce costs by  standardizing basic materials and accessories, such as new clothing  items, and provides information on costs to introduce a new uniform into  inventory. According to Defense Logistics Agency policy, an initial  inventory fee could apply to new items when the cost of introducing a  replacement item into inventory is greater than 10 percent of the cost of  the item being replaced or when a new item is introduced by an individual  organization. The initial inventory fee, charged by the Defense Logistics  Agency, covers the cost of acquiring initial inventory of seven months of  the new clothing and the cost of the remaining inventory being replaced.", "Also, DOD issued Instruction 4140.63, Management of DOD Clothing and  Textiles (Class II), in August 2008, in part to prescribe authority, policy,  and responsibilities for the management of clothing and textiles in  peacetime and across the spectrum of military operations.

In the context of their uniform  development activities, the services varied in their views as to the  applicability of the 5000 series. For example, the Air Force did not view its  uniform development and fielding activities as an acquisition program,  although it may do so in the future as a consequence of the policy  contained in DOD Instruction 4140.63.

Under the guidance, the milestone decision authority may tailor the  regulatory information requirements and acquisition process to achieve  cost, schedule, and performance goals, where consistent with statutory  and regulatory requirements. Generally, due to statutory and regulatory  requirements, higher-cost acquisition programs have greater information,  reporting, and procedural requirements than lower-cost programs.  Accordingly, since milestone decision authorities that manage lower-cost  programs generally have fewer statutory or regulatory requirements to  implement, they often have greater flexibility to tailor the guidance.

For example, the  Marine Corps developed documents to support decision making in the  five areas described below.", "In doing", "Acquisition Strategy\u2014First, officials used an acquisition strategy to  highlight deficiencies in the service\u2019s current uniform and assessed  methods for addressing the deficiencies. The service considered  modifying the current uniform or buying a commercially available  uniform, but concluded that the best approach was to begin a new  development program that could rapidly test and evaluate prototypes  of alternative designs that would meet Marine preferences obtained  from field surveys and allow it to develop a unique uniform for the  Marine Corps. Officials provided an action plan and key dates for  developmental testing, testing of prototypes, field evaluations,  production approval, contract award, first article testing, product  verification, full production, initial issuance, and initial operational  capability. Also, the strategy included contracting requirements and a  phased fielding plan to test small lots of uniforms for a limited number  of Marines before building up inventory to meet the needs of all  Marines.", "Acquisition Program Baseline\u2014The Marine Corps developed an  acquisition program baseline to seek and receive full funding for new  uniforms, and to list performance, schedule, and cost parameters over  the program\u2019s life cycle.", "Risk Assessment\u2014In preparing a risk assessment, the Marine Corps  concluded that risk to cost, schedule, and performance would be low.

Among various assumptions of costs, Marine Corps  officials determined that the 2001 projections of the number of officer  candidates and active and reserve recruits would remain constant  throughout the 20-year life cycle. All told, the Marine Corps estimated  that the 20-year life-cycle costs would be about $502 million in  constant fiscal year 2001 dollars.", "Test and Evaluation Master Plan\u2014The Marine Corps Systems  Command created a plan to evaluate different camouflage patterns  and colors. Marine Corps Systems Command and U.S. Army Soldier,  Biological and Chemical Command, conducted testing and evaluation  on camouflage technology and alternative uniform designs to  determine which camouflage and elements of uniform design would  meet user requirements. The plan also included field tests by  approximately 450 Marines to evaluate two designs of the new  uniform for suitability for a number of mission-oriented tasks, such as  helicopter and amphibious operations. The planned tests and  evaluations were to determine durability, function, and preferred  features.", "In addition, Marine Corps officials established a process that followed the  federal key practice to use a knowledge-based approach that includes  meaningful data to determine whether a product will meet customer  requirements. A knowledge-based approach includes obtaining sufficient  information about technology, design options, and production capabilities  so that the product will be able to meet various requirements. In April  2000, according to documents, Marine Corps officials decided to replace  the existing combat uniforms with new camouflage combat uniforms to  increase durability and utility for combat over the current BDU and Desert  Camouflage Uniform and to provide Marines with a unique and distinct  combat uniform.", "As part of their knowledge-based approach during decision making,  Marine Corps officials considered about 70 camouflage patterns, and  Marine Corps test observers, who were assessing the effectiveness of the  camouflage, narrowed the candidates to eight. The eight were narrowed  to the top three performers, due to what Marine Corps officials described  as patent issues. The Marine Corps chose four colors each for the  patterns for woodland and desert environments based on discussions  with camouflage experts. The Marine Corps Commandant reviewed the  camouflage patterns and officials chose two camouflage patterns for  further testing\u2014Tiger Stripe and Canadian Disruptive Pattern (later  named the Marine Corps Pattern or MARPAT). However, initial field  testing showed that the Tiger Stripe was not an effective camouflage  pattern. After other field tests with woodland and desert colored variations  of the Marine Corps Pattern, Marine Corps officials determined that the  Marine Corps Pattern had performance advantages over the Tiger-Stripe  pattern when used in camouflage uniforms. On the 7-point scale, with 7  being the most effective camouflage, test observers gave average scores  of 5.0 to the Marine Corps Pattern and 4.16 to the Tiger Stripe.

However, the Army did not follow the 5000- series policy or establish alternate policies and procedures on reporting of  testing, performance, and risk to the program to support its decision  making, which could have provided reasonable assurance that its  requirements were met. The Army tailored its development program in a  manner that excluded steps in the process that might have ensured the  use of test and evaluation results to support decision making throughout  the development of the ACU. For example, the Army did not take steps to  establish an acquisition strategy, which can guide the development  activities, or use another mechanism to inform senior leadership about  testing, performance, and risks associated with the development of the  uniform. An acquisition strategy can provide a master schedule for  research, development, testing, production, fielding and other activities;  one of the keys to a successful program is an acquisition strategy that is  carefully developed and consistently followed.", "As part of our review, officials from the program office that managed the  program\u2014Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier\u2014told us that officials  briefed the Chief of Staff in March 2004 through the Army Uniform Board  on issues related to the management of fielding the new uniform to  soldiers. Specifically, the briefing included the number of uniforms per  soldier, the cost of the new uniforms, and the timeline for fielding. The  Army did not provide information on testing results or an evaluation of the  performance and risks associated with the development of the uniform.  Developing an acquisition strategy could have provided the Army with a  structured approach to requirements, testing plans, cost estimate data, a  risk assessment of the program, and recommendations to support  decision making.", "Similarly, we found that the Army did not employ the key practice of using  a knowledge-based approach to support development decisions that  included obtaining sufficient information about camouflage performance  from testing data. As part of the development of the ACU, the Army  Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center began a  field evaluation in 2002 of the performance of 13 camouflage patterns and  color combinations. However, PEO Soldier officials told us that prior to  the completion of this study the leadership chose a camouflage pattern  and colors for the new uniform without data from the camouflage study.  PEO Soldier leadership could not provide a performance report to support  the selection of the Universal Camouflage Pattern nor explain how the  camouflage pattern was developed. The Universal Camouflage Pattern  was not part of the Natick study and was not tested prior to the decision  by PEO Soldier to use this pattern or prior to the June 2004 approval of  the pattern by the Chief of Staff. The Army began fielding the uniform in  February 2005. Later in 2005, the Army Natick Soldier Research,  Development, and Engineering Center completed its camouflage  evaluation and recommended a different pattern\u2014Desert Brush\u2014as the  most effective universal camouflage pattern. In 2009, a follow-on Army  study found that the Universal Camouflage Pattern of the ACU offered  less effective concealment than the patterns chosen by the Marine Corps  and some foreign military services, such as Syria and China. The test  showed that soldiers wearing the Universal ACU were at greater  operational risk of visibility to enemy forces than soldiers wearing the  Marines\u2019 pattern.", "Moreover, soldiers deployed to Afghanistan conveyed concerns about  their uniform, which they indicated provided ineffective concealment in the  Afghan environment. In response to those concerns, in 2009 a  congressional conference committee directed immediate action to provide  combat uniforms suited to that environment. The Army established a  decision process that included a strategy of development and fielding  activities and leadership review of the testing to support a decision on a  new uniform. The Army expedited testing of camouflage patterns suited  for Afghanistan by sending a photo simulation team to Afghanistan to  collect environmental data. Further, the Army surveyed soldiers on  deployment to support its decision making. The Army also considered the  conclusions of the 2005 and 2009 Natick studies.", "In 2010, the Army began replacing the ACU for personnel deployed to  Afghanistan with Operation Enduring Freedom Camouflage Pattern  (OCP), and estimated that the replacement would add more than $38.8  million in development and initial fielding costs for fiscal year 2010 and  2011.", "For future uniform needs, the Army is conducting a study to choose  environment-specific camouflage patterns for use Army-wide by the end  of December 2012. If the Army chooses a new camouflage uniform,  officials estimate that it may cost up to $4 billion over 5 years to replace  its uniform and related protective gear. The leadership of PEO Soldier  told us that, unlike the decision process used to support development of  the camouflage pattern for the ACU, the decision process for future  camouflage uniforms will include a knowledge-based approach and  greater use of DOD policies and procedures to ensure that decisions are  informed, science-based, and data driven. For example, the Army  established an acquisition strategy for conducting the development of  new uniforms, hosted regular meetings to obtain input from other services  and Army organizations, and PEO Soldier regularly provided Army  leadership with information about its development activities.", "In 2002, Air Force officials began developing the Airman Battle Uniform  (ABU) for noncombat use to replace two combat uniforms. At the time,  the U.S. military, including the Air Force, was conducting expeditionary  operations worldwide, including Afghanistan. Officials later recognized  that the ABU under development might not meet their needs, and in 2005  they began testing to determine the suitability of the ABU in a combat  environment. We found that the decision process used by the Air Force in  the development of the ABU did not follow the key element of using clear  policies and procedures. Also, the Air Force did not employ a knowledge- based approach including an analysis of the potential requirements for  both combat and base uniforms. As a result, the Air Force developed a  non-combat uniform for wear at the home base. Personnel found that the  uniform\u2019s fabric weight was uncomfortable due to heat buildup, and the  Air Force had to replace the uniform with one constructed from a lighter  fabric.", "During our review, Air Force officials told us that they did not follow  DOD\u2019s 5000-series policies. According to Air Force officials, in 2002 Air  Force leadership determined that its development activities for its new  uniform\u2014intended for use only on bases\u2014did not constitute an  acquisition program under the 5000 series and Air Force Instruction 63- 101, entitled Operations of Capabilities Based Acquisition System.  Instead of following a specific policy, the Chief of Staff provided direction  on the development of the uniform during three senior leadership  briefings between 2002 and 2004, according to Air Force officials. In  considering support for his decision making, the Chief of Staff did not  require the Clothing Office to establish a strategy to guide the  development activities, such as documenting deficiencies of the current  combat uniforms and establishing capability requirements for the  replacement uniforms. Also, the Chief of Staff did not use a mechanism to  report how the new uniform would meet capability requirements, as well  as the results of uniform testing, performance evaluation, and risk  assessment. All these procedures could have provided more reasonable  assurance that personnel requirements were met. If the Air Force had  used DOD policies or established an alternative policy that included  procedures to review requirements of the new uniform prior to the start of  development activities, Air Force officials may have determined that  replacing combat uniforms with a non-combat uniform would leave a gap  in uniform capabilities.", "In addition, in developing their uniform the Air Force officials did not fully  employ the key practice of using a knowledge-based approach that  included the collection and use of meaningful data to determine whether a  product will meet customer requirements. The Air Force tested the ABU  against other service uniforms in different environments for camouflage  effectiveness and conducted field tests for comfort and durability. We  found that the Air Force\u2019s testing process had weaknesses, such as not  testing different camouflage patterns and fabrics prior to choosing the  tiger-stripe pattern, and using test results of a desert pattern in a  woodland area. Also, officials chose not to implement all of the testing  recommendations from the Air Force\u2019s Air Warfare Center, including one  recommendation to reduce the heat build-up from the uniform.", "During the development of the uniform, the Air Force conducted surveys  of personnel to determine their uniform design preferences. Then,  according to Air Force officials and documents, the Chief of Staff directed  the Clothing Office to use a tiger-striped camouflage pattern in a uniform  for all environments with colors complementing the Army\u2019s universal  camouflage uniform, and to use one fabric weight for the trousers and the  blouses worn in hot and cold climates. In contrast, the Marine Corp\u2019s  knowledge-based approach included testing and evaluation of multiple  camouflage patterns and colors from which they selected two top  performing patterns. As a result, the Marine Corps produced two  prototypes for extensive field testing and evaluation. Using this  information, the Marine Corps was able to make knowledgeable decisions  to select the best prototype and to make improvements in the design prior  to production. The Marine Corps selected the same twill fabric weave that  the Air Force selected for the ABU, but the Marine Corps decided to use a  lighter weight fabric than the Air Force did for the uniform jacket as a way  to prevent heat buildup.", "In 2005, the Air Force Uniform Board sought testing of the ABU to assess  the uniform\u2019s suitability for use in a combat environment and whether a  second version of the uniform was needed. The Air Warfare Center  produced a test plan, which included the overall test methodology and  measures of uniform effectiveness and performance for concealment and  comfort.", "In October 2006, the Air Warfare Center issued a report on its testing of  the combat effectiveness of the ABU. The report concluded that the ABU  camouflage performed well in most environments\u2014never ranking lower  than third among the six uniforms in different environments. However, the  report also concluded that the ABU was not an effective combat uniform  due to trouser fit, heat buildup, and other concerns.", "Regarding camouflage effectiveness, the Air Force compared the ABU  performance to five fielded uniforms: Army Combat Uniform, Marine  Corps desert and woodland uniforms, and Army Battle Dress (woodland)  and Desert Camouflage uniforms. However, four of the five uniforms were  environment-specific uniforms not intended for a number of settings for  which they were tested. Specifically, in a tropical forest environment, the  Air Force tests showed that the DCU and Marine Corp desert uniforms  performed worst, and were ranked 5th and 6th respectively out of six  uniforms tested. Similarly, in a desert scrub environment, the Air Force  tests showed that the BDU woodland and Marine Corps woodland  performed worst, ranking 5th and 6th respectively among six uniforms  tested. Our analysis shows that the Air Force used camouflage test  results from settings other than the ones for which they were developed,  which raises questions about the meaningfulness of the report\u2019s  conclusion that the ABU camouflage performed well in most  environments. In 11 of 19 tests, Air Force observers rated the ABU as  marginal or unsatisfactory for concealment 58 percent of the time.", "Additionally, the report recommended some design changes to improve fit  and comfort and to improve the ABU\u2019s overall effectiveness for combat  use. As a result, the Air Force incorporated some changes into the final  production design, such as relocating pocket drain holes and redesigning  the trouser crotch, but did not address other recommendations like the  heat buildup. direction for the development of the ABU was for non-combat use rather  than as a combat uniform or as a camouflage-effective garment.", "In response, the Clothing Office noted that the original  At the conclusion of our field work, we learned that the Air Force had  begun replacing the ABU with a lighter weight version to address the long  standing complaints by personnel about the heat buildup issue. According  to Air Force officials, the replacement ABU in a lighter weight fabric will be  used by home base and deployed personnel with the exception of those  serving in Afghanistan, where the Army OCP uniform will continue to be  used. If Air Force officials had expanded the knowledge-based approach  for selecting a uniform\u2014such as by ordering extensive testing and  evaluation of varying fabric weights for comfortable wear to support the  decision process\u2014the service may have avoided the need to replace  uniforms with a lighter weight fabric.", "In 2010, Air Force Central Command decided that it would be safer for  personnel serving in Afghanistan to wear the Army\u2019s flame resistant OCP  uniform rather than the ABU or its flame resistant uniform. Air Force  Central Command determined that the ABU\u2019s camouflage contrasted with  the Army\u2019s camouflage, increasing the risk of personnel standing out to  enemy forces when Army and Air Force personnel were in a joint  operating environment.", "The Air Force allowed personnel to remove interior pockets in the ABU shirt to address  the heat buildup issue.

According to Air  Force officials, this action was taken to reduce the risk of any personnel  standing out in the joint operating environment.

However, according to DLA  officials, none of the services has partnered on combat uniforms since  they began separately replacing the BDU and DCU beginning in 2002.  Instead, each of the services generally went its own way in developing or  adopting service-specific camouflage uniforms. For example, the goals for  the Marine Corps\u2019 uniform development program included providing  Marines with a unique combat uniform, the Air Force wanted a utility  uniform with a distinctively Air Force look, the Navy\u2019s goals were to adopt  a set of uniforms that reflected the requirements of a 21st century Navy  and its naval heritage, and the Army wanted a new uniform that would be  more widely accepted by its soldiers than the BDU. The services\u2019  fragmented approaches to uniform development began with the Marine  Corps in 2002 and continued for other services until the Navy was the last  service to replace the BDU in 2011 with camouflage uniforms developed  for naval special forces.

We have previously reported that the Marine Corps patents on  elements of the uniform do not preclude another service from adopting  the Marine Corps\u2019 uniform. However, given the prevailing military service  culture that places a high value on having distinctive and unique combat  uniforms, the printing of a service\u2019s logo on a uniform\u2019s fabric might make  it difficult for another service to adopt the uniform for temporary mission  needs or as a permanent replacement unless the printed logo was  removed. Conversely, the Army and the Air Force have not found it  necessary to print their service logos on their combat uniforms. The Army,  for example, has been open in allowing members of another service to  wear its uniform to meet mission needs.", "We also found that the services have not reduced costs by collaborating  to eliminate inventory fees for new uniforms. When the military services  introduce a new item, the Defense Logistics Agency imposes an initial  inventory fee if the cost of the new item is greater than 10 percent of the  cost of the item being replaced and if the item is introduced into inventory  by only one DOD component. The inventory fee covers the cost of  acquiring initial inventory, according to Defense Logistics Agency officials,  and includes the first four months of inventory, a three-month safety level,  and the cost of the remaining uniforms in inventory being replaced. To  encourage the services to reduce costs by standardizing materials and  eliminating duplication, according to the Defense Logistics Agency, Troop  Support office, officials will waive the initial inventory fee if two or more  services agree to jointly introduce the item into their inventories.", "Two military services, the Army and the Navy, have recently experienced  opportunities to potentially save tens of millions of dollars in initial  inventory fees by partnering with another service in the introduction of  new uniforms. The Army is currently testing camouflage patterns to  support the development of new camouflage uniforms for service-wide  use and has estimated that the service could avoid initial inventory fees of  as much as $82 million by partnering with another service or services.  However, during our review none of the services had reached an  agreement to partner with the Army.

The Air Force is monitoring the  Army\u2019s activities and Air Force officials stated that they are considering  using the new uniforms if the uniforms meet their requirements.  Nevertheless, we found that Army officials have not reached an  agreement with the Air Force or other services to partner on the joint  introduction of its uniforms to achieve cost savings if the initial inventory  fee applies. If the Army does not partner with at least one service on the  introduction of its new uniforms, it will miss an opportunity to eliminate the  initial inventory fee cost, decrease the life-cycle costs of its uniforms, and  may duplicate effort if the Air Force or another service later decides to  independently develop a new uniform.", "The Navy, as part of its acquisition planning in the spring of 2011,  estimated potential cost savings of about $6 million in its initial inventory  fees if it partnered with another service in the introduction of its Type II  desert and Type III woodland uniforms.

The Coast Guard  request stated that the uniform partnership would promote the active  relationship between the Coast Guard and the Navy and provide  interoperability and cooperation in the joint maritime environment. In  August 2011, the Navy revised guidance on the wear of its uniforms,  permitting the Coast Guard to use its Type II desert uniform for Coast  Guard personnel assigned to or directly supporting Naval Special  Warfare, and it approved use of the Type III woodland uniforms for all  other Coast Guard personnel.

However, DOD did not specifically identify how the  Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board plans to provide consistent,  long-term oversight to ensure the military services use policies and  procedures to guide their development activities in the future.  As we  discuss in our report, without additional guidance from DOD on the use of  clear policies and procedures for a knowledge-based approach to  developing effective uniforms, some services may continue to lack  assurance that they have a disciplined process that is capable of delivering  uniforms that meet warfighter requirements.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretaries of the military departments to identify and  implement actions necessary to enable the Joint Clothing and Textiles  Governance Board to develop and issue joint criteria for uniforms prior to  the development or acquisition of any new camouflage uniform and  establishing a timeline for developing joint standards. One important  action includes the completion of the Board's charter outlining the roles,  responsibilities, and authorities of the board. DOD stated that the military  departments participate in the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance  Board's efforts to develop joint criteria for camouflage uniforms by  providing appropriate research and development and functional expertise.  DOD stated that draft joint criteria for camouflage uniforms have been  developed and are going through the DOD approval process, which DOD  estimated will be completed in the 2nd quarter of Fiscal Year 2013.  Finally, DOD stated that once approved, the joint criteria will be used prior  to the development or acquisition of new camouflage uniforms. While we  are encouraged to learn that DOD has draft joint criteria moving through  the approval process, the development of the joint criteria has been an  ongoing effort for several years\u2014initially to be completed by February  2011, then in December 2012, according to DOD's status report to  congressional committees, and now no later than March 2013, in  response to our recommendation. Because of the difficulties the  department has experienced in developing and approving joint criteria,  our recommendation called for the completion of the Joint Clothing and  Textiles Governance Board's charter as a specific action that DOD should  take to facilitate the department's ability to meet the statutory requirement  to develop joint criteria for future ground combat uniforms. DOD,  however, did not address completion of the Board's charter in its  comments. We continue to believe that completion of the charter to  clearly outline the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the Board  would facilitate military department approval of meaningful joint criteria.  Further, we believe that completion of the Board's charter will be critical in  ensuring that the Board can assist DOD in 1) carrying out the oversight of  service uniform development actions and 2) providing additional oversight  and encouraging active partnerships for joint development and use of  uniforms, particularly since DOD has identified the Board as an essential  actor in carrying out three of our four recommendations.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics develop a policy and  establish a timeframe to ensure that future service-specific uniforms  provide equivalent levels of performance and protection, and minimize  risk to service members operating in the joint battlespace. DOD said that  the USD (AT&L) will disseminate policy guidance to the military  departments that will include direction for using joint criteria and ensuring  equivalent levels of performance and protection by the 3rd quarter of  Fiscal Year 2013. If fully implemented, we believe this action would  satisfy our recommendation.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretaries of the  military departments actively pursue partnerships for the joint  development and use of uniforms to minimize fragmentation in the  development of uniforms, and to seek to reduce inventory and overall  procurement costs. DOD stated that it will use the Joint Clothing and  Textiles Governance Board and the Cross-Service Warfighter Equipment  Board to provide additional oversight and further pursue active  partnerships for joint development and use of uniforms. We believe these  actions, if fully implemented, would satisfy our recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Secretaries of the Air  Force, Army, and Navy, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and other  interested parties.

We collected and  reviewed the DOD\u2019s and services\u2019 regulations, instructions, policies,  procedures, and other guidance that the services used to structure their  decision processes on the development and acquisition of their  camouflage uniforms. We assessed the decision processes based on  their use of DOD\u2019s 5000-series acquisition guidance, military department  implementing guidance, or other guidance, and OMB\u2019s acquisition  guidance and GAO\u2019s framework for assessing acquisition functions. We  assessed whether three services\u2014the Marine Corps, Army and Air  Force\u2014followed the two key elements that GAO has determined are key  practices for a decision process that produces successful outcomes, and  to what extent each service developed uniforms that met requirements.  We visited the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Navy offices  responsible for managing the development or acquisition of their  camouflage uniforms and gathered data and reports that the services  used to support their decisions. We interviewed military service officials  responsible for the management of uniform development and acquisition  policy and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics about the flexibility of DOD\u2019s 5000-series  guidance and how the services used this guidance in their development  activities. To determine whether the services\u2019 uniforms met requirements,  we collected data and interviewed service officials to determine if the new  uniforms have been replaced to meet operational needs.", "To determine the extent to which the services have used a joint approach  to develop criteria, ensure equivalent protection and manage costs, we  reviewed the DOD guidance, the requirement of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 that the military departments  establish joint criteria for future ground combat uniforms, and policy  established by the act permitting the design and fielding of service- unique, future ground combat uniforms so long as they, to the maximum  extent practicable, provide equivalent levels of performance and  protection to all service members commensurate with their assigned  combat missions and minimize the risk to the individual service members  operating in the joint battle space, among other things. We collected data  and interviewed relevant officials from the four military services and  officials with the Joint Clothing and Textiles Governance Board from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics and the Defense Logistics Agency to determine if the services  are using a joint approach to address the requirement and policy and if  they are being met. Specifically, we interviewed governance board  officials and reviewed documents related to the board\u2019s efforts and plans  to develop joint criteria and collect a set of common uniform  characteristics to support development of uniforms and protective gear.  Finally, to determine how the services jointly seek to reduce costs in the  acquisition of uniforms, we gathered data from the Navy and Army on the  estimated cost to introduce their new camouflage uniforms into inventory.  We reviewed DOD\u2019s supply chain materiel management regulation and  other guidance from the Defense Logistics Agency, Troop Support office  on initial inventory fees and how the agency provides the services a  reduced initial inventory fee if a service partners with one or more service.  To assess the reliability of the cost data, we interviewed Navy and Army  officials to understand how the initial inventory fee was determined. The  Defense Logistics Agency confirmed the cost of the Navy\u2019s initial  inventory fee. To verify the Army\u2019s estimate, we obtained data from the  Defense Logistics Agency, Troop Support office on monthly demand for  uniforms and created our own cost estimate. To ensure that the  computer-generated data from the Defense Logistics Agency, Troop  Support office is reliable, we collected information about the Enterprise  Business System and the Standard Materiel Management System and  interviewed officials who manage the system. We determined that the  data from the Defense Logistics Agency, Troop Support office, the Navy,  and the Army were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  engagement.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2010 to  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Flame Resistant Ground Combat Uniforms", "paragraphs": ["Since 2006, each service has developed or adopted flame-resistant  uniforms in response to urgent warfighter needs. See figure 2 for  additional information about the uniforms. Prior to Operation Enduring  Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, DOD personnel with flame  resistant uniforms were mainly aviators, fuel handlers, and combat- vehicle crewmen. These personnel required flame resistant uniforms  because of their potential exposure to fire or other thermal energy. With  the growing prevalence of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) threat,  all ground forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have been exposed to  the possibility of fire-related injuries. As the threat from IEDs emerged  and continues today, the services have developed flame resistant uniform  capabilities to protect the warfighter.", "The Marine Corps developed its Flame Resistant Organizational Gear  (FROG) in response to a July 2006 Urgent Statement of Need to increase  protection against flash flame IED events in Central Command\u2019s area of  responsibility. The Urgent Statement of Need requested burn protection  for the hands, face, and neck. After extensive testing, the Marine Corps  determined that in addition to providing a base layer of protection, the  service also needed to provide an outer layer of protection. The Marine  Corps conducted testing of flame-resistant fabrics in January and  February of 2007 and selected the TenCate Defender\u2122 M fabric for its  flame-resistant uniforms. The Marine Corps spent about $1.5 million in  the development of the FROG through Fiscal Year 2008. The service  began fielding FROG items in February 2007 to all deployed and  deploying Marines.", "The Army\u2019s Flame Resistant Army Combat Uniform (FR ACU) was  developed in response to two Operational Need Statements requiring  flame protection clothing capabilities to support operations in Central  Command\u2019s area of responsibility due to greater threats of IEDs with  enhanced accelerants throughout the theater. In August 2006, the Army  received an Operational Need Statement from Multi-National Corps Iraq  which called for an increase in the number of flame-resistant uniforms  already available to be used by soldiers to protect against increased burn  injuries occurring from IED attacks. The Operational Need Statement was  met by issuing Nomex\u00ae Combat Vehicle Crewman\u2019s uniforms and  Nomex\u00ae Combat Vehicle Crewman\u2019s balaclavas for those soldiers  deployed in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom. In addition, as part of its response, the Army tested flame- resistant fabrics in 2006 for future uniforms. In March 2007, an  Operational Needs Statement was submitted by United States Army  Central requesting flame-resistant uniforms to enhance survivability while  conducting missions. The Army developed its FR ACU using the same  flame-resistant fabric, TenCate Defender\u2122 M, identified in its 2006  testing and as the Marine Corps\u2019 FROG. The Army did not provide the  total cost of the development of the FR ACU, but did provide PEO  Soldier\u2019s research and development costs of about $530,000. The Army  began fielding the FR ACU to soldiers in late 2007.", "In response to direction from a June 2009 conference committee that  DOD take immediate action to provide personnel deployed to Afghanistan  with a camouflage pattern that is suited to the environment of  Afghanistan, the Army developed the Operation Enduring Freedom  Camouflage Pattern (OCP). The OCP uniform provides increased  camouflage protection to soldiers operating in Afghanistan\u2019s diverse  environments and is printed on the TenCate Defender\u2122 M flame  resistant fabric. The Army spent about $3.4 million through 2009 on  development, began fielding the uniform in July 2010, and it is expected  to be fully fielded by September 2012.", "The Air Force\u2019s Airman Battle System-Ground (ABS-G) was developed in  response to a May 2008 Urgent Operational Need for flame-resistant  equipment to be used in ground combat and combat support  environments by personnel performing non-traditional, ground-focused, or  newly emerging missions for the Air Force and in support of other joint  and services\u2019 staffs in Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility. The  ABS-G consists of four layers of flame-resistant clothing: a base layer,  core layer, an outer layer, and an extreme cold-weather layer. In 2007,  the Air Force and Army conducted joint testing of flame-resistant fabrics  to identify alternatives to TenCate Defender\u2122 M based on concerns  about the availability of flame resistant rayon given a projected increase  in demand from both services. The Air Force spent about $1.7 million  between 2007 and 2010 in the development of the ABS-G and began  fielding it in March 2009. However, in September 2010, the Air Force  changed its combat uniform wear policy to enhance the level of protection  for personnel who perform ground combat missions. The updated policy  authorizes personnel conducting ground combat missions beyond the  perimeter of a base to wear the uniform of their assigned or aligned unit\u2014 generally the Army\u2019s OCP\u2014and directs all other Air Force personnel  deployed to Afghanistan to wear the Army\u2019s OCP uniform or the FR ACU  if the OCP uniform is not available. If neither uniform is available, the  policy authorizes personnel to wear the ABS-G. Air Force officials stated  that the ABS-G will be transitioned out of the Air Force\u2019s inventory as  soon as the production levels of the Army\u2019s flame-resistant uniforms can  meet Air Force demand.", "In response to an Urgent Statement of Need dated February 2011, the  Navy adopted the Marine Corps\u2019 flame resistant uniform for Navy use,  thereby avoiding a duplication of effort and eliminating development  costs. Through the Naval Logistics Integration initiative with the Marine  Corps, the Navy is leveraging the Marine Corps\u2019 flame resistant uniform  and gear and adding its own Type II desert and Type III woodland  camouflage patterns and the legacy Desert Camouflage Uniform patterns  to the FROG uniform for use by the Navy\u2019s expeditionary ground  personnel. The Marine Corps Systems Command\u2019s Program Manager for  Infantry Combat Equipment (PM-ICE) is the program manager for the  Navy expeditionary ground personnel\u2019s flame-resistant uniforms. The  Navy spent about $29,000 for final preproduction review of the uniforms  and had no additional research or development costs because it adopted  the Marine Corps\u2019 flame-resistant uniform. The Navy began fielding  elements of the Navy FROG in September 2011.
