In the 1990s, a series of natural disasters, (1) raised questions about the adequacy of the insurance industry's financial capacity to cover large catastrophes without limiting coverage or substantially raising premiums and (2) called attention to ways of raising additional sources of capital to help cover catastrophic risk. Catastrophe risk includes exposure to losses from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and tornadoes, which are infrequent events that can cause substantial financial loss but are difficult to reliably predict. The characteristics of natural disasters prompt most insurers to limit the amount and type of catastrophic risk they hold. Risk-linked securities that can be used to cover risk from natural catastrophes employ many structures and include catastrophic bonds and catastrophic options. GAO identified and analyzed several issues that might affect the use of risk-linked securities. First, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and insurance industry representatives are considering revisions in the regulatory accounting treatment of risk transfer obtained from nonindemnity-based coverage that would allow credit to the insurer similar to that now afforded additional reinsurance. Such a revision has the potential to facilitate the use of risk-linked securities. Second, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is proposing a new U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles interpretation, which would increase independent capital investment requirements that allow the sponsor to treat special purpose reinsurance vehicles (SPRV) and similar entities as independent entities and report SPRV assets and liabilities separately. Third, \"pass-through\" tax treatment--which eliminates taxation at the SPRV level--with favorable implementing requirements could facilitate expanded use of catastrophe bonds. Finally, catastrophe bonds, most of which are noninvestment-grade instruments, have not been sold to a wide range of investors beyond institutional investors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Because of population growth, resulting real estate development, and rising  real estate values in hazard-prone areas, our nation is increasingly exposed  to much higher property-casualty losses\u2014both insured and uninsured\u2014 from natural catastrophes than in the past.

The nation\u2019s  exposure to higher property-casualty losses increases pressure on federal,  state, and local governments; businesses; and individuals to assume ever- larger liabilities for losses associated with natural catastrophes.  Recognizing this greater exposure and responding to concerns about  insurance market capacity, participants in the insurance industry and  capital markets have developed new capital market instruments (hereafter  called risk-linked securities) as an alternative to traditional property- casualty reinsurance, or insurance for insurers.", "Because of these concerns, you asked that we review the role of risk-linked  securities in providing coverage for catastrophic risk and issues related to  their expanded use. As agreed with your office, our objectives were to (1)  describe catastrophe risk and how the insurance and capital markets  provide for coverage against such risks; (2) describe how risk-linked  securities, particularly catastrophe bonds, are structured; and (3) analyze  how key regulatory, accounting, tax, and investor issues might affect the  use of risk-linked securities. Our overall objective was to provide the  Committee with information and perspectives to consider as the  Committee and Congress move forward in this important and complex  area.", "Even though we did not have statutory audit or access to records authority  with private-sector entities, we obtained extensive documentary and  testimonial evidence from a large number of entities, including insurance  and reinsurance companies, investment banks, institutional investors,  rating agencies, firms that develop models to analyze catastrophe risks,  regulators, and academic experts. We did not verify the accuracy of data  provided by these entities. Some entities with whom we met voluntarily  provided information they considered to be proprietary; therefore, we did  not report details from such information. In other cases companies decided  not to voluntarily provide proprietary information, and this limited our  inquiry. For example, we did not obtain any reinsurance contracts  representing either traditional reinsurance or reinsurance provided  through the issuance of risk-linked securities.", "Although we identified factors that industry and capital markets experts  believe might cause the use of risk-linked securities to expand or contract,  we make no prediction about the future use of these securities\u2014either  under current accounting, regulatory, and tax policies or under changed  policies.

Insurance companies  face catastrophe risk associated with their provision of property-casualty  insurance. Major reinsurers are insurance companies with global insurance  and reinsurance operations. Insurers and reinsurers are subject to \u201cmoral  hazard,\u201d which is \u201cthe incentive created by insurance that induces those  insured to undertake greater risk than if they were uninsured, because the  negative consequences are passed through to the insurer.\u201d  Therefore,  reinsurers have incentives to limit the possibility that ceding insurers take  actions that would create negative consequences for the reinsurer.  Indemnity reinsurance contracts have the potential to increase a reinsurer\u2019s  risk exposure to the extent that the reinsurer might be unaware of the  underwriting and claims settlement practices of the ceding insurer.", "Traditional reinsurance is generally indemnity-based and tailored to the  needs of the ceding company because traditional reinsurance depends, in  part, on well-developed contractual and business relationships between  insurers and reinsurers. When reinsurance coverage is not indemnity- based, the ceding insurer is exposed to basis risk\u2014the risk that there may  be a difference between the payment received from the reinsurance  coverage and the actual accrued claims of the ceding insurance company.  Property-casualty reinsurance agreements are typically single-event,  excess of loss contracts. A single-event contract means that the reinsurer\u2019s  obligations are specific to an event, such as a hurricane in a contractually  specified geographic area. Excess of loss means that the reinsurer makes  payments that are based on a contractually specified share of claims in  excess of a minimum amount, subject to a maximum claim payment.", "The financial industry has developed instruments through which primary  financial products, such as lending or insurance, can be funded in the  capital markets. Lenders and insurers continue to provide the primary  products to the customers, but these financial instruments allow the  funding of the products to be \u201cunbundled\u201d from the lending and insurance  business; instead, the funding comes from securities sold to capital market  investors. This process, called securitization, can give insurers access to  the large financial resources of the capital markets. With respect to  funding catastrophe risk in property-casualty insurance, the risk of  investing is tied to the potential occurrence of a specified catastrophic  event and to the quality of underwriting by insurers and reinsurers.", "In evaluating risk, capital market investors face the issue of moral hazard  because in the absence of well-developed contractual and business  relationships with primary market insurers, capital market investors might  be unable to monitor the primary insurance company\u2019s underwriting and  claims settlement practices that can act to increase risk. Nonindemnity- based coverage is a means to limit moral hazard for the investor by tying  payment to industry loss indexes, parametric measures, and models of  claims payments rather than actual claims that could be affected by lax  underwriting standards or lax settlement of claims by the ceding insurer.  However, such coverage introduces basis risk for the sponsoring insurance  company.", "Insurance companies are not regulated at the federal level but are to  comply with the laws of the states in which they operate. The insurance  regulators of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories  have created NAIC to coordinate regulation of multistate insurers. NAIC  serves as a forum for the development of uniform policy, and its  committees develop model laws and regulations governing the U.S.  insurance industry. Although not required to do so, most states either adopt  model laws or modify them to meet their specific needs and conditions.", "NAIC also has established statutory accounting standards, which are  intended for use by insurance departments, insurers, and auditors when  state statutes or regulations are silent. If not in conflict with state statutes  and regulation, or in cases when the state statutes are silent, statutory  accounting standards promulgated by NAIC are intended to apply. In  addition to statutory accounting standards, insurers use GAAP, which are  promulgated by FASB and are designed to meet the varying needs of both  insurance and noninsurance companies. Although NAIC\u2019s statutory  accounting standards use the framework established by GAAP, GAAP  stresses the measurement of earnings from period to period, while NAIC\u2019s  standards stress the measurement of ability to pay claims in the future.  NAIC has also developed the Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act,  adopted in some form in all states, which imposes automatic requirements  on insurers to file plans of action when their capital falls below minimum  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insurance and Reinsurance Markets Provide Catastrophe Risk Coverage and Capital Markets Add to Industry Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Natural catastrophes are infrequent events that can cause severe financial  losses.

More than 68 million Americans now live in hurricane-vulnerable coastal  areas. Eighty percent of Californians live near active faults. When natural  disasters occur they cause damage and destruction, which may or may not  be covered by insurance. The four most costly types of insured  catastrophic perils in the United States are earthquakes, hurricanes,  tornadoes, and hailstorms, although earthquakes and hurricanes pose the  most significant catastrophe risk in insurance markets. Figure 1 shows the  combined relative risk of these hazards across the United States.", "In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew swept ashore in Florida south of Miami  and at the time set a new record for insured losses. As shown in figure 2,  estimated losses from Andrew were about $30 billion, of which $15.5 billion  was insured. Payments of claims stemming from Andrew reduced the  capital of affected insurance companies and sharply reduced their capacity  to issue new policies. Some of Florida\u2019s largest homeowner insurance  companies had to be rescued by their parent companies and others had to  tap their surpluses to pay claims. Eleven property-casualty insurance  companies went into bankruptcy. In January 1994, an earthquake occurred  about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles in the Northridge area  of the San Fernando Valley. Also shown in figure 2, estimated losses from  the Northridge earthquake were about $30 billion, of which approximately  $12.5 billion was insured. Earthquake insurance coverage availability  declined precipitously after the Northridge earthquake.

Reinsurance helps  insurance companies underwrite large risks, limit liability on specific risks,  increase capacity, and share liability when claims overwhelm the primary  insurer\u2019s resources. In reinsurance transactions, one or more insurers  agree, for a premium, to indemnify another insurer against all or part of the  loss that an insurer may sustain under its policies.

In 1993, the Florida state legislature responded by  establishing the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund to provide  reinsurance for insurance companies operating in Florida. Also, the  Northridge earthquake raised serious questions about whether insurers  could pay earthquake claims for any major earthquake. In 1994, insurers  representing about 93 percent of the homeowners insurance market in  California severely restricted or refused to write new homeowners policies.  In 1996, the California state legislature responded by establishing the  California Earthquake Authority (CEA) to sell earthquake insurance to  homeowners and renters. Appendix III more fully discusses the  mechanisms established by Florida and California to deal with the risks  posed by such catastrophes.", "In one comprehensive study analyzing the pricing of U.S. catastrophe  reinsurance, the authors concluded that a catastrophic event, such as a  hurricane, reduced capital available to cover nonhurricane catastrophe  reinsurance, thereby affecting reinsurance prices. This finding is consistent  with the \u201cbundled\u201d nature of capital investment in traditional reinsurance  (i.e., capital investors face both the risks associated with company  management and the various perils covered by the insurance company).  Therefore, the finding suggests that price and availability swings for  catastrophe reinsurance covering one peril are affected by catastrophes  involving all other perils.", "Given the cyclic nature of the reinsurance market, investors have  incentives to look for alternative capital sources.

Other risk-linked securities, especially catastrophe bonds,  were created and used in the mid-1990s in the aftermath of Hurricane  Andrew and the Northridge earthquake. During this time, traditional  reinsurance prices were relatively high compared with other time periods.  While the most direct means for insurance companies to raise capital in the  capital market is issuing company stock, an investor in an insurance  company\u2019s stock is subject to the risks of the entire company. Therefore, an  investor\u2019s decision to purchase stock will depend on an assessment of the  insurance company\u2019s management, quality of operations, and overall risk  exposures from all perils. In contrast, an investor in an indemnity-based,  risk-linked security can face risk associated with the insurance company\u2019s  underwriting standards but does not take on the risk of the overall  insurance (or reinsurance) company\u2019s operations. The cost of issuing risk- linked securities, such as catastrophe bonds, includes the legal, accounting,  and information costs that are necessary to issue securities and market  them to investors who do not have contractual and/or business  relationships with the insurance company receiving coverage.

Demand for risk-linked securities by insurance and  reinsurance company sponsors will depend, in part, on the basis risk faced  and the ability of sponsors to hedge this basis risk.", "Although issuance of risk-linked securities has been limited, many of the  catastrophe bonds issued to date have provided reinsurance coverage for  catastrophe risk with the lowest probability and highest financial severity.  Insurance industry officials we interviewed told us that their use of risk- linked securities has lowered the cost of some catastrophe protection.

Insurance  companies and investment banks developed catastrophe bonds, and the  bonds are offered through the SPRVs. Recent catastrophe bonds have been  nonindemnity-based to limit moral hazard; therefore, they expose the  sponsor to basis risk. The SPRVs are usually established offshore to take  advantage of lower minimum required levels of capital, favorable tax  treatment, and a generally reduced level of regulatory scrutiny.", "Currently most risk-linked securities are catastrophe bonds. Most  catastrophe bonds issued to date have been noninvestment-grade bonds.  Catastrophe bonds achieved recognition in the mid-1990s. They offered  several advantages that catastrophe options did not, among them  customizable offerings and multiyear pricing. Catastrophe bonds, to date,  have been offered as private placements only to qualified institutional  buyers. A catastrophe bond offering is made through an SPRV that is  sponsored by an entity that may be an insurance or reinsurance company.  The SPRV provides reinsurance to a sponsoring insurance or reinsurance  company and is backed by securities issued to investors. The SPRVs are  similar in purpose to the special purpose entities (SPE) that banks and other entities have used for years to obtain funding for their loans.  These  SPEs pay investors from principal and interest payments made by  borrowers to the SPE. In contrast, the SPRVs that issue catastrophe bonds  receive payments in three forms (premiums, principal, and interest); invest  in securities; and pay investors in another form (interest). The SPRV  returns the principal to the investor if the specified catastrophe does not  occur. Figure 5 illustrates cash flows among the participants in a  catastrophe bond.", "As shown in figure 5, the sponsoring insurance company enters into a  reinsurance contract and pays reinsurance premiums to the SPRV to cover  specified claims. The SPRV issues bonds or debt securities for purchase by  investors. The catastrophe bond offering defines a catastrophe that would  trigger a loss of investor principal and, if triggered, a formula to specify the  compensation level from the investor to the SPRV. The SPRV is to hold the  funds raised from the catastrophe bond offering in a trust in the form of  Treasury securities and other highly rated assets. To avoid consolidation  on the sponsor\u2019s balance sheet, the trust also is to contain a minimum  independent equity-capital investment of at least 3 percent of the SPRV\u2019s  assets, per GAAP. According to a rating agency official, the 3 percent equity  capital is usually obtained from capital markets in the form of preferred  stock. Typically, investors earn a return of the London Interbank Offered  Rate (LIBOR) plus an agreed spread. The SPRV deposits the payment  from the investor as well as the premium from the company into a trust  account. The premium paid by the insurance or reinsurance company and  the investment income on the trust account provide the funding for the  interest payments to investors and the costs of running the SPRV.", "Under the terms of nonindemnity-based catastrophe bonds, for the  sponsoring insurance company to collect part or all of the investors\u2019  principal when the catastrophe occurs, an independent third party must  confirm that the objective catastrophic conditions were met, such as an  earthquake reaching 7.2 in moment magnitude as reported by the U.S.  Geological Survey. Such nonindemnity bonds also allow the sponsor to  continue to write new business without impacting the risk level of the bond  and provide for faster reimbursement to the sponsor in the event of a  catastrophe. The sponsor is exposed to basis risk because the claims on the  investors\u2019 principal might not fully hedge the sponsor\u2019s actual catastrophe  exposure. However, the sponsor has minimal credit risk\u2014the risk of  nonpayment in the event of the covered catastrophe\u2014because the bond is  fully collateralized. The SPRVs are usually established offshore\u2014typically  in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands\u2014to take advantage of lower minimum required levels of capital, favorable tax treatment, and a generally reduced  level of regulatory scrutiny.", "Bond rating agencies, such as Fitch, Moody\u2019s, and Standard & Poors,  provide bond ratings that are based on their assessment of loss  probabilities and financial severity. Some SPRVs have issued catastrophe  bonds in tranches having more than one risk structure. The rating  agencies rate the bonds according to expected loss. Catastrophe bonds  issued to date have generally received noninvestment-grade ratings  because investors face a higher risk of loss of their principal. The rating  agencies rely, in part, on the risk assessments of three major catastrophe- modeling firms\u2014the same firms are used by traditional reinsurers to help  them understand catastrophe risk. These modeling firms rely on large  computing capacity; sophisticated mathematical modeling techniques; and  very large databases containing information on past catastrophes,  population densities, construction techniques, and other relevant  information to assess loss probabilities and financial severities.  Catastrophe bond-offering statements to investors include rating  information and the results from the catastrophe modeling.", "One example of a catastrophe bond is Redwood Capital I, Ltd., which is  linked to California earthquakes. Lehman Re, a reinsurance company, is the  sponsor of the bond. Due to the catastrophe bond structure, investors are  exposed to potential loss of principal of about $160 million. The contract  provides insurance for 12 months beginning January 1, 2002, covering  specified earthquake losses to property in California.

These regulatory requirements are designed to  ensure that a true transfer of risk has occurred and the reinsurance  company will be able to pay any claims. In receiving \u201ccredit\u201d for  reinsurance, an insurance company may count the payments owed it from  the reinsurance company on claims it has paid as an asset or as a deduction  from liability. In doing so, a company can increase earnings reported on its  financial statement and lower the amount of capital it needs to meet risk- based capital requirements established by regulators.

Some  risk-linked securities have also provided payments from principal on an  indemnity basis, and, under insurance accounting principles, these risk- linked securities have enabled the SPRVs to provide reinsurance that has  received what is called \u201cunderwriting accounting treatment,\u201d thereby  allowing the SPRV sponsor to gain credit for reinsurance. In other cases,  recovery under a catastrophe bond may not be indemnity based and may  rely on a financial model of the insured claims of the insurance company  rather than on the actual claims of the company. In these cases, there is a  risk that the modeled claims will not equal the insurance company\u2019s actual  claims. There are also risks that the financial model will produce a  recovery less or greater than the companies\u2019 incurred claims. Current  accounting guidance requires that the contract must indemnify the  company against loss or liability associated with insurance risk in order to  qualify for reinsurance accounting.", "However, NAIC is currently reconsidering the appropriate statutory  accounting treatment of nonindemnity-based insurance, which would  include risk-linked securities. Both exchange-traded instruments and  over-the-counter instruments can be used to hedge underwriting results  (i.e., to offset risk). The triggering event on a risk-linked contract must be  closely related to the insurance risks being hedged so that the payoff is  expected to be consistent with the expected claims, even though some  basis risk may still exist. This correlation is known as \u201chedge  effectiveness.\u201d  NAIC is currently considering how hedge effectiveness  should be measured. Should NAIC determine a  hedge-effectiveness  measure, statutory insurance accounting standards could be changed so  that a fair value of the contract could be calculated and recognized as an  offset to insurance losses, hence allowing a credit to the insurer similar to  that granted for reinsurance. If nonindemnity-based, risk-linked securities  are accepted by insurance regulators as an effective hedge of underwriting  results, they could help make such contracts more appealing to insurance  companies by providing treatment similar to that afforded traditional  reinsurance. Nevertheless, it is important yet difficult for U.S. insurance  regulators to develop an effective measure to account for risk reduction for  nonindemnity-based coverage so that insurance company reporting on  both risk evaluation and capital treatment properly reflects the risk  retained.

The use of an SPE (or more  specifically an SPRV) in a catastrophe bond securitization transaction  involves a number of complex financial accounting issues in the United  States. Current FASB guidance generally provides that the sponsor of an  SPE report all assets and liabilities of the SPE in its financial statements,  unless all of the following criteria are met: 1.", "Independent third-party owner\u2019s(s\u2019) investment in the SPE is at least 3  percent of the SPE\u2019s total debt and equity or total assets. 2. The independent third-party owner(s) has a controlling financial  interest in the SPE (generally meaning that the owner holds more than  50 percent of the voting interest of the SPE).", "3.", "Independent third-party owners must possess the substantive risk and  rewards of its investment in the SPE (generally meaning that the  owner\u2019s investment and potential return are \u201cat risk\u201d and not  guaranteed by another party).", "In response to issues arising from Enron\u2019s use of SPEs, FASB is currently  considering a new approach to accounting for SPEs. The new FASB  interpretation would require the primary beneficiary of an SPE to  consolidate (list assets and liabilities of) the SPE in its financial statements,  unless the SPE has \u201ceconomic substance\u201d sufficient not to be consolidated;  that is, the SPE would have to have the ability to fund or finance its  operations without assistance from or reliance on any other party involved  in the SPE. In turn, the SPE would have that ability if it had independent  third-party owners who have substantive voting equity investment at risk,  exposure to variable returns, and the ability to make decisions and manage  the SPE\u2019s activities. A presumption is set that substantive equity investment  in an SPE should be at least 10 percent of the SPE\u2019s total assets throughout  the life of the SPE. Therefore, according to information provided by FASB,  many existing SPEs would probably be consolidated on the sponsors\u2019  financial statements under the new requirement. The potential revision for  equity requirements is intended to improve transparency in capital  markets. According to rating agency officials, the current 3 percent  independent equity requirements in recent catastrophe bond transactions  have been met by issuing preferred stock. Our work did not determine the  extent to which the 3 percent independent equity requirement is currently  being met by the insurance industry.", "Bond market representatives told us that the proposed FASB equity  requirements also have the potential to create a substantial hurdle to  structuring catastrophe bond SPEs because few investors would be willing  to purchase preferred shares because of the difficulties in understanding  the risks. These representatives argue that risk-linked securitizations are  different from other securitizations using SPEs because the insurer does  not control the funds held by the SPE, and therefore, should not be subject  to the new 10 percent equity investment requirement.", "The proposed new FASB interpretation also considers who bears the  largest potential risks of the SPE when determining whether to consolidate  with the primary beneficiary. Should the primary beneficiary bear the  largest dollar loss if the SPE should fail, then consolidation would be  required with the primary beneficiary. According to one FASB  representative, one issue that needs to be considered is whether the insurer  or the investors should be responsible for reporting or consolidating the  assets and liabilities of the SPE in financial statements depending on who  bears the largest potential risks of the SPE. If an insurer must consolidate  the assets and liabilities of the SPE onto its own balance sheet, the insurer  will also lose part of the benefit of the reinsurance contract that it enters  into with the SPE.", "While the proposed guidance is intended to improve financial transparency  in capital markets, it could also increase the cost of issuing catastrophe  bonds and make them less attractive to sponsors.

To further encourage the  use of onshore SPRVs, NAIC\u2019s working group on securitization has  interacted with a group of insurance industry representatives that is  considering how to structure a legislative proposal to make onshore SPRVs  tax-exempt entities. The SPRVs have been established in offshore tax  haven jurisdictions, where the SPRV itself is not subject to any income or  other tax; the SPRVs also usually operate in a manner intended to help  ensure that they avoid U.S. taxation by conducting most activities outside  of the United States. Taxation of the U.S. holders of SPRV-issued  securities depends upon whether the securities are characterized as debt or  equity. This characterization in turn depends upon a number of factors,  including the likelihood of loss of principal, the relative degree of  subordination of the instrument in the SPRV\u2019s capital structure, and the  accounting treatment of the instrument.", "Although almost all SPRVs have been established offshore, there has been  interest in facilitating the creation of onshore transactions because it is  argued that onshore SPRVs would lessen transactional costs and afford  regulators greater scrutiny of the SPRVs\u2019 activities. NAIC has already  approved a model state insurance law that allows for the creation of an  onshore SPRV. Under the model law, an onshore SPRV would be an entity  domiciled in and organized under state law for a limited purpose. Insurance  regulators\u2019 scope of authority would be limited for the SPRVs, which would  be required to be minimally capitalized, and the domiciliary state\u2019s laws on  insolvency would apply to the SPRV.", "However, it is likely that the onshore SPRV would be subject to federal  income taxation, making the transaction more expensive. To further  encourage the use of onshore SPRVs, a group of industry attendees at the  NAIC\u2019s insurance securitization working group is considering a legislative  proposal to make the onshore SPRVs tax-exempt. Currently, the industry  representatives are considering using a structure that would receive tax  treatment similar to the treatment received by an issuer of asset- or  mortgage-backed securities. Issuers of asset-backed securities are  generally not subject to tax on the income from underlying assets as they  pass through the issuer to the investors in the securities. It would not be  economical for an SPE to issue an asset-backed security if the SPE  incurred material tax costs on the payments collected and paid over to the  investors as taxable income. Securitizations address the problem of taxes  in one of two ways:  First, if an asset-backed security is considered debt for  tax purposes, deductions are allowed for the interest expense, and the tax  burden is shifted to the investors. Second, if the securities are not classified  as debt, tax is avoided by treating the SPE as a pass-through entity with  income allocated and taxed to its owners.", "The current proposal by the industry representatives would create a  structure similar to a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC)  or a Financial Asset Securitization Investment Trust (FASIT). REMICs and  FASITs are pools of real property mortgages or debt instruments that issue  multiple classes, or tranches, of financial payments among investors. The  REMIC and FASIT legislation adopt two approaches to avoiding an issuer  tax:  They treat the issuer as a pass-through entity and classify regular  interest as debt for purposes of allowing an interest deduction to the issuer.  The proposal would mimic REMICs and FASITs by providing pass-through  treatment for the onshore SPRV and ensuring that the regular payments in  the SPRV are classified as debt. To the extent that domestic SPRVs gained  business at the expense of taxable entities, the federal government could  experience tax revenue losses. The statutory and regulatory requirements  used to implement any such legislation would also affect tax revenue.", "Expanded use of catastrophe bonds might occur with favorable  implementing requirements, but such legislative actions may also create  pressure from other industry sectors for similar tax treatment.", "Also, some elements of the insurance industry believe that any  consideration of changes to the tax treatment of domestic SPRVs would  have to take into account the taxation of domestic reinsurance companies.  Domestic reinsurance companies are taxed under the special rules of  Subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, all  insurance companies are taxed as corporations.  Premiums earned by a  domestic reinsurance company, after deducting premiums paid for  retrocessional insurance coverage, are taxable. Investment income earned  by the reinsurer is also taxable. A ceding commission paid by a reinsurer to  an insurer to cover costs, including marketing and sale of the premium, is  taxable to the ceding insurance company. However, many reinsurers are  either incorporated offshore or are affiliated with companies created  offshore to take advantage of reduced levels of taxation. Payments to an  offshore reinsurer may be subject to an excise tax. In addition, because of  the potential for abuses, the Secretary of the Treasury has special statutory  authority to reallocate deductions, assets, and income between unrelated  parties when a reinsurance transaction has a significant tax avoidance  effect.", "RAA officials expressed concerns about the impact of NAIC\u2019s model act  creating an onshore SPRV. RAA objects to both the special regulatory  treatment in the model act and the tax advantages proposed for the  onshore SPRV. RAA argues that the NAIC model act creates a new class of  reinsurer that will operate under regulatory and tax advantages not  afforded to existing U.S. licensed and taxed reinsurance companies.

However,  RAA took exception to (1) our characterization of reinsurance industry  capacity and (2) our description of risk-linked securities as an alternative  to reinsurance. RAA noted that in recent occurrences of major catastrophic  events in the United States, insurers and reinsurers had sufficient capital to  meet their obligations and added that most of the California and Florida  market was underwritten by insurers that relied very little, if at all, on  reinsurance capacity. First, we note that while the reinsurance industry has  been able to meet its obligations from recent events with existing capacity,  the industry\u2019s capacity must be considered along with issues related to (1)  the price and availability of catastrophic reinsurance in high-risk areas and  (2) its ability to handle multiple, sequential catastrophes. Some insurers  who self-reinsure might do so partially because they believe that the price  of reinsurance to cover their exposure to catastrophic events is not  attractive. Second, RAA asked that we characterize risk-linked securities as  a supplement to reinsurance rather than as an alternative because of the  relatively small amount of reinsurance coverage currently provided  through risk-linked securities. We agree, and our report states that risk- linked securities add to or supplement reinsurance capacity, but we also  note that sponsors of catastrophe bonds view these securities as  alternatives to traditional reinsurance when they are more cost-effective.", "BMA stated that our report was accurate and well-researched and  commented on several policy issues raised in the report. Their letter raised  several concerns with our discussion of tax treatment, accounting  treatment, and investor interest in risk-linked securities. First, BMA  disagreed with concerns cited in our report that pass-through tax treatment  for risk-linked securities could result in (1) tax revenue losses and (2) regulatory and tax advantages that are not afforded to existing U.S.- licensed and taxed reinsurance companies. BMA commented that because  a large percentage of entities that provide reinsurance coverage is based  outside of the United States, including all reinsurance companies  established since September 11, 2001, the tax impact would not be  dramatic. In addition, BMA noted that any potential loss of U.S. tax revenue  must be weighed against the policy benefits associated with creating  additional private-sector capacity to absorb and distribute insurance risk.  We agree that many reinsurance entities are not U.S.-based, but the  potential tax revenue losses would depend on a number of factors,  including business lost by taxable entities and the regulatory requirements  used to implement such legislation. We also agree that many considerations  must be weighed in the policy decision to grant special tax treatment for  onshore SPRVs, including potential tax revenue losses and the extent to  which an uneven playing field is created for domestic reinsurance  companies.", "Second, BMA commented that our description of FASB\u2019s SPE consolidation  proposal was not based on the final exposure draft and that they interpret  the proposal to allow SPRVs to apply only a variable interests approach and  not satisfy a particular outside equity threshold.

While we did  not evaluate BMA\u2019s interpretation of the FASB proposal, we included their  position in our report. Finally, BMA commented that our discussion of  reasons for the lack of broader investor participation in risk-linked  securities was incomplete and somewhat inaccurate. They noted that  several mutual funds have purchased risk-linked securities as part of their  overall portfolios, that mutual fund managers are well-equipped to evaluate  the risk associated with these securities, and that lack of broader investor  participation may be due to limited issuance. We agree that some mutual  funds have purchased risk-linked securities and that lack of broader  participation may be attributed to some degree to limited issuance of risk- linked securities.

Reinsurance transactions over the years have increased in complexity and  sophistication. Reinsurance accounting practices are influenced not only  by state insurance departments through NAIC, but also by SEC and FASB.

The regulatory requirements for allowing credit  for reinsurance are designed to ensure that a true transfer of risk has  occurred and any recoveries from reinsurance are collectible. By obtaining  reinsurance, ceding companies are able to write more policies and obtain  premium income while transferring a portion of the liability risk to the  reinsurer. Under many reinsurance contracts, a commission is paid by the  reinsurer to the ceding company to offset the ceding company\u2019s initial  acquisition cost, premium taxes and fees, assessments, and general  overhead. For example, if an insurer would like to receive reinsurance for  $10 million and negotiates a 20 percent ceding commission, then the  insurer will be required to pay the reinsurer $8 million ($10 million  premiums ceded, less $2 million ceding commission income). The effect of  this transaction is to reduce the ceding company\u2019s assets by the $8 million  paid for reinsurance, while reducing the company\u2019s liability for unearned  premiums by the $10 million in liabilities transferred to the reinsurer. The  $2 million is recorded by the ceding company as commission income. This  type of transaction results in an economic benefit for the ceding company  because the ceding commission increases equity. The reinsurer has  assumed a $10 million liability and would basically report a mirror entry  that would have the opposite effects on its financial statements.
