Some of these efforts have been effective and others less so. For example, the Special 301 process--the U.S. Trade Representative's process for identifying foreign countries that lack adequate IP protection--has been seen as effective because it compiles input from multiple agencies and serves to identify IP issues of concern in particular countries. Other interagency efforts, such as the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council (NIPLECC), are viewed as being less effective because little has been produced beyond summarizing agencies' actions in the IP arena. While STOP has energized IP protection and enforcement efforts domestically and abroad, our initial work indicates that its long-term role is uncertain. STOP has been successful in fostering coordination, such as reaching out to foreign governments and private sector groups. Private sector views on STOP were generally positive; however, some stated that it emphasizes IP protection and enforcement efforts that would have occurred regardless of STOP's existence. STOP's lack of permanent status and accountability mechanisms pose challenges for its long-term impact and Congressional oversight. STOP faces challenges in meeting some of its objectives, such as increasing efforts to seize counterfeit goods at the border--an effort for which the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are responsible. CBP has certain steps underway, but our initial work indicates that resources for IP enforcement at certain ports have declined as attention has shifted to national security concerns. In addition, prior GAO work found internal control weaknesses in an import mechanism through which a significant portion of imports flow, and which has been used to smuggle counterfeit goods."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to appear again before the subcommittee to  discuss our work on U.S. efforts to protect U.S. intellectual property (IP)  rights.

However, because protection  of intellectual property in many parts of the world is inadequate, U.S.  goods are subject to substantial counterfeiting and piracy. Such goods are  widely distributed in global markets, including here in the United States.  As you stated in this Subcommittee\u2019s June 2005 hearing on IP protection,  the production and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods create  health and safety hazards for consumers, damage companies that are  victims of this theft, and pose a threat to the U.S. economy.", "Since my last testimony before this committee, the United States has  continued to develop and implement its Strategy for Targeting Organized  Piracy, or STOP, which outlines priority IP enforcement efforts of six  agencies.

However, there is no corresponding trend in  the estimated value of such seizures. The estimated value of goods seized  in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 was $99 million and $94 million, respectively.  This figure jumped to a peak of about $139 million in fiscal year 2004, but  dropped back to the former level, about $93 million, in fiscal year 2005.", "According to CBP officials, the agency\u2019s goal is to focus its resources in  part on high-value seizures, but a large percentage of annual seizure  activity does not result in a significant seizure value. For example, nearly  75 percent of fiscal year 2005 seizures were small-scale shipments made at  mail and express consignment facilities (facilities operated by companies  that offer express commercial services to move mail and cargo, such as  the United Parcel Service) or from individuals traveling by air, vehicle, or  on foot. These seizures represented about 14 percent of total estimated  seizure value in that year. Conversely, about 14 percent of fiscal year 2005  seizures involved large-scale shipments (i.e., containers) and accounted  for about 55 percent of that year\u2019s estimated seizure value. The number of  seizures made on goods emanating from China has risen from about 49  percent of the estimated domestic value of all IP seizures in fiscal year  2002 to about 69 percent in fiscal year 2005.", "While CBP seizes goods across a range of product sectors, in recent years,  seizures tend to be concentrated in particular goods, such as apparel,  handbags, cigarettes, and consumer electronics. CBP also seeks to  increase seizures of goods involving public health and safety risks, and its  data shows that the estimated domestic value of seized goods involving  certain health and safety risks, specifically pharmaceuticals, electrical  articles, and batteries, increased during fiscal years 2002-2005. However,  seizures in these and certain other health and safety categories  represented less than 10 percent of the total estimated domestic value of  seizures in fiscal year 2005, and seizures of other potentially dangerous  goods, such as counterfeit auto parts, remain relatively limited. For  example, CBP estimated in a letter to an automotive industry trade  association that it made 14 seizures in fiscal years 2003-2005 of certain  automotive parts.

The strategy addresses several components of IP  enforcement, such as targeting (identifying high risk shipments),  international coordination, communication to employees, and industry  outreach. A CBP official who oversees the IP strategy told us that CBP  seeks to perform IP enforcement more efficiently, and the strategy notes  the importance of conducting IP enforcement while minimizing the burden  on front line resources whose priority is national security.

To develop the model, CBP examined  elements of past seizures and container examinations and identified  certain factors that were significant characteristics of IP-infringing imports  and that could be used to identify future IP rights violations. CBP piloted  this model on a nation-wide basis for about one month in February 2005,  but the pilot revealed several issues that need to be addressed before the  model can be implemented. CBP plans to pilot the model again for up to 3  months this summer at two land border ports and one seaport. CBP will  use the results of the second pilot to further evaluate the viability of the  model.", "Another STOP-related activity for CBP is the use of post-entry audits to  assist with IP enforcement. CBP officials said using such audits for this  purpose is a new approach that is designed to assess whether companies  have adequate internal controls to prevent them from importing goods that  infringe IP rights. Initiated in fiscal year 2005, these audits are a novel  approach that is likely to work best with established importers, but they  may be less effective for dealing with importers that are engaged in  criminal activity and deliberately take steps to evade federal scrutiny. CBP  selected 40 known and potential IP-infringing companies to audit in fiscal  years 2005-2006, and by July 2006 had completed 17 of these audits. In  three audits, CBP found that the companies possessed or had already sold  infringing goods that were not seized at the border. In two of these cases,  CBP imposed penalties on the companies totaling about $4.6 million. In  the third case, the audit closed in September 2005, but the decision on  whether to impose penalties is still pending in CBP. A CBP official said  that some less significant IP-infringing activity was found in several other  audits, but CBP chose not to impose penalties in these cases. CBP also  found that internal controls to prevent IP rights violations were lacking or  inadequate for most of the 17 companies, and has worked with them to  improve these controls.", "A third STOP activity for CBP is the development of a system that allows  companies to electronically record their IP rights through CBP\u2019s website.  While trademark and copyright protection is obtained from USPTO and  the Copyright Office, respectively, these rights must be separately  recorded with CBP, for a fee. Recording with CBP provides CBP officials  with information about the scope, ownership, and representation of  protected IP rights being recorded. Although CBP officials have said  recordation is important because it helps CBP effect legally defensible  border enforcement, some companies fail to record their rights with CBP,  either because they are unaware of the recordation requirement or  because they choose not to. The electronic recordation system,  implemented in December 2005, is designed to streamline the process;  reduce processing times; and, ideally, increase the number of  recordations. A link to the recordation system has been established on  USPTO\u2019s website, and a link from the Copyright Office is planned. CBP  expects that most paper-based applications will eventually be eliminated.  While these are important steps, we have not yet evaluated the impact of  the new recordation system. Several industry representatives have cited  other concerns about recordation generally, such as long recordation  processing times and the effective lack of border protection caused by the  inability to record copyrights with CBP before such rights are issued by  the Copyright Office.

Some CBP officials said the in-bond system may  contribute to imports of counterfeits by allowing some importers to \u201cport  shop\u201d for ports that are less likely to identify IP violations. Indeed, CBP  has made sizable IP-related seizures from the in-bond system, including  220 seizures valued at about $41 million in fiscal year 2004, representing  nearly 30 percent of the total estimated domestic value of IP seizures in  that year. In fiscal year 2005, there were 126 seizures valued at about $14  million, representing about 15 percent of estimated domestic value of IP  seizures that year.", "We have found weaknesses in the past with the in-bond system and are  currently conducting follow-up work to determine whether these  weaknesses have been corrected. Our audit is still underway, but work to  date indicates that some previously identified weaknesses in tracking and  monitoring in-bonds remain. For example, in January 2004 GAO reported  that CBP collects significantly less information on in-bond shipment than  for regular entries and that this lack of information makes tracking in- bond shipments more difficult. In our recent work, CBP staff continue to  observe that the limited information required from importers on in-bond  shipments makes it difficult for CBP to ensure that the shipments have  reached their proper destinations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Intellectual property protection is an issue that requires the involvement of  many U.S. agencies, and the U.S. government has employed a number of  mechanisms to combat different aspects of IP crimes, with varying levels  of success. The STOP initiative, the most recent coordinating mechanism,  has brought attention and energy to IP efforts within the U.S. government,  and participants and industry observers have generally supported the new  effort. At the same time, the challenges of IP piracy are enormous, and will  require the sustained and coordinated efforts of U.S. agencies, their  foreign counterparts, and industry representatives to be successful. Our  initial observations on the structure of STOP suggest that it is not well  suited to address the problem over the long term, as the presidential  initiative does not have permanence or the accountability mechanisms  that would facilitate oversight by the Congress. Our ongoing work on IP  protection efforts at the U.S. border, one of the five areas identified by  STOP, also illustrates the types of challenges that need sustained attention  to make progress on the issue. We believe that our more detailed reports  to be released in the near future will contribute to continuing  Congressional oversight of these issues.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
