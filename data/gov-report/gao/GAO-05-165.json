Wastewater facilities in the United States provide essential services to residential, commercial, and industrial users by collecting and treating wastewater and discharging it into receiving waters. These facilities, however, may possess certain characteristics that terrorists could exploit either to impair the wastewater treatment process or to damage surrounding communities and infrastructure. GAO was asked to obtain experts' views on (1) the key security-related vulnerabilities affecting the nation's wastewater systems, (2) the activities the federal government should support to improve wastewater security, and (3) the criteria that should be used to determine how any federal funds are allocated to improve security, and the best methods to distribute these funds. GAO conducted a systematic, Web-based survey of 50 nationally recognized experts to seek consensus on these key wastewater security issues. EPA expressed general agreement with the report, citing its value as the agency works with its partners to better secure the nation's critical wastewater infrastructure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Experts identified the collection system's network of sewer lines as the most vulnerable asset of a wastewater utility. Experts stated that the sewers could be used either as a means to covertly gain access to surrounding buildings or as a conduit to inject hazardous substances that could impair a wastewater treatment plant's capabilities. Among the other vulnerabilities most frequently cited were the storage and transportation of chemicals used in the wastewater treatment process and the automated systems that control many vital operations. In addition, experts described a number of vulnerabilities not specific to particular assets but which may also affect the security of wastewater facilities. These vulnerabilities include a general lack of security awareness among wastewater facility staff and administrators, interdependencies among various wastewater facility components leading to the possibility that the disruption of a single component could take down the entire system, and interdependencies between wastewater facilities and other critical infrastructures. Experts identified several key activities as most deserving of federal funds to improve wastewater facilities' security. Among those most frequently cited was the replacement of gaseous chemicals used in the disinfection process with less hazardous alternatives. This activity was rated as warranting highest priority for federal funding by 29 of 50 experts. Other security-enhancing activities most often rated as warranting highest priority included improving local, state, and regional collaboration (23 of 50 experts) and supporting facilities' efforts to comprehensively assess their vulnerabilities (20 of 50 experts). When asked how federal wastewater security funds should be allocated among potential recipients, the vast majority of experts suggested that wastewater utilities serving critical infrastructure (e.g., public health institutions, government, commercial and industrial centers) should be given highest priority (39 of 50). Other recipients warranting highest priority included utilities using large quantities of gaseous chemicals (26 of 50) and utilities serving areas with large populations (24 of 50). Experts identified direct federal grants as the most effective method to distribute the funds, noting particular circumstances in which a matching contribution should be sought from recipients. Specifically, a matching requirement was often recommended to fund activities that benefit individual utilities. Grants with no matching requirements were often recommended for activities that should be implemented more quickly and would benefit multiple utilities. The other funding mechanisms experts mentioned most frequently included the federal Clean Water State Revolving Fund, loans or loan guarantees, trust funds, and tax incentives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As requested, this report discusses the views of nationally recognized  experts on key issues concerning wastewater security, including the  potential vulnerabilities of wastewater systems; activities that most  warrant federal support to mitigate the risk of terrorism; and the criteria  that the experts believe should be used to determine how any federal funds  are allocated among recipients to improve their security and the methods  the experts suggest should be used to distribute these funds.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

While more federal resources have been directed toward  drinking water security than wastewater security, some maintain that  wastewater systems, like drinking water systems, also possess  vulnerabilities that could be exploited. The unique characteristics and  components these systems possess provide for the efficient collection,  treatment, and disposal of wastewater\u2014functions that are vital to the  health of the general public and the environment. However, many of these  same characteristics and components have been identified as potential  means for carrying out a terrorist attack. A terrorist could seek to impair a  wastewater system\u2019s treatment process, to use a wastewater system to  carry out an attack elsewhere, or some combination of both.", "Documented accidents and intentional acts highlight the destruction that  arises from an attack on a wastewater system. For example, in June 1977 in  Akron, Ohio, an intentional release of naptha, a cleaning solvent, and  alcohol into a sewer by vandals at a rubber manufacturing plant caused  explosions 3.5 miles away from the plant, damaging about 5,400 feet of  sewer line and resulting in more than $10 million in damage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Nation\u2019s Wastewater Systems and the Populations They Serve", "paragraphs": ["A majority of the nation\u2019s wastewater is treated by publicly owned  treatment works (POTW) that serve a variety of customers, including  private homes, businesses, hospitals, and industry. These POTWs discharge  treated water into surface waters and are regulated under the Clean Water  Act. Nationwide, there are over 16,000 publicly owned wastewater  treatment plants, approximately 800,000 miles of sewers, and 100,000 major  pumping stations. This infrastructure serves more than 200 million people,  or about 70 percent of the nation\u2019s total population.

Sewers are connected  to all buildings and streets within typical communities through indoor  plumbing and curb drains.", "Most systems were designed for easy and frequent access to facilitate  maintenance activities. Access for these purposes is usually conducted  through manholes that are typically located approximately every 300 feet.  Many collection systems rely on gravity to maintain the flow of sewage  through the pipes toward the treatment plant. However, the geographic  expanse of a collection system, both in size and topography, may impede  the flow. For this reason, collection systems may depend on pumping  stations to lift the flow to gain elevation for continued gravity flow until the  wastewater reaches the wastewater treatment plant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Wastewater Treatment Plant", "paragraphs": ["Once the wastewater enters the treatment plant (influent) through the  collection system, the treatment process removes contaminants such as  organic material, dirt, fats, oils and greases, nitrogen, phosphorus, and  bacteria. The influent typically undergoes several stages of treatment  before it is released. Primary treatment includes the removal of larger  objects, such as rags, cans, or driftwood, through a screening device or a  grit removal system, and solids are removed through sedimentation.  Secondary treatment includes a biological process that consumes  pollutants, as well as final sedimentation. Some facilities also use tertiary  treatment to remove nutrients and other matter even further. Following  secondary or tertiary treatment, the wastewater is disinfected to destroy  harmful bacteria and viruses. Disinfection is often accomplished with  chlorine, which is stored on-site at the wastewater treatment plant. The  collection and treatment process is typically monitored and controlled by a  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, which allows  utilities to control such things as the amount of chlorine needed for  disinfection."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Government and Industry Have Recently Sought to Improve Security", "paragraphs": ["In December 2003, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-7 (HSPD-7), which established a national policy for federal  departments and agencies to identify and set priorities for the nation\u2019s  critical infrastructures and to protect them from terrorist attacks. HSPD-7  established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the lead federal  agency to oversee the security of the water sector, both drinking water and  wastewater. Presidential Decision Directive 63 had done so earlier in May  1998, with a focus primarily on drinking water. Based on the 1998 directive,  EPA and its industry partner, the Association of Metropolitan Water  Agencies (AMWA) established a communication system, the Water  Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Water ISAC). The Water ISAC  was designed to provide real-time alerts of possible terrorist activity and  access to a library of information and contaminant databases to water  utilities throughout the nation. In fiscal year 2004, Congress appropriated  $2 million for the Water ISAC, which today serves more than 1,000 users  from water and wastewater systems. In November 2004, the Water ISAC  launched a free security advisory system known as the Water Security  Channel to distribute federal advisories on security threats via e-mail to the  water sector.", "EPA recently established a Water Security Working Group to advise the  National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC) on ways to address  several specific security needs of the sector.  The working group is made up  of 16 members selected on the basis of experience, geographic location,  and their unique drinking water, wastewater, or security perspectives.  It  represents a diverse collection of drinking water and wastewater utilities of  all sizes, state and local public health agencies, and environmental and rate- setting organizations.  The group's charge includes making  recommendations to the full council by the spring of 2005 that identify  features of an active and effective security program and ways to measure  the adoption of these practices.  The working group is also charged with  identifying incentives for the voluntary adoption of an active and effective  security program in the water and wastewater sector.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is also seeking to enhance  communication between critical infrastructure sectors, like the water  sector, with the government. The Homeland Security Information Network  (HSIN) is being developed to provide the water sector with a suite of  information and communication tools to share critical information both  within the sector, across other sectors, and with DHS. According to DHS,  these information and collaboration tools will facilitate the protection,  stability, and reliability of the nation\u2019s critical water infrastructure and  provide threat-related information to law enforcement and emergency  managers on a daily basis. A Water Sector Coordinating Council  established by the department with representative members of the water  sector community is charged with identifying information and other needs  of the sector, including the appropriate use of and the relationships among  ISAC, the Water Security Channel, and HSIN. According to a DHS official,  the department is also assembling a Government Coordinating Council  made up of federal, state, and local officials to assess impacts across  critical infrastructure sectors, including the water sector.", "While federal law does not address wastewater security as  comprehensively as it addresses drinking water security, wastewater  utilities have taken steps, both in concert with EPA and on their own, to  protect their critical components. Since 2002, EPA has provided more than  $10 million to help address the security needs of the wastewater sector. A  large portion of this funding has been awarded to nonprofit technical  support and trade organizations including the Association of Metropolitan  Sewerage Agencies (AMSA) and the Water Environment Federation to  develop tools and training on conducting vulnerability assessments to  reduce utility vulnerabilities and on planning for and practicing response to  emergencies and incidents. Also, according to EPA, because of the  relationship between the drinking water and wastewater sectors, much of  the work and funding that has been allocated for drinking water security  also directly benefits the wastewater sector. The Water Environment  Research Foundation, for instance, has been conducting research on cyber  security, real-time monitoring, the effects of contaminants on treatment  systems, and other topics that could benefit both sectors. In addition, EPA  has supported the development of a variety of resource documents for  utilities such as guidance on addressing threats and security product guides  for evaluating available technologies and has offered additional technical  support to small systems.", "To assist in the completion of vulnerability assessments, AMSA with EPA  funding cited above, developed technical assistance documents and  software including the Vulnerability Self Assessment Tool (VSAT) that are  available free of charge to water and wastewater systems. The VSAT  methodology and software offers utilities a structured approach for  assessing their vulnerabilities and establishing a risk-based approach to  taking desired actions.", "Even though the wastewater industry has not been required by law to  undertake the security measures undertaken by drinking water utilities,  many in the industry maintain that enhanced security must be pursued.  They note, however, that the implementation of security measures imposes  additional financial costs on a sector that is already experiencing difficulty  in meeting the financial challenges of an aging infrastructure. Accordingly,  the industry has sought federal assistance through the congressional  appropriations process. In 2003, Congress responded by considering  legislation that would have authorized $200 million for use in making grants  to wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement  security improvements, $15 million for technical assistance for small  systems, and $5 million over 5 years for refinement to vulnerability  assessment methodologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As requested by the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate  Committee on Environment and Public Works, this report identifies  experts\u2019 views on the following questions:  What are the key security-related vulnerabilities affecting the nation\u2019s  wastewater systems?", "What specific activities should the federal government support to  improve wastewater security?", "What are the criteria that should be used to determine how federal funds  are allocated among recipients to improve wastewater security, and how  should the funds be distributed?", "It was outside the scope of this review to ascertain the desirability of using  federal funds to support wastewater security or to compare the merits of  federal support of the wastewater industry with others such as the electric  power or transportation industries.

The Delphi method is a systematic process  for obtaining individuals\u2019 views and seeking consensus among them on a  question or problem of interest. Since first developed by the RAND  Corporation in the 1950s, the Delphi method has generally been  implemented using face-to-face group discussions. For this study, however,  we adapted the method to use on the Internet. We used this approach, in  part, to eliminate the potential bias associated with group discussions.  These biasing effects include the dominance of individuals and group  pressure for conformity. Moreover, by creating a virtual panel, we were  able to include many more experts than possible with a live panel, allowing  us to obtain a broad range of opinions.", "For each phase in our three-phase Delphi process, we posted a  questionnaire on GAO\u2019s survey Web site.

Of these assets,  experts ranked the collection systems\u2019 network of sewers and treatment  chemicals as the most vulnerable.", "Experts also identified overarching vulnerabilities that could compromise  the overall integrity of the systems\u2019 security. These vulnerabilities include  (1) a general lack of security awareness within the wastewater sector; (2)  interdependencies among components of the wastewater system, opening  the possibility that a failure of any individual component could bring down  the entire system; and (3) interdependencies between the wastewater  system and other critical infrastructure that could fail, such as electric  power supplies.", "In general, our panel of experts\u2019 observations were consistent with those of  major organizations that have conducted research on wastewater system  vulnerabilities.

Experts explained  that adversaries could use the network of sewers to (1) covertly gain  access to intended targets within the service area or to (2) convey  hazardous or flammable substances that may cause explosions at points  along the system or cause harm to the wastewater treatment system or  process.", "Access controls to important installations, such as perimeter fencing, can be countered by a  terrorist gaining access to the facility unseen by using the underground collectors. Once  access is gained, any activity could then occur\u2014target reconnaissance or surveillance,  planting of conventional explosives or weapons of mass destruction, hostage taking,   theft of critical documents and items.", "Many experts also suggested that adversaries could use the collection  system as an underground transport system\u2014without ever physically  entering the system\u2014for explosive or toxic agents. These substances could  be inserted into the system through storm drains, manholes, or household  drains. Several experts explained that with prior knowledge of a system\u2019s  gravity flow, an adversary could calculate the precise timing and location of  an explosion or calculate the amount of a substance that might be  necessary to disable or destroy the biological processes of a wastewater  treatment plant.", "However, even without precise knowledge about a system, significant  damage can occur as a result of underground sewer explosions. These  explosions may also damage natural gas or electric lines often co-located  with sewers. One expert cited the effects of an unintentional explosion that  occurred in 1981 in Louisville, Kentucky, where thousands of gallons of a  highly flammable solvent, hexane, spilled into the sewer lines from a local  processing plant. The fumes created an explosive mixture that was  eventually ignited by a spark from a passing car. The result was a series of  explosions that collapsed a 12-foot diameter pipe and damaged more than 2  miles of streets. While no one was seriously injured, sewer line repairs took  20 months, followed by several more months to repair the streets. A more  serious incident occurred in Guadalajara, Mexico, when a gasoline leak  into a sewer, in April 1992, caused explosions that killed 215 people, injured  1,500 others, damaged 1,600 buildings, and destroyed 1.25 miles of sewer.  The explosion created craters as deep as 24 feet and as large as 150 feet in  diameter. Another alarming incident was an intentional release of a  cleaning solvent (naptha) and alcohol into a sewer that caused explosions  3.5 miles away from the source and damaged about 5,400 feet of sewer line.  This June 1977 incident in Akron, Ohio, by vandals at a rubber  manufacturing plant resulted in more than $10 million in damage.", "Adversaries may also use the system to convey substances that disable the  treatment process. For example, as one expert explained, an adversary  could introduce a highly toxic chemical into the sewer that could damage  the biological processes involved in treatment. Several experts warned that  disabling the treatment process could cause the release of improperly  treated sewage, placing the receiving water in jeopardy and potentially  harming human health and the environment. In February 2002, such an  incident occurred in Hagerstown, Maryland, when chemicals from an  unknown source entered the wastewater treatment plant and destroyed the  facility\u2019s biological treatment process. This incident resulted in the  discharge of millions of gallons of partially treated sewage into a major  tributary of the Potomac River, less than 100 miles from a water supply  intake for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wastewater Treatment Chemicals", "paragraphs": ["Thirty-two of the 50 experts we surveyed identified process chemicals used  in wastewater treatment as among the top five terrorist-related wastewater  system vulnerabilities. Wastewater treatment facilities use a variety of  chemicals, including chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia during the  treatment process. Most experts singled out chlorine gas as a major  chemical of concern because it is an extremely volatile and hazardous  chemical that requires specific precautions for its safe transport, storage,  and use.", "Chlorine is a disinfectant that is commonly used in the treatment process  before treated water (effluent) is discharged into local waterways.  However, if chlorine, which is stored and transported as a liquefied gas  under pressure, is accidentally released into the atmosphere, it quickly  turns into a potentially lethal gas. Because gaseous chlorine is heavier than  air, the cloud it forms tends to spread along the ground. Consequently,  accidental or intentional releases of chlorine could be extremely harmful to  those in the immediate area. Exposures to chlorine could burn eyes and  skin, inflame the lungs, and could be deadly if inhaled. One expert pointed  out that accidental releases of chlorine gas have occurred numerous times  and that a deliberate release would be relatively feasible. The expert  further explained that many wastewater plants have been converting from  chlorine gas to alternative disinfection methods for various reasons,  including the risk of a release.", "Recognizing that chlorine gas releases pose threats to the public and the  environment, EPA requires, among other things, that any facility storing at  least 2,500 pounds of chlorine gas submit a risk management plan; as of  December 2004, EPA estimates that about 1,200 plants fit this category. The  plan includes an estimate of the potential consequences to surrounding  communities of hypothetical accidental \u201cworst-case\u201d chemical releases  from their plants. These estimates include the residential population  located within the range of a toxic gas cloud produced by a \u201cworst-case\u201d  chemical release, called the vulnerable zone.", "Several experts stated that a terrorist could use chlorine gas as a weapon,  either at a wastewater plant that is in close proximity to a specific target  population, or through theft and use at another location. In fact, on  September 11, 2001, railroad tanker cars filled with toxic chemicals  including chlorine sat at a treatment plant across the river from the  Pentagon as it was being attacked. At that time, the population within the  plant\u2019s vulnerable zone was 1.7 million people. Within weeks after  September 11, this facility converted to an alternative disinfection method.  Other facilities have also eliminated the use of chlorine gas, choosing  instead chlorine-based technologies (e.g., sodium hypochlorite, calcium  hypochlorite, mixed oxidant generation) or nonchlorine-based  technologies (e.g., ozone and ultraviolet light). However, as one expert  noted, several dozen wastewater treatment plants in heavily populated  areas continue to use large amounts of chlorine gas.", "In addition to concerns over on-site chlorine storage, experts were also  concerned about the safe transport of chemicals to treatment facilities.  Chlorine is delivered to facilities via railways and highways and in various  container sizes ranging from 1-ton cylinders to 90-ton railroad cars (see  figs. 5 and 6). As experts noted, although rail tank cars are designed to  avoid leakage in the event of a derailment, and the containers can  theoretically withstand a bullet from a normal handgun or rifle, one expert  concluded that the \u201cuse of explosives to cause a rupture is well within the  skill set of a terrorist.\u201d", "Such an attack along a congested transportation corridor could have severe  public health and safety impacts. One expert said that before converting  from chlorine to alternative disinfection methods, a major wastewater  treatment plant in Washington, D.C., received its chlorine supply via rail  shipments that traversed through the center of the city, close to the U.S.", "Capitol Building and across two military installations before reaching its  final destination. Derailments of chlorine could have major impacts in  small communities as well, as occurred in Alberton, Montana, in April 1996.  One of the five tankers that derailed ruptured and reportedly released more  than 60 tons of chlorine. Subsequently, a toxic plume of chlorine gas  crossed the Clark Fork River, a major interstate, and surrounding  residences.

Specifically, more than half of the experts  (29 of 50) identified one or more of these components as among the top five  vulnerabilities. One expert explained that, historically, security was not a  consideration in site selection or design of these facilities. While many  utilities planned for natural disasters or vandalism, it was only after  September 11, that many utilities have considered how best to protect  against potential terrorist attacks.", "While experts expressed concern over the security of the entire treatment  plant, several identified the headworks as a component that is particularly  vulnerable to attack, as well as critical to the treatment process. This unit is  part of a plant\u2019s primary treatment process, where wastewater carried  through the collection system first enters the treatment plant. It is here that  large objects, such as cans, wood, and plastics are removed from the  wastewater stream. These structures may be open to the atmosphere and,  according to one expert, are easy to attack. Experts explained that  sabotage of the headworks could affect the proper working order of  subsequent treatment processes and could cause the immediate  interruption of the collection system, potentially restricting or completely  blocking wastewater flow. As one expert noted, restricted flow would  could cause backups through the collection system, and the stagnant  wastewater would become a public health hazard within hours, either  through physical contact or through cross-contamination of drinking water  supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control Systems", "paragraphs": ["Control systems were also listed as a key vulnerability by 18 of the 50  experts. Many wastewater systems are increasingly relying on the use of  these control systems, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  (SCADA) networks, to serve functions ranging from storing and processing  data to monitoring the system\u2019s condition and controlling its operation. The  primary role of SCADA systems is to monitor and control dispersed assets  from a central location. According to one expert, \u201cThe backbone for  process control is the SCADA system.\u201d The expert explained that several  factors contribute to the vulnerability of these controls, including typically  nonsecured process control rooms at treatment plants, remote access to  SCADA, and shared passwords between multiple users.", "Experts generally explained that an attack on these systems could interfere  with critical operations. For example, one expert explained that an  adversary could use SCADA systems to introduce either dangerously high  or inadequate levels of chemicals; reduce biological treatment levels; or  cause remote points along the collection system to fail. Although some  facilities could operate their systems manually should the automated  system fail or be compromised, others do not have the personnel or  equipment to do so. For example, as one expert noted, large valves in  modern plants are now typically operated electronically and seldom used  manual operation components (see fig. 7).", "While SCADA networks offer operators increased flexibility and efficiency  by controlling processes remotely, they were not designed with security in  mind. The security of these systems is, therefore, often weak. According to  our experts, while many facilities take advantage of their system\u2019s  flexibility, they often do not provide the necessary training on cyber  security or implement security measures such as rotating passwords or  securing network connections. Experts also explained that penetration of  SCADA systems, particularly those that may be nonencrypted and accessed  via the Internet, offers a particularly easy point of access and control of a  wastewater system. One expert provided an example of a breach in cyber  security in 2000 when such a system in Australia was attacked, causing the  release of thousands of gallons of raw sewage. While the actions were not  an act of terrorism, they illustrate how a computer or cyber-related attack  could be used to disrupt wastewater treatment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pumping Stations", "paragraphs": ["Sixteen of the 50 experts identified pumping stations, which are  components that help convey sewage to the wastewater treatment plant, as  among the top vulnerabilities.

The expert added that adverse effects on public  health and the environment are likely if the target pump station pumps  several million gallons per day of wastewater. Another expert explained,  that within a service area, one pumping station has the capacity to pump 25  million gallons of wastewater per day.", "Experts explained that the remoteness and geographic distribution of  pumping stations, and their lack of continuous surveillance, make them  particularly vulnerable (see fig. 8).

First, they pointed out that wastewater utilities  generally do not have a security culture because they are often more  focused on operational efficiency and may, therefore, be reluctant to add  security procedures and access control elements to their operations. For  example, one expert noted the ease with which many types of individuals  (employees, contractors, and visitors) and vehicles typically enter  wastewater treatment plant facilities. As this expert pointed out, some  facilities do not check to ensure that individuals entering the property have  legitimate reasons for being there. This expert also raised a concern about  the lack of inspection of incoming truckloads at some wastewater  treatment plants. An adversary could exploit this lack of security by  delivering contaminants or explosives to destroy the treatment process or  the entire facility. In addition to securing entrance checkpoints, two  experts suggested there is little background screening of utility employees.  One expert noted, \u201cPeople with criminal records, falsified educational  credentials, and other serious liabilities might be hired by utilities that fail  to thoroughly check their backgrounds. The result can be intentional acts  of terrorism on a utility.\u201d", "Second, experts pointed to interdependencies among all major wastewater  assets within the treatment system. The system as a whole relies on the  proper working order of all its components to treat a community\u2019s  wastewater. One expert explained that, because treatment plants are less  able to recover from an attack, they may have a higher level of security  than other assets, such as the collection system. However, because  collection and treatment are part of one integrated system, securing one  asset does not ensure that the system as a whole is more protected. For  example, gates and fences around the main treatment plant may stop an  adversary from coming onto the physical property, but it will not prevent a  harmful agent from entering the facility through the collection system\u2014an  event that could destroy the facility\u2019s entire secondary treatment process.", "Third, experts identified interdependencies between wastewater systems  and other critical infrastructures. As several experts explained, disruptions  in electric power, cyber systems, and transportation of treatment chemicals  can result in a failure of wastewater treatment systems. One expert  cautioned that the interruption of the power grid could render the  wastewater plant useless, noting, \u201cSeveral hours without power would  cause the biological treatment process to halt and wastewater would back  up on the collection system.\u201d Such an event occurred in 2003, when a major  power failure caused treatment plants in Cleveland, Ohio, to release at least  60 million gallons of raw untreated wastewater into receiving waters.  Without electric power, operators had no other option but to bypass  treatment and directly discharge the untreated sewage into Lake Erie or the  Cuyahoga River and other tributaries.", "Conversely, there are instances in which other infrastructure and activities  may depend on treated wastewater to properly function. For example, in  some parts of the country, effluent is reclaimed and used as cooling water  for power generation, to recharge groundwater, or to water outdoor  landscapes. One expert noted that wastewater treated at a plant in the arid  Western United States is reclaimed and used to provide the only cooling  source for a nuclear power plant that provides power for much of that  region. According to the same expert, the immobilization of this treatment  plant could, within a certain number of days, disable the nuclear plant,  causing a major, multistate power outage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experts Identified Wastewater Security- Enhancing Activities That Warrant Federal Support", "paragraphs": ["Experts most frequently identified 11 specific activities to improve  wastewater security as deserving high priority for federal support (see fig.  9).

However, one stated that  replacing gaseous chemical treatment technology can actually result in  certain offsetting cost savings. For example, the Blue Plains Wastewater  Treatment Plant in Washington, D.C., employed around-the-clock police  units prior to replacing its chlorine gas treatment process. Following  conversion to a less hazardous treatment technology, Blue Plains found  that it could reduce this security posture.
