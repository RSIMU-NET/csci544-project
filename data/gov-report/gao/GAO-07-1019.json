Given the importance of information technology (IT) to VA's mission, effective information security controls are critical to maintaining public and veteran confidence in its ability to protect sensitive information. GAO was asked to evaluate (1) whether VA has effectively addressed GAO and VA Office of Inspector General (IG) information security recommendations and (2) actions VA has taken since May 2006 to strengthen its information security practices and secure personal information. To do this, GAO examined security policies and action plans, interviewed pertinent department officials, and conducted testing of encryption software at select VA facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although VA has made progress, it has not yet fully implemented most of the key GAO and IG recommendations to strengthen its information security practices. Specifically, VA has implemented two GAO recommendations: to develop a process for managing its plan to correct identified weaknesses and to regularly report on progress in updating its security plan to the Secretary. However, it has not fully implemented two other GAO recommendations: to complete a comprehensive security management program and to ensure consistent use of information security performance standards for appraising senior VA executives. In addition, the department has not yet fully implemented 20 of 22 recommendations made by the IG in 2006. For example, VA has not completed activities to appropriately restrict access to data, networks, and department facilities; ensure that only authorized changes and updates to computer programs are made; and strengthen critical infrastructure planning. Because these recommendations have not yet been implemented, unnecessary risk exists that the personal information of veterans and others, such as medical providers, will be exposed to data tampering, fraud, and inappropriate disclosure. Since the May 2006 security incident, VA has continued or begun several major initiatives to strengthen its information security practices and secure personal information within the department, but more remains to be done. These initiatives include continuing efforts begun in October 2005 to reorganize its management structure to provide better oversight and fiscal discipline over its IT systems; developing an action plan to correct identified weaknesses; establishing an information protection program; improving its incident management capability; and establishing an office responsible for oversight of IT within the department. However, implementation shortcomings limit the effectiveness of these initiatives. For example, no documented process exists between the Director of Field Operations and Security and the chief information security officer (CISO) to ensure the effective coordination and implementation of security policies and procedures within the department. In addition, the position of the CISO has been unfilled since June 2006. Although, 39 percent of items in the department's remedial action plan are tasks to develop, document, revise, or update a policy or program, 87 percent of these items have no corresponding task with an established time frame for implementation across the department. VA also did not have clear guidance for identifying devices that require encryption functionality, and it lacked adequate procedures for incident response and notification. Finally, VA's Office of IT Oversight and Compliance lacks a standard methodology and established criteria to ensure that its examination of internal controls is consistent across VA facilities. Until the department addresses recommendations to resolve identified weaknesses and implements the major initiatives it has undertaken, it will have limited assurance that it can protect its systems and information from the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, or loss of personal information of veterans and other personnel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to promote the  health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans, in recognition of their service  to the nation, by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social  support, and lasting memorials.

First, in more than a third of  cases, VA has not completed action items by their expected completion  date. Specifically, VA has extended the completion date at least once for  38 percent of the plan items, and it has extended the completion date  multiple times for 6 percent of the items in the plan. The average extension  was about 5 months. In addition, 28 percent of action items that remained  open as of June 1, 2007, had already exceeded the scheduled completion  date, and over half of the work remained to be completed for a majority of  those items. These extensions and missed deadlines can be attributed in  part to VA\u2019s not developing, documenting, and implementing procedures  to ensure that action items were addressed in an effective and timely  manner. If weaknesses are not successfully corrected in a timely manner,  VA will continue to lack effective security controls to safeguard its assets  and sensitive information.", "Second, a large portion of VA\u2019s approach to correcting identified  weaknesses has been focused on establishing policies and procedures: 39  percent of the items in the action plan are to develop and document or  revise and update a policy, a program, or criteria. However, VA has not  established action items for implementing these new or changed policies  and procedures across the department. For 87 percent of action items  related to policies and procedures, the action plan included no  corresponding task with an established time frame for departmentwide  implementation. Developing and documenting policies and procedures are  just the first two steps in remediating identified weaknesses. If there are  no implementation tasks with time frames, VA cannot monitor and ensure  successful implementation. Until VA establishes tasks with time frames to  implement policies and procedures in the plan, it will not be able to  successfully manage its planned actions to correct identified weaknesses.", "Third, VA does not have a process in place to validate the closure of action  plan items, that is, to ensure both that task owners have completed the  activities required to sufficiently address action items and also that there  is adequate documentation of these activities. During our review, we noted  the closure of approximately 80 action items that included activities such  as developing a policy or procedure, creating a schedule, deploying  security tools, or updating software. However, according to the  department official responsible for managing the plan, upon review of  these completed items, VA found a number of them lacked support for  closing the item (such as documentation). This official indicated that VA  was developing a process to provide validation of closed action plan items,  but no supporting documentation on the development of this validation  process had been provided.

At one medical center, of  the 58 laptops tested, 3 should have been encrypted according to VA\u2019s  policy but were not. At another medical center, of the 41 laptops tested, 1  laptop was not encrypted that should have been. In some of these cases,  VHA medical center officials noted that the reference in the directive to  operation in a mobile environment led to ambiguity about which laptops  were required to be encrypted.", "Although our testing showed sound consistency in this encryption effort,  this and another source of ambiguity in the directive could affect the  department\u2019s success in implementing other planned encryption  initiatives. Specifically, Directive 6504 did not provide explicit guidance on  whether to encrypt laptops that were categorized as medical devices,  which make up a significant portion of the population of laptops at VHA  facilities. At facilities for patient care, laptops could be categorized both  as equipment that operated in a mobile environment (and thus subject to  VA\u2019s encryption directive) and as medical devices (and thus subject to  compliance with other federal guidance that may interfere with following  the encryption directive). At the two medical centers we visited, which  each have over 300 laptops, most laptops were considered medical  devices. When VHA officials contacted the help desk for the encryption  initiative, they were told that these laptops did not need encryption  software installed. However, Directive 6504 had not made this clear,  increasing the challenge to VHA facilities in implementing the encryption  initiative. Without guidance that takes into consideration the environment  in which laptops are used in different VA facilities and that clearly  identifies devices that require encryption functionality, VA may not have  assurance that all facilities in the department will be able to consistently  implement encryption initiatives for all appropriate devices.", "Finally, the department did not maintain an accurate inventory of all  laptops that had been encrypted, nor did it have an inventory of all laptops  within the department.

For example, eight laptops listed in the inventories were not  laptops, but scanners, personal computers or other devices. In some cases,  the inventory listed a laptop as encrypted, but testing revealed that the  machine was not encrypted. (The weaknesses identified with the  inventories of laptops are similar to weaknesses identified in a report we  recently issued, which noted significant IT inventory control weaknesses  at VA).

In the incident in Birmingham in  January 2007, medical provider and physician information from the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the Department of Health  and Human Services was lost, requiring VA to coordinate with this  department to respond to the incident. At the time of the incident, VA had  drafted interim procedures for incident response, including notifying  individuals affected by security incidents. These draft procedures  described steps to be taken to respond to incidents involving the loss of  information on veterans. However, they did not include processes for  coordinating incident response and mitigation activities with other  agencies. This contributed to the fact that it took more time to determine  the risks to medical providers, who were not notified until 85 days after  the incident.", "To address the coordination issue, VA revised its interim procedures to  indicate that incident response teams will work with other federal  agencies and teams as needed to contract for independent analyses of the  risk associated with compromise of the particular data involved. In March  2007, VA approved these revised interim procedures. However, the  approved procedures are limited to contracting for risk analyses and do  not incorporate processes for coordinating with other federal agencies on  other appropriate mitigation activities. For example, although the  procedures allow for the offer of credit monitoring to affected individuals,  they do not address mitigating other types of risks, such as potential  fraudulent claims for payment under Medicare, which were a potential risk  for the Birmingham incident. Credit monitoring would not address this  risk. Other coordination and mitigation activities may be needed, such as  alerting the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to the possibility of  fraudulent claims involving specific providers to adequately address this  potential risk or other risks, different from those experienced to date.", "Obtaining up-to-date contact information. VA\u2019s procedures for incident  response and notification do not include mechanisms for obtaining  contact information on individuals (when necessary), which can also  cause delays in sending out notification letters to individuals. A VA official  noted that notification letters to individuals could be delayed, depending  on whether the department could locate complete address information for  the affected individuals and on the number of letters that must be sent.  Such delays occurred in the case of the missing backup tape in May 2006  (when 159 days passed before notification letters were sent). The data and  number of records that were on the backup tape were not immediately  known, and the address information of veterans whose data were  compromised in the incident had to be researched. Our recent report  noted that agencies faced challenges in identifying address information for  individuals affected by security incidents and that mechanisms should be  in place to obtain contact information on individuals. However, VA\u2019s draft  and approved interim procedures do not include a mechanism for  obtaining such contact information. As a result, the department\u2019s response  to incidents could be delayed when the compromised data do not include  complete and accurate contact information (or there is uncertainty about  the data).", "Risk analysis. As mentioned earlier, VA asked the Department of Health  and Human Services to conduct an independent risk analysis on the  provider data loss in the January 2007 incident in Birmingham; this  analysis showed that there was a high risk that the loss of personal  information could result in harm to the individuals concerned. Conducting  such risk analyses after incidents is a recommended procedure, since  appropriate incident response and notification depend on determining the  level of risk associated with the particular information that is  compromised. In addition, conducting periodic risk assessments before  an incident occurs facilitates a rapid response, by enabling the  development of mitigation activities and appropriate coordination for  potential data losses. Assessments of both systems and the information  they contain are important, particularly information with a high potential  risk for inappropriate use or fraud. However, VA is still in the process of  finalizing and approving its guidance for completing risk assessments on  VA\u2019s systems. As a result, the department does not have a current  assessment of risk for the information located at its facilities and in its  information systems, which could affect the coordination and mitigation  activities that are developed by the department to respond to potential  data losses. Until VA assesses the risk for information located at its  facilities and in its information systems and uses this assessment to  develop and document mitigation activities and appropriate coordination  for potential data losses (particularly high-risk losses), it may not be able  to adequately address potential risks associated with loss of sensitive  information at its facilities and on its systems.", "Additional VA actions. VA has taken additional actions to improve  incident response and notification. In February 2007, VA chartered the  Incident Resolution Team Structure, a group of officials from  organizations within the department who are responsible for responding  to incidents and handling notification requirements at the national,  regional, and local levels. This action was in response to an OMB  memorandum issued in September 2006, which recommended that all  departments and agencies develop a core management group responsible  for incident response to losses of personal information, as well as a  response plan for notifying individuals affected by security incidents.  Roles and responsibilities within the Incident Resolution Team Structure  are organized according to the level of activity, the nature of the incident,  and how the incident is categorized based on risk levels. VA also uses the  Formal Event Review and Evaluation Tool to determine what the risk  category of a security incident should be, based on the severity of the  incident.", "VA has also recently developed, with contractor assistance, interim  regulations for security incident notification, data mining, fraud alerts,  data breach analysis (that is, risk analysis of security incidents), credit  monitoring, identity theft insurance, and credit protection services, as  required under the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information  Technology Act of 2006.

The ITOC  recommends corrective actions to remediate identified issues where  necessary and also makes available a remediation team to assist the  facility in addressing any recommendations. In January 2007, the ITOC  began conducting assessments at facilities and by June 2007 had  conducted 34 assessments.

For example, although the ITOC  developed a checklist to conduct facility assessments, it did not develop  a standard methodology for analysts to use when evaluating internal  controls against the checklist, or specific criteria for each checklist item.  As a result, the office lacks a process to ensure that its examination of  internal controls is consistent across VA facilities. In addition, although  the Director of the ITOC indicated that the assessment team  recommendations to facilities are tracked in a database, no supporting  documentation was provided. Further, according to the standards for  internal control, organizations should follow up to ensure that corrective  active is taken. However, the ITOC follows up to see if recommendations  have been implemented only when a site is re-inspected. As a result, the  office has no timely mechanism in place to ensure that its  recommendations have been addressed.
