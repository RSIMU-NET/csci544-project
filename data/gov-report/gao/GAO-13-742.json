Within DHS, the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is responsible for human capital policy development and implementation. GAO has previously reported on DHS's challenges in attracting and retaining a qualified workforce. GAO was asked to assess DHS's recruiting and hiring strategies. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS and four selected components have implemented recruiting and hiring strategies to fill MCOs, and (2) DHS has assessed these efforts. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed recruiting strategies and data on MCO hiring and losses, and interviewed officials from OCHCO and the four DHS components selected for this review based on their varieties of MCOs and recruiting strategies.

In 2011, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)--which coordinates component recruiting efforts--developed the Coordinated Recruiting and Outreach Strategy (CROS). Through the CROS, D&I intends to better coordinate and link component recruiting and outreach efforts to hiring for DHS mission and workforce needs (for all positions, including MCOs), and to leverage resources as well as reduce recruiting costs, among other things. D&I has begun to implement the CROS through various means, including requiring components to develop their own outreach and recruiting plans that align with the CROS. However, D&I has been limited in its ability to implement some elements of the CROS--such as recruiter training--because of budget constraints, according to D&I officials. The components selected for GAO's review--the National Protection and Programs Directorate, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Secret Service (USSS)--have also implemented various strategies to recruit and hire MCOs. In addition, these four components have generally been able to address hiring needs for MCOs. For example, USSS data show that vacancy rates were generally below 3 percent for MCO positions during fiscal years 2010 through 2012. Still, some officials have reported experiencing challenges attracting qualified candidates because of factors such as financial constraints and regional competition, among other things. For example, TSA has been challenged in filling certain positions in some areas where competition for other jobs makes it difficult to attract qualified candidates.", "D&I is taking steps to assess implementation of the CROS, but could improve efforts to track recruiting costs. D&I assesses progress in implementing the CROS by tracking and monitoring component performance for six measures, such as compliance with data-tracking requirements. These measures are aligned with the two overarching goals of the CROS; however, they do not include targets to measure DHS's progress in achieving the goals over the period the strategy covers (2012-2017). D&I officials stated that they are gathering baseline data on these measures and plan to use these data to help develop targets in the future. In addition, three of the CROS's six annual measures are associated with its goal of recruiting a highly qualified workforce. However, DHS does not require components to report the information needed to accurately assess component performance for one of these measures--which calls for standardized data tracking of recruiting and outreach activities. D&I has developed a database for components to use to track recruiting efforts and costs, but it does not require that all components use this tool or provide data to DHS in a consistent manner. D&I officials said that since some components have their own tracking systems, they do not want the tracking systems to duplicate efforts. D&I acknowledges the importance of obtaining comprehensive and consistent cost information from components, but has not determined whether and how it will do so. As a result, D&I does not know the total amount of money being spent on recruiting and outreach throughout DHS, nor is it able to fully track component recruiting costs--and therefore cannot measure the results of the second goal in the CROS of optimizing outreach and recruiting resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS require all components to provide recruiting cost information in a consistent manner.

To  address the increasingly complex national security challenges associated  with its wide array of responsibilities, it is important that DHS have  programs and policies in place to effectively recruit and hire employees  with the appropriate skills to meet its various mission requirements. In  recent years, we, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and other  parties have identified major challenges to recruitment and hiring in the  federal government broadly and at DHS specifically, such as passive  recruitment strategies and insufficient workforce planning. For example,  passive recruitment strategies, such as infrequent or no outreach to  college campuses, can create missed opportunities to expose potential  employees to information about federal jobs. Also, we have found that  federal agencies made limited use of hiring flexibilities that could better  position them to efficiently hire well-qualified candidates for jobs. We  have also reported that in order to ensure that organizations are reaching  out to diverse pools of talent, agencies must consider active recruitment  strategies, such as widening the selection of schools from which they  recruit, building formal relationships with targeted schools and colleges to  ensure the cultivation of talent for future applicant pools, and partnering  with multicultural professional organizations and speaking at their  conferences to communicate their commitment to diversity to external  audiences and strengthen and maintain relationships.", "Specific to DHS, we have reported that the department faces challenges  in attracting and retaining a qualified workforce, particularly in the areas of  acquisitions, information technology, and cybersecurity.

In addition to reviewing these components\u2019 efforts to  adhere to the CROS and develop their own recruiting strategies, we also  analyzed workforce hiring data when available and appropriate. To  determine the reliability of these data, we reviewed documentation on the  data systems and interviewed officials responsible for working with the  data systems. Through this work, we determined these data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To gain further insights into the  development of recruiting strategies and efforts, challenges faced in hiring  for MCOs, and efforts to mitigate such challenges, we interviewed  OCHCO officials responsible for overseeing department-wide recruiting  and hiring strategies and efforts, and human capital officials in the four  components included in our review at their headquarters and at selected  field locations.

As shown in table 6, all six  measures in the CROS use percentages to quantitatively indicate the  extent to which the measure is being achieved. However, none of these  measures identify a target percentage, or standard, against which to  assess component performance. For example, the performance measure  for objective 2.2 calls for a percentage decrease in component-specific  participation at recruiting events, but it does not identify any target  percentages to assess component performance in achieving the measure  or goal 2 in the CROS, which is to optimize outreach and recruiting  resources enterprise-wide. In addition, one of the measures (1.1) calls for  components to have fully developed recruiting and outreach portfolios,  which the CROS defines as including both short- and long-term workforce  plans, strategic and tactical plans, and diversity snapshots.

As a result, D&I does not have the information  required to accurately assess component performance for this objective.  D&I officials said that since many components have their own systems for  tracking the costs associated with recruiting outreach activities (e.g.,  events attended, occupations for which they are recruiting, and number of  attendees), they do not want the components to duplicate efforts by  having them enter the same type of information in the DHS shared  database. D&I officials reported that components saved approximately  $22,590 in fiscal year 2012 by sharing booth space at recruiting events  coordinated through the CRC.

Doing so would help DHS better track the amount  of resources being spent on recruiting and outreach throughout DHS and  assess the extent to which increased coordination and leveraging  resources have decreased recruiting costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DHS has comprehensive data to help track recruiting  costs and coordinated efforts, we recommend that the Secretary of  Homeland Security direct OCHCO to take the following action:  require all components to provide D&I with recruiting cost information  in a consistent manner to allow better tracking of overall recruiting  costs and use this information to assess the extent to which recruiting  costs are being reduced by components as a result of increased  coordination and leveraging resources as called for in the CROS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment. On  September 9, 2013, DHS provided written comments, which are reprinted  in appendix II, and provided technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate. DHS concurred with our recommendation and described  actions planned to address it. Specifically, DHS stated that through the  CRC, DHS will develop and implement a system to consistently track and  analyze overall recruiting costs by all components. This information could  help DHS assess the degree to which recruiting costs are being reduced  through component coordination\u2014as called for in the CROS. DHS  expects to complete this effort by December 31, 2013. If fully  implemented, DHS\u2019s planned actions will address the intent of this  recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested  parties.
