GAO agreed to review the statutory allocations for federal funding of public television, the Corporation's distribution of funds through its Community Service Grant and Television Future Fund programs, its distribution of funds for the Public Broadcasting Service's National Program Service and for local programming, and its grant programs for assisting public television's transition to digital technologies and services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["By statute, 75 percent of the Corporation's annual federal funding for public television is to be distributed among licensees of public television stations, and 25 percent is to be available to the Corporation for the support of national public television programming. In our survey of all 176 licensees, of which 85 percent responded, more than three-fifths favored maintaining the current allocations. Of those favoring a change, most proposed an increase in the allocation for distribution among licensees. The Corporation uses Community Service Grants as the primary means of distributing funding to licensees. Most licensees were generally satisfied with the recent consultation process for reviewing the eligibility criteria for these grants. Another program, the Television Future Fund, awarded grants to projects designed to reduce licensees' operational costs and enhance revenues. Only about 40 percent of the licensees indicated that these projects had resulted in practical methods to help their stations, and only about 30 percent agreed with the Corporation's approach of using funds designated for distribution among licensees to partly support these projects. In our legal view, the use of such funds for this purpose is not consistent with the statutory authority under which the Corporation operates. The Corporation provides an annual grant to the Public Broadcasting Service to help fund a package of children's and prime-time programming that make up the National Program Service. Most licensees favored continuation of the Corporation's funding, noting that this national programming helps them meet their educational and cultural missions and build community support for their stations. Licensees also indicated that local programming is important in serving their communities. However, most responded that they do not produce enough local programs to meet their communities' needs, and many cited a lack of funds as the reason. About 85 percent of the licensees responding to our survey indicated that the congressionally mandated transition from analog to digital broadcasting will improve their ability to provide local services to their communities. The Corporation has received appropriations to help support this transition since fiscal year 2001. In consultation with licensees, the Corporation has used these funds to provide licensees with grants for acquiring digital transmission equipment. Some grantees, however, did not receive their awards in time to meet FCC deadlines for the construction of digital transmission facilities. In addition, the Corporation received only a few grant applications during the latter part of 2003. Our survey indicates that most licensees' priorities now involve other aspects of the transition, some of which (including digital production equipment and development of digital content) were not included in the scope of the grant programs. The Corporation is also seeking funds for digitally based infrastructure improvements for distributing public television programming to stations and is working with public television stakeholders to develop a strategic plan that includes the creation of digital content."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Created to harness the technology of broadcast television for the delivery  of educational, informational, and cultural programming, noncommercial  educational television\u2014generally known as \u201cpublic television\u201d\u2014has  evolved over the past half-century into a complex and uniquely structured  broadcasting system. Since the first station went on the air in 1953 until  today, the nation\u2019s 356 public television stations were built and have  continued to operate as nonprofit, community-based organizations,  offering a mix of broadcast programming and other outreach activities to  serve their local communities. While public television stations themselves  produce programming for local broadcast, programming is also created for  national audiences and distributed through national station-based  membership organizations, such as the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS),  distributor of noted series such as Sesame Street, Masterpiece Theatre, and  Great Performances. The funding of public television, also unique in form,  has historically come from a multitude of sources, including foundations,  corporations, colleges and universities, state and local governments, and  individual viewers. For the past 35 years, the federal government has also  provided funding to advance the mission of public broadcasting, principally  through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Corporation was  established in 1967 by an act of Congress as a nongovernmental, nonprofit  corporation to facilitate\u2014with federal funds\u2014the availability and  distribution of high quality educational and cultural programming to public  broadcast stations. Since its founding, the Corporation has received an  annual federal appropriation from the Congress and, more recently,  additional funds have been made available to assist in public television\u2019s  transition from analog to digital broadcast technology.", "Because the House Energy and Commerce Committee could consider  reauthorizing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as early as this year,  you requested that we review various programs and funding mechanisms  utilized by the Corporation to support public television. Specifically, you  asked us to review the Corporation\u2019s activities and obtain the views of  public television station officials regarding: (1) the statutory allocations for  federal funding of public television; (2) the distribution of funds by the  Corporation through its Community Service Grant and Television Future  Fund programs, including a legal analysis of whether the funding of the  Television Future Fund program is consistent with the Corporation\u2019s  underlying statutory authority; (3) the distribution of funds by the  Corporation for PBS\u2019s National Program Service and for local  programming; and (4) Corporation funding to assist public television  stations in their transition to digital technologies and services. You also  asked us to review the statutory and regulatory requirements, system  policies and guidance, and licensees\u2019 views on underwriting  acknowledgments (see app. V).", "To respond to these objectives, we reviewed provisions of the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and the  processes of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to allocate federal  funding for public television and distribute grant funds to public television  stations and for public television programming. We also interviewed  officials of the Corporation and PBS, as well as the Association of Public  Television Stations\u2014a nonprofit organization that represents public  television stations in legislative and policy matters and conducts planning  and research activities on behalf its members. For the second objective, the  distribution of funds among licensees, we reviewed the legal opinions of  the Corporation\u2019s outside counsels as part of our legal analysis to  determine whether the Corporation\u2019s approach to funding the Television  Future Fund is consistent with the governing statute. For the third  objective, national programming, we reviewed documents and interviewed  officials of the Independent Television Service, a nonprofit corporation that  receives federal funding support from the Corporation for distribution to  independent producers of public television programming, and from two  other distributors of national public television programming\u2014American  Public Television and the National Educational Telecommunications  Association. For the fourth objective, the digital transition, we interviewed  officials of the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA) in the Department of Commerce, which makes  grants to public television licensees for digital equipment. Officials of  American Public Television, the National Educational Telecommunications  Association, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were  also interviewed on issues related to underwriting acknowledgements on  public television.", "To obtain views on each of these objectives from the officials who operate  the nation\u2019s 356 public television stations, we conducted a Web-based  survey of all 176 entities that are licensed by the FCC to operate these  stations and receive grants from the Corporation. We received 149  completed surveys\u2014an overall response rate of 85 percent. (The number of  responses to individual questions may be lower depending on the number  of licensees who were eligible or chose to answer each question.) The  survey consisted of objective questions and the option for licensees to add  narrative comments in each section of the survey. The survey questions and  aggregate responses appear in appendix VI. We also conducted interviews  with officials of 16 public television station licensees to obtain general  perspectives on the issues to be reviewed, and we conducted pretests with  seven of these licensees to assist us in the development of the survey  instrument.", "Our review was performed from April 2003 through February 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Among these 176 licensees, some operate a  single station, such as the Detroit Educational Television Foundation,  which operates WTVS public television; others operate multiple stations,  such as the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television, which has 16  stations on the air throughout the state. Figure 1 provides a breakdown of  the number of licensees and stations they operate (by type of licensee).", "Licensees also differ by the size of their budgets, ranging from the smallest  licensees, with total revenues below $3.5 million, to the largest, with total  revenues exceeding $20 million. A few of the largest licensees are also  among the most prominent producers of public television programming,  such as WGBH in Boston, producer of Masterpiece Theatre, Arthur, and  other notable series. Other licensees also produce programming for  national distribution, such as KUHT in Houston, producer of The American  Woodshop and the children\u2019s program Mary Lou\u2019s Flip Flop Shop.  Programs intended for local and regional audiences are produced by many  licensees, such as KDIN public television in Johnston, Iowa, producer of  Iowa Press and Living in Iowa. Finally, public television licensees provide  numerous services to their communities, such as programming-related  outreach, formal educational services, literacy services, Amber Alerts for  the abduction of children, and emergency weather information.", "Public television is characterized as a decentralized system, with all  licensees owned and controlled at the local level. Stations exercise  substantial discretion over programming decisions. This structure is due, in  part, to the institutional and financial factors that motivated the founding  of each individual public television station. Unlike commercial television  stations, which typically involve business-related investment decisions,  establishing a public television station entails a local-level commitment to  the education and cultural enrichment of viewers. Further, whereas  advertising revenues finance commercial television, public television has  always been financed by both public and private sources. For fiscal year  2002 (the most recent data available), public television generated $1.63  billion in revenues, which came from a variety of sources: federal, state,  and local government; private foundations; corporations; and subscribers  (individual memberships) (see fig. 2). The Corporation\u2019s funding of $263  million provided about 16 percent of this total.", "Figure\u00a02:\u00a0 Sources\u00a0of\u00a0Public\u00a0Television\u00a0Revenues,\u00a0Fiscal\u00a0Year\u00a02002\u00a0($1.63\u00a0billion)", "The Educational Television Facilities Act of 1962 authorized the first form  of federal funding support for public television, establishing a program in  the former Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide grants  to public broadcasting licensees for equipment and facilities. Soon  thereafter, the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, a national  commission formed in 1965 with the sponsorship of the Carnegie  Corporation, studied educational television\u2019s financial needs. Based on  recommendations in the Carnegie Commission\u2019s 1967 report, President  Lyndon Johnson proposed and the Congress enacted the Public  Broadcasting Act of 1967, amending the Communications Act of 1934 to  reauthorize funding for facilities and equipment grants and, among other  provisions, to authorize funding for public television programming through  a new entity\u2014the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Corporation is  organized under the act as a nongovernmental, nonprofit corporation to  facilitate the growth and development of public television and radio  broadcasting and the use of public television and radio broadcasting for  instructional, educational, and cultural programming.", "In passing the 1967 act, the 90th Congress did not intend that annual  authorizations and appropriations for the Corporation would serve as a  permanent process for funding support of public broadcasting. Rather,  they were seen as temporary measures pending the development and  adoption of a long-term financing plan for public broadcasting. Although  various financing proposals for public broadcasting have since been  suggested, the Corporation continues to receive nearly all of its budget in  the form of an annual federal appropriation. Figure 3 illustrates the history  of annual federal appropriations made to the Corporation in current  dollars.", "The Corporation is governed by a board of directors that is appointed by  the President and confirmed by the Senate.The Corporation\u2019s most recent  mission statement, adopted by the board in July 1999, states that the  Corporation is to facilitate the development of, and ensure universal access  to, noncommercial high-quality programming and telecommunications  services in conjunction with licensees. Reflecting the local and national  characteristics of public television, the Corporation\u2019s current goals include:  (1) strengthening the value and viability of local stations as essential  community institutions by improving their operational effectiveness and  fiscal stability and increasing their capacity to invest in and create services  and content to advance their mission and (2) developing economically  sustainable, high-quality noncommercial programming that inspires,  enlightens, and entertains.", "The most important work the Corporation has underway, according to a  July 2003 memorandum to the board, is a systemwide planning study that  addresses three facets of public television. First, to improve the financial  sustainability of public television, the Corporation has determined that  improvements in public television\u2019s net revenues can occur by attracting  increased financial support for stations from major donors and by  developing new practices to improve the efficiency of stations\u2019 operations.  Second, through a strategic assessment of the local services provided by  public broadcasting stations, the Corporation seeks to \u201chelp stations chart  the course ahead\u201d and aid in efforts to improve the financial sustainability  of public television, provide direction for efficiencies in station operations,  and inform decisions on national programming. Systemwide efforts related  to national programming, the third area of focus, will address the \u201cwide  disconnect between audience research, national commissioning and  scheduling decisions, and local service strategy.\u201d According to the  Corporation, this will involve strategic analysis and reengineering of  national programming.", "Public television also faces the challenge of transitioning its broadcast  operations from analog to digital technology. Unlike analog broadcasting,  which converts moving pictures and sound into a \u201cwave form\u201d electrical  signal, digital technology converts pictures and sound into a stream of  digits consisting of zeros and ones that are transmitted over the air. Digital  technology has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and  services of all television broadcasters and is viewed as critical to the  broadcast television industry\u2019s ability to enhance its provision of  communications services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established  the framework for licensing digital television spectrum to existing  broadcasters. Under FCC rules implementing this framework, public  television licensees are required to complete the construction of digital station facilities by May 1, 2003; broadcast in digital a minimum of 50 percent of the programming that  they broadcast in analog\u2014known as \u201csimulcasting\u201d\u2014as of November 1,  2003,simulcast 75 percent by April 2004, and simulcast 100 percent by  April 2005; and by December 31, 2006, return their analog (or digital) spectrum to FCC  for reallocation.", "In response to the difficulties faced by public television licensees in  financing expenses related to the digital transition, the regulatory deadline  for the construction of digital public television stations was set for May 1,  2003, a year later than the deadline for commercial stations.

Our analysis  indicates that the current allocations were favored by a majority of  licensees of each type, with the exception of local authority licensees (see  fig. 6) and by each size, based on total revenues (see fig. 7).

In fact, several of these respondents suggested that all of  the public television funds should be allocated among licensees, with no  funds for national programming. Among the reasons cited for an increase  in the allocation for licensees was the view that providing more of these  funds to licensees, rather than to national programming entities, would  advance the \u201clocal\u201d quality of public television. Another reason given was  that distributors of national programming would be more accountable and  responsive to licensees\u2019 local needs if more funds were allocated to  licensees. In addition, one licensee noted that by placing the funds in the  hands of licensees, a greater degree of insulation from political influence  over national programming would be likely.", "However, a couple of licensees suggested that the 25 percent allocation for  national programming should be increased and the 75 percent allocation  for licensees decreased. One licensee suggested, for example, that despite  the need for national programming, licensees would likely not pool funding  necessary to produce national programming if all funds were distributed to  licensees.

Statutory  provisions requiring that the Corporation distribute funds directly among  licensees were first enacted in 1975.

With regard to the make-up of the review panel, suggestions  were made to rotate panel members, involve licensee officials that have not  previously served on a review panel, and make the review panel more  representative of the licensee community.

Among such factors were the policy which  specifies that licensees operating stations in the same market (known as an  \u201coverlap\u201d market) share a single base grant component of their Community  Service Grants, the provision of supplemental funds in the incentive grant  portion of the Community Service Grant for licensees that operate multiple  public television stations, and an insufficient level of Community Service  Grant funds provided to licensees to cover PBS membership assessment  for access to PBS\u2019s national programming.", "However, we were told that while modifying the eligibility criteria for  establishing the base and incentive grant portions of Community Service  Grants may result in an increase in the grant funds awarded to some  licensees, it would also likely reduce the grant amounts awarded to others.  Further, we were told that the Corporation makes every attempt to ensure  that these grant funds are distributed fairly among public television  licensees. For example, as a result of the 2001 review, the Corporation  revised a policy previously adopted to increase the minimum level of  nonfederal financial support that licensees must raise to $1 million  beginning in fiscal year 2003 in order to receive the incentive portion of the  Community Service Grant.

Over one-fifth of our survey respondents,  however, indicated that the Corporation should cease all funding for the  Television Future Fund.", "In September 2002, the Corporation suspended the award of further  Television Future Fund grants pending a review of the program to (1)  assess the consistency between the planning and execution of the program  in relation to the Corporation\u2019s goals and (2) determine how the program  could address concerns that the public broadcast mission and business  models were no longer adequate in the digital era. In the course of its  review, the Corporation\u2019s Future Fund Advisory Panelconcluded that  while a majority of the projects had yielded the results anticipated, some  were not successful for reasons that included an inability to achieve  appropriate scale or significant economic benefit, inadequately defined  objectives and poor execution, and inadequate marketing of results to  stations. The panel solicited comments from the public television  community on how the Future Fund could best be used to help stations  maximize their financial resources and invest these resources in new and  strengthened service to their local communities. Based on input from  public television stakeholders and its own deliberations, the panel  developed four new criteria to guide the investment of funds. Specifically,  Television Future Fund initiatives should have the potential to change systemwide decision making and transform  current approaches to achieving system and station goals, measurable and sustainable outcomes, strong and verifiable support of key advocates and participants, and consistency with the Corporation\u2019s legislative mandate.", "In addition, the panel recommended changes in how Television Future  Fund initiatives are developed and supported. Rather than continuing to  invite proposals on a broad array of themes, as had been done in the past,  the panel recommended that the solicitations more directly define the  initiatives\u2019 intended outcomes for participants, the station community, and  the system overall. The panel also recommended that funding  commitments be made over longer time frames at higher monetary levels in  order to focus on fewer initiatives that have greater impact. The panel  called for improved project management, with clearly defined expectations  and performance measures and a clear definition of success. To evaluate  and monitor the progress of the initiatives, the panel recommended that the  membership of the Future Fund Advisory Panel include greater  representation from across the station community. planning study discussed earlier. According to Corporation officials, it was  anticipated that the Future Fund program would help support some of the  new initiatives and projects stemming from the planning study.", "The Television Future Fund was reactivated in November 2003 with the  advisory panel endorsing several funding grants. In a December 2003  memorandum to station managers, the Corporation outlined the new  Television Future Fund review and selection process and described three  Future Fund projects that were in progress: (1) the Major Giving Initiative  aimed at helping stations attract financial support from major donors\u2014an  area of opportunity identified in the Corporation\u2019s systemwide planning  study; (2) the Education Leadership Academy, a pilot effort to identify  opportunities for improved community partnership in elementary and  secondary school education; and (3) an online knowledge base to improve  public television\u2019s fundraising potential, strategies, and practices.  Corporation officials noted that 90 of the 176 licensees have signed up to  participate in the first Major Giving Initiative workshop, and they expect  licensees to participate in another workshop to be held later this year. In  addition, they noted that the Future Fund was used to cover the  participation of about 110 station personnel in a 2-day concentrated track  of sessions for the Education Leadership Academy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporation\u2019s Approach to Funding the Television Future Fund Is Not Consistent with Its Underlying Statute", "paragraphs": ["counsels to support their differing positions on this issue. As part of our  review, we examined the Corporation\u2019s statutory authority to use funds  allocated for distribution among public television licensees to support the  Television Future Fund. Although our legal review focused on the program  as it was constituted prior to its recent revisions, the recent changes made  do not appear to have solved the legal deficiencies that we identified. As  reconstituted, the Future Fund program still is funded, in part, with funds  designated by the Congress for distribution among public television  licensees.", "According to the Corporation, its authority to establish \u201celigibility criteria,\u201d  and the formula under which the funds are disbursed, is broad enough to  allow the Corporation to take a portion of the funds allocated for  distribution among licensees, pool them with System Support funds, and  use this aggregated pool of money to make selective grants only to  applicants submitting project proposals acceptable to the Corporation after  being reviewed and recommended by a review panel. We disagree. The  difference between our view and that of the Corporation rests on whether  the eligibility criteria the Corporation may adopt include project-focused  criteria that govern the selective award of funds for a particular project (as  the Corporation maintains) or whether eligibility criteria the Corporation  may adopt include only station-based criteria that distinguish among public  television licensees on the basis of such factors as financial needs,  audience satisfaction, or fundraising effectiveness. It is our view that the  phrase \u201celigibility criteria\u201d should be read in the context of the distribution  mechanism to mean criteria focusing on the eligibility of the licensees,  rather than the eligibility of the projects. Although we often defer to an  agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is charged to administer, we cannot  do that here because the Corporation\u2019s interpretation of its authority is  neither consistent with the statutory language nor the Congress\u2019 policy  choice favoring local, not Corporation, control of the expenditure of the  funds allocated for licensees.", "Fundamentally, we believe that the Corporation\u2019s interpretation of the  statutory language changes the basic nature and control over the  expenditure of the funds allocated for licensees. First, the language of the  distribution provision makes no reference to funding specific projects. By  contrast, the Congress has provided the Corporation with specific  authority to fund projects using system support funds. Second, the statute  and its legislative history reflect a clear division of roles vis-\u00e0-vis the  Corporation and the licensees and permittees of public television stations.  Under the statutory scheme, it is the Corporation that is responsible for  distributing funds to the licensees, and it is the recipients of these funds  that are granted the discretion over how they are to be used. Thus, in the  context of the entire statutory scheme, these funds would not be available  for project-specific systemwide grants.", "Moreover, as implemented by the Corporation, the Television Future Fund  grants are available to nonstation entities. We believe this is inconsistent  with the direction in the statute regarding the fact that the funds are to be  distributed among licensees of public television stations. For example, an  award was given to a consultant to conduct studies to identify skills that  will be needed by chief executive officers of public television stations in  the next decade. Another award was given to a consultant group to study  the perception of public television by its current and potential financial  supporters. In our view, the funds allocated by statute for distribution  among licensees are not available to nonstation entities.

Of the 19 percent of the licensees  who indicated that a change was needed, most suggested that the funding  be reduced or eliminated and be given instead to the licensees.", "Concerns with the process that PBS uses to choose the programs selected  for the National Program Service were also noted in some of our interviews  with officials of public television licensees. The Corporation\u2019s annual grant  to PBS for the National Program Service was instituted as a result of a  statutory provision enacted in 1988 requiring that the Corporation study  and submit a plan to the Congress for funding support of national public  television programming. Prior to the establishment of the National  Program Service, grants were awarded by the Corporation directly to  several of the producers of programming included on the PBS national  schedule. Other programs were made part of the national schedule through  a mechanism known as the \u201cStation Program Cooperative.\u201d Through the  Cooperative, officials from public television stations would vote on which  individual programs to include on the national schedule and participate in a  \u201cgroup buy\u201d\u2014combining their funds for the purchase of programming for  distribution by PBS. However, concerns arose that the Station Program  Cooperative model was not effective in the establishment of programming  priorities, the production of minority programming, or the ability of  producers to effectively attract underwriters. In 1989, a National Program  Funding Task Force\u2014comprised of representatives from the Corporation,  public television stations, PBS, independent producers, and other  stakeholders\u2014was formed to review the method of funding national  programming. This review led to the replacement of the Station Program  Cooperative with a new model for selecting PBS programming. Under this  new model, PBS created the position of chief programming executive to  make programming decisions. Currently, two chief programming  executives located on the East and West coasts, respectively, select  programs for the National Program Service with input from licensees,  internal PBS programming staff, and PBS management. This approach was  designed to facilitate the centralized development and purchasing of  programming for the National Program Service and for other programming  distributed nationally under the PBS logo\u2014including children\u2019s, prime\u00ad time, and syndicated programs.", "Our survey of licensees found that only a small percentage expressed a  desire to reinstate the former Station Program Cooperative or a similar  model to select programming for PBS\u2019s National Program Service.  However, a majority of the survey respondents, 58 percent, indicated that  changes were needed in the process for selecting programs for the Service.  Specifically, respondents suggested that PBS solicit more input from  licensees in making the selections.

Many licensees  stated that they do not rely on children\u2019s programming for underwriting  support because of content restrictions and because underwriters do not  see a strong market in the viewers of such programs. However, a few  licensees stated that some underwriters support children\u2019s programs  because of their high quality and their educational and social value. Several  licensees stated that they do not rely on children\u2019s programming to  generate membership support because families with young children often  do not have the economic means to contribute financially.", "Licensees also indicated that they value the prime-time programs on the  National Program Service, with 96 percent of the respondents indicating  that prime-time programs help them meet their mission to a great or  moderate extent.

Our survey also showed that 91  percent of the licensees believe that prime-time programs help them build  local underwriting and membership support to a great or moderate extent.

As proposed by the Corporation and PBS, a new  system, called the \u201cNext Generation Interconnection System,\u201d would  replace the current system with a digital one that distributes programming  in real-time and nonreal time to licensees. Licensees can then store these  programs for later broadcast, which in turn allows PBS to become more  efficient by broadcasting these programs to licensees once instead of  multiple times. The Corporation and PBS have estimated that it will cost  $177 million to replace the interconnection system. The Corporation has  requested that the cost be covered by federal appropriations during fiscal  years 2004 through 2006. The Corporation received an initial $10 million  appropriation for fiscal year 2004 for this purpose.", "In addition, PBS is separately seeking funds from the Corporation for a  project to provide enhancements to the new interconnection system. This  effort, known as the Enhanced Interconnection Optimization Project, is  designed to allow licensees and PBS to schedule and manage the digital  broadcasting of public television programs through the use of automated  channel operations and monitoring. According to PBS, this system will cost  approximately $12 million to $15 million to implement at its facilities. PBS  told us that approximately $8 million is still needed, half of which it is  seeking from the Corporation. The individual stations will also need to  implement the interconnection project at their ends. PBS has estimated  that a typical station-side installation costs between $1 million and $1.2  million. The Corporation\u2019s consultation panel for digital funds  recommended in July 2003 that PBS receive $4.1 million for the project  from the Corporation\u2019s fiscal year 2003 digital transition funds.", "While some licensees noted that this project has potential to bring about  substantial savings and improved operations for licensees, others  expressed concerns about increased maintenance costs, stranded  investments in digital master control equipment bought before the project  was announced, and a lack of detailed information to assess the costs and  usefulness of the project. For example, in our survey, about 25 percent of  the licensees responding said that they have already acquired some types of  digital equipment (master control, production, or storage) that are not fully  compatible with the project, which may limit the capabilities and  usefulness of the project to them. New equipment may need to be acquired  in order to obtain the full benefits of the project.

Among the suggested changes were limiting the  Corporation\u2019s digital grants to one licensee in a market served by multiple  licensees; offering grants to support shared operations, such as digital  master control equipment, among public television stations in the same  market; and eliminating duplication of public television stations in markets  served by multiple licensees.

These  services include interactive Web sites that provide audio and video content  on subjects such as history, science, and literature. Unlike over-air  broadcasting, interactive Web sites would allow people to access this  content regardless of their location.

In addition, most licensees expressed their support for the  Corporation\u2019s continued funding for PBS\u2019s National Program Service,  which nearly all see as helping them meet their missions for providing  quality children\u2019s and prime-time programming. As for local programming,  most licensees indicated that the amount of local programming they  produced was not sufficient to meet their communities\u2019 needs, largely due  to their limited financial resources.", "The Corporation\u2019s approach for funding its Television Future Fund  program is a concern for many licensees. As our survey shows, only 30  percent of respondents agreed with the Corporation\u2019s current approach of  using funds designated for distribution among licensees to support  Television Future Fund projects. The Corporation, as informed by counsel,  contends that it has the authority to use these funds to support the  Television Future Fund program. It is our view that the Corporation may  not take a portion of the funds designated by the Congress for distribution  among public television licensees, pool them with System Support funds,  and use them to make competitive grants only to applicants submitting  project proposals acceptable to the Corporation after review and  recommendation by an advisory panel. Although our legal analysis focused  on the Television Future Fund program as it existed prior to the end of  fiscal year 2003, we note that under the revised program, the Corporation is  still aggregating the funds and using them for projects that benefit the  entire system rather than giving the monies directly to the individual  licensees. Moreover, it appears that the majority of the funds will be going  to vendors rather than the stations. Accordingly, we continue to question  whether the Corporation has the authority to utilize in this fashion the  $10.1 million of the $18.3 million currently in the Television Future Fund  account that came from funds designated for distribution among licensees.", "The Corporation\u2019s support for the digital transition is another area of  concern. As shown by our survey, the priorities of most licensees in 2003  shifted beyond the digital transmission equipment supported by  Corporation grants.

The  Corporation stated that it recognizes that stations are at various stages in  the conversion process and that all station needs are being given careful  consideration in consultations on the distribution of fiscal year 2004 digital  transition funds. The Corporation did not agree with our recommendation  that the Corporation should request specific statutory authority before  making further Television Future Fund awards or expending any funds in  the Television Future Fund account.

The Corporation uses this doctrine to support  its contention that the Congress has consistently replenished funds  designated for distribution among licensees knowing that a portion of these  funds are being used for Future Fund projects. Thus, the Corporation  contends that the Congress has, in essence, ratified by appropriation the  Corporation\u2019s interpretation of the statute.

First, the outside counsel reads paragraph  (k)(6)(B) as providing the Corporation with authority to \u201cspend\u201d CSG  funds. Second, the outside counsel contends that the goals of the formula  design are in essence mandates on how the CSG funds are to be used. We  see no support for either proposition. Paragraph (k)(6)(B) directs the  Corporation on how CSG funds are to be distributed not on how they are to  be spent. The goals of the formula design also provide guidance on what  criteria the Corporation should consider in distributing funds, but does not  constrain a recipient\u2019s use of CSG funds. Moreover, although the  Corporation\u2019s outside counsel reads paragraph (k)(7) in terms of its  permissive direction, this does not recognize that the subsection  emphasizes the discretion of the recipient to use CSG funds for purposes  related primarily to programming, i.e., for purposes chosen by the  recipient.

Thus, some CSG funds have been awarded to entities  other than licensees or permittees of public television stations. According  to the Corporation, so long as the purpose of the grants is to benefit public  television stations, the award of grants to consultants or other third-party  entities is consistent with the statute. Since consultants and stations often  work together to generate project proposals that are reviewed by a panel  representing a diverse group of stations, the Corporation\u2019s outside counsel  concludes that the statutory purposes are being fulfilled, regardless of  whose name appears as payee on the Corporation check.

Many in the public television community believe that  how mandatory carriage obligations are applied to their digital signal is at  the heart of public television\u2019s future. Cable systems are required to carry  local noncommercial educational television stations based upon a cable  system\u2019s number of usable activated channels. Satellite carriers are  required to carry all nonduplicative noncommercial educational television  stations in markets where they provide local-into-local service. These  mandatory carriage requirements are often referred to as \u201cmust carry\u201d  obligations.", "There are two key issues on how to apply the mandatory carriage  obligations in the digital arena that are of importance to the public  television community. The first is whether the \u201cmust carry\u201d requirements  apply to both the digital and analog signal during the transition period. In  other words, would a cable provider be required to carry both the analog  and digital signal until the analog spectrum is returned. In a January 2001  Order concerning the carriage of digital television broadcast signals by  cable operators, FCC tentatively concluded, based on the existing record  evidence, that during the transition, a dual must-carry requirement would  burden the cable operator\u2019s First Amendment interests more than is  necessary to further the government\u2019s interests. In this regard, the record  was found insufficient to demonstrate the degree of harm that  broadcasters, including public television stations, would suffer without  carriage of both signals. In order to ensure that it had sufficient evidence  to fully evaluate this issue, FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking. operate on a much more flexible basis that could allow for multiple  streams, or \u201cmulticasting,\u201d of standard definition digital television  programs. Under the statute, a cable operator is required to carry in its  entirety the \u201cprimary video\u201d of the commercial broadcast station.According to FCC, largely parallel provisions are contained in the statute  relating to carriage of noncommercial stations. Although FCC recognized  that the term \u201cprimary video\u201d was susceptible to different interpretations,  FCC concluded that, based on the available record, the term \u201cprimary  video\u201d means a single programming stream and other program-related  content. In its Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC sought  comment on the appropriate parameters for \u201cprogram-related\u201d in the digital  context. FCC also raised questions concerning the applicability of the rules  and policies it adopted in the above cited Order to satellite carriers. Public  television stations and other broadcasters have asked FCC to reconsider its  ruling, and a decision on this request is pending.", "As our own survey of licensees shows, there is a very strong consensus  among licensees that the lack of dual carriage of analog and digital signals  by cable companies, as well as a lack of cable carriage of the entire digital  over the air stream such as multicast offerings are seen as factors impeding  public television\u2019s digital transition. Additionally, there is a strong  consensus that lack of carriage of local stations\u2019 digital signals by direct  broadcast satellite (e.g., DISH Network, DIRECTV), would produce  similarly negative results (see fig. 23). freedom of speech restrictions and a governmental limitation on cable  television providers\u2019 right to decide what services they provide.", "Absent changes to FCC\u2019s ruling on these issues, some in the public  television community have taken the position that they \u201cmust convince\u201d  cable and satellite providers that the digital services offered by public  television are valuable additions for their customers and, therefore, should  be carried by them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Underwriting Acknowledgments on Public Television", "paragraphs": ["One of the distinguishing features of public television is, by definition, its  noncommercial character. Unlike commercial television stations, public  television stations are prohibited from airing advertisements. However,  public television stations are permitted to acknowledge station supportand, without interrupting regular programming, may acknowledge  underwriters on the air. Dating back to the initial decision to reserve  spectrum for noncommercial educational broadcast television, FCC  rejected proposals to allow noncommercial educational licensees the  ability to generate revenues through advertising sales and frequency  sharing with commercial broadcasters. In 1981, as part of a \u201cmajor\u201d  reevaluation of the noncommercial educational broadcast service, FCC  reaffirmed its rejection of advertising on public television, concluding that  advertiser-supported programming of any kind could harm the service.  FCC\u2019s 1981 policy statement on the nature of public broadcasting states  that the Commission\u2019s interest in creating a noncommercial service in 1951  was to remove the programming decisions of public broadcasters from the  normal kinds of market pressures faced by commercial broadcasters. FCC  noted, however, that acknowledgments of funders are \u201cproper\u201d and  possibly necessary to ensure continued funding from such sources. public broadcasting, and to conduct demonstrations of limited advertising  for the purpose of \u201creduc the uncertainty about the advantages and  disadvantages accompanying public broadcast station\u2019s use of limited  commercial advertising or expanded underwriting credits.\u201d In its 1983  Report to the Congress, the Temporary Commission concluded that  potential revenues from advertising were limited in scope and that the  avoidance of significant risks to public broadcasting could not be ensured.  In addition, it recommended that the Congress continue to provide federal  funding for public broadcasting until or unless adequate alternative  financing becomes available.", "Under current law, the Communications Act defines a \u201cnoncommercial  educational broadcast station\u201d and \u201cpublic broadcast station\u201d as a  television or radio broadcast station that under the rules and regulations of  the Commission in effect on November 2, 1978, is eligible to be licensed as  a station that is \u201cowned and operated by a public agency or nonprofit  private foundation, corporation or association\u201d or \u201cis owned and operated  by a municipality and which transmits only noncommercial programs for  educational purposes.\u201d For our purposes here, the act defines  \u201cadvertisements\u201d as any message or other programming material that is  broadcast or otherwise transmitted \u201cin exchange for any remuneration\u201d  and is intended to \u201cpromote any service, facility, or product\u201d of for-profit  entities. As noted above, the act permits public broadcasting stations to  provide facilities and services for remuneration so long as those uses do  not interfere with stations\u2019 provision of public telecommunications  services; the act also prohibits stations from making their facilities  \u201cavailable to any person for the broadcasting of any advertisement.\u201d identification purposes only. Such acknowledgments may not promote the  contributors\u2019 products, services, or business, and may not contain  comparative or qualitative descriptions, price information, calls to action,  or inducements to buy, sell, rent, or lease.

Recognizing that it may be  difficult to distinguish between language that \u201cpromotes\u201d and language that  merely \u201cidentifies\u201d an underwriter, broadcasters must make \u201creasonable  good faith judgments\u201d to exclude language or visual elements in their  acknowledgments that promote the contributors\u2019 products, services, or  business. Consistent with the identification of underwriters, FCC has  determined that acknowledgments may include, in addition to the  underwriter\u2019s name, the following identifying information:  logo-grams or slogans which identify and do not promote,  location information and telephone numbers, value neutral descriptions of a product line or service, and/or brand and trade names and product or service listings.", "According to FCC, enforcement primarily occurs through self-policing by  licensees of public television stations and also by the Commission\u2019s  response to complaints. For the period from January 2000 through early  February 2004, FCC had 43 complaint cases. Thirteen of the complaints  were denied or dismissed, 17 complaints resulted in admonishments or  cautions, and 2 resulted in notices of apparent liability. Eleven others were  under investigation. distributed programs may be identified on air. The acceptance of program  funding from third parties, the guidelines state, are intended to ensure that  editorial control of programming remains in the hands of program  producers, that funding arrangements will not create the perception that  editorial control has been exercised by someone other than the producer,  and that the noncommercial character of public broadcasting is protected  and preserved. PBS guidelines also specify that the maximum duration for  all underwriter acknowledgments may not exceed 60 seconds and  generally that the maximum duration for a single underwriter not exceed  15 seconds. Other national distributors of public television programming,  such as American Public Television and the National Educational  Telecommunications Association, also have guidelines with similar  acknowledgment length limitations. The PBS Board adopted an exception  to its guidelines in February 2003. As modified, the maximum duration for  one underwriter may not exceed 30 seconds within a 60-second maximum  interval for all acknowledgments. This applies only to underwriters that  contribute $2.5 million or more per year for the production of PBS\u2019s prime  time programming and the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.", "In our survey of licensees, we asked several questions related to the airing  of 30-second underwriting acknowledgments by licensees themselves and  not those aired as part of PBS programming. The percentage of licensees  that said they are currently airing 30-second acknowledgments (41 percent)  was equal to the percentage of licensees that said that they neither air, nor  plan to air, 30-second underwriting acknowledgments. An additional 9  percent of the licensees responded that they intend to air 30-second  acknowledgments in the future. Figure 24 illustrates the responses of  licensees to this question.", "Of the respondents who told us that they are currently airing 30-second  acknowledgments, the earliest date provided for the first airing of such  acknowledgments was 1982.", "We also asked licensees who currently air or plan to air 30-second  acknowledgments to prioritize the reasons for such decisions.

For both groups, maintaining revenues from existing  underwriters was the second most frequently identified top priority.

See our comments  below on the attached legal memorandum from Covington and Burling.  The Corporation notes that its ability to support projects designed to  improve the system as a whole could decrease if it had to depend only  on system support funds. We recognize the Corporation\u2019s concern.  However, we continue to believe that this is a matter that should be  addressed to the Congress.", "2.", "The point of the cited paragraph of our report is limited to historical  background and is not a characterization of congressional commitment  to public television. To restate, when the Public Broadcasting Act of  1967 was passed, annual congressional appropriations were seen as a  temporary measure pending the development and adoption of a long\u00ad term financing plan for public broadcasting. Absent the development of  such a plan, the Congress has in fact continued to support public  broadcasting with annual appropriations at the levels indicated in  figure 3. We agree with the Corporation that when the Congress  deferred the development of a long-term financing plan at the time the  1967 act was passed, it did not intend that federal funding for the  Corporation would be discontinued. Congressional committee reports  accompanying the 1967 legislation and subsequent reauthorization  legislation suggest the need for ongoing federal funding to enable the  Corporation to fulfill its mission.", "3.", "We do not agree with the Corporation that our report implies that its  policy decisions should be made on the basis of our survey of licensees.  Although we recognize that the views of licensees are, by statute and in  practice, central to the making of policy decisions by the Corporation,  the survey served as only one source of evidence for our review. We  determined that it was important to ascertain the views of licensees  because we believe they are integral to the discussion of the statutory  framework for federal support of public television and the  Corporation\u2019s funding programs and processes. The findings,  conclusions, and recommendations in this report are based on several  methodologies we employed to review the Corporation\u2019s activities in  support of public television (as described in app. I) including, but not  limited to, the survey of public television licensees.", "President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting to Mindi Weisenbloom, Senior Attorney,  General Accounting Office, dated August 11, 2003.  6. \t Our review did not examine whether the make-up of the Television  Future Fund advisory panels have adequately represented a cross\u00ad section of the public broadcasting community. We note that the  Corporation intends to change the composition of the advisory panel to  ensure a greater representation from across the station community. It  also appears that the Corporation envisions that the panel will operate  more as an investment board than as a consultation panel. Although the  Corporation contends that the Future Fund plan has been regularly  placed before the constituent elements of public broadcasting, our  survey of public television licensees indicates a number of concerns  about the program. For example, 42 percent of the respondents to our  survey indicated that they had little or no knowledge about the findings  and outcomes of Television Future Fund projects. Overall, only 41  percent of licensees responding to our survey indicated that the  projects had provided them with practical methods for reducing costs  and/or enhancing revenues. The Corporation\u2019s approach for funding the  Television Future Fund program was another area identified in our  survey as a concern for licensees. Only 30 percent of the responding  licensees indicated that they favored the current funding approach, and  one-fifth of our survey respondents indicated that the Corporation  should cease all funding for the program.  7. \t We agree that nothing in the statute suggests that the Corporation\u2019s role  is passive. Section 396(k)(6)(B) provides the Corporation with  discretion to establish eligibility criteria and a formula for the  distribution of funds reserved by the Congress for public television to  the licensees. However, this discretion must be exercised within the  constraints of the provision. The Corporation must periodically review  its eligibility criteria with the station community, and the formula must  be designed to provide for the financial needs and requirements of  stations and to maintain existing, and stimulate new, sources of  nonfederal financial support. More importantly, the provision provides  that the funds are to be distributed to licensees. Thus, under the plain  meaning of the provision, these funds are not available for the  Corporation\u2019s use or for the Corporation to decide how the licensees  may use the funds. Nor are the funds available for distribution to  entities other than the licensees themselves.", "8. \t The statute specifies that it is the recipients of the funds, in other words  the public television licensees, who have discretion over the use of  these funds. Specifically, section 396(k)(7) provides that these funds  \u201cmay be used at the discretion of the recipient for purposes related  primarily to the production or acquisition of programming.\u201d  9. \t GAO is not suggesting that the Corporation \u201cpick and choose\u201d stations  for grants. Rather, under the plain meaning of section 396(k)(6)(B), the  Corporation is to distribute the funds reserved to television stations on  the basis of eligibility criteria and a formula. And under the plain  meaning of section 396(k)(7), it is the licensees who have the discretion  over the use of these funds within the constraints of the statute. The  Congress has directed that the 396(k)(6)(B) funds be used \u201cfor  purposes related primarily to the production or acquisition of  programming.\u201d  10.  We disagree that the Congress has ratified the Corporation\u2019s use of  section 396(k)(6)(B) funds for the purposes of the Future Fund by  continuing to make funds available for distribution under section  396(k)(6)(B). \u201cRatification by appropriation\u201d is the doctrine by which  the Congress can, by the appropriation of funds, confer legitimacy on  any agency action that was questionable when it was taken. However,  this doctrine is not favored and will not be accepted where prior  knowledge of the specific disputed action cannot be demonstrated  clearly. GAO summarized the test courts have used to find ratification  by appropriation in B-285725, September 29, 2000. \u201cTo conclude that Congress through the appropriations process has ratified agency  action, three factors generally must be present. First, the agency takes the action  pursuant to at least arguable authority; second, the Congress has specific knowledge of  the facts; and third, the appropriation of funds clearly bestows the claimed authority.\u201d", "All three elements are missing here. The Corporation does not have the  authority to use funds designated for distribution to public television  licensees to support the Future Fund. The Congress has not clearly  been informed that the Future Fund is supported in part with section  396(k)(6)(B) funds. Finally, the Congress has not in any way indicated  that the funds it has provided to the Corporation for public television  licensees may be used to support the Television Future Fund.  Accordingly, \u201cratification by appropriation\u201d is not applicable in this  instance. exercise their discretion over the use of their funds to contribute to  such efforts.  14.  As stated in the report, under the plain meaning of the statute, section  396(k)(6)(B) directs the Corporation to distribute the balance of funds  reserved for television stations, after deduction of the basic grant, \u201cto  licensees of such stations.\u201d Thus, the Corporation does not have the  discretion to distribute these funds to other than public television  licensees even if the purpose of the grant is to ultimately benefit public  television stations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Public Broadcasting Service", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Public Boardcasting Service\u2019s  letter dated March 15, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["We have edited language in the report to clarify that the funds needed to  complete the Enhanced Interconnection Optimization Project of $12  million to $15 million are separate from those to purchase the Next  Generation Interconnection System."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Dennis Amari, Alan Belkin,  Edda Emmanuelli-Perez, Colin Fallon, Michele Fejfar, Kevin Heinz, Logan Kleier, Randall Lennox, Omari Norman, Tina Sherman, Mindi Weisenbloom,  and Alwynne Wilbur made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
