GAO reviewed and analyzed planning, funding, and performance documents from U.S. agencies and implementing partners, and interviewed U.S. officials in Washington, D.C., and U.S., Afghan, and donor officials in Afghanistan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The goals outlined in the U.S. government's 2010 Inter-Agency Water Strategy generally align with Afghan government strategic goals for the water sector. The Strategy identifies short, medium, and long-term goals to be achieved between 2010 and 2014. Additionally, since 2002, the U.S. government has implemented a wide range of water projects throughout Afghanistan to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation, agriculture irrigation, and water-sector management. These projects generally align with Afghan water-sector goals. The United States expects to accelerate development efforts in the water sector and estimates that an additional $2.1 billion will be needed to fund these efforts from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014. The Government Performance and Results Act and several U.S. strategic documents concerning operations in Afghanistan emphasize the importance of interagency coordination. GAO has reported on the importance of interagency coordination and collaboration when multiple U.S. agencies are involved in U.S. counterterrorism-related efforts. GAO's review showed that the United States has taken steps to better coordinate water-sector development projects but that additional efforts are needed. For example, the U.S. government has developed an Infrastructure Working Group, an Inter-Agency Water Strategy, and has started to meet on a regular basis. However, an interagency implementation plan called for in the strategy has not been completed. Also, USAID and DOD have not developed a centralized database to enhance coordination, which GAO previously recommended. Moreover, U.S. agencies generally do not meet on a regular basis with all the relevant ministries in the Afghan government, and they lack complete data concerning other donor projects to maximize the U.S. investment in development projects. USAID's Automated Directives System outlines USAID's performance management and monitoring procedures. GAO found that gaps existed in USAID's performance management and monitoring efforts for water sector projects in Afghanistan. For example, while 4 of the 6 implementers of projects GAO reviewed established performance indicators, some did not always establish targets for the indicators as required. In addition, although USAID collected quarterly progress reports from 5 of the 6 water project implementers for the projects GAO reviewed, it did not analyze and interpret this information as required. Finally, though USAID has identified several alternative monitoring procedures staff can use to help mitigate monitoring challenges in high threat environments, USAID has not effectively ensured that such guidance was disseminated to staff in Afghanistan. The U.S. government has included a focus on building sustainability into U.S.-funded water projects in Afghanistan. Recent U.S. strategies have emphasized the importance of project sustainability. GAO has identified two key elements to ensuring water project sustainability: enhancing technical and managerial capacity to maintain projects within the institutions with water-sector responsibilities, and ensuring funding is available to keep projects operational after they have been completed. Ongoing USAID water projects included in this review have incorporated sustainability initiatives. DOD guidance also emphasizes sustainability. However, DOD officials have acknowledged the difficulties of sustaining water projects in Afghanistan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes several recommendations to the USAID Administrator, in conjunction with DOD and other relevant agencies, to improve planning, coordination, and management of U.S.-funded water projects in Afghanistan.

These are  among the lowest rates in the world. Agriculture, the source of livelihood  for almost 80 percent of the population, accounts for up to 93 percent of  Afghanistan\u2019s total water usage through irrigation. Yet, only about 30  percent of Afghanistan\u2019s agricultural land receives adequate water.  Between 2002 and the second quarter of 2010, the U.S. government has  awarded about $250 million for water development efforts in Afghanistan  and, in March 2010, estimated it would need an additional $2.1 billion in  funding to achieve U.S. development efforts in Afghanistan\u2019s water sector  from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014.

To ascertain the alignment of U.S. funded projects to  Afghan water goals, we analyzed the objectives of three ongoing USAID- funded water-exclusive projects and four USAID-funded water-exclusive  projects completed since 2003. These projects represent about 50 percent  of the total funding disbursed by USAID for water projects in Afghanistan  from fiscal year 2002 through the 2nd quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Additionally, we identified 19 USAID-funded infrastructure projects  completed or ongoing since 2002 that contained water-related activities.  We received data for 13 of these projects. From these, we identified 511  water-related activities. These activities together accounted for about 50  percent of total USAID disbursed funding for water projects in  Afghanistan from fiscal year 2002 through the 2nd quarter of fiscal year  2010. To assess the U.S. government\u2019s performance management and  evaluation efforts, we reviewed five of the seven USAID water-exclusive  projects and one of USAID\u2019s water-related projects that had a large water  component. Our findings from these six projects cannot be generalized to  water projects we did not include in our review. We also reviewed CERP  regulations to ascertain CERP planning and monitoring requirements for  water projects, as well as prior GAO reports that addressed CERP-funded  development efforts in Afghanistan.

While some of this water is lost to evaporation, the  balance recharges Afghanistan\u2019s surface and groundwater systems, which  serve as the nation\u2019s primary sources of water. Only about 30 percent of  agricultural land receives adequate supplies of water, and Afghanistan  now uses less than a third of its available water resources. Furthermore,  the lack of infrastructure to store and control river flow results in severe  flooding in some years and drought in others.", "Almost 80 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population derives their livelihood  from the agriculture sector, which is highly dependent on irrigation.  Afghanistan is mountainous and much of its land is not naturally arable  (see fig. 1). Specifically, irrigation makes up 93 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s  total water usage. The agriculture sector, however, has been severely  impacted by years of civil strife and war, droughts and damaging floods,  and breakdowns in community-based and government institutions  operating the Afghan irrigation systems. As a consequence, irrigation  infrastructure seriously deteriorated and many farmers returning to their  land cannot get a reliable irrigation water supply.", "In addition, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, social services, and  markets among the rural population is the lowest in the region and among  the lowest in the world.

The World Bank has reported that  current access to piped water infrastructure is among the lowest in the  world at 18 percent, and because of poor operation and maintenance, the  water service reaches an even lower share of the population. In addition, a  report prepared by a USAID Afghanistan Program Manager for Power and  Water noted that while Kabul has an estimated 35 percent of the city\u2019s  population served by piped water, it has no municipal wastewater system.

As a result, U.S. officials we met with acknowledged that  opportunities to leverage resources and to establish synergy among  projects were often overlooked.

These regulations also state  staff should address whether recipients of CERP funding for projects  equal to or greater than $500,000 have a plan for sustainability and who  will be providing long-term maintenance and sustainability for the project.  In addition, CERP officials we met with in Afghanistan acknowledged the  importance of Afghan technical and managerial capacity and the  availability of funds for post-project operations and maintenance of CERP  water projects, but pointed out that DOD is not responsible for  establishing long-term sustainability strategies.", "DOD officials have acknowledged the difficulty of sustaining CERP  projects in Afghanistan. CERP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials  acknowledged that the physical sustainability of projects and maintenance  is a problem. A DOD official noted that building capacity and ensuring  projects can be sustained is more difficult than building the projects  themselves. Another DOD official stated that having Afghans with the  necessary skills and funding for operations and maintenance of projects  was essential for the long-term sustainability of water projects. This  official and others acknowledged a number of CERP projects, once  completed and handed over to Afghans, were not sustained because the  Afghans lacked the capacity to sustain them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The development of the Afghan water sector is critical to the stability of  Afghanistan, given the role of water in enhancing agriculture productivity  and improving the health and well-being of the Afghan populace. Thus, the  U.S. government\u2019s assistance in the water sector is an important element  of U.S. development and counter-insurgency efforts. The approximately  $250 million that the United States awarded from fiscal year 2002 through  the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 has funded a significant number of  water projects, but it pales in comparison to the over $2 billion the United  States has projected would be needed to meet U.S. assistance obligations  for water in the next 5 years. Because of this, planning, coordination, and  oversight are particularly important. While the U.S. efforts and the goals  are outlined in the 2010 U.S. Inter-Agency Water Strategy, the U.S.  government lacks an interagency implementation plan called for in its  strategy and that best practices have shown is critical to enhancing the  coordination of multi-agency efforts. In addition, a centralized database  that tracks all U.S. development projects in Afghanistan\u2014including water- sector development, which we previously reported was lacking\u2014 does not  currently exist. This is especially important in light of the U.S. Inter- Agency Water Strategy that indicates that multiple agencies would become  involved in Afghan water-sector activities going forward. Lack of  coordination and information sharing creates the potential for duplication  of efforts and missed opportunities for synergy and the leveraging of  resources among U.S. agencies.", "USAID did not ensure that its implementing partners had established  indicators or performance targets as required and did not consistently  analyze and interpret implementing partner performance data, which is  vital to making program adjustments, higher level decisions, and resource  allocations. Without a set of agreed upon performance indicators and  targets, it becomes more difficult for USAID to accurately assess the  performance of USAID-funded water projects in Afghanistan. Also, it is  important that USAID routinely analyze and interpret data from project  reports submitted by implementers, as its monitoring procedures require.  Further, given security challenges may impede site visits to some project  locations, it is important that USAID take steps to more effectively  disseminate previously-approved alternative monitoring methods for \u201chigh  threat\u201d environment to its mission staff.
