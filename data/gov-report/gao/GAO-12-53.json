These programs provide offenders with intensive court supervision, mandatory drug testing, substance-abuse treatment, and other social services as an alternative to adjudication or incarceration. As of June 2010, there were over 2,500 drug courts operating nationwide, of which about 1,400 target adult offenders. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) administers the Adult Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program, which provides financial and technical assistance to develop and implement adult drug-court programs. DOJ requires grantees that receive funding to provide data that measure their performance. In response to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, this report assesses (1) data DOJ collected on the performance of federally funded adult drug courts and to what extent DOJ used these data in making grant- related decisions, and (2) what is known about the effectiveness of drug courts.

For example, during September 2011, BJA assessed a sample of adult drug-court grantees' performance across a range of variables, using a new process it calls GrantStat. BJA developed recommendations following this assessment and is determining their feasibility. In addition, in October 2011, BJA finalized revisions to the performance measures on which grantees report. BJA's process of revising its performance measures generally adhered to key practices, such as obtaining stakeholder involvement; however, BJA could improve upon two practices as it continues to assess and revise measures in the future. First, while BJA plans to assess the reliability of the new measures after the first quarter of grantees' reporting, officials have not documented, as suggested by best practices, how it will determine if the measures were successful or whether changes would be needed. Second, should future changes to the measures be warranted, BJA could improve the way it documents its decisions and incorporates feedback from stakeholders, including grantees, by recording key methods and assumptions used to guide its revision efforts. By better adhering to best practices identified by GAO and academic literature, BJA could better ensure that its future revision efforts result in successful and reliable metrics--and that the revision steps it has taken are transparent. In the evaluations that GAO reviewed, drug-court program participation was generally associated with lower recidivism. GAO's analysis of evaluations reporting recidivism data for 32 programs showed that drug-court program participants were generally less likely to be re-arrested than comparison group members drawn from criminal court, with differences in likelihood reported to be statistically significant for 18 of the programs. Cost-benefit analyses showed mixed results. For example: (1) Across studies showing re-arrest differences, the percentages of drug- court program participants re-arrested were lower than for comparison group members by 6 to 26 percentage points. Drug court participants who completed their program had re-arrest rates 12 to 58 percentage points below those of the comparison group. (2) GAO's analysis of evaluations reporting relapse data for eight programs showed that drug-court program participants were less likely than comparison group members to use drugs, based on drug tests or self- reported drug use, although the difference was not always significant. (3) Of the studies assessing drug-court costs and benefits, the net benefit ranged from positive $47,852 to negative $7,108 per participant."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that BJA document key methods used to guide future revisions of its performance measures for the adult drug-court program.

A drug court is a  specialized court-based program that targets criminal offenders who have  alcohol and other drug addiction and dependency problems. Drug courts  have implemented deferred prosecution or post-adjudication case- processing approaches, or have blended both in their organizational  structures. In drug courts using deferred prosecution, defendants waive  rights to a trial and enter a treatment program shortly after being charged;  those who subsequently fail to complete the treatment program have their  charges adjudicated, while those who complete the program are not  prosecuted further, or have their charges dismissed. In post-adjudication  case processing, defendants are tried and convicted, but either have  deferred sentences or suspensions of incarceration until they complete or  withdraw from the treatment program. The first approach offers  individuals the opportunity to obtain treatment and avoid the possibility of  a felony conviction, while the second provides a rehabilitation incentive  because treatment progress is factored into the sentencing determination.  As of June 2010, there were over 2,500 drug courts operating throughout  the United States, of which about 1,400 of these target adult offenders.  Drug courts are generally based on a comprehensive model involving  \uf0b7  monitoring (e.g., drug testing) and supervision;  \uf0b7  graduated sanctions and incentives; and  treatment services.", "The Department of Justice (DOJ), through its Office of Justice Programs\u2019  (OJP) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), administers the Adult Drug  Court Discretionary Grant Program, which provides financial and  technical assistance to states, state courts, local courts, units of local  government, and Indian tribal governments to develop and implement  drug treatment courts. The total amount BJA has awarded in grants  through the program increased from about $2 million in fiscal year 2006 to  $29 million in fiscal year 2010, and the number of grants it has awarded  during the same period increased 588 percent. Pursuant to the  Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), DOJ requires  applicants that receive funding through the program to provide data that  measure the results of their work.", "In April 2002, we reported that DOJ had not sufficiently managed its  efforts to collect performance measurement and outcome data from  federally funded drug courts. We recommended that DOJ take actions to  address these concerns, and DOJ agreed with our recommendations and  took actions in response. Appendix I provides information on the status of  these recommendations. In February 2005, we studied drug courts again  and reported that in most of the 27 drug-court program evaluations we  reviewed, adult drug-court programs led to recidivism reductions\u2014that is,  reductions in new criminal offenses\u2014during periods of time that generally  corresponded to the length of the drug court program.

We briefed your offices on our  preliminary results on July 18, 2011. This report includes our final results  related to the following questions: (1) What data does DOJ collect on the  performance of federally funded adult drug courts, and to what extent has  it used these data in making grant related decisions? And (2) What is  known about the effectiveness of adult drug courts in reducing recidivism  and substance-abuse relapse rates, and what are the costs and benefits  of adult drug courts? In addition, appendix I of this report provides  information on the extent to which DOJ has addressed the  recommendations that we made in 2002 regarding drug court programs.", "To address the first question, we analyzed: the reporting guidance and  requirements that BJA provided in fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to  grantees applying for Adult Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program  funds; BJA-generated grantee performance data reports from October to  December 2010; and BJA\u2019s guides for managing grants and enforcing  grantee compliance that were issued in fiscal year 2011. We selected  2007 as the starting point for our review because BJA implemented its  Performance Measurement Tool (PMT)\u2014an online reporting tool that  supports BJA grantees\u2019 ability to collect, identify, and report performance  measurement data activities funded by the award\u2014in fiscal year 2007.  We also reviewed our prior reports and internal control standards as well  as other academic literature regarding effective performance  management practices. Further, we interviewed cognizant BJA officials  about the extent to which they use grantees\u2019 performance data when  engaging in these management activities, any challenges faced with  ensuring grantee compliance, ongoing efforts to revise program  performance metrics, and the extent to which BJA\u2019s revisions incorporate  best practices we previously identified.", "To address the second question, we conducted a systematic review of  evaluations of drug court program effectiveness issued from February  2004 through March 2011 to identify what is known about the effect of  drug court programs on the recidivism of and relapse of drug involved  individuals as well as the costs and benefits of drug courts. We also  reviewed DOJ\u2019s National Institute of Justice (NIJ)-funded Multi-Site Adult  Drug Court Evaluation (MADCE), a 5-year longitudinal process, impact,  and cost evaluation of adult drug courts that was issued in June 2011, a  summary of which we provide in appendix II. We identified the universe  of evaluations to include in our review using a three-stage process. First,  we identified evaluations by searching databases and Web sites. Second,  we selected evaluations of adult drug court programs in the United States  that report recidivism, substance use relapse, and/or costs and benefits.  Third, we screened the selected studies to determine whether each met  criteria for methodological soundness based on generally accepted social  science principles or cost-benefit analysis criteria. From more than 260  studies in our initial group, we assessed the findings of 44 studies that  met our criteria and reported on the effectiveness of 32 drug court  programs or sets of programs. See appendix III for additional details on  our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2010 through  December 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government- auditing standards.

Drug court programs share several general characteristics but vary in  their specific policies and procedures because of, among other things,  differences in local jurisdictions and criminal justice system practices. In  general, judges preside over drug court proceedings, which are called  status hearings; monitor offenders\u2019 progress with mandatory drug testing;  and prescribe sanctions and incentives as appropriate in collaboration  with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, and others.  Drug court programs vary in terms of the substance-abuse treatment  required. However, most programs offer a range of treatment options and  generally require a minimum of 1 year of participation before an offender  completes the program.", "Practices for determining defendants\u2019 eligibility for drug court participation  vary across drug court programs, but typically involve screening  defendants for their criminal history, current case information, whether  they are on probation, and their substance use, which can include the  frequency and type of use, prior treatment experiences, and motivation to  seek treatment. In 2005, we reported that based on literature reviewed,  eligible drug-court program participants ranged from nonviolent offenders  charged with drug-related offenses who had substance addictions, to  relatively medium risk defendants with fairly extensive criminal histories  and who had failed prior substance-abuse-treatment experiences.  Appendix IV presents additional information about the general  characteristics of drug court programs.

In particular, while drug  courts generally adhere to certain key program components, drug courts  can differ in factors including admission criteria, type and duration of drug  treatment, degree of judicial monitoring and intervention, and application  of sanctions for noncompliance. In February 2005, we studied drug courts  and reported that in most of the 27 drug-court program evaluations we  reviewed, adult drug court programs led to recidivism reductions during  periods of time that generally corresponded to the length of the drug court  program. Several syntheses of multiple drug court program evaluations,  conducted in 2005 and 2006, also concluded that drug courts are  associated with reduced recidivism rates, compared to traditional  correctional options.

Since fiscal year 2008, BJA has  required grantees to submit quantitative performance data on a quarterly  basis and qualitative performance information on a semi-annual basis.  The quantitative information grantees submit to BJA varies depending on  the type of grant awarded. For example, information that BJA can  calculate based on what Implementation grantees have been required to  submit quarterly includes \u201cthe percent of drug court participants who  exhibit a reduction in substance use during the reporting period,\u201d \u201cthe  percent of program participants who re-offended while in the drug court  program,\u201d and \u201cthe number and percent of drug court graduates.\u201d  Information that BJA can calculate based on what Enhancement grantees  have been required to submit includes \u201cthe increase in units of substance- abuse treatment services\u201d and \u201cthe percent increase in services provided  to participants.\u201d In addition to the quarterly reporting of quantitative  performance data, all adult drug court grantees must submit progress  reports semi-annually.

In  early fiscal year 2011, BJA officials initiated a new process called  GrantStat to maximize the use of performance information by leveraging  the resources of other BJA divisions, BJA\u2019s training and technical  assistance partners, its contractor, and other key stakeholders.  GrantStat provides an analytical framework to assess grantee  performance data and other relevant information on a semi-annual basis  to determine the effectiveness of the grant programs in BJA\u2019s portfolio.", "In September 2011, BJA officials applied GrantStat to a review of the  Adult Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program. As part of the process,  they collected, reviewed, and analyzed performance data and other  relevant information from a cohort of Implementation grantees to  determine the overall effectiveness of the adult drug court program and to  identify grantees that might need additional technical assistance to  improve their outcomes. BJA officials told us that as part of the GrantStat  review, they and their technical-assistance provider\u2019s staff reviewed  selected Implementation grantees\u2019 responses to the seven narrative  questions and discussed common issues they each identified. For  example, BJA identified that a number of grantees had lower-than- expected capacity because drug court stakeholders (e.g., district  attorneys) were referring fewer drug-involved defendants to these drug  courts. BJA also reported reviewing and discussing other qualitative  information, such as the training and technical assistance provider\u2019s site- visit reports, to determine grantees\u2019 fidelity to the 10 key components.  BJA officials acknowledged that prior to GrantStat, they had not  leveraged the summary data that its technical assistance providers had  previously compiled from grantees\u2019 narrative responses to these seven  questions and indicated that future iterations of GrantStat would continue  to include both qualitative and quantitative performance data reviews.", "Our prior work has emphasized the importance of using performance data  to inform key decisions and underscored that performance measures  can be used to demonstrate the benefits of a program or identify ways to  improve it. In addition, we also have reported that effective performance  measurement systems include steps to use performance information to  make decisions. In doing so, program managers can improve their  programs and results. Recognizing that BJA is working through  GrantStat to improve its use of performance data in managing the drug  court program, we identified six management activities for which  performance information can be most useful to decision makers and  benchmarked BJA\u2019s practices against them. The six activities are:   (1) setting program priorities, (2) allocating resources, (3) adopting new  program approaches, (4) identifying and sharing with stakeholders more  effective program processes and approaches, (5) setting expectations for  grantees, and (6) monitoring grantee performance. See appendix VII for  the definition of the six management activities.

For example, officials told us that grantees may have been  confused with how to measure \u201cthe number of participants admitted\u201d and  \u201cthe number of drug court participants.\u201d Specifically, BJA officials added  that their analysis of several years of data shows that some grantees  reported the same number for these two measures, some grantees  reported a higher number than were admitted, a few grantees reported a  lesser number for the number of participants than the number admitted,  and some grantees reported these two measures in each of these three  ways over multiple reporting periods.

Examples of these measures include the demographic make-up of  their drug court participant populations, the amount of service  provided to their participants, and the geographic location of their drug  courts;  \uf0b7  Enhancement, Joint, and Statewide grantees are required to report on  participant level outcomes, such as graduation rates, to ensure  consistency with measures BJA collects from Implementation  grantees;  \uf0b7  Measures previously excluded from the PMT, such as retention rates  and outcomes of participants once they complete the drug court  program, are now included;  \uf0b7  BJA has established two sets of benchmarks as points of reference  against which to gauge grantees\u2019 performance. The first set of  benchmarks requires a comparison of grantees\u2019 performance against  averages of drug court performance derived from research. The  second set of benchmarks requires a comparison of grantees\u2019  performance to historical performance data reported to BJA by adult  drug court grantees; and  \uf0b7  BJA revised the descriptions and the definitions of the measures to  help ensure their clarity.", "To revise the performance measures, BJA officials consulted with  technical assistance providers and a drug court researcher to discuss  possible improvements to the performance measures, reviewed drug  court literature, and reviewed and analyzed BJA grantees\u2019 clarification  and information requests to identify the most common problems adult  drug court grantees historically experienced submitting performance  information to BJA. In addition, BJA obtained comments on the  proposed measures from BJA staff and other DOJ stakeholders, as well  as Enhancement, Implementation, Joint, and Statewide grantees. BJA  officials also invited all current grantees to participate in four  teleconferences to obtain their feedback on the feasibility of collecting and  reporting the new measures and their suggestions to improve the clarity  of the measures\u2019 definitions and descriptions. BJA officials finalized the  new measures in October 2011 and plan to closely monitor grantees\u2019  performance data submissions to ensure the reliability and usefulness of  the measures and then revise as necessary after the first reporting  period. BJA officials also stated that they expected to review the  measures\u2019 overall reliability and validity after the first reporting period\u2014 October 1, 2011, through December 30, 2011.", "BJA officials reported that the revised measures will strengthen the  reliability and improve the usefulness of grantee performance data in  making grant-related decisions. For example, BJA officials stated that  reliable and useful data would help them to identify the most effective  grantees and common characteristics these courts share to inform the  types of drug courts the officials choose to fund in future grant  solicitations. BJA officials also reported that as a result of the revision,  they expect to be able to conduct more sophisticated analyses using  GrantStat that are needed to inform grant-related decisions. For example,  BJA officials told us that implementing benchmarks and participant level  measures will enable the agency to compare similar drug courts (e.g.,  large-urban jurisdictions of similar size, demographic make-up, and  geographic context) to one another and across jurisdictions, thereby  improving BJA\u2019s understanding of grantees\u2019 impact on the populations  they serve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BJA Could Enhance Two Key Practices as It Continues to Review and Revise Its Adult Drug Court Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["BJA\u2019s process to revise its performance measures generally adhered to  some of the key practices that we have identified as important to ensuring  that measures are relevant and useful to decision-making.

The key  practices also describe the value of testing the measures to ensure that  they are credible, reliable and valid and documenting key steps  throughout the revision process. However, BJA could take actions to  improve its efforts in these two areas. For instance, BJA officials told us  that after the grantees\u2019 first reporting period concludes, they plan to assess  the data that grantees submitted to ensure that the measures produce  reliable and useful data over at least the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.  They stated that if necessary, at that point they will then further revise the  measures. Nevertheless, BJA officials have not documented how they will  determine if the measures were successful or whether changes would be  needed. In addition, BJA officials did not record key methods and  assumptions used to guide their revision efforts, such as the feedback  stakeholders provided and BJA\u2019s disposition of these comments. For  example, BJA officials provided a document generally showing the original  performance measure; whether it was removed, revised or replaced; and  BJA\u2019s justification for the action, but this document did not demonstrate  how BJA had incorporated the stakeholder feedback it considered when  making its decisions.

In the past,  we have reported that revising performance measures involves a number of  aspects needing to be carefully planned and carried out and that by  documenting the steps undertaken in developing and implementing the  revised measures, agencies can be better assured their revisions result in  effective performance measures. In addition, academic literature on the  best practices for developing effective performance measures states that  agencies should develop products to document and guide their revision  efforts. These products, among other things, can include plans for ensuring  the quality and integrity of the data for full-scale implementation of the  measures. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government call for clear documentation of significant events, which can  include assumptions and methods surrounding key decisions, and this  documentation should be readily available for examination. As BJA moves  forward in assessing the revised measures and implementing additional  changes, if it deems necessary, BJA could better ensure that its efforts result  in successful and reliable metrics and are transparent by documenting key  methods used to guide revision efforts and an assessment of its measures.

In general, the evaluations we reviewed found larger  differences in re-arrest rates between drug-court program completers and  members of the comparison group than between all drug-court program  participants and the comparison group members.

Our methodology for  rating the evaluation studies is detailed in appendix III. After assigning the  rating, we grouped the studies into two tiers. Tier 1 studies were the most  carefully designed and incorporated substantial statistical rigor in their  analyses. Tier 2 studies, while still meeting our basic criteria for  methodological soundness, were relatively less rigorous in their design and  analyses. Both tier 1 and tier 2 studies reported differences between drug  court participants and comparison group members and both sets of studies  found that some but not all differences were statistically significant.", "Table 3 shows whether a difference in recidivism rates was reported for  each program\u2014expressed as the difference in the rate of re-arrest  between all drug court program participants and the comparison group.

In those cases, table 3 notes  that a difference was reported, but does not include the difference in re- arrest rates. For example, the evaluation of the Queens Misdemeanor  Treatment Court reported that the re-arrest rate for program participants  was 14 percentage points lower than the re-arrest rate of comparison  group members up to 2 years after participants entered into the program,  and 10 percentage points lower at 3 or more years after entry. Similarly,  the evaluation of the Hillsborough County Adult Drug Court reported a  statistically significant difference in the relative odds of an arrest after  drug court program enrollment but did not report the difference in rearrest  rates, therefore table 3 indicates a statistically significant reduction in  rearrest rates but does not show the difference in rates.", "The evaluations we reviewed showed that adult drug-court program  participation was also associated with reduced drug use. Our analysis of  evaluations reporting relapse data for eight programs showed that drug  court program participants were less likely than comparison group  members to use drugs, based on drug tests or self-reported drug use,  although the difference was not always significant. This was true for  both within-program and post-program measures, and whether drug use  was reported as the difference in the frequency of drug use or the  proportion of the treatment and comparison groups who used drugs.", "The MADCE concluded drug courts produce significant reductions in drug  relapse. Specifically, MADCE reported that \u201cdrug court participants were  significantly less likely than the comparison group to report using all drugs  (56 vs. 76 percent) and also less likely to report using \u2018serious\u2019 drugs (41  vs. 58 percent), which omit marijuana and \u2018light\u2019 alcohol use (fewer than  four drinks per day for women or less than five drinks per day for men).  On the 18-month oral fluids drug test, significantly fewer drug court  participants tested positive for illegal drugs (29 vs. 46 percent). Further,  among those who tested positive or self-reported using drugs, drug court  participants used drugs less frequently than the comparison group.\u201d  Regarding post-drug court program relapses, the MADCE concluded that  participation in drug court\u2014along with less frequent drug use among  offenders prior to arrest, and the absence of mental health problems\u2014 were the strongest predictors of success against relapses. Table 4  summarizes the results of drug-use relapse reported in the evaluations  we reviewed.", "Of the studies we reviewed, 11 included sufficient information to report a  net benefit figure. Of these studies, the net benefit ranged from positive  $47,852 to negative $7,108 per participant. The net benefit is the  monetary benefit of reduced recidivism accrued to society from the drug  court program through reduced future victimization and justice system  expenditures, less the net costs of the drug court program\u2014that is, the  cost of the program less the cost of processing a case in criminal court. A  negative net benefit value indicates that the costs of the drug court  program outweigh its estimated benefits and that the program was not  found to be cost beneficial. Eight of the studies reported positive net  benefits\u2014the benefits estimated to accrue from the drug court program  exceeded the program\u2019s net costs. Three of the 11 studies reported  negative net benefits. We did not attempt to determine whether the  differences in the reported values were because of differences in study  methodology or the attributes of the drug courts themselves. The  environment in which the drug court operates may also be important. For  example, the largest net benefit reported was for Kings County, in which  members of the comparison group were incarcerated, in contrast to other  programs in which members of the comparison group were given  probation, which is less costly. The more costly the alternative, such as  incarceration, the more likely a drug court will have positive net benefits.  In this case, the study reported that society would accrue $47,852 in  benefits relative to conventional court processing.", "Table 5 below shows whether, based on the available information, the  study was shown to be cost beneficial.

While both the drug court participants and comparison group  participants reported large numbers of crimes in the year preceding  the 18-month follow-up, drug court participants reported statistically  significantly fewer than the comparison group members. Drug court  participants were less likely than members of the comparison group to  report committing any crimes (40 percent vs. 53 percent) and drug  court participants reported committing fewer crimes in the preceding  12 months than comparison group members (43 criminal acts vs. 88  criminal acts). The difference between the two groups in the  probability of an official re-arrest over 24 months was not statistically  significant, though the percentage of individuals rearrested was lower  for the drug court group than the comparison group (52 percent vs. 62  percent), as was the average number of re-arrests (1.24 vs. 1.64).  \uf0b7  Drug courts produce statistically significant reductions in drug use.", "Drug court participants were less likely than members of the  comparison group to report using any drugs (56 percent vs. 76  percent) and any serious drugs (41 percent vs. 58 percent), and less  likely to test positively for drugs at the 18-month follow-up (29 percent  vs. 46 percent). Furthermore, the large difference in self-reported  relapse rates is evident at 6 months (40 percent vs. 59 percent), so  the impact of drug courts on alcohol and other drug use is sustained.  The interview data also indicate that among the drug court  participants and comparison group members that were using drugs,  the drug court participants, on average, were using them less  frequently.  \uf0b7  Drug court participants reported some benefits, relative to comparison  group members, in other areas of their lives. At 18 months, drug court  participants were statistically significantly less likely than comparison  group members to report a need for employment, educational, and  financial services, and reported statistically significantly less family  conflict. However, there were modest, non-significant differences in  employment rates, income, and family emotional support, and no  differences found in experiencing homelessness or depression.  \uf0b7  Regardless of background, most offenders who participated in drug  courts had better outcomes than offenders who were in the  comparison programs. However, the impact of drug courts was  greater for participants with more serious prior drug use and criminal  histories, and the impact was smaller for participants who were  younger, male, African-American, or who had mental health problems.  \uf0b7  While the treatment and service costs were higher for drug court  participants than treatment and service costs associated with the  alternative \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d comparison programs, drug courts  save money through improved outcomes, according to the  researchers, primarily through savings to victims resulting from fewer  crimes and savings resulting from fewer re-arrests and incarcerations.", "The authors of the study assert that their findings have strong internal  validity\u2014that is, that the findings were actually produced by the drug court  programs\u2014and external validity\u2014that is, that the findings can be  generalized to the population of all drug court participants and potential  comparison group members. The claim to strong internal validity is not  without merit, given the high response rates, low attrition, propensity  score adjustments, and conservative estimates produced by the  hierarchical models used. The claim of high internal validity is also  supported by the sensitivity analyses undertaken for several outcomes  using other models and methods of adjustments that produced little or no  change in conclusions. The claim to strong external validity, which relates  to the generalizability of the results beyond the sample of courts and  comparison sites and specific offenders considered, may be somewhat  overstated. The authors note that the 23 drug courts included in the study  represent \u201ca broad mix of urban, suburban, and rural courts from 7  geographic clusters nationwide,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t assure that, collectively,  the drug courts that were included resemble the hundreds of drug courts  that were not included, especially since they were not chosen at random.  It also seems unlikely that the six comparison sites from four states are  representative of all potential controls, or all alternative programs in all  states, and it is potentially problematic that all of the selected sites,  including drug court and comparison sites, were alike in their willingness  and interest in participating. Those concerns notwithstanding, this is the  broadest and most ambitious study of drug courts to date; it is well done  analytically; and the results, as they relate to the impact of drug courts,  are transparent and well described."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MADCE\u2019s Cost Benefit Analysis Focused on Individuals", "paragraphs": ["The MADCE cost benefit analysis approach differed from most of the  other studies we reviewed. In most of the other studies, the average cost  and benefit of a drug court participant was compared to the average cost  and benefit of normal court processing. In contrast, the MADCE obtained  a separate net benefit figure for each individual. The net benefit was  obtained by tracking each individual\u2019s use of resources, such as hearings  or meetings with case managers, and program outcomes like use of  public assistance. The MADCE also tracked each individual\u2019s rates of re- arrest, number of crimes, and time of incarceration. The crimes are  multiplied by cost to victims per crime to obtain the cost to society. The  difference between the net benefits of the drug court participants and the  comparison group were obtained using a hierarchical model similar to the  one used for program outcomes. After applying the method, the MADCE  found that the drug court participants led to a net benefit of $6,208 to  society per participant, as compared to the comparison group. However,  due to the variability in the estimate, the study did not find that the net  benefits were statistically significant.", "The lack of a statistically significant difference may be because of greater  variability in the MADCE approach than the approach used in other  studies. Specifically, the MADCE did not assume identical costs for each  participant. As a result, costs may be higher for individuals who have  lower rates of re-arrest, perhaps because those individuals received more  treatment. According to the study\u2019s authors, by assuming identical costs  for each participant, the standard approach understates the variance in  the computed net benefit figure by not including the variability in cost.  However, the MADCE authors assumed that the prices of services were  consistent across sites by using a weighted average. In contrast, some  studies generate site-specific cost figures. In this way, the MADCE  approach did exclude one source of variation that is present in some  other studies.", "In addition to tracking costs and benefits at the individual level, the  MADCE also included some effects of drug court participation that some  other studies omit. This is consistent with OMB guidance that states that  studies should be comprehensive in the benefits and costs to society  considered. One of the benefits considered by the MADCE, sometimes  omitted elsewhere, is the estimated earnings of the drug court participant.  However, it is unclear that the full value of earnings should have been  considered a net benefit to society. For example, to be comprehensive, a  study should also consider the cost to society of providing that benefit.  The net benefit would account for the value of production from this  employment less the wages paid.
