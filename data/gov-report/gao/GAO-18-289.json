The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure that a full audit is performed on the financial statements of DOD for each fiscal year and that the results be submitted to Congress no later than March 31 of the following fiscal year. The Navy was the first military department to assert real property audit readiness related to DOD's Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness effort.", "For this report, GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which the Navy had internal control deficiencies, if any, that may impair its ability to assert that its buildings, as reported in its financial statements, exist and that the information about these buildings is complete and adequately supported by property records and (2) identify the challenges, if any, that Navy faces in valuing its buildings in accordance with federal accounting standards. GAO reviewed the Navy's policies and procedures for control activities over its buildings, performed data analyses, and tested a nongeneralizable sample of buildings. GAO also discussed with Navy officials the challenges in complying with federal accounting standards for valuing its buildings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the United States Navy (Navy) has taken actions to become audit ready for its real property, GAO identified internal control deficiencies that impaired the Navy's ability to assert that (1) buildings recorded in the internet Navy Facility Assets Data Store (iNFADS), the Navy's real property system, and reported as assets in its financial statements existed and (2) all of the Navy's buildings were recorded in iNFADS and correctly reported as assets in the Navy's financial statements. As shown in the figure below, the effects of these internal control deficiencies contributed to the Navy (1) continuing to maintain records in iNFADS for buildings that had been demolished, sometimes many years ago, and include these buildings as assets in its financial statements; (2) excluding some of the buildings it owns from being recorded in iNFADS and reported as assets in its financial statements; (3) erroneously reporting nonfunctional buildings as assets in its financial statements; and (4) excluding certain buildings from being reported as assets in its financial statements that met or exceeded the Department of Defense's (DOD) capitalization threshold.", "The Navy has various efforts under way to address challenges in valuing its buildings for financial reporting in accordance with federal accounting standards. Navy officials have acknowledged that significant delays can sometimes occur in the Navy being able to complete supporting documentation of the final costs to properly report buildings in its financial statements. Additionally, implementation of the Navy's new methodology to properly account for capital improvements will be critical for capturing accurate costs for buildings. Furthermore, the Navy has not consistently completed a physical inventory (asset evaluation) for each building every 5 years as required by DOD policy. These asset evaluations are an important control to help ensure that the information recorded for buildings in iNFADS is accurate. Finally, the Navy also faces a challenge in determining the placed in service dates for those buildings found through inventory procedures. The Navy's use of the date the building was found rather than the estimated date the building was placed in service can substantially affect the accuracy of the information in the Navy's systems and financial statements. Navy officials are aware of these challenges and have various efforts under way to address them. Effective implementation of these efforts is crucial to help address these challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations to the Navy to improve internal controls for its buildings by implementing needed written procedures and control activities.

These deficiencies prevent DOD from having  auditable financial statements, which is one of the three major  impediments preventing us from expressing an opinion on the accrual- based consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government.", "The effects of DOD\u2019s financial management problems extend beyond  financial reporting and negatively affect DOD\u2019s ability to manage the  department and make sound decisions on mission and operations. For  example, we found that DOD cannot fully determine the number, size,  and costs of its leases for its leased facilities because the inventory  system that DOD uses to report on its leased assets contains some  inaccurate and incomplete data.", "DOD\u2019s reported property, plant, and equipment represent more than 70  percent of the U.S. government\u2019s reported property, plant, and  equipment.

With a DOD-estimated  replacement value of about $880 billion, this infrastructure is critical to  maintaining military readiness, and the estimated cost to build and  maintain it represents a significant financial commitment. However, DOD  remains one of the few federal entities that cannot demonstrate its ability  to accurately account for and reliably report its costs or assets.", "DOD has undertaken several financial management improvement  initiatives over the years to address deficiencies in business systems,  processes, and controls through its Financial Improvement and Audit  Readiness (FIAR) Plan. In addition to the FIAR Plan, the 2010 National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) required, until December 2017, that  DOD provide semiannual reports to the congressional defense  committees on the status of the implementation of the FIAR Plan. The  2018 NDAA repealed the requirement for the FIAR Plan and semiannual  status reports and codified a requirement for DOD to submit a Financial  Improvement and Audit Remediation Plan to Congress by June 30, 2019,  and annually thereafter. DOD is further required to prepare a  consolidated corrective action plan management summary on the status  of key corrective action plans and to brief the congressional defense  committees semiannually on the status of the corrective action plans.", "The results of prior audits, including ours, have raised concerns about the  data reliability of certain key categories of the military services\u2019 general  property, plant, and equipment. In addition, the Department of the Navy\u2019s  (DON) inability to accurately account for real property assets, specifically  its buildings, continues to be a primary impediment to it receiving an  auditor\u2019s opinion on its financial statements. One of the previously  identified material weaknesses reported by the independent auditors for  fiscal year 2017 related to real property. Specifically, the independent  auditors reported that the DON had insufficient internal controls and  supporting documentation for real property and construction-in-progress.  The DON consists of two services\u2014the United States Navy (Navy) and  the United States Marine Corps. The DON was the first military  department to initially assert real property audit readiness for existence  and completeness. According to the Navy\u2019s accountable real property  system, the internet Navy Facility Assets Data Store (iNFADS), the Navy  owned 35,308 and 35,600 buildings as of September 30, 2017, and  September 30, 2016, respectively.", "This engagement was initiated in connection with the statutory  requirement for GAO to audit the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements.

We reviewed the  results from prior testing conducted by a contractor that the Navy  engaged to help it achieve audit readiness for its real property. We also  performed data analyses of building data elements contained in iNFADS  as of September 30, 2016. To assess the reliability of data we used, we  reviewed relevant Navy documentation, interviewed knowledgeable  officials, reviewed policies and procedures regarding collecting and  maintaining the data, and performed data analyses to look for logical  inconsistencies. We concluded that the data elements we used from  iNFADS were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of selecting a  nongeneralizable sample of buildings to test during our site visits. We  selected the Norfolk and San Diego geographic areas for site visits  because of the numerous bases in each area and the proximity of the 5  installations to one another in both areas. Finally, we conducted site visits  in Norfolk and San Diego to understand the processes followed and  documents used to record real property transactions, test the buildings  selected in our nongeneralizable samples, and review the available  supporting documentation for the selected buildings.", "For the site visits, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of a total of 40  buildings from the iNFADS real property system, 20 from 5 Norfolk-area  installations and 20 from 5 San Diego-area Navy installations that we  visited, to test through observation whether these buildings existed (book- to-floor). We met with the real property accountable officers (RPAO) at  the 10 installations we visited. In addition to testing for existence, we  compared the descriptions of the buildings in iNFADS with the buildings  that we observed. For example, if the date the building was placed in  service was recent, we would observe whether it was a newer building.  We also selected a nongeneralizable sample of an additional 39 buildings  while at the installations to perform floor-to-book tests to test the  completeness of Navy\u2019s recorded buildings in iNFADS.", "To identify the challenges the Navy faces in valuing its buildings in  accordance with federal accounting standards, we reviewed federal  accounting standards and the Navy\u2019s documents for recording assets into  iNFADS and interviewed agency officials responsible for financial  reporting and real property management, including the RPAOs at the  installations we visited.

The Navy has developed and is testing its  methodology to properly account for capital improvements to buildings.  This methodology uses an automated link from the Facilities Information  System (which has the construction-in-progress account) to iNFADS. The  success of this methodology will be critical for capturing capital  improvements for buildings.", "The inability to account for the total costs associated with capital  improvements to buildings after the opening balances have been  established using alternative valuation methods would result in the  undervaluing of the total actual cost and annual depreciation expense  associated with the buildings.
