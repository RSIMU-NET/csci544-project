For the 91 percent of projects that are expected to have minimal environmental impacts, state departments of transportation need only to identify environmental features, assess possible impacts, address any resource agency and public concerns, and obtain permits, if needed. For the 6 percent of projects where it is initially unclear whether significant environmental impacts may exist, additional activities occur, including evaluating alternatives to the proposed project and obtaining FHWA approval. For the 3 percent of highway projects with expected significant environmental impacts, states conduct extensive environmental review, including evaluating all reasonable alternatives and their environmental impacts and consult with resource agencies. Stakeholders we contacted identified 43 aspects that they said frequently (more than half the time) add more time than viewed as necessary to environmental reviews of federally funded highway projects. A majority of stakeholders with primary responsibilities for environmental and historical preservation issues and those with primary responsibilities for transportation improvement identified five aspects as occurring frequently. However, there was no overall agreement about which aspects frequently add undue time to environmental reviews. A majority of environmental stakeholders told us that state departments of transportation waited too long to consider environmental impacts and involve important stakeholders. In contrast, a majority of transportation improvement stakeholders told us that state departments of transportation and federal resource agencies lack sufficient staff to handle their workloads and that meeting statutory criteria for historic preservation projects on public lands and obtaining wetlands permits are too time consuming.

Given the  importance of transportation to the nation\u2019s economy, mobility, and  security and the need to improve the nation\u2019s roads to meet these needs,  many transportation improvement stakeholders\u2014such as the Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA), state departments of transportation, and  others\u2014have said that completing a federally funded highway project takes  too long, and that the most time consuming aspect involves environmental  review. Transportation improvement stakeholders acknowledge that  environmental reviews result in better project decisions, but say that  reaching decisions is difficult and time consuming. The Transportation  Equity Act for the 21st Century, enacted in 1998, contained provisions  designed to streamline environmental reviews. As the reauthorization of  this act approaches, the Congress may again consider measures for  reducing the time it takes to complete a federally funded highway project  so that transportation benefits are realized sooner.", "You requested that we (1) describe the activities involved in the  environmental review of federally funded highway projects and (2) report  on stakeholders\u2019 views on which aspects of these environmental reviews, if  any, unduly add time to gaining environmental approval. To carry out this  work, we reviewed laws and documents related to environmental review.  We asked officials from FHWA and the departments of transportation from  Maryland and North Carolina to identify the activities involved in  environmental review and to identify federal, state, and local agencies that  routinely participate in reviews of federally funded highway projects. To  obtain stakeholders\u2019 views on aspects that add undue time\u2014more time  than they view as necessary\u2014to environmental reviews, we asked officials  from federal and state agencies with responsibilities relating to the  construction of federally funded roads, transportation professional  organizations, historic preservation organizations, and environmental  organizations to identify laws, behaviors, resource issues, or project  management approaches, if any, that unduly add time to environmental  review. We asked these officials to identify other stakeholders with  expertise in such reviews and asked those individuals to identify aspects  that they felt add undue time. Overall, 39 stakeholders identified 43 aspects  they have encountered during environmental reviews that they felt add  undue time to these reviews. We then asked these stakeholders to rate each  aspect on how frequently, if at all, they occur. Twenty-eight officials  representing different interests provided these ratings (of these 28, 16  stakeholders had primary transportation improvement responsibilities or  interests, and 12 stakeholders had primary environmental responsibilities  or interests). The approach we used makes two contributions. First, it  captures the views of a wide range of stakeholders that are identified by  their peers as knowledgeable. Second, it provides a systematic assessment  of the perceived frequency of the aspects that knowledgeable stakeholders  indicated add undue time to environmental reviews. We did not attempt to  corroborate whether or not particular aspects actually occur or the reasons  why stakeholders rated individual aspects as occurring more or less  frequently.

At the federal level,  FHWA is the primary agency providing funding, training, approving state  transportation plans, and certifying that states have met requirements  related to environmental protection and historical preservation.", "Many of the organizations with a role in highway project completion have  concluded that completing major highway construction projects takes too  long\u2014in some cases about 20 years. The construction of highway projects  using federal funds can be complicated and time consuming because state  departments of transportation must adhere to a number of federal laws  pertaining to transportation, the environment, and historic preservation  and involve multiple stakeholders representing all levels of government  and the public; and for some controversial projects, this could involve  litigation.", "As a condition of receiving federal funds for highway projects, state  departments of transportation must comply with the National  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires that federal  agencies consider the potential impacts on environmental resources when  considering approval of a proposed action. FHWA is responsible for  ensuring that state departments of transportation identify, assess, and, if  necessary, mitigate impacts to the natural and human (e.g., health)  environment and historic properties that may result from the construction  of a highway project. In this regard, state departments of transportation  involve federal agencies with environmental responsibilities (called  resource agencies), such as the Army Corps of Engineers, Fish and Wildlife  Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and Advisory Council on  Historic Preservation, in addition to FHWA and state resource agencies  when assessing the potential impacts of a highway project in order to  comply with NEPA and other federal and state environmental  requirements. Along with NEPA, state departments of transportation must  comply with other federal statutes that may apply to a highway project,  including:   The Clean Water Act of 1977. The Clean Water Act of 1977 was  designed to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological  integrity of the nation\u2019s waters through the prevention and elimination  of pollution. Any project, including the construction of a highway  project, that involves the discharge of pollutants into waters of the  United States must comply with the Clean Water Act.

FHWA  officials reported that it takes even less time, sometimes as little as several  days, to complete categorical exclusions for projects that FHWA has  preapproved for limited environmental review (for example, landscaping  or installation of road signs). In a survey conducted for the American  Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in 2000, state  transportation officials estimated that it took an average of 8 months to  complete the activities involved in environmental review of categorical  exclusion projects that they had classified as not delayed. However, these  state transportation officials also reported that, for projects they selected  for the survey, it took an average of 22 months to complete activities  involved in environmental review for categorical exclusion projects that  they had identified as delayed. There is no standard method for measuring  length of time for environmental review.", "Some of the projects that qualify for a categorical exclusion are considered  by FHWA to be routine\u2014with little or no environmental impact such as bus  and rail car rehabilitation, construction of bike paths, landscaping,  installation of traffic signals, ride-sharing activities, or improvements to  existing rest areas\u2014and have been preapproved by FHWA for limited  environmental review. For preapproved projects, state department of  transportation need only to sufficiently establish that there are no  significant impacts. State departments of transportation do not need to  identify mitigation measures, address public and agency concerns, or gain  FHWA\u2019s approval of the state\u2019s assessment of environmental impacts. Other  projects\u2014such as bridge rehabilitation, construction of bus or rail storage  or maintenance facilities, or adding shoulders\u2014have somewhat greater  potential for environmental impact but may also qualify for a categorical  exclusion. However, because of the greater potential to cause significant  environmental impacts or generate substantial controversy, they are not  preapproved by FHWA. Instead, for these types of projects, FHWA advises  state departments of transportation to conduct environmental review  activities commensurate with the level of impact, including (1) identifying  environmental features that will be affected by the project (if any); (2)  assessing the environmental impacts caused by the project to the extent  that it is clearly established that impacts are minor; (3) addressing public,  federal, and state resource agency concerns where adverse impacts are  likely to occur; (4) gaining FHWA\u2019s approval for classification as a  categorical exclusion; and (5) obtaining permits, if needed, to clearly  establish that there is little potential for significant impacts and that the  project\u2019s classification as a categorical exclusion is appropriate.

According to FHWA, projects that qualify for environmental assessments  do not typically add new miles of road to the road system. FHWA estimates  that approximately 6 percent of approximately 31,000 federally funded  roadway projects (representing about 15 percent of the $17.6 billion in  federal funding distributed to states for highway projects in fiscal year  2001) required an environmental assessment in 2001.

For an environmental assessment, the  state department of transportation must (1) identify environmental  features that will be affected by the proposed project; (2) evaluate one or  more alternatives (but need not evaluate all reasonable alternatives); (3)  assess impacts to the environment caused by the project or any of its  alternatives and determine measures to mitigate unavoidable  environmental impacts; and (4) invite comments and obtain feedback from  the public and interested federal, state, and local agencies.

Federally funded highway projects that are likely to require an  environmental impact statement include the construction of a new segment  of controlled access freeway or fixed rail, or projects which make it likely  that there will be significant environmental effects.

(See app. II for a flow chart depicting these  activities.) These two state departments of transportation typically carry  out environmental review activities in four phases: (1) developing an  understanding of the extent to which the project is expected to affect the  environment, (2) identifying alternatives and assessing environmental  impacts, (3) gaining approval on draft environmental impact statement and  selecting the preferred alternative, and (4) gaining final approval for  environmental analysis. Resource agencies, the public, and other  stakeholders provide input at each of these phases. However, these states  may carry out some environmental activities even before the first phase,  such as considering whether environmental impacts are likely when they  develop their state transportation improvement plan. Further, attention to  environmental impacts may occur even after FHWA and permit agencies  approve the project if the environmental analysis is challenged in court.", "Developing an understanding of expected environmental impacts. In  this phase, the Maryland and North Carolina departments of transportation  develop the scope and purpose of and need for the proposed transportation  project. To determine the potential for environmental impacts, the state  department of transportation incorporates existing environmental  information and feedback from stakeholders about the project that may  have been obtained through the development of the state\u2019s transportation  improvement plan. In addition, Maryland and North Carolina departments  of transportation identify preliminary information on environmental  features and resources including wetlands, floodplains, historic sites,  parklands, and endangered species, as well as the area to be affected by the  proposed project. FHWA notifies the public through the Federal Register  that detailed environmental review is needed for the proposed highway  project (called a notice of intent). In addition, Maryland and North Carolina  departments of transportation invite local officials, federal, state, and local  agencies with environmental responsibilities, and the public at large to  discuss the purpose and need, the proposed scope, environmental features  identified, and substantial issues related to the project. In addition to  environmental review activities required by NEPA, permits or consultation  required by other environmental laws may be needed (e.g., coastal  resources). For projects in Maryland or North Carolina that require a  permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the state department of  transportation will also normally obtain concurrence on the purpose of and  need for the proposed project from the Army Corps of Engineers, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and  FHWA. Other states may not obtain concurrence. In addition, Maryland and  North Carolina state departments of transportation may also obtain  concurrence from the National Park Service, the Coast Guard, the Forest  Service, and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service, if the project is in the  vicinity of a geographic area for which an agency has jurisdiction.", "Identifying alternatives and assessing environmental impacts. This  phase typically begins with Maryland and North Carolina state departments  of transportation identifying alternatives to the proposed project.  Following guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality, FHWA  requires that the state department of transportation consider a reasonable  range of alternatives that accomplish its objectives, including an alternative  of not building the project. For each alternative, state departments of  transportation must identify the environment that will be affected.  Maryland and North Carolina departments of transportation then obtain  feedback on the alternatives they have developed from the public and from  federal, state, and local agencies that have environmental responsibilities.  Maryland and North Carolina state departments of transportation evaluate  comments from the public and agencies and select a subset of alternatives  for more detailed study. For alternatives selected for detailed study,  Maryland and North Carolina state departments of transportation conduct  detailed engineering and environmental analyses of the impacts to natural,  socioeconomic, and cultural resources, including historic resources and  endangered species, and begin identifying measures to avoid, minimize, or  mitigate impacts. The last activity in identifying alternatives and assessing  environmental impacts is to invite the public, local officials, and federal,  state, and local agencies with environmental responsibilities to discuss the  rationale and issues related to the subset of alternatives selected. For  projects in Maryland or North Carolina that require a permit under section  404 of the Clean Water Act, the state department of transportation will also  normally obtain concurrence on the criteria for alternative selection and  the alternatives to be evaluated from the Army Corps of Engineers, the  Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, and FHWA.  Other states may not obtain concurrence. In addition, Maryland and North  Carolina state departments of transportation may also obtain concurrence  from the National Park Service, the Coast Guard, the Forest Service, and/or  the National Marine Fisheries Service, if the project is in the vicinity of a  geographic area for which an agency has jurisdiction.", "Gaining approval on draft environmental impact statement and  selecting the preferred alternative. In this phase, Maryland and North  Carolina state departments of transportation attempt to gain approval from  FHWA on  preliminary efforts to meet environmental requirements and  concurrence from resource agencies on selecting the preferred alternative.  If FHWA is satisfied that the state department of transportation has  adequately identified all reasonable alternatives to the proposed action and  discusses the reasons why other alternatives were eliminated from detailed  study, then FHWA will provide approval of the state\u2019s preliminary efforts in  meeting environmental requirements. After receiving FHWA\u2019s approval,  state departments of transportation will obtain and analyze comments from  the public and from resource agencies to help the state department of  transportation in selecting the preferred alternative. After Maryland and  North Carolina state departments of transportation select the preferred  alternative, they develop additional avoidance and mitigation efforts, if  needed. Finally, Maryland and North Carolina state departments of  transportation will obtain feedback from the public and agencies on its  selection of the preferred alternative and address any concerns in the final  environmental impact statement. For projects in Maryland or North  Carolina that require a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the  state department of transportation will also normally obtain concurrence  on the preferred alternative from the Army Corps of Engineers, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and  FHWA.

Seventy percent of the  environmental stakeholders (7 of 10) who provided a rating for this  aspect, told us that undue time is frequently added to environmental  reviews because state departments of transportation generally do not  consider environmental and historic preservation impacts early enough  in the environmental review. An official with the Council on  Environmental Quality, which oversees federal agency implementation  of the environmental impact assessments, stated that when  environmental activities related to NEPA are not considered during the  planning phase of a highway project, agreements made during the  planning phase must be revisited once a NEPA review starts, thus  unduly adding time to environmental reviews.

The state department of  transportation had spent time and money developing projects prior to  allowing the state historical preservation office to review project plans.  When the state historical preservation office had a concern with a  project, the state department had to change or redesign its plans causing  cost increases and time delays. In contrast, 19 percent of the  transportation improvement stakeholders (3 of 16) cited this aspect as  frequently adding undue time to reviews.", "Of the 43 aspects identified overall, a majority of transportation  improvement stakeholders identified 3 aspects as frequently adding undue  time to environmental reviews.

Sixty-nine percent of transportation improvement stakeholders  (11 of 16) who provided a rating for this aspect told us that undue time is  frequently added to environmental reviews because state departments  of transportation and federal resource agencies lack sufficient staff to  handle their responsibilities in a timely manner. This aspect was cited as  occurring frequently by a majority of the transportation improvement  stakeholders and by half of the environmental stakeholders (5 of the 10)  who provided ratings for this aspect. According to FHWA, state  departments of transportation are using different methods to attempt to  provide sufficient staff to carry out environmental reviews, such as  hiring consultants to complete environmental analyses when their own  staff resources are limited. In addition, according to FHWA, 34 states are  funding additional staff at state and federal environmental agencies to  facilitate environmental reviews and approval. In a recent report,  stakeholders identified this latter approach as a promising approach  that states are using to reduce the overall time it takes to complete  federally funded highway projects.", "Section 4(f) historic preservation requirement considered  burdensome. Fifty-six percent of the transportation improvement  stakeholders (9 of 16) told us that section 4(f) adds undue time to  environmental reviews because it is inflexible and, therefore,  burdensome to comply with. Section 4(f) prohibits the Department of  Transportation from approving any highway project that uses, among  other things, publicly owned land of an historic site of national, state, or  local significance unless it finds that (1) there is no prudent and feasible  alternative that avoids such resources or causes less harm to them and  (2) the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to those  resources. In April 2003, we reported that many stakeholders consider  these reviews as burdensome and inflexible and that alternative  approaches could protect historic properties and take less time to reach  resolution.  In that report, a large majority of the stakeholders we  contacted indicated that historic property protections under section 106  of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (which requires that  projects subject to federal agency jurisdiction or licensing consider the  effects on any properties included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the  National Register of Historic Places) offered a flexible mediation  process that brings all parties into discussion and allowed for more  productive outcomes that preserve the goals of the transportation  project, while creating meaningful protections of historic properties. In  contrast, 30 percent of the environmental stakeholders (3 of 10) who  provided a rating for this aspect cited it as occurring frequently,  resulting in undue time being added to environmental reviews.", "Obtaining wetlands permits considered time consuming. Fifty-six  percent of the transportation improvement stakeholders (9 of 16) told  us that section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which requires that projects  receive a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers if water impacts  exist, frequently adds undue time to environmental reviews. These  stakeholders described a variety of issues, including that section 404  adds undue time because the Corps requires extensive alternative  analysis, even for minor projects, to demonstrate that there is no  practicable alternative to building on wetlands. None of the  environmental stakeholders rated this aspect as occurring frequently in  adding undue time to environmental reviews.", "In our April report on stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of the most promising  approaches for reducing highway project completion time (covering all  aspects of a highway project from planning through construction),  stakeholders identified 13 most promising approaches. Nine of these  approaches involved environmental review, such as funding specialized  staff at resource agencies and unifying section 404 and NEPA reviews. Four  of the five aspects that stakeholders told us add undue time to  environmental reviews relate specifically to promising approaches cited in  the April report. These are approaches for increasing resource agency staff,  providing early consideration of environmental impacts by state  departments of transportation, inclusion of important stakeholders early in  environmental review, and handling the exacting requirements of section  4(f). In our April report, we recommended that FHWA consider the benefits  of the 13 most promising approaches and act to foster the adoption of the  most cost effective and feasible approaches. FHWA generally agreed with  this recommendation and stated that most, if not all, of the promising  approaches coincide with the streamlining activities that the department  and its partners, such as state departments of transportation and resource  agencies, have been developing and implementing under section 1309 of  the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. We believe that acting on  that recommendation will address some of the concerns identified by the  environmental and transportation improvement stakeholders in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Departments of Transportation and Interior with a draft of  this report for their review and comment.

We discussed  the activities involved, the time it takes to complete environmental reviews,  and aspects that may increase the time it takes to complete such reviews  with officials from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), state  departments of transportation, federal resource agencies, transportation  advocacy organizations, environmental advocacy organizations, and  historic preservation agencies. We also reviewed federal, state, and private  studies on environmental reviews of transportation projects.", "To determine the activities required to complete environmental reviews of  federally funded highway projects and the stakeholders involved in the  reviews, we obtained information from FHWA, the Maryland Department of  Transportation, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation. We  chose these states because officials we interviewed identified these states  as those that have studied their environmental review procedures and  taken steps to improve the timeliness of environmental reviews. While the  general requirements for an environmental impact statement (identify  environmental features, evaluate alternatives, assess impacts, involve the  public, etc.) are the same for all states, each state may implement the  requirements differently.", "To determine stakeholders\u2019 views on the aspects that frequently add undue  time to environmental reviews of federally funded highway projects, we  contacted 51 organizations with a role or interest in highway project  environmental reviews. (See table 4.)  Of these 51 organizations, officials  from 39 agreed to participate in interviews, including federal and state  agencies with responsibilities relating to the construction of federally  funded roads, federal agencies with responsibilities relating to the  protection of the environment, transportation engineering organizations,  transportation professional associations, environmental organizations, and  historic preservation organizations. To identify the 51 organizations, we  initially contacted agencies and organizations that have a role or interest in  highway project environmental reviews or that have been vocal on the  issue. We asked these officials to identify, for subsequent interviews, other  agencies or organizations undertaking or knowledgeable about  environmental reviews. We continued to ask for names from the  subsequent organizations until we began getting duplicate referrals.", "Using a semi-structured interview, we asked knowledgeable stakeholders  at each of the 39 organizations to provide information about the aspects of  laws, stakeholders\u2019 behaviors, resource availability, or project management  approaches, if any, that unduly add time to environmental reviews. We used  these categories because they are related to components of the  environmental review process. For each aspect cited, we asked  stakeholders to provide information on (1) how the aspect leads to an  undue increase in review time; (2) the positive and negative outcomes, if  any; (3) at what stage in the review the aspect occurred; (4) an example and  the amount of time it added to the review; and (5) the type of  environmental review (e.g., categorical exclusion, environmental  assessment, or environmental impact statement) where the aspect  occurred.  We did not define the term undue time but relied on the  stakeholders\u2019 professional judgment to determine which aspects added  time that would not be added ordinarily. Most stakeholders did not provide  estimates of the amount of time the aspect added to the review.", "To determine how frequently the aspects occur, we compiled a list of 43  aspects identified by stakeholders as adding unnecessary time to  environmental reviews and asked each of the 39 stakeholders we  interviewed to rate how frequently each aspect adds undue time to  environmental reviews for highway projects involving categorical  exclusions, environmental assessments, and environmental impact  statements using a scale of 1 to 5.  Twenty-eight stakeholders agreed to  participate in this segment of our work. The 11 stakeholders who did not  participate in this segment chose not to do so for a variety of reasons. At  least 25 stakeholders (89 percent) rated each of the 43 aspects. We  identified the most significant aspects as those where a majority of the  stakeholders responding to the question indicated it occurred frequently  (more than half to all or almost all the time).", "Stakeholders made a significant distinction by type review in less than 8  percent of all responses.
