Since 2003, GAO has identified information sharing as key to developing effective partnerships. In July 2010, GAO reported some barriers affecting the extent to which cyber-related security information was being shared between federal and industry partners. For example, industry partners reported concerns that sharing sensitive, proprietary information with the federal government could compromise their competitive advantage if shared more widely. Similarly, federal partners were restricted in sharing classified information with industry officials without security clearances. GAO recommended that DHS work with industry to focus its information-sharing efforts. DHS concurred and has taken some steps to address the recommendation, including sponsoring clearances for industry.", "Sharing Results of DHS Assessments with Industry. GAO has found that DHS security assessments can provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of critical assets and drive industry decisions about investments to enhance security. In a May 2012 report, GAO found that DHS was sharing the results of its assessments with industry partners, but these results were often late, which could undermine the relationship DHS was attempting to develop with these partners. GAO recommended that DHS develop time frames and milestones to ensure the timely delivery of the assessments to industry partners. DHS concurred and reported that it has efforts underway to speed the delivery of its assessments.", "Measuring and Evaluating Performance of DHS Partnerships . GAO's prior work found that taking a systematic approach to gathering feedback from industry owners and operators and measuring the results of these efforts could help focus greater attention on targeting potential problems and areas needing improvement. In an April 2013 report, GAO examined DHS's chemical security program and assessed, among other things, the extent to which DHS has communicated and worked with industry owners and operators to improve security. GAO reported that DHS had increased its efforts to communicate and work with industry to help them enhance security at their facilities. However, GAO found that DHS was not obtaining systematic feedback on its outreach. GAO recommended that DHS explore opportunities and take action to systematically solicit and document feedback on industry outreach. DHS concurred and reported that it had taken action to address the recommendation.", "However, the cyber security of infrastructure remains on GAO's high-risk list and more needs to be done to accelerate the progress made.

In a July 2010 report examining, among other things,  government stakeholders\u2019 expectations for cyber-related, public- private partnerships we identified some barriers to industry\u2019s sharing  of cyber threat information with federal partners.of the government entities we contacted reported that industry  partners were mostly meeting their expectations in several areas,  including sharing timely and actionable cyber threat information,  though the extent to which this was happening varied by sector.  However, we found that federal officials also reported that  improvements could be made. For example, while timely and  actionable cyber threat and alert information was being received from  industry partners, federal officials noted there were limits to the depth  and specificity of the information provided by industry partners.  Among other issues, we found that industry partners did not want to  share their sensitive, proprietary information with the federal  government. For example, information security companies had  concerns that they could lose a competitive advantage by sharing  information with the government if, in turn, this information was shared  with those companies\u2019 competitors. In addition, despite special  protections and sanitization processes, we found that industry  partners were unwilling to agree to all of the terms that the federal  government or a government agency requires to share certain  information. On the basis of our findings, we recommended, among  other things, that DHS, in collaboration with industry partners, use the  results of our July 2010 report to continue to focus its information- sharing efforts on the most desired services. DHS concurred with this  recommendation and described steps underway to address it,  including the initiation of several pilot programs intended to enable the  mutual sharing of cybersecurity information at various classification  levels.", "Identifying barriers to the government\u2019s sharing information with  industry partners. Federal efforts to meet the information-sharing  expectations of industry partners are equally important in managing  effective public-private partnerships to successfully protect cyber- reliant critical assets from a multitude of threats. In July 2010, we also  examined industry partners\u2019 expectations for cyber-related, public- private partnerships and identified some barriers to the federal  government\u2019s sharing of cyber threat information with its industry  partners. We reported that federal partners were not consistently  meeting industry\u2019s information sharing expectations, including  providing timely and actionable cyber threat information and alerts,  according to industry partners we contacted at the time. We found that  this was, in part, due to restrictions on the type of information that can  be shared with industry partners. We reported that according to  federal officials, DHS\u2019s ability to provide information is affected by  restrictions that do not allow individualized treatment of one industry  partner over another industry partner\u2014making it difficult to formally  share specific information with entities that are being directly affected  by a cyber threat. In addition, we reported in July 2010 that because  DHS has responsibility for serving as the nation\u2019s cyber analysis and  warning center, it must ensure that its warnings are accurate.", "DHS vulnerability assessments are conducted during site visits at individual assets and  are used to identify security gaps and provide options for consideration to mitigate these  identified gaps. DHS security surveys are intended to gather information on an asset\u2019s  current security posture and overall security awareness. Security surveys and vulnerability  assessments are generally asset-specific and are conducted at the request of asset  owners and operators. assets crucial to national security, public health and safety, and the  economy. We recommended, and DHS concurred, that it design and  implement a mechanism for systematically assessing why owners and  operators of high-priority assets decline to participate, and develop a  road map, with time frames and milestones, for completing this effort.  DHS stated that it had implemented a tracking system in October  2013 to capture data on the reason for declinations by owners and  operators.", "Although DHS reports that it has taken or begun to take action on the  open recommendations discussed above, we have not verified DHS\u2019s  progress implementing all of our recommendations.

DHS  security surveys and vulnerability assessments can provide valuable  insights into the strengths and weaknesses of assets and can help  asset owners and operators that participate in these programs make  decisions about investments to enhance security and resilience. In our  May 2012 report, we found that, among other things, DHS shares the  results of security surveys and vulnerability assessments with asset  owners or operators.security survey and vulnerability assessment results could be  enhanced by the timely delivery of these products to the owners and  operators and that the inability to deliver these products in a timely  manner could undermine the relationship DHS was attempting to  develop with these industry partners. Specifically, we reported that,  based on DHS data from fiscal year 2011, DHS was late meeting its  (1) 30-day time frame\u2014as required by DHS guidance\u2014for delivering  the results of its security surveys 60 percent of the time and (2) 60- day time frame\u2014expected by DHS managers for delivering the results  of its vulnerability assessments\u2014in 84 percent of the instances.

DHS stated  that, among other things, it deployed a web-based information-sharing  system for facility-level information in February 2013, which,  according to DHS, has since resulted in a significant drop in overdue  deliveries.", "Sharing information with critical infrastructure partners at the  sector level. Critical infrastructures rely on networked computers and  systems, thus making them susceptible to cyber-based risks.  Managing such risk involves the use of cybersecurity guidance that  promotes or requires actions to enhance the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability of computer systems. In December 2011, we reported  on cybersecurity guidance and its implementation and we found,  among other things, that DHS and the other sector-specific agencies  have disseminated and promoted cybersecurity guidance among and  within sectors. However, we also found that DHS and the other  sector-specific agencies had not identified the key cybersecurity  guidance applicable to or widely used in each of their critical  infrastructure sectors. In addition, we reported that most of the sector- specific critical infrastructure protection plans for the sectors we  reviewed did not identify key guidance and standards for  cybersecurity because doing so was not specifically suggested by  DHS guidance. Therefore, we concluded that given the plethora of  guidance available, individual entities within the sectors could be  challenged in identifying the guidance that is most applicable and  effective in improving their security and that improved knowledge of  the available guidance could help both federal and industry partners  better coordinate their efforts to protect critical cyber-reliant assets.  We recommended that DHS, in collaboration with government and  industry partners, determine whether it is appropriate to have  cybersecurity guidance listed in sector plans. DHS concurred with our  recommendation and stated that it will work with its partners to  determine whether it is appropriate to have cybersecurity guidance  drafted for each sector and, in addition, would explore these issues  with the cross-sector community.", "Sharing certain information with critical infrastructure partners at  the regional level. Our work has shown that over the past several  years, DHS has recognized the importance of and taken actions to  examine critical infrastructure asset vulnerabilities, threats, and  potential consequences across regions. In a July 2013 report, we  examined DHS\u2019s management of its Regional Resiliency Assessment  Program (RRAP)\u2014a voluntary program intended to assess regional  resilience of critical infrastructure by analyzing a region\u2019s ability to  adapt to changing conditions, and prepare for, withstand, and rapidly  recover from disruptions\u2014and found that DHS has been working with  states to improve the process for conducting RRAP projects, including  more clearly defining the scope of these projects. We also reported  that DHS shares the project results of each RRAP project report with  the primary stakeholders\u2014officials representing the state where the  RRAP was conducted\u2014and that each report is generally available to  certain staff, such as sector-specific agencies and protective security  advisors within DHS. However, we found that DHS did not share  individual RRAP reports more widely with others in similar industry  lines, including other stakeholders and sector-specific agencies  outside of DHS. We also reported that DHS had been working to  conceptualize how it can develop a product or products using multiple  sources\u2014including RRAP reports\u2014to more widely share resilience  lessons learned to its critical infrastructure partners, including federal,  state, local, and tribal officials. DHS further reported using various  forums, such as regional conferences or during daily protective  security advisor contacts, to solicit input from critical infrastructure  partners to gauge their resilience information needs. Due to DHS\u2019s  ongoing efforts, we did not make a related recommendation in the  report. However, we noted that through continued outreach and  engagement with its critical infrastructure partners, DHS should be  better positioned to understand their needs for information about  resilience practices, which would in turn help clarify the scope of work  needed to develop and disseminate a meaningful resilience  information\u2013sharing product or products that are useful across sectors  and assets.", "Sharing information with sector-specific agencies and state and  local governments. Federal sector-specific agencies and state and  local governments are key partners that can provide specific expertise  and perspectives in federal efforts to identify and protect critical  infrastructure. In a March 2013 report, we reviewed DHS\u2019s  management of the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization  Program (NCIPP)\u2014which identifies and prioritizes a list of nationally  significant critical infrastructure each year\u2014to include how DHS  worked with states and sector-specific agencies to develop the list.  We reported that DHS had taken actions to improve its outreach to  sector-specific agencies and states in an effort to address challenges  associated with providing input on nominations and changes to the  NCIPP list. For example, in 2009, we reported that DHS revised its list  development process to be more transparent and provided states with  additional resources and tools for developing their NCIPP  nominations. Furthermore, DHS provided on-site assistance from  subject matter experts to assist states with identifying infrastructure,  disseminated a lessons-learned document providing examples of  successful nominations to help states improve justifications, and was  more proactive in engaging sector-specific agencies in ongoing dialog  on proposed criteria changes, among other efforts. However, we also  found that most state officials we contacted continued to experience  challenges with nominating assets to the NCIPP list using the  consequence-based criteria developed by DHS. We reported that  DHS officials told us that they recognized that some states are facing  challenges participating in the NCIPP program and have taken  additional steps to address the issue, including working to minimize  major changes to the consequence-based NCIPP criteria; enhancing  state participation; and working collaboratively with the State, Local,  Tribal and Territorial Government Coordinating Council to develop a  guide to assist states with their efforts to identify and prioritize their  critical infrastructure.", "Furthermore, in our January 2014 report reviewing the extent to which  federal agencies coordinated with state and local governments  regarding enhancing cybersecurity within public safety entities, we  determined that DHS shared cybersecurity-related information, such  as threats and hazards, with state and local governments through  various entities. For example, we found that DHS collected,  analyzed, and disseminated cyber threat and cybersecurity-related  information to state and local governments through its National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center and through its  relationship with the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center. In addition, we reported that DHS\u2019s State, Local, Tribal, and  Territorial Engagement Office\u2019s Security Clearance Initiative facilitated  the granting of security clearances to state chief information officers  and chief information security officers which allowed these personnel  to receive classified information about current and recent cyber  attacks and threats. For example, we reported that, according to DHS  officials, they have issued secret clearances to 48 percent of state  chief information officers and 84 percent of state chief information  security officers. Moreover, we reported that DHS provides  unclassified intelligence information to fusion centers, which then  share the information on possible terrorism and other threats and  issue alerts to state and local governments. For example, in March  2013, a fusion center issued a situational awareness bulletin specific  to public safety entities.", "Although DHS reports that it has taken or begun to take action on the  open recommendations discussed above, we have not verified DHS\u2019s  progress implementing all of our recommendations.

Taking  a systematic approach to gathering feedback from industry owners  and operators and measuring the results of these efforts could help  focus greater attention on targeting potential problems and areas  needing improvement. In April 2013, we examined DHS\u2019s Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program and assessed,  among other things, the extent to which DHS has communicated and  worked with owners and operators to improve security. Specifically,  we reported that DHS had increased its efforts to communicate and  work with industry owners and operators to help them enhance  security at their facilities since 2007. We found that as part of their  outreach program, DHS consulted with external stakeholders, such as  private industry and state and local government officials to discuss  issues that affect the program and facility owners and operators.  However, despite increasing its efforts to communicate with industry  owners and operators, we also found that DHS had an opportunity to  obtain systematic feedback on its outreach. We recommended that  DHS explore opportunities and take action to systematically solicit and  document feedback on facility outreach. DHS concurred with this  recommendation and has actions underway to explore such  opportunities to make CFATS-related outreach efforts more effective  for all stakeholders.", "Evaluating why facility-level improvements are made or not  made. According to the NIPP, the use of performance measures is a  critical step in the risk management process to enable DHS to  objectively and quantitatively assess improvement in critical  infrastructure protection and resiliency at the sector and national  levels. In our May 2012 report on DHS\u2019s efforts to conduct surveys  and assessments of high-priority infrastructure assets and share the  results, we found that, consistent with the NIPP, DHS has taken  action to follow up with participants to gather feedback from asset  owners and operators that participated in the program regarding the  effect these programs have had on asset security. However, we also  found that DHS could consider using this follow-up tool to capture key  information that could be used to understand why certain  improvements were or were not made by asset owners and operators  that have received surveys and assessments. For example, the  follow-up tool could ask asset representatives what factors\u2014such as  cost, vulnerability, or perception of threat\u2014influenced the decision to  implement changes, either immediately or over time, if they chose to  make improvements. We concluded that obtaining this information  would be valuable to understanding the obstacles asset owners or  operators face when making security investments. We recommended,  and DHS concurred, that it consider the feasibility of expanding the  follow-up program to gather and act upon data, as appropriate, on (1)  security enhancements that are ongoing and planned that are  attributable to DHS security surveys and vulnerability assessments  and (2) factors, such as cost and perceptions of threat, that influence  asset owner and operator decisions to make, or not make,  enhancements based on the results of DHS security surveys and  vulnerability assessments. DHS reported that it had modified the  follow-up program to capture data on whether ongoing and planned  security enhancements are attributable to security surveys and  vulnerability assessments. Furthermore, DHS stated that it had also  completed additional modifications to the follow-up tools to more  accurately capture all improvements to resilience as well as  information on factors influencing owner and operator decisions to  make or not make enhancements.", "Measuring the effectiveness of sector-level partnerships.", "Ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of communications networks  is essential to national security, the economy, and public health and  safety. In an April 2013 report, we found that while DHS has multiple  components focused on assessing risk and sharing threat information,  DHS and its sector partners do not consistently measure the outcome  of efforts to improve cybersecurity at the sector level. For example,  we found that DHS and its partners had not developed outcome- based performance measures related to the cyber protection of key  parts of the communications infrastructure sector. We concluded that  outcome-based metrics related to communications networks and  critical components supporting the Internet would provide federal  decision makers with additional insight into the effectiveness of  partner protection efforts at the sector level. We recommended that  DHS collaborate with its partners to develop outcome-oriented  measures for the communications sector. DHS concurred with our  recommendation and stated that it is working with industry to develop  plans for mitigating risks that will determine the path forward in  developing outcome-oriented performance measures for cyber  protection activities related to the nation\u2019s core and access  communications networks.", "Measuring the effectiveness of regional-level assessments.", "Similarly, in our July 2013 report examining DHS\u2019s management of its  RRAP program, we found that DHS had taken action to measure  efforts to enhance security and resilience among facilities that  participated in these regional-level assessments, but faced challenges  measuring the results associated with these projects. Consistent with the NIPP, DHS performs periodic follow-ups among industry  partners that participate in these regional assessments with the intent  of measuring their efforts to make enhancements arising out of these  surveys and assessments. However, we found that DHS did not  measure how industry partners made enhancements at individual  assets that participate in a RRAP project contribute to the overall  results of the project. DHS officials stated at the time that they faced  challenges measuring performance within and across RRAP projects  because of the unique characteristics of each, including geographic  diversity and differences among assets within projects. However, we  concluded that DHS could better position itself to gain insights into  projects\u2019 effects if it were to develop a mechanism to compare  facilities that have participated in a RRAP project with those that have  not, thus establishing building blocks for measuring its efforts to  conduct RRAP projects. We recommended that DHS develop a  mechanism to assess the extent to which individual projects  influenced partners to make RRAP-related enhancements. DHS  concurred with our recommendation and reported that it had actions  underway to review alternatives, including possibly revising its  security survey and vulnerability assessment follow-up tool, to  address this recommendation.", "Although DHS reports that it has taken or begun to take action on the  open recommendations discussed above, we have not verified DHS\u2019s  progress implementing all of our recommendations.
