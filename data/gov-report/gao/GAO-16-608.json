DOE incurred this cost increase and delay partly because it did not follow all best practices in developing the cost and schedule estimates. In particular, DOE's schedule did not include extra time, or contingency, to account for known project risks. Instead, DOE estimated it would restart waste operations in March 2016 based on a schedule with no contingency that gave DOE less than a 1 percent chance of meeting its restart date. In January 2016, DOE approved new estimates that added 8.5 months to the schedule, extending the restart to December 2016; increased the estimated cost of recovery by $2 million; and resulted in an additional $61.6 million in costs for operating WIPP in fiscal year 2016. DOE's WIPP operations activity manager said the revised schedule included contingency. However, according to DOE officials, they did not follow other best practices. For example, DOE did not provide evidence of having an independent cost estimate to validate the revised estimate. DOE did not follow all best practices for cost and schedule estimates in part because DOE does not require that its cleanup operations, such as WIPP, follow these practices. Therefore, DOE cannot have confidence that its estimates are reliable. In contrast, DOE established new requirements in June 2015 that its capital asset projects, such as the new ventilation system at WIPP, follow these best practices. By also requiring cleanup operations to follow them, DOE would have more confidence in the estimates for cleanup operations and capital asset projects.", "DOE did not follow all best practices in analyzing and selecting an alternative for the new ventilation system at WIPP. As a result, DOE's analysis was not reliable and DOE cannot be confident that the alternative it selected in December 2015 will best provide the needed capabilities at WIPP. The analysis of alternatives (AOA) process entails identifying, analyzing, and selecting a preferred alternative to best meet the mission need. Of the four categories of best practices for AOAs, DOE's process fully met the category for identifying alternatives. For example, DOE identified a broad range of ventilation alternatives. However, DOE only partially or minimally met the other three categories: general principles, analyzing alternatives, and selecting the preferred alternative. DOE did not follow the best practice to select the preferred alternative based on a cost-benefit analysis that assesses the difference between the life-cycle costs and benefits of each alternative. In addition, an independent review that DOE commissioned consistent with best practices found that DOE's AOA did not adequately document a cost-benefit analysis and that, as a result, the selection of the preferred alternative was not supported by compelling information. The independent review recommended that DOE conduct a cost-benefit analysis consistent with best practices. However, DOE did not conduct the recommended analysis and document it before selecting the final alternative because there was no requirement to do so. In June 2015, the Secretary of Energy directed DOE to develop guidance for conducting AOAs consistent with AOA best practices. A DOE official said the department expected to issue the new guidance by December 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE require cleanup operations to follow best practices for cost and schedule estimates and require projects, including the WIPP ventilation system, to implement recommendations from independent AOA reviews or document the reasons for not doing so. DOE concurred with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)  near Carlsbad, New Mexico, serves as the only deep geologic repository  in the U.S. for the disposal of defense-related nuclear waste. WIPP is  designed to safely dispose of a specific type of defense waste, referred to  as transuranic waste, generated by DOE\u2019s nuclear weapons research,  production, and cleanup activities at sites across the country. The waste  is disposed of in underground rooms mined out of an ancient salt  formation more than 2,000 feet below the earth\u2019s surface. Since WIPP  began to accept waste in 1999, DOE has depended on WIPP\u2019s capability  to accept transuranic waste shipments. In February 2014, waste  operations at WIPP were suspended following two accidents  underground: a fire on a salt-hauling truck and an unrelated radiological  release from a waste container that contaminated portions of the facility  underground and released a small amount of radiation into the  environment above ground. The suspension of WIPP\u2019s operations has  impaired DOE\u2019s ability to meet its cleanup and national security missions  as well as regulatory cleanup milestones agreed to with states that host  DOE sites.", "The department has made it a top priority to restart WIPP\u2019s waste  disposal operations. In September 2014, DOE issued a WIPP recovery  plan. This plan describes the major activities needed to restart  operations, first on a limited basis and then moving to full operations.  WIPP\u2019s full operations include waste disposal operations concurrent with  mining and mine maintenance activities. A key set of activities in the  recovery plan is to increase ventilation airflow underground, which was  425,000 cubic feet of air per minute (cfm) before the WIPP accidents. As  a result of the radioactive contamination underground, DOE has  continually run WIPP\u2019s existing ventilation system in a filtered mode,  which is not the normal operating mode and has reduced the airflow to  60,000 cfm. Running in filtered mode severely restricts the number of  people that can be underground, as well as the activities that can be  conducted there, such as mine repair activities using diesel-powered  equipment that creates fumes and dust. To increase the airflow to restart  limited waste disposal operations, DOE planned two upgrades to the  existing ventilation system: an interim system that would increase airflow  to about 114,000 cfm, and a supplemental system that would increase  airflow to about 180,000 cfm. To resume full operations, DOE planned to  build a new permanent ventilation system to replace the existing one and  to provide airflow of about 540,000 cfm, which DOE estimates is sufficient  to safely support full and concurrent waste operations, mining, and mine  maintenance activities. From October 2014 through December 2015,  DOE conducted an analysis of alternatives (AOA) to identify the best  solution for the new permanent ventilation system. The AOA is a key first  step in DOE\u2019s procedures for the acquisition of a capital asset such as  WIPP\u2019s new permanent ventilation system. The process entails  identifying, analyzing, and selecting a preferred alternative to best meet  the mission need by comparing the operational effectiveness, costs, and  risks of potential alternatives.", "In February 2015, DOE approved a project management baseline that  included the estimated cost and schedule for completing the activities  described in the WIPP recovery plan. DOE estimated that it would need  $242 million to complete the recovery activities needed to restart limited  waste disposal operations by March 2016. DOE also estimated a cost  range of $77 million to $309 million to complete the new permanent  ventilation system by the end of December 2018, paving the way for  resumption of full operations. In the recovery plan, DOE described its  schedule as aggressive and noted that it did not include extra time to  account for unanticipated delays. In May 2015, a DOE assessment found  that pressure to achieve the March 2016 deadline contributed to poor  safety practices in WIPP recovery efforts. In July 2015, DOE announced  that it experienced delays in implementing the project baseline, including  delays related to procuring equipment and delays related to correcting  deficiencies in safety practices. As a result of these delays, the  department announced that it would revise the WIPP project  management baseline with the goal of developing a more realistic  schedule. In January 2016, DOE approved the revised estimates for the  project cost and schedule to restart limited waste operations.  Nonetheless, the department still faces challenges in completing the  recovery. For example, in March 2016, the Defense Nuclear Facilities  Safety Board, which oversees DOE\u2019s nuclear facilities such as WIPP,  reported that DOE had made progress in revising its nuclear safety plans  at WIPP but additional work remained to address safety concerns to  prevent a recurrence of the February 2014 radiological accident. As we  found in our most recent High-Risk Series update, DOE has a history of  exceeding its cost and schedule estimates and then creating new  baselines. We have also found that when DOE creates new baselines  during the execution of projects, it can be challenging to independently  assess DOE\u2019s performance in managing these projects.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee report accompanying a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a  provision for us to review recovery operations at WIPP. Our report  examines the extent to which DOE (1) met its initial cost and schedule  estimates for restarting waste disposal operations at WIPP and (2)  followed best practices in analyzing and selecting an alternative for the  new ventilation system.", "To address both objectives above, we conducted a site visit to WIPP in  January 2015. During the site visit we obtained documentation and  interviewed officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management  (EM), which is responsible for oversight of WIPP and exercises this  responsibility primarily through its Carlsbad Field Office. We also  interviewed representatives at WIPP from Nuclear Waste Partnership  LLC (NWP), which is the private contractor that manages and operates  WIPP for DOE. To examine the extent to which DOE met its initial  (February 2015) cost and schedule estimates for restarting waste  disposal operations, we compared DOE\u2019s initial cost and schedule  estimates to restart limited waste disposal operations contained in its  February 2015 WIPP recovery project management baseline with DOE\u2019s  revised estimates in its January 2016 revised baseline. We reviewed  DOE\u2019s reports on the reasons it exceeded the initial estimates and the  risk management plans for WIPP recovery prepared by NWP which were  used in developing the initial estimates. We compared the initial cost and  schedule estimates from the February 2015 recovery baseline with the  best practices described in our cost and schedule guides. We reviewed  documentation on the revised (January 2016) baseline and interviewed  DOE and NWP on the approach followed to develop the revised cost and  schedule estimates to restart limited waste disposal operations in the  baseline, but we did not assess the revised estimates against the best  practices because of the time frame of our review. To examine the extent  to which DOE followed best practices in analyzing and selecting an  alternative for the new ventilation system, we reviewed documentation on  the process DOE followed and compared the process with best practices  for conducting an AOA that we published in December 2014. During the  review, we also interviewed officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Enterprise  Assessments, which provides internal oversight of DOE facilities; the  Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which provides external  oversight of DOE defense nuclear facilities; the U.S. Mine Safety and  Health Administration, which provides external oversight of mining  activities at WIPP; and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and  New Mexico Environment Department, both of which provide external  regulation of WIPP.

The breach was  caused by a chemical reaction inside the container between materials  that DOE later determined should not have been packaged together. The  reaction generated enough heat to increase pressure in the container.  The pressure forced open the container\u2019s lid and propelled its radioactive  waste contents, combustible gases, and other materials into the air and  on to adjacent waste containers. The radioactive contents, gases, and  other materials ignited and triggered a fire in the disposal room by igniting  other materials in the room.

Specifically, in January 2016, approximately a year after approving the  initial project baseline, DOE approved a new project management  baseline that increased the estimated costs for the recovery project by $2  million (from $242 million to $244 million) and added 8.5 months to the  project schedule, extending the date when limited waste disposal  operations might begin from March 2016 to December 2016. According to  DOE officials, the project was unable to meet its estimated completion  date due to delays, including delays associated with procuring  components for the interim ventilation system upgrade that were found to  be faulty, and delays associated with DOE\u2019s decision to require the  project to adhere to new nuclear safety requirements. According to the  operations activity manager for WIPP in the Carlsbad Field Office, the  recovery project only exceeded the $242 million baseline by $2 million in  part because DOE overestimated the cost of some project activities and  spent contingency funds to make up for cost increases in certain parts of  the project. For example, DOE overestimated the cost for  decontaminating the WIPP underground by more than $6 million, which  offset a $5 million cost increase caused by delays associated with the  faulty ventilation system components.

Notably, DOE\u2019s risk  analysis predicted that the March 2016 date to restart operations had  a less than 1 percent confidence level, meaning in effect that DOE  had a less than 1 percent chance of meeting the March 2016  deadline. EM officials said the department used a less than 1 percent  confidence level because it wanted to have an aggressive goal for  restarting operations. According to EM officials, when EM managers  presented this schedule to senior DOE decision-makers for approval,  they described the schedule as \u201caggressive\u201d but did not clarify that  there was less than a 1 percent chance of meeting the schedule.  According to these officials, they did not think that senior managers  would understand the project management terminology regarding  confidence levels.", "In January 2016, DOE approved revised cost and schedule estimates for  restarting WIPP\u2019s limited waste disposal operations. The operations  activity manager for WIPP in the Carlsbad Field Office said the revised  schedule included contingency and the revised restart date of December  2016 had an 80 percent confidence level. However, according to DOE  officials, they did not follow other best practices. For example, DOE did  not provide evidence of having an independent cost estimate which would  have provided DOE an unbiased and objective benchmark to validate the  estimates prepared by NWP. As noted above, we did not assess DOE\u2019s  revised estimates against all of the best practices. The full results of our  analysis of the initial cost and schedule estimates can be found in  appendixes II and III.", "DOE did not follow all best practices in developing the initial cost and  schedule estimates for the WIPP recovery project or in developing new  estimates because, unlike DOE\u2019s requirements for capital asset projects  under Order 413.3B, DOE\u2019s EM operations activities protocol that  governs cleanup operations such as WIPP recovery does not require the  use of best practices in developing such estimates. As mentioned above,  DOE EM\u2019s protocol requires that EM sites develop or approve baselines  for each project\u2019s cost and schedule to judge project performance.  However, the protocol does not specify any best practices in terms of the  steps to follow in developing the cost and schedule estimates in these  baselines. The absence of a requirement to follow best practices for cost  and schedule estimating is in contrast to a decision in June 2015 by the  Secretary of Energy to require that all capital asset projects with an  estimated cost of $10 million or more follow such practices under Order  413.3B. Operations activities such as the WIPP recovery activities are not  considered capital asset projects and therefore are not required to follow  these requirements even though EM\u2019s operations activities share many of  the same characteristics as capital asset projects. Without requiring EM\u2019s  operations activities such as WIPP to follow all best practices when  developing cost and schedule estimates DOE cannot have confidence  that it is producing reliable baselines needed to monitor its performance in  managing these activities. Without reliable baselines, DOE will also  continue to be at risk of cost overruns and delays in achieving its cleanup  missions such as the permanent disposal of transuranic waste from sites  across the country.", "DOE has reported progress in completing the activities needed to restart  limited waste operations using its revised cost and schedule estimates,  although it still faces challenges and it remains unclear whether DOE  identified and analyzed the risks associated with these challenges in  revising the estimates. In terms of progress, for example, in December  2015, NWP submitted revisions to WIPP\u2019s nuclear safety documentation  to EM for review. In addition, DOE reported in March 2016 that NWP  completed most of the construction of the interim ventilation system  upgrade in the underground. However, as noted above, in March 2016,  the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board reported that additional work  was needed to revise WIPP\u2019s nuclear safety documentation to prevent  recurrence of a radiological release accident. In addition, in April 2016,  DOE\u2019s Office of Enterprise Assessments, which provides independent  internal oversight of DOE\u2019s management of safety, issued two reports that  found that although NWP had made improvements in its operational  safety and emergency management programs and procedures, significant  challenges remained to fully meet DOE requirements and effectively plan  and implement these programs and procedures. As we noted above,  DOE officials acknowledged that the department did not follow all best  practices in developing the revised estimates to restart WIPP operations.  Without having followed all best practices, including having an  independent cost estimate conducted to validate the estimates, DOE  cannot be confident that NWP sufficiently accounted for these challenges  in revising its risk analysis and that DOE set an appropriate allowance for  contingency to reduce the risk of cost overruns and delays in restarting  WIPP\u2019s operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Did Not Successfully Manage WIPP Recovery Project Risks That Contributed to the Project Cost Increase and Schedule Delay but Has Revised Its Risk Management Process", "paragraphs": ["DOE did not successfully manage key risks that it had identified and that  contributed to the project\u2019s cost increase and schedule delay but has  taken steps to revise the risk management process for the WIPP recovery  project. DOE\u2019s EM operations activities protocol requires the use of a risk  management process to identify and mitigate risks to completing a project  within its baseline cost and schedule estimates. For the WIPP recovery  project, DOE and NWP developed a project risk register to support the  initial project management baseline for WIPP recovery. The risk register  listed the risks that could increase costs or delay completion. DOE and  NWP assessed the likelihood and consequence of each risk and  identified a mitigation plan for each risk that described the actions to  reduce the impact on the project if the risk were realized.", "In a public statement explaining the need to revise its baseline for the  recovery project, DOE cited problems with three activities that the  department had previously identified in its project risk register: (1)  completing revisions to WIPP\u2019s nuclear safety documentation; (2)  installing the interim ventilation system upgrade; and (3) completing the  corrective actions that address the recommendations in the phase two  accident investigation report. DOE had identified risks related to each of  these activities in the project risk register but was not able to effectively  mitigate them, as discussed below:", "WIPP nuclear safety documentation. NWP identified the risk of a  potential delay of up to 6 months in restarting operations if DOE  decided that the WIPP nuclear safety documentation should be  revised according to standards that were in the process of being  updated rather than according to the existing standards. According  to DOE, when NWP started to revise the safety documentation in the  summer of 2014, the contractor assumed it should follow the existing  standard. NWP added this risk to its project risk register to account for  the possibility that EM could require NWP to revise the nuclear safety  documentation according to the new standards. To mitigate this risk,  NWP\u2019s plan was to ensure they had concurrence with DOE to start  the revisions using the existing standards. DOE issued the new  standards in November 2014 and notified NWP in December 2014  that the WIPP safety documentation would need to comply with them.  According to an NWP recovery project manager, this change in policy  resulted in a 7-month delay in NWP\u2019s schedule for revising the WIPP  safety documentation.", "Interim ventilation system. NWP identified the risk of a potential  delay of 3 months to complete the installation of the interim ventilation  system upgrade if NWP faced difficulties acquiring the components for  the system. To mitigate this risk, NWP\u2019s plan was to identify difficult- to-procure equipment early in the project, ensure it had a valid and  up-to-date list of qualified suppliers, and monitor and review  equipment purchases. According to NWP officials, this plan was  partially effective. Specifically, NWP officials said that they discovered  that components for the interim ventilation system were damaged  when they inspected the components before formally accepting them.  In addition, they said that the costs to return the components to the  manufacturer and repair them were paid for by the manufacturer.  However, the NWP officials said that as a result of receiving the faulty  equipment, the installation of the interim ventilation system was  delayed about 4 months because NWP needed to send the  components back to the manufacturer and make corrections to its  shipping process to prevent a reoccurrence of these issues.", "Corrective actions from the phase two accident investigation  report. NWP identified the risk of potential delay of up to 6 weeks  regarding the length of time DOE needed to complete the phase two  accident investigation. In the summer and fall of 2014, when NWP  was developing the initial project management baseline, DOE\u2019s phase  two accident investigation was still underway. According to NWP  officials, they needed to wait for DOE to complete the accident  investigation and issue the final report with recommendations before  they could begin developing and implementing corrective actions.  DOE issued the final report in April of 2015. According to the  operations activity manager for WIPP in the Carlsbad Field Office,  completing the corrective actions in response to the report\u2019s  recommendations resulted in a 3-month delay.", "NWP officials said that in recognition of the need for a more effective risk  management process, they revised their process as part of revising the  recovery cost and schedules estimates.

Specifically, they identified nine ventilation system  alternatives that the contractors determined should be analyzed because  the alternatives could meet the mission need and other screening criteria  that they defined: NWP identified six and Trinity identified three. The  alternatives included continued use of the existing exhaust shaft as well  as constructing a new shaft or more than one shaft, such as a new  exhaust shaft and a new air intake shaft. In addition, the studies identified  different ventilation filtration capacities and modes of operation that  included continuous filtering of all exhaust air or filtering air only when a  radiological release is detected underground."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Partially Met Best Practices in the General Principles Category", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s AOA process partially met the best practices in the general  principles category, which covers how the AOA process is planned,  conducted, and documented.

As the AOA related  to the best practices of defining the mission need for the project and  analyzing alternatives without a predetermined solution, DOE did not  define the mission need for the new ventilation system by focusing only  on the capabilities needed for the project, but instead defined the need for  the system to include a particular solution, which included constructing a  new ventilation exhaust shaft. Because DOE defined the mission need by  mentioning a new exhaust shaft, both contractors appeared to have  analyzed alternatives with a preference for the alternatives that included  constructing a new shaft. Specifically, NWP completed its analysis of the  six alternatives by proposing two for further consideration by DOE, one  that did not include a new shaft and one that did. NWP\u2019s alternative that  did not include a new shaft was its highest-scoring alternative and the  alternative that included a new shaft was its third-highest scoring  alternative. NWP officials told us that they proposed the second  alternative along with the highest-scoring one because they believed the  mission need statement discussed a new shaft. Regarding Trinity, in its  final AOA report, Trinity stated that the mission need statement endorsed  a new exhaust shaft. Trinity then analyzed three alternatives, one of  which included using the existing shaft, and proposed an alternative to  DOE that included constructing a new shaft. In its final assessment, DOE  assessed the two alternatives proposed by NWP and the one proposed  by Trinity and selected NWP\u2019s alternative that included constructing a  new shaft, shown as the second of the three alternatives in table 1.

DOE did not consistently  define two key functional requirements of the project\u2014(1) the rate of  airflow needed to support full operations at WIPP, and (2) the expected  operational life of the new system\u2014which limited the reliability of the  overall AOA process as follows:", "Regarding the estimated airflow, DOE did not specify a functional  requirement in its mission need statement for the rate of airflow that  the new ventilation system must be capable of providing for full  operations at WIPP. Instead, the mission need statement described  the minimum airflow required by WIPP\u2019s hazardous waste facility  permit, which was 260,000 cfm, and the actual airflow at WIPP before  the accidents, which was 425,000 cfm. In conducting its AOA, NWP  calculated its own airflow that it thought would be necessary for full  operations at WIPP, which they estimated was about 540,000 cfm.  NWP estimated the higher airflow based on its analysis of  underground operations and used this amount to analyze a range of  alternatives. In contrast, Trinity used the airflow associated with the  WIPP hazardous waste facility permit, 260,000 cfm, as the estimated  airflow in conducting its AOA. The federal project director in the  Carlsbad Field Office told us that he did not direct Trinity to redo its  analysis using NWP\u2019s higher airflow because he believed that airflow  was needed for examining the scale of the system and would be  defined lower during design. Moreover, he said that he wanted to  maintain Trinity\u2019s independence from NWP to be consistent with the  December 2014 DOE requirement for conducting independent AOAs.", "However, as a result of not defining the same functional airflow  requirement for both contractors, DOE officials explained that they  needed to conduct additional analysis to compare the alternatives  proposed by NWP and Trinity.", "Regarding the estimated operational life of the new ventilation system,  DOE did not specify a functional requirement in its mission need  statement for the estimated operational life of WIPP.

As a result, NWP assumed certain costs should be excluded in  estimating the life-cycle costs of its two proposed alternatives. These  costs included the costs for major equipment replacements or  upgrades which NWP assumed would not be needed during the 30- year operational life of the system; costs for providing facility security,  quality assurance, and nuclear safety that are provided to all facilities  at WIPP; and costs for the final closure of the new exhaust shaft after  2050 when the system will be decommissioned.

We provided a draft of our cost and  schedule assessments to the Carlsbad Field Office and NWP and revised  the draft, as appropriate, after discussing our assessment with the federal  officials and the contractor. We reviewed documentation on the revised  (January 2016) baseline and interviewed DOE and NWP officials on the  approach followed to develop the revised cost and schedule estimates to  restart WIPP\u2019s waste disposal operations in the baseline, but we did not  assess the revised estimates against the best practices because of the  time frame of our review.", "To examine the extent to which DOE followed best practices in analyzing  and selecting an alternative for WIPP\u2019s new ventilation system, we used  as criteria the best practices for conducting an AOA identified in  GAO-15-37 issued in December 2014. GAO developed the best  practices identified in this report by reviewing AOA policies and guidance  used by seven public and private-sector entities with experience in the  AOA process, and verified these practices with subject-matter experts.  DOE\u2019s AOA process for the WIPP ventilation system consisted of three  elements: NWP\u2019s January 2015 AOA that resulted in the selection of two  preferred alternatives proposed for further analysis, a second AOA  completed by Trinity Engineering Associates (Trinity) in October 2015  which resulted in a single preferred alternative proposed to DOE, and  DOE\u2019s final alternative evaluation process led by the Carlsbad Field  Office that considered the three alternatives proposed by the initial  studies. Our analysis assessed the overall AOA process considering each  element. We compared the process with the best practices and  determined a score for the overall process. We reviewed project  documentation from the Carlsbad Field Office, NWP, and Trinity and  interviewed Carlsbad Field Office officials and NWP representatives in  charge of the AOA. In addition, in October 2015, as we were conducting  our engagement, EM and DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management Oversight  and Assessments completed separate assessments of the WIPP AOA for  the new ventilation system. We reviewed documentation of these reviews  and interviewed the DOE officials who worked on them. We examined the  extent that the independent assessments followed the best practice to  have an independent entity assess the extent that a project\u2019s AOA  followed all best practices.", "To score DOE\u2019s AOA process, a GAO analyst examined the AOA  documentation received from the agency and then assigned a score for  each of the 24 best practices. Following this, a GAO AOA specialist  independent of the engagement team reviewed the AOA documentation  and the scores assigned by the analyst for accuracy and cross-checked  the scores in all the analyses for consistency. We used a five-point  scoring system to determine the extent to which DOE\u2019s AOA process  conformed to the best practices. After determining a score for each  individual best practice, we calculated the score for each category\u2014(1)  general principles, (2) identifying alternatives, (3) analyzing alternatives,  and (4) selecting a preferred alternative\u2014by calculating the average of  the scores for the best practices that fall under each category. If the score  for each best practice and the average score for each category was \u201cfully  met\u201d or \u201csubstantially met,\u201d we concluded that the AOA process  conformed to best practices and therefore could be considered reliable. In  contrast, if the score was \u201cpartially met,\u201d \u201cminimally met,\u201d or \u201cnot met,\u201d we  concluded that the AOA process did not conform to best practices and  therefore could not be considered reliable. We shared our analysis with  DOE officials and representatives from NWP for review and incorporated  their technical comments and any additional evidence they provided in  our analysis, as appropriate. We also interviewed officials from DOE\u2019s  Office of Enterprise Assessments, which provides internal oversight of  DOE facilities; the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which  provides external oversight of DOE defense nuclear facilities; the U.S.  Mine Safety and Health Administration, which provides external oversight  of mining activities at WIPP; as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency and the New Mexico Environment Department, both of which  provide external regulation of WIPP.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to August  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
