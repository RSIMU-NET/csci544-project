The Department of Defense (DOD)  has stated that although the JIAC is a critical intelligence asset, its 21  current facilities\u2014located at Royal Air Force (RAF) base Molesworth\u2014are  inadequate and inefficient. According to DOD, the facilities at RAF  Molesworth were not designed to support the JIAC\u2019s intelligence  missions, and this has led to costly sustainment challenges and instances  of degraded theater intelligence capabilities. For example, the U.S. Air  Force has reported that the JIAC has experienced numerous outages to  facility-related information technology systems that have severely  degraded theater command and control and intelligence capabilities for  several hours at a time. To address these issues, DOD will invest  approximately $240 million in military construction (MILCON) for the Air  Force to consolidate and relocate the JIAC to provide additional space  specifically designed to support and fully enable the current intelligence  mission.", "In the fall of 2009, DOD began its analysis of alternatives process for  consolidating the JIAC and, as part of this analysis, considered potential  alternative locations in Europe and the United States. By the spring of  2013, DOD had concluded that its preferred alternative was to move the  JIAC from its current location at RAF Molesworth and consolidate its  facilities at RAF Croughton in the United Kingdom. According to the  Deputy Secretary of Defense, the decision to locate the JIAC at RAF  Croughton was the result of careful consideration of intelligence and  operational requirements and factors and was informed by other criteria,  such as diplomatic relationships and economic factors. The Secretary of  Defense issued a Resource Management Decision in April 2013 to move  ahead with the JIAC consolidation. After the selection of RAF Croughton,  the Air Force developed a MILCON cost estimate and initiated a three- phase MILCON project which, according to Air Force officials, it plans to  complete by early 2021.", "The consolidation of the JIAC is proceeding in three phases. In Phase I,  according to the Air Force budget documentation, the Air Force plans to  build EUCOM\u2019s Intelligence Analytic Center, a data processing center, a  warehouse, and various supporting facilities. In Phase II it plans to build  the U.S. Africa Command\u2019s Intelligence Analytic Center, the Intelligence  Fusion Center of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a battlefield  information system, and additional supporting facilities. Phase III will  include a regional Joint Intelligence Training Facility and a physical fitness  facility. In December 2014 and November and December 2015, Congress  authorized and appropriated $92.2 million for Phase I and $94.2 million  for Phase II. In September 2016, Congress appropriated $53.1 million for  Phase III. The United Kingdom is serving as executive agent for JIAC  construction, and in August 2015, DOD obligated Phase I funding to the  United Kingdom. DOD officials told us that DOD obligated Phase II  funding to the United Kingdom in July 2016. As of September 2016, DOD  officials said they anticipate awarding a contract for Phases I and II in  mid-2017 with construction to start in the fall of 2017.", "Since 2013, Congress has required DOD to provide information on its  JIAC consolidation effort and has taken a number of oversight actions.  For example, House Report 113-102 directed DOD to provide detailed  information on its plans for the JIAC consolidation at RAF Croughton.  House Report 113-02 also directed the Secretary of Defense to submit a  report on RAF Croughton and, among other things, provide a description  of why the current facility, RAF Molesworth, was not sufficient to meet  JIAC\u2019s requirements and how the facility at RAF Croughton would meet  them. In other statutory provisions, Congress has prohibited DOD from  obligating or expending military construction funds in the United Kingdom  or awarding construction contracts in the EUCOM area of responsibility  until it provides certain required information to Congress. In the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, Congress authorized  funding for the JIAC consolidation but prohibited the expenditure of funds  until the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional defense  committees that RAF Croughton remains the \u201coptimal location\u201d for the  consolidation of the JIAC and explains why.

The Secretary of Defense approved  the recommendation and announced his decision to streamline Lajes  Field in October 2012. According to the Secretary of Defense, the  frequency and volume of flights using Lajes Field had decreased, and the  base was operating well below its capacity. The Air Force recommended  reducing U.S. operations at Lajes from 24 hours, 7 days a week to 8  hours, 7 days a week and downsizing the 65th Air Base Wing to an Air  Base Group. According to the Secretary of Defense, the presence at  Lajes Field exceeded mission requirements, and the mission  requirements at Lajes Field could be supported with a smaller force. DOD  has estimated that the streamlined footprint would yield approximately  $35 million in annual savings.

According to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide,  a cost estimate created using best practices exhibits four  characteristics\u2014it is comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and  credible. Each of the four characteristics is associated with a specific set  of best practices. Our assessment found that the JIAC cost estimate  partially met three and minimally met one of the four characteristics of a  reliable cost estimate. If any of these characteristics is not substantially or  fully met, then the cost estimate does not reflect the characteristics of a  high-quality estimate and cannot be considered reliable. Table 2 lists  each of the four characteristics, along with our summary assessment of  the JIAC cost estimate.", "The following summarizes our analysis of the JIAC cost estimate for each  of the four characteristics. Appendix I provides greater detail on our  assessment.", "Comprehensiveness (Partially Met). According to best practices,  agencies should develop accurate life-cycle cost estimates. Further, a  life-cycle cost estimate should encompass all past (or sunk), present,  and future costs for every aspect of the program, regardless of  funding source\u2014including all government and contractor costs.  However, the JIAC cost estimate included only MILCON costs and did  not include costs associated with the life cycle of the project. Air Force  and Office of the Secretary of Defense officials said they do not  consider the JIAC cost estimate a life-cycle cost estimate and that the  estimate\u2019s scope is in line with DOD guidance on the development of  budget requests for MILCON projects. According to DOD officials, the  department does not have a full life-cycle cost estimate for the entire  JIAC consolidation effort. DOD and Air Force officials further stated  that the estimate covers the costs of infrastructure for the JIAC\u2019s  facilities, other supporting infrastructure (e.g., utilities serving the JIAC  facilities), and certain other facilities for functions related to JIAC, such  as family support (e.g., expanded capacity of the child development  center). The associated Operation and Maintenance costs (e.g.,  family support costs like living allowances) were not included in the  estimate, because they were considered out of scope, according to  DOD and Air Force officials. However, without fully accounting for life- cycle costs, management may have difficulty successfully planning  and programming resource requirements for the JIAC consolidation  and making sound decisions.", "Documentation (Partially Met). According to best practices,  documentation is essential for validating and defending a cost  estimate. The JIAC cost estimate is generally consistent with the  sizing assumptions included in DOD documentation, laying out  requirements for the JIAC\u2019s facilities, inputs from appropriate experts,  and relevant DOD guidance, such as the DOD Facilities Pricing  Guide. Also, DOD documented both the data sources and the  methodology used for the JIAC cost estimate in an Excel spreadsheet  model and a parametric cost engineering estimate summary.  However, the documentation for the JIAC cost estimate is not  complete. Specifically, the cost estimate does not provide sufficient  documentation so that a cost analyst unfamiliar with the program  could understand what had been done and replicate it. The cost  estimate uses the DOD Facilities Pricing Guide (heretofore referred to  as the Pricing Guide), which provides planning assumptions and  prices for a variety of types of facilities, such as office buildings. In the  cost calculation spreadsheet for the JIAC cost estimate, the cost  estimators\u2019 judgements regarding which type of facility to use from the  Pricing Guide were not always consistent with the categories listed in  the Pricing Guide. For example, there is no mention of intelligence  facilities in the Pricing Guide, and we were unable to independently  trace all of the unit costs from the JIAC cost estimate back to it. Air  Force officials were able to show where in the Pricing Guide these  numbers were drawn from; however, this is not documented in the  estimating model, and there is no rationale provided to show that an  intelligence facility would be the same as a communications center.  Without a well-documented cost estimate, the Air Force may not be  able to present a convincing argument for the validity of the JIAC cost  estimate and answer decision makers\u2019 and oversight groups\u2019  questions.", "Accuracy (Partially Met). According to best practices, the cost  estimate should provide results that are unbiased, and it should not be  overly conservative or overly optimistic. An estimate is accurate when  it is based on an assessment of most likely costs, adjusted properly  for inflation, and contains no more than a few minor mistakes\u2014if any.  In addition, a cost estimate should be updated regularly to reflect  changes in the program, for example when schedules or other  assumptions change or actual costs change, so that it always reflects  the current status. The JIAC estimate used historical data, did not  contain mathematical errors, showed evidence of being updated,  underwent a review process before final approval, and follows DOD  construction cost estimation guidance on how to account for inflation.  However, while the JIAC cost estimate has been updated, it has not  been updated regularly. Specifically, the April 2013 estimate was  updated in June 2013 to align with an update to the Pricing Guide but  was not updated to align with the two subsequent updates to the  Pricing Guide that occurred before the February 2015 JIAC cost  estimate was submitted. Air Force officials said that the JIAC cost  estimate was updated to reflect foreign currency fluctuations.  According to these officials, the MILCON process assumes flexibility  in the project timeline to allow adjustments to the estimate and  focuses on establishing the project\u2019s scope (e.g., the square feet or  square meters associated with a project) in the Air Force\u2019s project  development justification forms. These Air Force officials also stated  that the costs associated with MILCON projects are updated only with  significant changes to the program and are typically permitted to be  adjusted by as much as plus or minus 25 percent of the total costs\u2014 even after funding has been appropriated\u2014without needing to be  reprogrammed. While updating an estimate in this way may be  permissible within the established MILCON process, it is not  consistent with cost estimating best practices, because the estimate is  not updated regularly. Without updating the JIAC cost estimate on a  regular basis, DOD and the Air Force may have difficulty analyzing  changes in program costs for the consolidation project and may  hinder the collection of up-to-date cost and technical data to support  future JIAC cost estimates.", "Credibility (Minimally Met). According to best practices, a cost  estimate should discuss any limitations of the analysis resulting from  uncertainty or biases surrounding data or assumptions. Major  assumptions should be varied, and other outcomes recomputed, to  determine how sensitive the cost estimates are to changes in the  assumptions. Also, risk and uncertainty analysis should be performed  to determine the level of risk associated with the estimate. Without a  sensitivity analysis that reveals how a cost estimate is affected by a  change in a single assumption, the cost estimator will not fully  understand which variable most affects the cost estimate. The use of  a sensitivity analysis is not specified in cost estimation guidance for  MILCON projects from either DOD or the Air Force, and the JIAC cost  estimate did not include such an analysis. According to Office of the  Secretary of Defense and Air Force officials, a sensitivity analysis is  part of the underlying unit cost development, because costs are  developed through the use of both historical data and industry  averages. These officials further stated that the Office of the Secretary  of Defense uses actual data underpinned by relevant sensitivity and  range analyses to develop its cost estimates. For example, Office of  the Secretary of Defense and Air Force officials said that the Office of  the Secretary of Defense uses the DOD Selling Price Index\u2014which  averages three commonly accepted national indexes for construction  price escalation\u2014to calculate actual project award cost data.  However, for sensitivity analysis to be useful in informing decisions,  careful assessment of the underlying risks and supporting data related  to a specific MILCON project is also necessary. In addition, the  sources of the variation should be well documented and traceable.  Without conducting sensitivity analysis for the JIAC cost estimate to  identify the effect of uncertainties associated with different  assumptions, DOD and the Air Force increase the risk that decisions  will be made without a clear understanding of the effects of these  assumptions on costs.", "Another key to establishing an estimate\u2019s credibility is its review  process. According to best practices, the estimate\u2019s cost drivers  should be crosschecked, and an independent cost estimate  conducted by a group outside the acquiring organization should be  developed to determine whether other estimating methods produce  similar results. While the Air Force has a review process, the review it  conducted for the JIAC cost estimate did not include the use of a  checklist provided as a sample in DOD MILCON cost estimation  guidance. The sample checklist, while not required, could have  helped the Air Force to confirm the validity of assumptions and the  logic used in estimating the cost of the JIAC construction tasks. Air  Force officials stated that their review primarily looks at the numbers  provided and the ranges from the Pricing Guide to see whether the  estimate is within those ranges. These officials added that they would  use the checklist only if there was a difference from the Pricing Guide.", "However, the first phase of the JIAC cost estimate did not identify the  stage of the estimate; did not separate costs for labor, equipment, or  material; and did not calculate prime and subcontractor profit by the  weighted guidelines method, which are items listed in the sample  checklist.", "When we shared the results of our analysis with officials from the Office  of the Secretary of Defense, they said that they did not agree our best  practices for cost estimating were entirely applicable to the JIAC cost  estimate, since the estimate focused on MILCON costs. Furthermore,  Office of the Secretary of Defense and Air Force officials said that  construction is discussed in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide  as a subsidiary cost to be included in the life-cycle cost estimate. For  example, these officials said that construction costs are to be considered  as part of the overall ground rules and assumptions for a cost estimate.  However, the methodology outlined in our Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide is a compilation of best practices that federal cost  estimating organizations and industry use to develop and maintain  reliable cost estimates, and this methodology can be used across the  federal government for developing, managing, and evaluating capital  program cost estimates, including military construction estimates.  Furthermore, DOD guidance for estimating construction costs states that  in the MILCON program, construction cost estimates are prepared  throughout the planning, design, and construction phases of a  construction project. These construction cost estimates are categorized  as follows: programming estimate, concept estimate, final estimate, and  government estimate. The Air Force provided us with the JIAC  consolidation programming estimate for analysis, because it was the most  complete and updated estimate at the time of our review. Even though  our analysis shows that the programming estimate did not meet all of the  four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable estimate, the Air Force will  have opportunities to incorporate our best practices as it prepares future  cost estimates for subsequent phases of the JIAC consolidation program.  Without incorporating a methodology that is more closely aligned with our  best practices for cost estimation and incorporates all four characteristics  of a high-quality, reliable estimate, the Air Force will not be providing  comprehensive and high-quality information for decision makers to use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Conducted Multiple Reviews of Lajes Field as a Possible JIAC Location", "paragraphs": ["After its 2013 decision to consolidate the JIAC at RAF Croughton, DOD  conducted multiple reviews to provide information on Lajes Field as a  potential alternative location for the JIAC, in response to congressional  interest and inquiries.

Additionally, according to the Deputy  Secretary of Defense, DOD\u2019s reviews determined that Lajes Field was not  a suitable location for the JIAC, based both on operational requirements  and costs including housing availability and the lack of adequate secure  communications infrastructure. These reviews were led by EUCOM,  CAPE, and DISA.", "EUCOM\u2019s September 2015 review. EUCOM developed an analysis  comparing RAF Croughton with Lajes Field as potential locations for  the JIAC. EUCOM officials told us that this review was in response to  congressional interest and requests, and it included inputs from U.S.  Air Forces Europe and officials at Lajes Field. The review compared  cost estimates associated with locating JIAC at RAF Croughton with  those associated with locating it at Lajes Field. These cost estimates  included one-time costs, such as construction costs for the JIAC  facilities, communications infrastructure, and housing, as well as  recurring costs\u2014including sustainment costs for base and  communications infrastructure. The review estimated the one-time  costs associated with locating the JIAC at RAF Croughton at $357  million and the one-time costs associated with locating it at Lajes Field  at $1.65 billion. For recurring costs, the review estimated that RAF  Croughton would cost approximately $68 million annually and Lajes  Field approximately $94 million annually. The largest differences  between the cost estimates were in the one-time costs for the  communications and housing infrastructure necessary to support the  JIAC. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense told us that  DOD had provided this review, with its appendixes, to the House and  Senate Armed Services Committees and the House and Senate  Appropriations Committees in September 2015.", "This review included two appendixes developed by DISA and DIA on the  communications infrastructure needed to support the JIAC.

This  report indicated that the Azores did not have sufficient communications  infrastructure to be a feasible location for a DISA telecommunications  hub. The DIA Azores Communications Cost Estimate provided a brief  summary on the current and proposed communications systems within  the Azores Islands, as well as the costs associated with modernizing the  systems. The appendix noted that it was developed in response to a  request from the DIA Office of Congressional Affairs.

CAPE conducted an  independent review of the cost estimates presented in EUCOM\u2019s  September 2015 review and those developed by the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for its July 2015  review. CAPE developed its own cost assumptions, which included  housing and communications infrastructure costs, among other things,  in its review of the cost calculations in the EUCOM and House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reviews, which produced  alternative cost totals. CAPE officials told us that this review was in  response to direction from the Deputy Secretary of Defense and that  they briefed this review to the House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence in May 2016 and the House and Senate Armed Services  Committees in April 2016.

DISA officials told us that this review included more refined cost  estimates for the communications infrastructure than prior estimates  and reflected new technical standards, such as operational bandwidth  requirements. The review found that the communications  infrastructure at Lajes Field did not meet technical and critical  infrastructure requirements. To upgrade the communications  infrastructure at Lajes Field, the review estimated a minimum of  $267.7 million in one-time costs to procure and install three undersea  cables and $6.8 million in annual sustainment costs. For locating the  JIAC at RAF Croughton, the review determined that no procurement  would be required and estimated sustainment costs for the  communications infrastructure at $5.5 million annually.

Table 4 shows the two cost  estimates for the housing and the assumptions that each review used.", "EUCOM and CAPE used different assumptions when developing their  cost estimates for the number of housing units needed to support the  JIAC at Lajes Field. Specifically, EUCOM reported that 1,812 housing  units were needed to support the JIAC and that those units would include  not only housing for the accompanied personnel working at the JIAC  (around 1,200 personnel) but also housing units for the additional base  operations and support personnel to support the JIAC (around 330  personnel) and personnel associated with the reversal of the personnel  streamlining initiative at Lajes Field (around 751 personnel). EUCOM  determined its estimate for accompanied housing units required for the  JIAC at Lajes Field by using Air Force personnel standards and JIAC  planning factors. On the other hand, CAPE\u2019s estimates assumed that  1,260 accompanied housing units would be needed, that dorm units  would be used, and unaccompanied civilians would live off base to  minimize the effect on military family housing. A factor in the difference  between EUCOM\u2019s and CAPE\u2019s housing cost estimates is the addition of  751 personnel (resulting in a need for 451 additional accompanied  housing units) that EUCOM included in its cost estimate when the Lajes  personnel streamlining initiative was reversed. CAPE officials told us that  their estimate did not assume that reversing the personnel streamlining  initiative would result in the addition of so many personnel, and that  therefore there would be a reduced need for additional housing.  However, CAPE assumed that more base operations and support  personnel would be needed (CAPE assumed that 500 support personnel  would be needed, while EUCOM assumed 330) to support the JIAC at  Lajes Field.", "Both reviews also provided housing estimates for unaccompanied military  personnel.

In July 2016, Air Force personnel at Lajes  Field confirmed that there were 456 available housing units at Lajes  Field. Also, both CAPE\u2019s and EUCOM\u2019s reviews used the January 2007  Housing Requirements Market Analysis for Lajes Field to determine the  number of housing units that were available for rent off base  (approximately 229 housing units). However, according to information  provided by Terceira\u2019s municipalities, there are currently 1,693 houses in  the Island of Terceira available for rent, and almost 400 were recently  occupied by U.S. military personnel and their families.

DOD agreed that many components in the GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide are broadly applicable in the decision process leading  up to a military construction budget request. However, DOD further stated  that once military construction funds are authorized and appropriated by  Congress, the department transitions to a project management mode,  and it would be a waste of resources to continue to generate cost  estimates once they have transitioned to managing project execution  using actual cost data. However, as we note in the report, DOD guidance  for estimating construction costs, DOD\u2019s Unified Facilities Criteria 3-740- 05, states that in the MILCON program, construction cost estimates are  prepared throughout the planning, design, and construction phases of a  construction project to account for the refinement of the project\u2019s design  and requirements. The final estimate should document the department\u2019s  assessment of the program's most probable cost and ensure that enough  funds are available to execute it.

The purpose of updating  the cost estimate is to check its accuracy, defend the estimate over time,  and archive cost and technical data for use in future estimates. After the  internal agency and congressional budgets are prepared and submitted, it  is imperative that cost estimators continue to monitor the program to  determine whether the preliminary information and assumptions remain  relevant and accurate.

The standards support the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) position that locating the JIAC at Lajes Field would  require the procurement and installation of three undersea cables. The  DISA review stated that capabilities for global intelligence  telecommunications at the JIAC must be secure, highly available, reliable,  and redundant. The review also listed technical requirements based on  these four characteristics, none of which\u2014according to the review\u2014the  infrastructure at Lajes Field currently meets. One of these requirements is  a critical infrastructure protection practice from the DOD Director of  National Intelligence, which prohibits the use of communication paths that  could result in denial of service or could compromise the integrity of  information. The review characterizes DOD\u2019s meeting this requirement at  Lajes Field as a high risk, noting that non-DOD personnel from Huawei, a  Chinese telecommunications company, could disconnect one fiber of the  two-fiber ring at Lajes Field, which would eliminate the redundancy of the  two cables and increase the risk that JIAC personnel would not be able to  use the communications infrastructure to meet their operational  requirements. The DISA review also listed a technical requirement that  the communications infrastructure be able to operate at 56 gigabits per  second, which the review noted is the minimum operational requirement  for Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network; Secret Internet  Protocol Router Network; Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications  System; and voice, video, and data. According to the review, the current  capabilities at Lajes Field do not meet this requirement. In comparison,  the capacity at RAF Croughton allows for 800 gigabits per second, the  capacity at U.S. Central Command also allows for 800 gigabits per  second, and the capacity at U.S. Pacific Command allows for 100 gigabits  per second. According to the review, DOD technical requirements also  specify that the communications cables must be available at 99.999  percent or higher, which equates to just a few minutes of downtime per  year. As indicated by DISA in its review, this level of availability requires  sufficient redundancy. The capabilities at Lajes Field do not meet this  requirement, according to DISA\u2019s review. DISA officials provided us data  on the number of average fiber cable outages per week in 2015\u20146.8  average outages per week for transatlantic cables and 4.4 average  outages per week for Pacific cables. The frequency with which the cables  experience outages highlights the need for redundancy in fiber cable  routes.
