Officials from all six VA medical centers GAO visited said they already were providing same-day services prior to the initiative and generally relied on previous approaches to implement VHA's same-day-services initiative. However, these officials told GAO that some of VHA's guidance and updated policies were difficult to implement due to long-standing challenges of staffing and space constraints, among others. For example, one medical center official stated that the medical center did not have the appropriate providers readily available to complete the initial mental health assessments of new patients in a timely manner\u2014a new requirement under VHA's updated policies.", "VHA officials stated that the objectives of the same-day services initiative are to improve veterans' access to care and customer service. However, VHA has not documented these objectives in a directive or developed and documented performance goals that, with associated performance measures, would monitor progress. Although VHA does monitor patient experience scores and the number of same-day appointments, these measures are not tied to specific performance goals. For example, VHA has not specified targets for the number of same-day appointments medical centers should provide. Furthermore, monitoring the number of same-day appointments does not capture all of the ways VA medical centers provide same-day services, such as renewing prescriptions. VHA officials acknowledged the intitiative was quickly developed in response to the 2014 access crisis, and developing new policies or processes, which could include documenting objectives and developing performance goals, was not the priority. Without performance goals and related measures, VHA will continue to be limited in its ability to determine, how, if at all, the same-day services initiative has improved veterans' access to care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA document objectives and develop performance goals and related performance measures to facilitate the periodic assessment of the impact of same-day services on veterans' access to care.

In  2014, a series of congressional testimonies highlighted serious problems  with veterans\u2019 access to care after well-publicized events drew national  attention to appointment wait times at VA medical centers.

We selected three of the six VA medical centers based  on (1) VHA\u2019s assessment of their access performance at the start of the  same-day services initiative, (2) current new patient wait times in primary  care and mental health, and variation in (3) geographic distribution and  complexity level. We selected the remaining three VA medical centers  because they had reportedly developed unique approaches to same-day  service implementation. We identified one of these three VA medical  centers by speaking with VHA officials, and two of the three by reviewing  their most recent annual reports. For each of the six selected VA medical  centers, we interviewed officials at one associated CBOC. See table 1 for  a list of VA medical centers we selected.

The PACT handbook was supplemented by a  2015 VHA memo on unscheduled patient walk-ins. The memo states that  if an unscheduled patient presents at a PACT clinic with a clinical  concern, the patient cannot be turned away without evaluation by a  clinical member of the team, regardless of clinic hours, resource  availability, or eligibility/enrollment status.", "VHA also had previously developed policies stating that veterans are  entitled to timely access to mental health care.

To help  VA medical centers implement its definition of same-day services, in April  2016, VHA developed written guidance\u2014the MyVA Access  Implementation Guidebook. The guidebook provides a variety of  solutions to help VA medical centers meet the intent of the same-day  service initiative. The guidebook includes specific solutions for VA  medical centers struggling to provide same-day services in primary or  mental health care for veterans with urgent care needs:  Implementing open access in primary and mental health care:  Open access aims to balance the supply of (for example, available  appointments) and demand for (for example, the number of patients  assigned to a provider and annual visits per patient) services to  increase patient access. Achieving open access requires  implementing specific strategies including achieving full staffing,  planning for contingencies such as clinical staff absences or  vacancies and managing the number of times patients see a provider  each year, among other strategies.", "Implementing primary care-mental health integration: In order to  complete the implementation of PC-MHI across the VA system, the  guidebook suggests facilities address staffing vacancies, develop a  PC-MHI implementation plan, and choose an open access scheduling  model (for example, full open access where there are no scheduled  appointments and patients are seen on a first come, first served  basis), among other things.", "Utilizing same-day referrals to mental health for suicide  prevention: This solution reiterates many of the mental health policy  changes that VHA introduced in conjunction with the same-day  service initiative such as implementing an initial screening evaluation,  developing a process for same-day care for established patients with  an urgent need, and deploying open access scheduling, among other  things.", "The guidebook states that all of the solutions were chosen because they  were used successfully at other VA medical centers; can be quickly  implemented; and have a high impact on veterans\u2019 access to care. The  guidebook also notes that flexibility is a key element when choosing  solutions and explains that VA medical centers should select and modify  solutions as needed. The guidebook does not make any of the solutions  mandatory; however, several of the mental health solutions were  introduced to facilities through separate VHA memos and are required.", "VHA updated mental health policies. VHA updated certain mental  health policies to facilitate the implementation of the same-day services  initiative. Specifically, in April 2016 VA issued a memo updating its mental  health policy to require that any veteran new to mental health services  requesting or referred for care in person be seen the same day by a  licensed independent provider to screen for and address immediate care  needs. This was a change from the previous timeframe of 24 hours for  an initial evaluation. The memo also created new processes for VA  medical centers to assess same-day services in mental health care  clinics, including a medical chart review and a one-time review of  standard operating procedures to ensure that the new guidelines are  being followed. VHA also distributed other memos that either sought to  clarify existing guidance or expand same-day services into other areas of  mental health care, such as substance abuse. Additionally, VHA  provided a memo to VA network directors and mental health leads about  scheduling models for mental health care that all VA medical centers  needed to implement for the same-day service initiative.", "VHA provided training on the same-day-services initiative. VHA  provided voluntary training for same-day services some of which  discussed the solutions from the guidebook and the updated mental  health policy. The trainings began in February 2016 for primary care and  in May 2016 for mental health. The trainings consisted of national  telephone calls (often with slide presentations) that any VA medical  center staff member could join, and the presentation materials were  posted to VHA\u2019s internal website. The telephone trainings generally  occurred twice a month in primary care and every week in mental health  care.", "VHA assessed VA medical center same-day service readiness.  Beginning in January 2017, VHA provided technical assistance around  same-day services to VA medical centers. VHA reviewed several aspects  of same-day services, including how VA medical centers were able to  provide same-day services and identified any approaches that may have  needed improvement. Generally, low-performing VA medical centers  received continuous on-site support; moderate performing VA medical  centers received a combination of virtual and on-site support; and, high  performing VA medical centers primarily received virtual support.", "To determine the progress that VA medical centers were making in  providing same-day services, VHA conducted surveys that required  medical center directors to self-certify\u2014and, in some cases, VISN  directors to validate\u2014that their VA medical centers (including affiliated  CBOCs) were able to provide same-day services. In the event that a  VISN director could not validate medical center survey information, VHA  followed up with the medical center and VISN director to create an action  plan to mitigate any issues that were delaying validation. These surveys  were conducted in 2016 and 2017; focused on either primary care, mental  health care or both; and varied in the information collected to determine  how VA medical centers were providing same-day services (See Table 2  for information on the same-day-services readiness assessment surveys  used by VHA).", "According to VHA, all VA medical centers were offering same-day  services in primary and mental health care by December 2016.

For example, in a VHA survey conducted in May 2016,  around the same time as the launch of the same-day service initiative,  142 out of 165 officials (86 percent) that responded to the survey said that  their medical centers offered same-day appointments \u201calways\u201d or \u201cvery  frequently\u201d in primary care for urgent concerns.", "We found that the VA medical centers in our review used a variety of  approaches in providing same-day services in primary and mental health  care, most of which were in existence before the initiative. As noted  earlier, VHA did not require the implementation of any specific solutions in  the guidebook and afforded VA medical centers the flexibility to choose  appropriate local solutions for the same-day service initiative. Many VA  medical centers used this flexibility to continue providing same-day  services as they had prior to the initiative often because that is what their  resources allowed them to do or, in the case of mental health, because it  was built into the foundation of their service line. VHA officials noted that  mental health services\u2014particularly PC-MHI\u2014were built around same- day services so VHA\u2019s guidance was familiar to them. The approaches  used by the selected VA medical centers included using \u201cfloat providers\u201d  who had not already been assigned specific patients to assist those who  requested same-day services; carving out specific appointment times in  the schedule for walk-ins; overbooking appointments in providers\u2019  schedules, and offering walk-in clinics.", "VHA suggested that certain solutions should be prioritized if VA medical  centers were struggling to provide same-day services and, in particular  for mental health, created new requirements around same-day services.  However, officials at selected VA medical centers noted that some of the  suggested solutions in the guidebook\u2014particularly open access\u2014and  requirements in updated mental health policies were difficult to implement  because of longstanding challenges with staffing, space, or competing  VHA policies. For example, VHA\u2019s guidebook suggests the  implementation of open access in primary and mental health care in such  situations. However, officials at four of the six VA medical centers we  visited noted that open access was difficult to implement because of the  long-standing challenges mentioned above. In addition, VHA updated its  mental health policy to include that any veteran new to mental health  services requesting or referred for care in person be seen the same day  by a licensed independent provider to screen for and address immediate  care needs. However, one medical center official noted that they had  designed their mental health clinic processes around registered nurses,  who are responsible for completing the initial assessments of new  patients. The official added that the medical center did not have licensed  independent providers readily available at certain facilities to help  complete the assessments in a timely manner.", "Officials at all six medical centers we visited noted that implementation  was also sometimes challenging as veterans\u2019 expectations shifted with  the same-day-services initiative, with veterans\u2019 expecting more immediate  access to care from physicians for a variety of conditions. For example,  one medical center official noted that veterans are presenting for care and  wanting to see a provider because it is these veterans\u2019 understanding that  they could get care immediately for any condition including chronic, less  urgent issues. Additional officials at the same facility echoed this concern  and noted that they are not certain that this was the policy\u2019s intent.  Another medical center official noted that several medical center officials  asked VHA to change the name \u201csame-day service\u201d because it gives the  impression that veterans would always be able to see their provider  immediately. This official added that there is some confusion for both staff  and veterans about what are same-day services. Additionally, according  to one veterans service organization official that we spoke with, a small  number of veterans reported that the availability of same-day services  varied by facility (VA medical center versus CBOC) and location (urban  versus rural). Another medical center official noted that same-day  services are not sustainable if the definition is immediate care by a  provider for any condition, especially non-urgent issues.", "VHA officials told us that the same-day service initiative was a response  to the 2014 access crisis and they wanted facilities to use the resources  available to them rather than waiting on new policies and strategies. They  stated that their main concern was that veterans\u2019 needs were met, not  necessarily how they were met. As such, VHA officials told us that they  found VA medical centers\u2019 implementation of same-day services  acceptable. The VHA officials added that the guidebook is still the  foundational document for same-day services. VHA officials told us that it  is important for VA medical centers to educate patients on the appropriate  use of same-day services. They added that in fiscal year 2019 they are  (1) developing a more precise definition of same-day services; (2)  developing a website to better explain the purpose of the initiative; and (3)  requiring on-demand trainings to provide a clearer explanation about what  same day services are available and what staff roles and responsibilities  are, among other things. The training is expected to be completed no  later than the first quarter of fiscal year 2020."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Not Documented Objectives or Developed Performance Goals and Related Measures to Assess the Impact of Same- Day Services on Veterans\u2019 Access to Care", "paragraphs": ["VHA is limited in its efforts to assess the impact of same-day services due  to its lack of documented objectives, developed performance goals and  related performance measures. Our previous work has shown the benefit  of fully connected objectives and performance goals with measurable  targets. Objectives state the longer term desired impact or outcome to  be achieved, while performance goals communicate the target the agency  seeks to achieve within a certain timeframe. Performance measures are  indicators of the progress the agency is making towards a goal or target  within a particular time frame.", "VHA officials told us that the overall objectives of same-day services are  to improve veterans\u2019 access to care and customer service while having  minimal impact on medical centers\u2019 existing workflows. However, VHA  has not documented these objectives\u2014for example, in a directive. In  addition, VHA has not developed and documented performance goals  that, with associated performance measures, would facilitate monitoring  of progress towards the desired outcome of the same-day services  initiative. VHA officials stated that the same-day-services initiative was  developed quickly in response to the 2014 access crisis, and noted that at  the time, their focus was \u201cto get something out quickly\u201d instead of taking  time to standardize the initiative around specific policies and procedures,  which could include documenting objectives and developing performance  goals. VHA officials acknowledged that their decision to focus on quickly  implementing the initiative without documenting objectives and  developing performance goals and associated performance measures  makes assessing the impact of the same-day services initiative more  challenging.", "VHA has taken some steps to collect data on same-day services. For  example, VHA officials stated that they primarily rely on two measures to  assess the impact of the same-day services initiative: patient experience  scores and the number of same-day appointments. However, without  performance goals these measures do not provide VHA with a means to  monitor progress and provide limited information on same-day services\u2019  impact.", "Patient experience score: VHA uses the Survey of Healthcare  Experiences for Patients (SHEP) to measure veterans\u2019 perceptions of  their experience at VA medical centers. For same-day services,  VHA monitors responses to two questions. According to VHA officials,  the key measure is based on the survey question that asks \u201cin the last  6 months, when you contacted this provider\u2019s office to get an  appointment for care you needed right away, how often did you get an  appointment as soon as you needed?\u201d While SHEP scores provide  some data related to customer service and access to care, VHA has  not developed performance goals that sets targets for these or other  aspects of the same-day services initiative that would benefit from  monitoring. Such goals would better enable VHA to identify gaps in  performance and plan any needed improvements; ensure balance  between agency priorities, such as customer service and access; and  identify unintended effects, such as disruption to clinic workflows. For  example, officials at one medical center told us that focusing on  customer service creates issues with respect to routine care in that  veterans\u2019 definition of customer service is based on what makes them  happy, while providers are focused on providing the best treatment.  Officials added that these two definitions do not always align. In  addition, officials at another medical center stated that implementing  same-day services impacted their providers\u2019 schedules and the  resulting changes to their processes created chaos.", "Number of same-day appointments: VHA measures the number of  same-day appointments, which, according to a VHA official, are  identified in VHA data as appointments completed on the same day  they are created in VHA\u2019s scheduling system. According to a VHA  training document, VA completed 12 million same-day appointments  in fiscal year 2018. However, without performance goals with clear  targets for same-day appointments, an official from one VISN said she  was unclear how many same-day appointments medical centers  should be scheduling. Additionally, same-day services performance  goals may afford VHA the opportunity to monitor other key  measures\u2014such as those that capture services that do not require an  appointment\u2014which could provide VHA with important information on  the impact of same-day services on access to care. Moreover,  performance goals and additional performance measures may help  prevent unintended consequences, such as an over-emphasis on  same-day appointments as the way to provide same-day services,  which VHA officials stated they are working to curb. For example,  officials at two selected medical centers also noted that measuring the  number or proportion of same-day appointments does not capture all  the ways medical centers provide same-day services. Officials at  two other selected medical centers noted they can meet veterans\u2019  same-day needs through multiple avenues, such as a registered  nurse providing patient education or by renewing a prescription, that  do not require an appointment and therefore, would not be counted in  the number of same-day appointments. VHA officials stated that the  impact of the same-day services on access to care is difficult to  measure and additional measures would help properly measure the  impact.", "VHA\u2019s lack of documented objectives and developed performance goals  and related measures is inconsistent with our prior work on effective  management practices and federal internal control standards.  Specifically, we have previously reported that performance measures  benefit from certain key practices, such as breaking down of broad long-  term objectives into specific near-term performance goals with  measurable targets and time frames, and key attributes, such as balance  to prevent skewed incentives over-emphasizing certain goals.  Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that documentation provides a means to retain organizational  knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few  personnel. Without clearly documented objectives, performance goals,  and related performance measures, VHA is hindered in its efforts to  define success for its same-day service initiative and measure progress  achieving it.", "VHA officials stated they rely on VISN and VA medical center officials to  oversee same-day services; however, we found that without performance  goals and related performance measures, VISNs and VA medical centers  found it challenging to oversee the same-day services initiative.  Specifically, officials at five of the six medical centers and two of the four  VISNs we visited stated that it is difficult to measure same-day services;  which in turn makes assessing the initiative\u2019s impact on veterans\u2019 access  to care difficult. Officials at one medical center explained that the  challenge stems from the fact that that VHA has not defined what  outcome it wants to achieve. In addition, officials at another VA medical  center stated that they have a number of access measures available to  them, but it was unclear to them which measures they should be  prioritizing as part of their oversight of the same-day services initiative.", "Further, absent performance goals, we found that VISNs and medical  centers, which operate in a decentralized environment, varied in their  oversight strategies. For example, one VISN required all medical centers  to complete a self-assessment of their access capacity and sustainability,  and collected information on a number of key open access elements,  including Patient-Aligned Care Team staffing levels and provider panel  sizes, among others. However, oversight by other VISNs was reportedly  less robust. For example, at one VISN, officials stated it is difficult to audit  access broadly and described their oversight of same-day services as  \u201cfairly minimal.\u201d", "At the medical center level, oversight also varied as officials tried to  develop their own oversight solutions. Officials at one medical center we  visited used a feature within the outpatient appointment scheduling  system that allowed them to count the specific services, such as  pharmacy refills, that veterans seeking same-day mental health care had  requested. According to these officials, the tool provided additional data  not found in existing VHA access-related reports and allowed them to  better understand veterans\u2019 demand for specific same-day services and  utilize resources more efficiently. These officials added that they  developed this solution because they had not received guidance from  VHA on how they should measure demand, and they had skilled staff with  the ability to develop their own measures. However, not all VA medical  centers we visited had the skilled staff to develop similar solutions.  Developing performance goals and related performance measures would  better position VHA to obtain useful, comparable information on the  impact of same-day services on access to care across VISNs and  medical centers.", "Moving forward, VHA is planning to conduct a \u201cmystery shopper\u201d  evaluation of same-day services to assess the impact of same-day  services. The mystery shopper evaluation will consist of various scenarios  in which veterans, engaged through a contractor, will attempt to access  same-day care at a variety of clinics in VA medical centers. As described  in a VHA planning document, the evaluation is intended to provide VHA  with information on veterans\u2019 experience in obtaining same-day services  and will attempt to understand variations in how same-day services are  provided. However, VHA officials have not determined if the evaluation  will be ongoing. VHA officials stated that in addition to the mystery  shopper evaluation, they are considering additional measures to better  assess the impact of same-day services beyond their current measures,  such as the number of pharmacy refills completed the same day they  were requested. However, as of May 2019, VHA had not developed  specific performance goals to align these measures to, or set timeframes  for their creation.

However, VHA has not documented  these objectives or developed performance goals and related measures  that provide for monitoring towards the desired outcomes. VHA primarily  relies on veteran satisfaction scores and the number of same-day  appointments to monitor the same-day-services initiative, but these  measures alone do not enable an assessment of the impact of same-day  services on access to care.
