For this review GAO selected six grant programs\u2014three in HHS and three in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Agencies and grant programs were selected in part based on obligation amounts and grant types. GAO reviewed each program's statutes, regulations, guidance, and grant documents, as applicable, and interviewed agency officials.

All the programs reported that they reviewed their grantees' costs for appropriateness. Two of the programs make administrative cost data available online. The programs GAO reviewed track administrative costs in different ways. For some programs administrative and program costs are reported separately, while for others they are included in the same line items. Administrative costs reported to the federal government may understate the actual cost to administer a grant program. GAO found examples of grantees absorbing part of the costs to administer a grant. Some primary grant recipients stated that when such costs were not reimbursed by the federal grant, they would cover those expenses themselves. Another grantee said he relies on state appropriations to cover the majority of administrative costs.", "GAO identified two factors that hinder the comparability of administrative cost data in the programs it reviewed. First, is the existence of cost caps. These caps limit the amount of the grant that may be charged as administrative costs, and thereby affect what is reported to the federal government as administrative costs. For the programs GAO reviewed caps ranged from 5 to 26 percent, with one program having no cap. This variation can make some programs look more administratively expensive than others. Second, differences in what is defined as an administrative cost can present an even greater challenge to comparing costs across programs. Programs have different missions, priorities, services, and clients; as a result definitions of administrative costs vary from program to program. Therefore, different programs may treat similar costs differently. A cost that may be classified as administrative in one program may be considered a direct program delivery cost by another. For example, the salary of an employee who enrolls participants in one Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) program is considered a program cost but an employee who holds a similar position determining the eligibility of participants in another HHS program may be considered an administrative cost depending on the state where it is administered. This variation in definitions means that a program with high administrative costs may not be less efficient than a program with low administrative costs.", "Given these issues, it is challenging to collect comparable information for different grant programs. Any use of information on administrative costs needs to recognize these concerns particularly when comparing programs with different types of objectives, projects, or services. Comparisons of costs may be appropriate when reviewing programs that fulfill similar missions or provide similar services.

Direct costs include,  for example, a researcher\u2019s salary and equipment. Indirect costs  represent a grantee\u2019s general support expenses that cannot be  specifically identified with an individual grant project. Indirect costs  include, for example, building utilities and administrative staff salaries  (see figure 2). To determine the proportion of indirect costs that may be  charged to federally funded awards, grantees use a mechanism called  the indirect cost rate. The procedure for requesting an indirect cost rate  varies based on the type of grantee organization. In the case of higher  educational institutions, the rate is established based on a historical fiscal  year of cost data from a school and is applied to each of its individual  research awards.", "As we have previously reported, there is no government-wide definition of  what constitutes an administrative cost.

For some of these programs, administrative costs and program costs may  be included in the same line items and program officials told us that  separating these costs would be labor intensive. For example, program  officials explained that for the AITR program they do not specifically track  grant administrative costs. Instead, grant program costs are reported as  either direct or indirect costs because recipients are required to use the  Federal Financial Report to report on grant expenditures and that report  captures indirect costs. NIH officials explained that administrative costs  are normally charged as indirect costs but if the administrative services  are integral to a major project and the administrative costs can be  specifically attributed to the project, they may be charged as direct costs  to the grant. Therefore, interpreting indirect costs as administrative  costs could miss administrative costs charged as direct costs to the grant.", "Further complicating this issue, NIH officials explained that primary grant  recipients report their subgrantee\u2019s direct and indirect expenses under the  primary recipient\u2019s total costs on the Federal Financial Report. There is  no requirement to specifically track grant administrative cost data for a  grant\u2019s subgrantee and the current federal financial reporting mechanism  for the AITR grant does not facilitate identifying all administrative costs.  According to NIH officials, identifying administrative costs reported under  the total cost line item would be onerous under the current financial  information collection method since this would entail additional auditing at  both the primary grantee and subgrantee levels. Additionally, consistent  with OMB guidance, indirect cost rates are to be based on historical costs  incurred by an institution and applied to all grants received by that  institution for a set period. While using such a rate may prove efficient for  reporting purposes, these rates are a blunt instrument by which to  determine actual administrative costs for any one grant program.", "For the grant programs we reviewed, financial reporting systems varied in  their ability to aggregate program-wide administrative cost information.  HUD\u2019s Integrated Disbursement & Information System\u2014a nationwide  database that provides HUD with current information on CDBG and  HOME program activities\u2014includes grant administrative cost information.  In contrast, the Head Start program does not currently have a system in  place that allows it to aggregate grant administrative cost information  across grantees. Instead, Head Start grantees report their expenses after  they are incurred on a SF-425 paper form retained at the regional office  level. HHS officials are planning to collect the SF-425 electronically on the  GrantSolutions platform beginning in late 2015 and should be able to  display these data electronically in the Head Start Enterprise System.  According to HHS officials, the new method of data collection and  management should enable Head Start staff to aggregate actual  expenditure data\u2014categorized as programmatic or administrative costs\u2014 for analysis and reporting at the headquarters level, which would  potentially facilitate reporting these costs. This mechanism should  facilitate program-wide aggregation of administrative costs and is a  necessary first step to obtain an overall understanding of a program\u2019s  administrative costs.", "Just as the mechanisms to collect information differ across the grant  programs we reviewed, there is also variation in guidance and training  regarding the reporting of grant administrative costs. The six programs we  reviewed provide some form of written guidance or instruction regarding  the allocation of administrative and program costs. Head Start provides  program-specific resources, written guides, and interactive training  modules on its website\u2014the Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge  Center. The AITR, CCDF, CDBG, and HOME programs also provide  resources and guidance online. Applicable administrative cost  definitions for MHSC are not included in the management handbook for  the grant program. However, officials explained that a list of allowable  administrative costs does exist in the grant\u2019s Notice of Funding  Availability. With regard to training, program officials with Head Start,  CDBG, HOME, and CCDF told us they provide grantees across the  country with training on a wide variety of program-specific and fiscal  management issues. For example, HUD officials explained that they offer  training on identifying allowable administrative costs and that they plan to  provide training in financial management via interactive modules online.", "NIH officials told us they provide written guidance and offer special  training upon request, but NIH does not provide training to all of its  grantees for the AITR grant program. NIH officials said that grantees tend  to hire external consultants to assist them with preparing indirect cost rate  proposals. MHSC officials said that they do not provide centralized  training on administrative costs to grantees, but training is provided by  some field offices that determine a need for such training. In addition to  written guidance on fiscal information, all six of the programs we reviewed  described processes for providing technical support to grantees on  request.", "Grant recipients of all the programs we reviewed told us that since  administrative costs are not always reimbursed by their federal grants  they must cover some administrative expenses themselves. The Urban  Institute made the same point in a survey of nonprofits that receive  government grants. This review found that half of survey respondents  said their government grants and contracts expressly excluded or limited  reimbursements for their program and organizational administrative costs.", "Unreimbursed administrative costs in the programs we reviewed ranged  from costs related to the grant managers who oversaw the grant program  to costs that covered centralized business services such as accounting or  human resources. Functions like these support the administration of the  grant but are not directly related to its aims or purposes. We found  examples of grantees absorbing part of the costs to administer a grant.  An official at a state department of health receiving a CCDF grant  explained that she analyzes administrative costs and when her  organization approaches its federal cost cap she pays these expenses  from the state\u2019s general fund. Another CCDF state grantee told us that he  relies on state appropriations to cover the majority of administrative costs,  and therefore his organization\u2019s federally reported administrative costs  remain well under the cap set by the program. Since state funds were  available to cover a portion of the administrative expenses, he explained  that the organization did not have to claim from the federal government all  the administrative expenses to which they were entitled. To the extent  that only administrative costs charged to the grant are reported, these  reports may understate the actual administrative costs.", "The actual cost to administer a grant may also be affected by whether  oversight responsibilities are extended over long periods, as is required  by some federal grant programs. If a grantee has oversight  responsibilities for an ongoing portfolio of work it may incur greater  administrative costs than a grantee with a shorter-term project with  defined beginning and end dates. For example, primary grant recipients  of the HOME program are required to oversee HOME-funded rental  properties for up to 20 years after construction. According to a HOME  grantee, as the portfolio of properties grows the HOME oversight  requirements cause the grantee\u2019s oversight costs to increase year after  year. However, the HOME grant administrative cost cap does not  increase to cover these increased oversight costs associated with a  grantee\u2019s growing portfolio of properties over time. Because of this, a  HOME grantee told us that as these costs increase over time she will  need to absorb these costs, covering them with resources from both  HOME administrative funds and state funds. In some cases, the grantee  has reviewed HOME grant amounts and actual HOME administrative  costs and chosen to allocate funds to fewer units and to fewer projects  because of the oversight costs that will be incurred over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations in Administrative Cost Caps and Definitions Hinder Meaningful Comparisons of Grant Administrative Cost Data across Programs", "paragraphs": ["Two challenges to comparing administrative costs across grant programs  are the variation in cost caps and differences in administrative cost  definitions. These two issues are different, but they intersect. The  variation in administrative cost caps\u2014the limit to the amount of the grant  that may be charged as administrative costs to the federal government\u2014 presents challenges to comparing costs across programs. Of the six grant  programs we reviewed, administrative cost caps ranged from 5 percent  for CCDF to a 26 percent administrative cost cap for education institutions  receiving AITR grants. The Multifamily Housing Service Coordinators  grant program has no cap. As a result of this variation, the  administrative costs of some programs may appear more expensive than  others. For example, CDBG\u2019s 20 percent cost cap could result in higher  administrative charges to the grant than the CCDF\u2019s 5 percent cost cap.  According to HUD data, CDBG administrative and planning expenses in  fiscal year 2012 were approximately 16 percent and, according to HHS  data, CCDF administrative expenses in fiscal year 2012 were  approximately 3 percent.

Programs have different missions, priorities, services,  and clients, and jurisdiction for the programs are often spread among  numerous congressional committees; federal agencies\u2019 definitions of  allowable (or prohibited) administrative costs vary from program to  program. Additionally, the definition of administrative costs varies across  different federal grant programs even though many of the same activities  are performed. For example, the salary of an enrollment specialist at  Head Start, who enrolls children in the program, is considered a program- related cost. However, the salary of similar position as an intake specialist  for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, who determines  the eligibility and benefit level for participants, may be an administrative  cost in some states where the program is administered. When the same  expenses are treated differently across programs, this results in different  administrative cost totals for similar functions. Regardless of the reasons  for variation in definitions of these costs, the existence of differences in  definitions limits their comparability. Monitoring programs entails  collection and use of program-related operational and financial data, but  for information to be effective for decision making, it has to be pertinent to  the individual program. OMB staff we spoke with stated that collecting  grant administrative cost information government-wide would not identify  whether funds for administrative costs are being spent effectively.  Specifically, they told us that analysis of administrative costs and the  identification of potential administrative cost savings should occur at the  program level. They said that when comparing administrative costs  across programs it is important to remember that some programs are  inherently more expensive to administer than others.", "Comparing unlike costs across different programs would lead to  erroneous comparisons.

Additionally, the  actual cost of administering a given program may be paid by sources  other than the federal government and the current collection of grant  administrative cost data only reflects the federally reimbursed portion of  these costs. Efficient and effective use of federal grant funds has always  been important, but attention to the balance between program costs and  administrative costs grows as budgets come under increasing pressures  and the resources available for achieving federal grants\u2019 goals become  further constrained. Although looking at administrative costs may seem  like a logical first step when identifying opportunities to reduce expenses  in such a budgetary environment, our review identified a number of  factors that hinder the comparability of administrative costs across grant  programs.

Although the results of our review  are not generalizable to other grant programs in other agencies, they are  indicative of the wide variation associated with the mechanisms and  guidance for tracking grant administrative costs and the utility of these  costs for program management.", "We conducted a literature review to identify issues raised, including those  in our previous reports as well as the Congressional Research Service  and the Congressional Budget Office, related to grant administrative  costs, grants management, and cost principles. Additionally, we reviewed  research reports from research groups and state representative  organizations that discuss grant administrative costs from the perspective  of grantees. We reviewed relevant HHS and HUD websites and related  agency documents to understand grant administrative costs guidance for  selected grant programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2014 to December  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
