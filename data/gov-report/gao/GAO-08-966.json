However, staffing and training challenges remain for DOD. DOD has increased the number of personnel in Iraq assigned to provide oversight for DOD's PSCs but has not developed plans or a strategy to sustain this increase. An Army-commissioned report has specifically raised concerns about the lack of personnel available to provide sufficient contracting support to either expeditionary or peacetime missions. In the short term, DOD has increased the number of oversight personnel in Iraq by shifting existing oversight personnel from other locations into Iraq. However, without developing and implementing a strategy for providing and sustaining an increased number of personnel dedicated to oversight of PSCs, it is not clear whether DOD can sustain this increase because of the limited number of oversight personnel in the workforce. Moreover, while DOD has provided some training on PSCs for units deploying, the training has not been updated to reflect the changes made by DOD since September 2007 to increase oversight. As a result, military units may be unaware of their expanded oversight and investigative responsibilities. The State Department has implemented 11 of 18 actions recommended in October 2007 by a panel tasked by the Secretary of State with reviewing that agency's use of private security contractors in Iraq. For example, the State Department has increased the number of diplomatic security personnel stationed in Iraq to provide oversight of contractor activities and has requested and received funding to hire and train 100 additional agents to replace those who were transferred from other State Department programs in the United States to Iraq. According to State Department officials, the additional personnel will help sustain the increased number of agents in Iraq. In addition, as of June 2008, the State Department has equipped 140 of its security vehicles with video recording equipment and plans to equip an additional 93 vehicles. Coordination among DOD, the State Department, and the government of Iraq has significantly improved since September 2007. The State Department coordinates its PSC movements with DOD through liaison officers, and by providing a daily briefing to Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I) on upcoming PSC activities. MNF-I 's Armed Contractor Oversight Division facilitates coordination for PSC matters among DOD, State Department, the government of Iraq, and the PSC community. Further, DOD and the State Department signed a memorandum of agreement detailing coordination activities to be undertaken. Various laws hold PSC employees accountable for their actions in Iraq, including U.S. criminal laws that may be applied extraterritorially, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The applicability of these laws depends on the circumstances--e.g., the nature and location of the alleged crime and the nationality of the accused--of any specific incident. The legal framework for holding PSCs accountable also includes Iraqi and international law and contract provisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since military operations began in Iraq in 2003, the United States  government has relied extensively upon the services of private security  contractors (PSC). For the Department of Defense (DOD) these services  include providing security for senior military officials such as the  Commanding General of the Multi-National Force-Iraq and for personnel  from the Army Corps of Engineers, protecting military facilities, and  protecting more than 19,000 supply convoys traveling throughout Iraq.  For the Department of State, PSCs provide security for the ambassador,  other U.S. government officials working in Iraq as well as visiting Members  of Congress and visiting officials of the executive branch. PSCs also  provide site security of the embassy and other State Department facilities  in Iraq. The number of PSCs in Iraq is also substantial. DOD and the  Department of State estimate that about 11,000 private security employees  (9,952 with DOD, 1,400 with the State Department) are working in Iraq  under direct contracts with the U.S. government. DOD has estimated that  it would need to create nine new Army brigades to replace the current  number of PSC employees working in Iraq.", "Because of incidents involving PSCs in Iraq, concern regarding the level of  oversight and the legal accountability over these firms and their employees  has increased. Incidents occurring between PSCs and Iraqis and between  PSCs and U.S. forces have been reported since 2004. In July 2005, we  issued a report that examined how the U.S. government and  reconstruction contractors used PSCs. In that report we made a number  of recommendations including one addressed to DOD to develop a training  package for military units deploying to Iraq that included information on  (1) the role of PSCs in Iraq, (2) typical PSC operating procedures, (3)  guidance related to PSCs, and (4) the military\u2019s responsibilities to PSCs. In  2006, we testified that coordination between the U.S. military and the PSCs  needed improvement and that further action needed to be taken by DOD  to implement the pre-deployment training recommendation from 2005.  According to the report of the Secretary of State\u2019s Panel on Personal  Protective Services in Iraq, on September 16, 2007, an incident involving a  PSC firm working for the Department of State resulted in the deaths of 17  Iraqi civilians in Baghdad. In the wake of this incident, which U.S.  government officials describe as a watershed event, both DOD and the  State Department began to examine their efforts to provide oversight,  improve coordination between DOD, the State Department and the  government of Iraq, and enhance accountability for the PSCs they employ  in Iraq.", "Because of continuing congressional interest in the use of PSCs in Iraq, we  began in August 2007, under the authority of the Comptroller General to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative, a review to update our work on  the U.S. government\u2019s use of PSC. This report examines the extent to  which DOD and the Department of State have strengthened (1) oversight  and (2) coordination of private security contractors in Iraq. In addition, we  are providing information on the legal framework in place to hold private  security contractor employees legally accountable for their actions in Iraq.  Later this year, we plan to issue a report on other PSC issues related to  selection, training, and weapons accountability as well as DOD\u2019s  implementation of provisions of Section 862 of the 2008 National Defense  Authorization Act which requires DOD to prescribe regulations for the use  of private security contractors in contingency operations.", "To assess the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to improve oversight and  coordination of PSCs it employs in Iraq, we reviewed recent DOD, United  States Central Command (CENTCOM), Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I),  and State Department policies and guidance addressing the requirements,  procedures, and responsibilities for the oversight and coordination of  PSCs. These documents include new MNF-I PSC guidance and policies on  incident reporting, investigation requirements, coordination, and contract  oversight. In addition, we reviewed the memorandum of agreement  between DOD and the State Department on PSCs working for the U.S.  government in Iraq. We reviewed these policies to determine the U.S.  government\u2019s authority and responsibility for the oversight and  coordination of PSCs in Iraq that have contracts with the U.S. government.  In February 2008, we traveled to Iraq to examine what, if any,  improvements had been made after the Nisour Square incident. In Iraq we  met with officials from DOD, including officials from MNF-I, the Joint  Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A), and the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA), as well as officials from the State  Department, including officials from the U.S. Embassy-Baghdad and its  Regional Security Office, to discuss issues related to oversight,  coordination, and accountability over PSCs in Iraq. While in Iraq, we  observed operations at DOD\u2019s Contractor Operations Cell and at the State  Department\u2019s Tactical Operations Center, witnessing the planning,  oversight and coordination, and tracking of PSC movements throughout  Iraq. We also met with the Executive Secretary of the Secretary of State\u2019s  panel established to review the State Department\u2019s security practices in  Iraq. We also interviewed officials from ten selected private security firms  who currently provide or have recently provided private security functions  in Iraq, as well as representatives from an Iraq-based private security  association.", "To describe the legal framework in place to hold PSC employees  accountable we reviewed various laws including the Uniform Code of  Military Justice and the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. We also  interviewed officials from DOD\u2019s Office of the General Counsel, the State  Department\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser and from the Department of  Justice to gain an understanding of the process used to hold PSCs  accountable. Moreover, we also reviewed applicable U.S. government PSC  contract clauses that outline and regulate contractor behavior.", "Our work focused on PSCs who have a direct contractual relationship with  the United States government and we did not assess the use of PSCs by  reconstruction contractors, non-governmental organizations or other  coalition nations. We reviewed processes used to provide oversight and  coordination over PSCs in Iraq but did not evaluate how effectively they  were being implemented because the processes reviewed are new. We also  did not evaluate how laws were being used to hold contractors  accountable. Appendix I contains a more detailed presentation of our  scope and methodology. We conducted this performance audit from  February 2008 to June 2008, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

In November 2007,  MNF-I, established a new organization, the Armed Contractor Oversight  Division, to serve as MNF-I\u2019s overall point of contact for policy issues  relating to PSCs hired by DOD as well as to provide broad oversight over  these contractors. According to MNF-I officials, the office\u2019s goals include  (1) working to reduce the number of incidents of PSCs discharging  weapons or behaving in a manner that undermines the credibility of U.S.  efforts; (2) developing a mechanism for holding PSCs accountable for their  actions; (3) reducing the time that elapses between the occurrence of an  incident and the reporting of that incident; and (4) minimizing the impact  of an incident on the credibility of U.S. efforts in Iraq.

These incidents include  those involving injuries; deaths; negative reports in the media; weapons  discharges; complaints from U.S. military commanders, local Iraqi citizens  or the government of Iraq; and other allegations of PSC misconduct. PSCs  are required to report these incidents in writing to the MNC-I CONOC. The  office then reviews each incident report to determine whether the incident  requires additional investigation. After an investigation is completed by  the appropriate unit commander, the Armed Contractor Oversight Division  tracks corrective or disciplinary actions initiated by the commander or the  PSC. The Armed Contractor Oversight Division also conducts a trend  analysis of incident reporting data. According to officials, since the office  began oversight over PSCs in October 2007, weapons discharges by PSCs  have decreased approximately 60 percent.

As such, contracting officers as well as military commanders  rotating into Iraq may not have been aware of all of the regulations  covering PSCs. In December 2007, MNF-I issued Fragmentary Order 07- 428, to consolidate the previous fragmentary orders and establish  authorities, responsibilities and coordination requirements for MNC-I to  provide oversight for all armed DOD contractors and civilians in Iraq  including PSCs. The establishment of the consolidating fragmentary order  creates a single source for CENTCOM mandated orders, regulations and  mandatory contract clauses relating to requirements, procedures, and  responsibilities for control, coordination, management, and oversight of  PSCs in Iraq. Specifically, the order addresses PSC requirements including  arming procedures and responsibilities, rules for the use of force and  mandates strengthened serious incident reporting procedures and  responsibilities. For example, under the new order when a PSC observes,  suspects, or participates in a serious incident such as a weapons  discharge, PSCs are required to submit an immediate incident report at the  earliest opportunity via the most secure means available to MNC-I and  then submit an initial written report of the incident not later than 4 hours  after the incident in contrast to the previous 48 hour reporting  requirement. The order requires the initial report to contain a highlighted  version of the incident, including critical information such as who was  involved and when and where the incident occurred. PSCs are required to  file a final report with 96 hours of the incident.", "Additionally, the fragmentary order increases the oversight responsibilities  for military units by requiring the military to investigate serious incidents  involving a DOD PSC. Previous orders only directed the military to  investigate incidents related to contractors firing weapons. According to  the December 2007 order, the military unit that receives the contracted  security services is required to conduct a preliminary inquiry if contractors  are involved in a serious incident. The order also stipulates that at a  minimum, a commander\u2019s inquiry will be conducted and documented.  Previously, there was no requirement that commanders\u2019 investigations be  documented. Incidents that involve death, serious injury, or property  damage in excess of $10,000 must be investigated by the appropriate level  commander. Previous investigative requirements did not include this  requirement. The order directs commanders to involve criminal  investigative authorities if the preliminary investigations suggest either  criminal misconduct, a violation of the rules for the use of force, or an  inappropriate graduated force response. Finally, the order requires that  any military unit observing or becoming aware of a serious incident  provide an investigative report to the unit\u2019s operational chain of command  and to include photographs and names if possible. In reviewing  investigative reports to determine whether PSC misconduct was involved,  commanders are to use the same standards as they would for their own  units\u2019 actions. Investigations or inquiries completed by the military are  forwarded to the Armed Contractor Oversight Division and the MNC-I  Staff Judge Advocate for review. Moreover, according to an Armed  Contractor Oversight Division official, if a military investigation is deemed  to have been inadequate, MNF-I or MNC-I can direct another investigation.  Prior to the establishment of the Armed Contractor Oversight Division  there was no MNF-I level review of incident reports.", "The fragmentary order also requires that PSCs report all weapons  discharges on a monthly basis to the contracting officer\u2019s representative or  sponsoring activity. The monthly report, which includes information on  the type of discharge, is to be annotated to include information on the type  and status of the investigation and who conducted it. In addition, if an  action such as a fine or termination was taken against a contractor  employee, this information also is to be included in the report. The reports  are provided to the MNC-I office responsible for authorizing individual  contractor employees to carry weapons and may be considered when  MNC-I determines whether an individual will be allowed to carry a  weapon. The monthly reports are also provided to the Armed Contractor  Oversight Division, which analyzes the data for trends. Previous guidance  did not require the monthly weapons discharge report.", "The fragmentary order also addresses the contracting officer  representative\u2019s (COR) critical role in contract support and provides  information to properly designate, train, and support the COR in  government oversight and administration of security contracts. A DOD  guidance memo assigning contract administration functions lists oversight  over a contractor\u2019s compliance with CENTCOM policies and directives  among contract administration responsibilities. The order states that  organizations supported by security services shall insure a COR is  nominated to perform contract oversight. The order further states that  contracting officers are responsible for monitoring PSC performance and  ensuring PSC compliance with contractual requirements. According to the  order, contracting officer representatives should be selected at a rank  commensurate with the contract\u2019s oversight responsibilities and that  contract oversight should be their primary function. The contracting  officer\u2019s representative should also be at a location to allow sufficient  direct oversight of contractor operations. Prior to the fragmentary order  there was not a comprehensive document describing these responsibilities  and how they relate to providing oversight over PSCs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Increased the Number of Personnel Devoted to Contract Management and Oversight, but It Is Unclear Whether the Increase Can Be Sustained", "paragraphs": ["DOD contract oversight efforts in Iraq have also been strengthened  through actions taken by the Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition  Technology and Logistics and the Defense Contract Management Agency  (DCMA). However the Department may be challenged to continue to  provide the increased number of personnel needed to sustain the  additional oversight. In October 2007, the Undersecretary issued  memoranda giving JCC-I/A new authorities and responsibilities for PSCs  contracting in Iraq. Specifically, JCC-I/A is responsible for all contract  administration for DOD\u2019s security contracts in Iraq. In Iraq, JCC-I/A has  delegated to DCMA the responsibility to provide contract administration  over private security contracts. This newly delegated authority enables  DCMA, with its presence in Iraq, to implement a systematic approach  toward oversight of PSCs contracts. DCMA officials told us that this  approach, which did not exist prior to DCMA receiving this authority,  includes developing a quality assurance framework, a key component of  which is the agency\u2019s development of a series of quality assurance  checklists for PSCs. DCMA officials stated that the checklists have been  developed by incorporating requirements from the statements of work in  PSC contracts and current MNF-I guidance and fragmentary orders and  translating these requirements into objective measurable standards  intended to enable the agency to conduct regular and unbiased inspections  of contracting personnel, known as surveillance audits. According to  DCMA officials, these checklists are intended to ensure that PSCs are  meeting contract requirements and that DOD is providing appropriate  oversight over the contracts. The checklists translate security contract  requirements into an audit document. According to DCMA officials, the  agency coordinates with the Armed Contractor Oversight Division to  ensure that the checklists reflect current MNF-I guidance and fragmentary  orders related to PSCs.", "To assist in its greater role in Iraq to provide contract award,  administration and oversight, JCC-I/A plans to add additional personnel in  Iraq while DCMA has increased its number of oversight personnel in Iraq  and hopes to add additional personnel. DCMA has approximately doubled  the number of oversight personnel in the CENTCOM area of responsibility  by shifting personnel from other areas. Of the personnel in theater in  March 2008, somewhat more than half were deployed to Iraq to provide  greater oversight of contracts in Iraq including private security contracts.  Furthermore, DCMA plans to increase the number of staff deployed to the  theater to 348 by the end of 2008. While the contracting command and  DCMA both hope to be able to increase the number of personnel available  in Iraq to provide additional oversight of DOD\u2019s PSC contracts, our current  and past work suggests that the agencies may not be able to fill all of the  positions or sustain this increase. For example, during our visit to Iraq  officials from JCC-I/A stated that while they had a joint manning document  that authorizes 39 additional staff, the positions would not be immediately  filled and thus they continued to work with the individual services to fill  the positions. As of June 2008, JCC-I/A officials reported that 32 of the 39  positions listed in the joint manning document had been created and  should be filled by the services soon. DCMA also developed a joint  manning document and is asking the services to provide the additional  oversight and management personnel needed in part because DCMA lacks  the personnel to meet the additional requirements. During our visit to Iraq,  DCMA officials expressed concerns about maintaining the increase in the  number of oversight personnel in Iraq over the long-term. In 2007 the  report of the Commission on Army Acquisition and Program Management  in Expeditionary Operations stated that the Army lacks the leadership and  military and civilian personnel to provide sufficient contracting support to  either expeditionary or peacetime missions. According to the  commission, Army contracting personnel experienced a 600 percent  increase in their workload and are performing increasingly complex tasks,  but the number of Army civilians and military in the contracting workforce  has either remained static or declined because of congressional direction  to DOD and the Army to make significant cuts in the acquisition  workforce. According to a May 2008 Congressional Research Service  report, the earlier reductions in the contracting workforce reflected  Congress\u2019 view that the workforce had not been reduced enough in  proportion with the overall defense budget, particularly the acquisition  portion of the defense budget. However, concomitant to the workforce  reduction was the department\u2019s decision to increase its reliance on  contractors to provide services previously provided by DOD civilians or  service members. As a result, the actual workload of contracting personnel  (the people charged with writing, negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing  performance of the contracts) was substantially increasing in complexity  and volume. Furthermore, in a June 2008 report to Congress, the Air Force  commented that in the current conflict it was strained to cover its own  contracting requirements and provide 67 percent of the contracting  personnel to support joint contracting requirements. These comments cast  doubt on the Air Force\u2019s ability as well as the Army\u2019s ability to fully  support either JCC-I/A or DCMA. As we noted in our January 2008  testimony, without adequate contract oversight personnel in place to  monitor DOD\u2019s many contracts in deployed locations such as Iraq, DOD  may not be able to reasonably assure that contractors are meeting their  contract requirements efficiently and effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Units Continue to Deploy to Iraq without Training on Increased PSC Oversight Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["In July 2005, we reported that units deploying to Iraq received no training  on working with PSCs and were unclear as to their responsibilities  towards PSCs. At that time we recommended that DOD establish and  incorporate a training program into the mission-rehearsal exercises and  predeployment training for units deploying to Iraq. In response to the  recommendation, DOD has incorporated training on PSCs into various  predeployment training programs and exercises. For example, the Joint  Forces Command has developed training on the role of PSCs in the  battlespace for senior military staff in Iraq. The Army has a pilot program  to incorporate PSC scenarios into its Battle Command Training Program,  which trains Corps, division and brigade staff. The Army and the Marine  Corps also incorporated scenarios on the rules of engagement and  escalation of force involving PSCs into unit predeployment training.  Additionally, according to DOD officials, PSC scenarios have been  incorporated into two recent training exercises for senior staff. However,  this training does not include all of the topics we recommended in 2005  such as information on PSC standard operating procedures nor does it  reflect the increased PSC oversight responsibilities and organizational  structures established since the September 2007 incident, such as training  on the role of the Armed Contractor Oversight Division. When we made  our recommendation, DOD\u2019s use of PSCs was limited to a few contracts  that provided support to the Army Corps of Engineers and to static  security for work areas within military installations. Since then DOD\u2019s use  of PSCs has increased significantly and military units at all levels have  been given more oversight responsibility for PSCs as well as more  responsibilities for coordination as we discuss below.

Appendix II provides  additional information on all of the panel\u2019s recommendations, their  implementation status, and our comments on the implementation status.", "When we met with State Department officials at the U.S. Embassy in  Baghdad, officials told us that the department had made progress in  implementing some of these recommendations. For example, one of the  panel\u2019s principal recommendations was to increase the number of  Diplomatic Security Special Agents in Iraq in order to expand oversight of  the department\u2019s PSCs. State Department officials told us that the agency  is increasing the number of agents in Iraq from 36 to 81 permanent and 7  temporary duty personnel to provide additional oversight of the  department\u2019s PSCs, such as accompanying the PSC contractors on each  personal protection mission. According to the State Department, these  positions are expected to be filled by September 2008. The State  Department has acknowledged that it does not have sufficient numbers of  diplomatic security agents to meet the agency\u2019s security requirements and  as a result relies on and will continue to rely on private security  contractors to provide additional capacity. According to the State  Department, in order to provide enough Diplomatic Security Special  Agents in Iraq, the department had to move agents from other programs,  and those moves have negatively affected the agency\u2019s ability to perform  other missions including providing security for visiting dignitaries and  visa, passport, and identity fraud investigations. For example, the official  stated that the agency had to borrow personnel from another federal law  enforcement agency in order to provide security at the Middle East Peace  Summit held in Annapolis, Maryland. According to the State Department,  100 new agents are needed in order to sustain this increase and will  continue to be needed after the hostilities in Iraq are over. The State  Department received funding for the new agents in the 2008 supplemental  appropriations act signed by the President of the United States on June 30,  2008, which covers the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2008 and all of fiscal year  2009. According to the State Department, these positions will be included  in the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget request.", "Similar to DOD, the State Department has developed directives to  consolidate and establish the agency\u2019s rules, regulations, and policies for  PSCs in Iraq. As of May 2008, the State Department has issued four  directives that provide guidance similar to the fragmentary order issued by  MNF-I. The purpose of these policy directives is to provide PSCs with  rules, regulations, and requirements for operating in Iraq. The topics  covered in these directives cover rules for the use of force, escalation of  force, serious incident reporting, and investigating as well as coordination  with DOD. According to State Department officials, these directives  consolidate previously issued guidance and ensure that all of the State  Department\u2019s PSCs are aware of current department policies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordination, Including Interagency Coordination, Related to PSCs in Iraq Has Improved", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the State Department have improved coordination related to  PSCs in Iraq.

According to State Department officials, much of the prior  coordination with MNF-I was ad hoc in part because MNF-I lacked a focal  point to coordinate with. During our visit to Iraq, DOD and State  Department officials told us that since the incident, both agencies have  implemented several measures to improve communication and  coordination between the two agencies. For example, the State  Department has a liaison officer stationed at MNC-I\u2019s operations cell, and  MNC-I continues to maintain a liaison officer in the RSO\u2019s operations  center. In addition, representatives from the State Department participate  in daily MNF-I briefings to coordinate with MNF-I regarding planned State  Department personnel movements. Additionally, the agencies have  increased their coordination on the reporting and investigation of serious  incidents involving PSCs. For example, the State Department\u2019s Tactical  Operations Center coordinates with and reports all serious incidents  involving its PSCs to the Armed Contractor Oversight Division. Moreover,  State Department officials in Iraq stated that they are now sharing  additional information and have enhanced coordination on PSC  movements with DOD, requesting route intelligence from DOD, and  providing DOD feedback on route security. While the State Department  provided MNF-I with route information and scheduled personnel  movements prior to the Nisour Square incident, MNF-I did not know that  the information was being provided by the State Department. The State  Department uses a data tracking system to provide DOD tactical units with  situational awareness of State Department PSC movements. According to  DOD and State Department officials, these improvements were driven in  part by recommendations made by the State Department panel reviewing  PSC operations and by the signing of a memorandum of agreement  between the two agencies stating that they agree to work together on PSC  matters in Iraq.", "Additionally, the director of the Armed Contractor Oversight Division  coordinates with the State Department by co-chairing an incident review  board with the Regional Security Officer. This board meets quarterly to  examine incidents involving U.S. government PSCs in order to identify  trends and make recommendations to improve U.S. Government oversight  of PSCs in Iraq. The board also identifies best practices and communicates  these practices with PSCs. Furthermore, Armed Contractor Oversight  Division officials told us that the office has increased its coordination  efforts with the government of Iraq. For example, the division and the  State Department\u2019s Regional Security Officer regularly meet with the  Ministry of the Interior to coordinate on managing PSCs, and listen to  concerns, resolve issues, and generate joint solutions.

As directed  by the fragmentary order, MNC-I has established six Contractor  Operations Cells to assume the responsibility to provide battlefield  coordination, previously handled by the Reconstruction Operations  Center, control of PSC movement throughout Iraq, and facilitate the  expedient reporting of incidents involving PSCs. The central Contractor  Operations Cell is located at MNC-I headquarters at Camp Victory, while  the others are located at the tactical operations centers of each of the five  divisions that control the corresponding battle space in Iraq. According to  MNF-I and MNC-I officials, the Contractor Operations Cells provide a  better mechanism for coordination than did the Reconstruction  Operations Center, for several reasons. First, as we noted above, the  Contractor Operations Cells are co-located with the tactical units  responsible for the battle space, making coordination easier. Second,  commanders have improved situational awareness because information  related to PSCs is now viewed in context with other battle space activities.  For example, the State Department provides the Contractor Operations  Cells with U.S. Embassy PSC movement information that can be tracked  by battlefield commanders using the same system as is used to track  military vehicles. This movement information was never provided to the  Reconstruction Operations Center when it was responsible for tracking  DOD\u2019s PSC movements. Third, battle space commanders now control the  movement of DOD PSCs in Iraq. According to the MNF-I order establishing  the Contractor Operations Cells, the tactical unit responsible for the battle  space must approve or deny the movement request submitted by DOD  PSCs. Previously, the battlespace commanders may have been made  aware of the PSCs\u2019 planned movements, but they were not required to  approve the movement. Additionally, MNF-I developed common standards  for communications between PSCs and government personnel. MNF-I  secured funding from U.S. Army Central Command for radios and satellite  phones for all DOD PSCs in Iraq in order to standardize communication  standards between PSCs and government personnel. Additionally, the  Defense Contract Management Agency is currently modifying all PSC  contracts in Iraq to incorporate these common standards, and the PSCs  will be acquiring standardized radios and satellite phones as contractor  furnished equipment in order to meet these new requirements.

We met with them to gain an understanding of the delegated  responsibility and oversight structure of PSCs in Iraq, procedures for the  coordination and communication between MNF-I and US Embassy  Baghdad for the movement of PSCs within the MNF-I battle space,  procedures for reporting and investigation in the event that a serious  incident occurs as well as applicable laws to hold PSCs operating in Iraq  accountable for their actions. While in Iraq, we toured DOD\u2019s Contracting  Operations Cell and the State Department\u2019s Tactical Operations Center,  witnessing the planning, oversight and coordination, and tracking of PSC  movements throughout Iraq. Additionally, in Iraq, we met with officials  from private security firms to gain an industry perspective.", "We scoped our work to include only on PSCs that have a direct  contractual relationship with the U.S. government. As such, our work  excluded PSCs with an indirect relationship with the U.S. government,  such as those contracted by reconstruction firms. We reviewed processes  but did not evaluate how effectively they were being implemented because  the processes reviewed are new. We also did not evaluate how laws were  being used to hold contractors accountable. We conducted this  performance audit from February 2008 to April 2008, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on audit objectives.

In July 2008, officials provided information on  the status of the implementation of the recommendations noting that 16  were completed and that others were dependent on other agencies or  governments. This appendix provides additional information on all of the  panel\u2019s recommendations, their implementation status, and our  assessment of the implementation status. In certain instances our  assessment differed from the State Department\u2019s. For example, the panel  recommended that the Regional Security Office should be provided video  and audio recording equipment for each security vehicle operating in Iraq.  According to the State Department, they have fully implemented this  recommendation by installing video recording systems into 140 vehicles  and installing a radio recording system in the Regional Security Officer\u2019s  Tactical Operations Center to record all Embassy radio transmissions.  However, according to State Department officials the goal is to install the  equipment into 233 vehicles by December 2008. Therefore, it is our  assessment that implementation of the recommendation is still in  progress. Similarly, the panel also recommended that a working group  should be established to determine ways to move the Iraqi licensing  process forward more transparently. The State Department stated that in  its view this recommendation has been completed because it established  the working group and that it was not necessary to have improved the  licensing process to consider the recommendation implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the State Department\u2019s letter dated  July 24, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The State Department commented that it had completed more than  half of the 18 recommendations made by the Secretary of State\u2019s panel.  The department noted that three of the recommendations were  dependent on other agencies or governments and the remaining  recommendations would be completed by December 2008. In appendix  II of the report, we note the State Department\u2019s assessment on the  status of implementation for each of the panel\u2019s 18 recommendations.  This information is presented verbatim from information provided by  the State Department. We also added an acknowledgement in the  report that the State Department has implemented 11 of the 18  recommendations made by the panel.  2.  We revised the report to attribute the number of Iraqi civilian deaths  caused by the September 16, 2007, incident to the report of the  Secretary of State\u2019s Panel on Personal Protective Services in Iraq.  3.  We revised the report to include \u201cnature of the contractor\u2019s  employment\u201d among the factors that could affect whether a particular  law provides extraterritorial jurisdiction in a specific case.   4.  While DOD and the State Department have improved communication  and coordination related to PSCs in Iraq, we have no basis to state that  these improvements are significant.  5.  The report was revised to accept the suggested change.  6.", "We are unclear how the language in footnote 28 is misleading or  suggests a loophole in 18 U.S.C. 7(9).  We did change the language as  suggested by the State Department to clearly state that  \"the statute  essentially exempts people who are already subject to MEJA (in other  words, giving preference to MEJA as the source of jurisdiction).\"  7.  The State Department misinterpreted our conclusions. Our statement  that the improvements made by DOD and the State Department may  reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, incidents is intended to  demonstrate that regardless of the level of oversight provided, in  places with tenuous security situations such as Iraq,  incidents  involving PSCs may still occur. As we noted in our conclusions, a  strengthened framework of PSC oversight and coordination in Iraq will  enable the U.S. government to be better prepared to respond  effectively when incidents do occur.  8.  While we incorporated the requested updated information into the  status of implementation column of recommendation 1, we disagree  that the State Department has completed implementation of the  recommendation. The State Department noted that the department\u2019s  Office of the Legal Advisor was actively engaged in this manner  through an interagency working group led by the Department of  Justice. However, the effort to establish a clear legal basis for holding  contractors accountable under U.S. law is still ongoing. Therefore, we  assert that this recommendation has not been implemented.   9.  The State Department commented that it disagreed with our assertion  that the status of implementation of recommendation 2 should be cited  as in progress. In its comments the department noted that the  recommendation was worded not to require that the State Department  create or negotiate a new regulatory framework, but to merely  \u201ccommence discussions\u201d with the Government of Iraq on this subject.  While negotiations with the Government of Iraq are ongoing on a  Status of Force Agreement and a Strategic Framework Agreement, it is  our assertion that implementation will be complete when an  agreement is reached.   10. Based on additional information provided to by the State Department  we have changed our assessment of the status of this implementation  to \u201cGAO agrees with the State Department\u2019s assessment.\u201d   11. While we have incorporated the requested updated information into  the status of implementation column of recommendation 5, we  disagree that the State Department has completed the implementation  of this recommendation. We assert that fully implementing the  recommendation means that the additional personnel should be  recruited, trained, and deployed to Iraq, a process that has not  happened yet. Therefore, we believe that implementation of the  recommendation is still in progress.  12. The State Department requested that we incorporate updated  information into the status of implementation column of  recommendation 9. While we updated the column, we disagree that the  State Department has completed the implementation of this  recommendation because not all of the department\u2019s vehicles have  been outfitted with the video recording systems as recommended by  the panel. According to the State Department, to date the equipment  has been installed in 140 of the 233 vehicles it intends to place this  equipment in. The State Department noted that it expects this process  to be completed by December 2008. As such our assessment of the  status of implementation is that implementation is ongoing.   13. While we have incorporated the requested updated information into  the status of implementation column of recommendation 10, we  disagree that the State Department has completed the implementation  of this recommendation.  As noted in appendix II, the panel  recommended that the State Department place a readable number on  the right rear door of each vehicle utilized, to enable anyone wishing to  question its mode of operation to identify the unit to the Regional  Security Office. The systems and measures being implemented by the  State Department may assist the monitoring of these vehicles by U.S.  government officials. However, these systems do not enable any  person, such as an Iraqi citizen standing on a street corner, to identify  the unit to the Regional Security Office.     14. We incorporated the requested updated information into the status of  implementation column for recommendation 11. Based on this  additional information we now agree with the State Department that  the recommendation has been implemented.   15. We incorporated the requested updated information into the status of  implementation column for recommendation 15.  16. While we incorporated the requested updated information into the  status of implementation column of recommendation 16, we stand by  our initial assertion that the recommendation is ongoing and therefore  not complete. According to information provided by the State  Department, officials from the department have had numerous  conversations with officials from the government of Iraq regarding the  licensing and registration of PSCs in Iraq and had established a  working group. However, officials were unable to provide a written  account for these discussions when asked and stated that it considered  the recommendation completed because the intent of the  recommendation was to start holding talks and not to have necessarily  improved the licensing process."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
