GAO found that IRS, ITA, and USTR internally discussed and planned for anticipated operational changes in the event of a prolonged FY 2019 shutdown.

Three of our four selected agency components\u2014CBP, ITA, and  USTR\u2014operated under an agency-wide plan. Therefore, we evaluated  the fiscal year 2019 contingency plans for Commerce, DHS, and EOP.  Because Treasury\u2019s contingency plan did not cover IRS, we evaluated  IRS\u2019s contingency plans for this objective. We also reviewed written  responses from OMB and interviewed officials at selected agencies to  understand the reasons for any discrepancies between the contingency  plans and OMB guidance.", "To address our second objective, we assessed the extent to which  selected agency components planned for a potential prolonged  shutdown\u2014one longer than 5 days\u2014as outlined in Circular A-11, and  changed operations during the shutdown. We reviewed shutdown  contingency plans and other planning documents at CBP, IRS, ITA, and  USTR to determine agency component processes for proposing,  reviewing, and approving operational changes during a government  shutdown. We interviewed officials at these agency components to  determine what operational changes components made during the fiscal  year 2019 shutdown and the key factors that led to these changes.", "To address our third objective, we assessed key elements of selected  agency components\u2019 shutdown processes to determine the extent to  which the components followed relevant internal control principles in  planning for the fiscal year 2019 government shutdown.

We also  interviewed representatives of employee organizations at the agency  components we reviewed to determine if communication of shutdown- related policies and procedures was timely, sufficient, and transparent. In  addition, we interviewed officials from agency component programs to  identify illustrative examples of how components operationalized their  shutdown processes, including how they planned for the fiscal year 2019  government shutdown, communicated with employees, and recalled  furloughed employees back to work (see appendix I for a more detailed  discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology).", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2019 to June 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Funding gaps can occur at the beginning of a fiscal year when new  appropriations, or a continuing resolution, have not yet been enacted.  Funding gaps also can occur any time during the year when a continuing  resolution expires and may affect a few agencies or all agencies across  the federal government. We have previously reported that funding gaps,  actual or threatened, are both disruptive and costly.", "The ADA prohibits agencies from obligating or expending funds in excess  or in advance of an available appropriation unless otherwise authorized  by law as well as from accepting voluntary services for the United States  except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the  protection of property. During a lapse in appropriations, employees may  continue working if they are exempt from the lapse in appropriations or if  an exception to the ADA applies (see figure 1).", "Exempt and excepted employees are defined as follows.", "Exempt employees are those who perform activities funded with  budget authority that remains available despite the lapse in  appropriations, such as multiple-year or no-year carryover balances.  Available balances can also come from other authorities such as fee  income that Congress made available for obligation.

We have also recognized, in  our prior legal opinions, other limited exceptions that may, under  some circumstances, allow functions to continue during a lapse in  appropriations. For example, Congress and the Executive branch may  incur obligations to carry out core constitutional powers. Agencies  also may incur those limited obligations that are incidental to  executing an orderly shutdown of agency activity.", "Over the past 29 years, there have been six lapses in appropriations that  led to government shutdowns, ranging in duration from 2 days to 35 days  (see figure 2).

The following table shows  examples of exempt and excepted work activities from our selected  agencies\u2019 contingency plans (see table 2).", "All four agencies provided the total number of employees on-board before  the shutdown and how many would continue to work during the  government shutdown. However, EOP\u2019s contingency plan did not break  down these employees by ADA exception categories that may include  addressing emergencies involving the safety of human life or the  protection of property or carrying out core constitutional powers, as  specified in OMB guidance. While the break out of employees by ADA  exception category was not in the DHS department-wide plan, CBP\u2019s  component-level portion of the plan, which is not publically available  because of law enforcement sensitivities, contained these details. This  information is important for an agency to ensure it has proper oversight of  operations and the right personnel performing excepted work to be in  compliance with the ADA.", "None of the agencies we reviewed provided a complete description of  potential changes to their activities and operations in the case of a  prolonged lapse in appropriations\u2014one lasting longer than 5 days\u2014within  their contingency plans.

As discussed later, three of  four selected agency components\u2014ITA, IRS, and USTR\u2014did have  internal discussions on changes to operations in the event of a prolonged  shutdown, according to officials. However, these discussions were not  documented in the agency contingency plans.", "Given that shutdowns longer than 5 days have occurred in the past, it is  important for agencies to consider and document the effects that a  potential prolonged shutdown would have on operations in their  contingency plans. Planning for potential prolonged shutdowns may  assist the agencies with effectively managing changes in operations, and  documenting these plans in public contingency plans may provide  transparency to agency actions as a shutdown continues. OMB\u2019s  guidance states that if an agency anticipates changes during a potential  prolonged shutdown, contingency plans should include information such  as points in time when the furlough status of an employee may change,  how many employees would be affected, and the legal basis for the  changes. This information element is mentioned in two separate sections  of Circular A-11 rather than in one consolidated location.", "Contingency plans for all selected agencies did not include complete  information about (1) flexibilities available to supervisors if furloughed  employees were unable to return to work on the day specified by the  agency, including use of annual leave, compensatory time off, or credit  hours; and (2) procedures for resuming program activities, including steps  to ensure appropriate oversight and disbursement of funds upon the end  of a shutdown, as specified in OMB\u2019s guidance. Officials at selected  agencies said that this information was available in internal guidance and  fact sheets for employees, but that they did not include it in contingency  plans, which are accessible to all employees during a shutdown. Including  this information in contingency plans is important because it helps clarify  agencies\u2019 expectations for returning employees, and its inclusion may  help agencies experience a more timely resumption of activities following  a shutdown.", "As previously mentioned, USTR, as a component of EOP, operated under  EOP\u2019s contingency plan and did not have a separate plan for the fiscal  year 2019 shutdown. While EOP\u2019s contingency plan contained some  information on USTR such as total number of employees on-board before  the shutdown and employees to be retained during the shutdown, the  plan did not fully address 10 of the 14 information elements outlined in  OMB\u2019s Circular A-11.

In one instance, an agency component  documented these discussions in planning documents separate from  agency contingency plans under which the component operated.  However, as mentioned previously, potential operational changes were  not documented in any of the contingency plans of our selected agencies.  Potential operational changes generally involved recalling additional  employees who had been furloughed at the beginning of the shutdown to  carry out activities that the agencies categorized as excepted from the  ADA or exempt due to other funding sources.", "IRS: IRS officials said that their initial planning was for a shutdown  lasting 5 days or less. Within their contingency plan IRS noted that it  would amend the plan if the shutdown lasted longer. On December  27, 2018, 6 days into the shutdown, IRS issued an updated  contingency plan. According to IRS officials, this updated plan was  assembled by contacting each of IRS\u2019s 23 organizational offices to  find any new activity requirements that would lead to changes in the  contingency plan. In its amended plan, IRS added approximately 60  positions as excepted or exempt. Examples of activities that  employees in these positions would support included: (1)  communications efforts through IRS websites, (2) end-of-month  financial operations, and (3) managing on-boarding for employees  hired under Public Law 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act.", "IRS officials said they knew about these operational changes at the  time of initial shutdown planning, but did not document all these  operational needs. IRS program officials told us that being informed of  anticipated operational changes as early as possible would have  helped them prepare for the shift in workload. For its fiscal year 2020  contingency plan, IRS asked plan contributors to identify \u201cas needed\u201d  positions that could be activated during a potential prolonged  shutdown. Plan contributors also identified positions that would be  needed if a shutdown lasting more than 5 days were to occur as IRS  approached the tax filing season.", "ITA: Prior to the shutdown, ITA officials prepared a list of upcoming  activities for the next 30 to 60 days to determine the potential scope of  activities affected by a government shutdown. Activities included trade  shows, meetings, and other critical operational deadlines. According  to officials, ITA worked with their General Counsel to determine if  activities could continue as excepted from the ADA or exempted  because funding was available from another source. For those  activities that could not be deemed excepted or exempt, ITA officials  said that they were prepared to notify affected parties of the  cancellation or postponement of the activities.", "For upcoming activities, ITA established dates when preparation  would need to begin. In addition, ITA officials prepared temporary  exception requests for employees to be recalled from furlough status  in time to conduct needed preparation and carry out scheduled  activities. ITA officials told us that they used and updated a tracker  daily during the shutdown to ensure that all information remained  current.", "Prior to the shutdown, ITA officials also said that they collected  information on official travel planned for around the anticipated time of  the shutdown. They said that it was important to gather this  information because once employees were furloughed it becomes  more difficult to gather complete and timely information on these  travel plans.", "USTR: Prior to the shutdown, USTR officials asked offices to provide  lists of positions that would need to be excepted during the first 2  weeks of a potential shutdown. This allowed USTR to anticipate  operational needs if a shutdown lasted longer than 5 days. USTR  officials said that flexibility was important as the potential shutdown  approached because it allowed offices to adjust excepted position lists  based on additional excepted activities or postponement of activities.  USTR officials said that, in their experience, it is difficult to anticipate  all the operational changes needed in the event of a shutdown longer  than 2 weeks, especially as the agency component relies on partners  at other agencies that may or may not be affected by the shutdown.", "CBP: Although the non-public portion of the DHS plan for CBP  included sections that describe functions that may resume in the  event of a prolonged shutdown, CBP officials said that these sections  were not used in anticipation of the fiscal year 2019 shutdown.  Specifically, the sections provide the opportunity for officials to  indicate how many employees would be recalled to perform functions,  but in the fiscal year 2019 plan almost every section indicates zero  employees. Despite OMB guidance on prolonged shutdowns, officials  said they believe that OMB guidance was exclusively for the first 5  days of a shutdown. Use of these sections of the CBP plan would help  provide clearer expectations to the agency component\u2019s workforce  about who may be recalled to perform work activities during a  shutdown.", "For the fiscal year 2020 contingency plan, CBP officials said that they  asked offices to analyze and communicate what, if any, additional  employees would be needed to work if a shutdown were to extend  past 5 days. However, our review of the 2020 CBP plan found that,  similar to the plan for fiscal year 2019, it largely does not indicate how  many employees would be recalled to perform functions in the event  of a prolonged shutdown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Selected Agency Components Made Operational Changes during the Prolonged Shutdown for Varying Reasons", "paragraphs": ["During the fiscal year 2019 shutdown, each agency component that we  reviewed determined that changes needed to occur that affected the  number of excepted employees working during the shutdown. According  to agency component officials, these changes were due to the length of  the shutdown, external events, and changes to the determination of  excepted work. The length of the fiscal year 2019 shutdown was the most  common reason cited by officials for operational changes.", "CBP: During the fiscal year 2019 shutdown, CBP responded to an  increase in foreign nationals arriving at the southern U.S. border. In  response to this external event, CBP officials told us that they  identified a need to train additional law enforcement officers and  agents to perform excepted activities. According to the DHS  contingency plan, new hire training for law enforcement officers may  be an excepted activity if the requesting agency component  establishes a reasonable likelihood that a delay in new hire training  would compromise the safety of human life or protection of property.", "According to DHS documents, this was a change from previous  shutdowns, when new hire training was not an activity excepted from  the ADA. CBP officials told us that they discussed this issue internally  before the shutdown, but processing the change through DHS\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer, DHS General Counsel, and OMB occurred after the  shutdown began. CBP has incorporated this change into its updated,  non-public portion of DHS\u2019s contingency plan.", "IRS: As the length of the shutdown increased, IRS identified mission  requirements that it determined necessitated the recall of additional  employees. For example, as it transitioned to its filing season  operations, IRS recalled mail center employees to oversee the  collection of taxes and protection of statute expiration. IRS\u2019s  updated fiscal year 2019 filing season contingency plan, published on  January 15, 2019, incorporated this activity along with the additional  560 employees recalled for one division to perform the work.", "IRS said in the updated plan that the ADA exception for this work was  the protection of life and property. According to IRS documents,  Treasury officials evaluated plan updates for compliance with the  ADA, and then shared the plan with OMB prior to implementing  changes.", "IRS also made operational changes during the fiscal year 2019  shutdown that were based on changes to the determination of which  work activities were excepted from the ADA. During the shutdown IRS  announced that it would process tax returns beginning January 28,  2019, and refund taxpayers as scheduled. In 2011, OMB directed IRS  not to pay tax refunds in the event of a lapse in appropriations.  However, at the request of Treasury and IRS, OMB revisited this  position and, on January 7, 2019, OMB informed Treasury that tax  refunds may be paid during a lapse in appropriations.", "As a result of this determination, IRS added approximately 16,000  additional excepted positions to its filing season contingency plan for  the purpose of issuing refunds. This change was documented in its  updated contingency plan, published on January 15, 2019. In October  2019, we determined that the agency violated the ADA by processing  tax returns and issuing refunds to taxpayers because it lacked  available budget authority to support these activities and no exception  to the ADA permitted IRS to incur these obligations.", "ITA: According to ITA officials, they updated ITA\u2019s activity list during  the course of the fiscal year 2019 shutdown. They said the update  was needed to help determine which preparation activities could  continue for future events, such as trade shows that bring  international delegations, and which activities or events would have to  be cancelled if the shutdown continued. ITA officials said they had to  evaluate cancellation clauses in its contracts with these trade shows  to decide whether and when to cancel. ITA recalled employees on a  temporary basis, as needed, to perform these tasks. ITA officials told  us that they followed departmental guidance in requesting employee  recalls during the shutdown. ITA submitted proposed changes to  Commerce\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Administration, which coordinated department-level review and  approval.", "Commerce officials told us that senior leadership discussed changes  to the contingency plan with OMB officials over the course of the  shutdown. Despite changes to the number of excepted employees,  Commerce did not publish an updated contingency plan during the  fiscal year 2019 shutdown. Commerce officials told us that, through  discussions with OMB, they determined that publishing an updated  plan was not necessary due to the relatively small number of changes  to the total number of excepted and exempt employees.", "USTR: Prior to the beginning of the shutdown, USTR estimated that it  could continue full operations for 3 to 4 weeks with available funding.  Because the shutdown lasted beyond 3 weeks, USTR furloughed a  majority of its employees on January 14, 2019, once those funds were  no longer available. In the absence of available funding, USTR  officials decided that some functions were excepted from the ADA  under the justification that the agency component works to discharge  the president\u2019s constitutional duty and power to conduct foreign  relations. USTR officials stated that component leaders identified the  highest priority mission activities to continue during the shutdown,  such as trade negotiations with China and work related to the North  American Free Trade Agreement. Officials decided not to continue  other activities, such as preparations for the 2019 Group of 20  Summit.", "USTR officials told us that, in consultation with OMB, USTR excepted  more than 74 employees, the number listed in the EOP contingency  plan published December 21, 2018.

Contingency plans are one control that agencies use in this effort.  Agencies must have assurance that the contingency plan is being  followed daily during a shutdown. This assurance can be verified through  controls that (1) track and document the number of employees who  actually worked daily during the shutdown, and (2) limit physical and  virtual workspace access to appropriate employees. Three of four agency  components we reviewed tracked employees who worked, one had  sufficient controls on physical access to workspaces, and none had  sufficient controls to limit virtual access.

DHS stated that CBP plans to update  procedures to ensure more comprehensive workspace access guidance  for furloughed employees.", "With regard to the recommendation on developing controls for virtual  workspace access (recommendation 11), DHS stated that CBP believes  that furloughed employees must be able to passively monitor the status of  the government shutdown and access important agency communications  using DHS-issued electronic devices. Additionally, disabling and  reactivating thousands of employee user accounts during a shutdown  posed a significant burden.", "DHS said that CBP plans to update shutdown procedures to clarify  allowed use of DHS-issued electronic devices by furloughed employees.  We agree that CBP should update procedures on workspace access as  suggested, and continue to believe that physical and virtual access  controls are important during shutdowns in order to prevent misuse of  government resources. We encourage CBP to improve their systems to  be able to efficiently implement such controls.", "IRS partially agreed with one recommendation addressed to it and  disagreed with two others. IRS agreed with one element of our  recommendation to include additional detail in its agency contingency  plan (recommendation 3) and stated that it is in the process of adding  procedures for resuming program activities following a government  shutdown into its contingency plan.", "IRS did not agree with the other elements of the recommendation  because it believes it has already addressed plans for a potential  prolonged shutdown and flexibilities for supervisors if employees are  unable to return to work at the end of a shutdown in its contingency plans.  We agree that while IRS has included some details on these elements in  its plans, we continue to believe that it should provide more detail, such  as points in time when the furlough status of an employee may change,  how many employees would be affected, and the legal basis for the  changes, within its publically available contingency plan to fully address  these elements.", "IRS disagreed with our recommendations on developing controls for  physical and virtual workspace access during a shutdown  (recommendations 9 and 12). For both recommendations, IRS stated that  it believes that it has effective controls in place to manage physical and  virtual workspace access during a shutdown. In addition, IRS said that it  believes that implementing additional access controls do not justify the  corresponding resource investments.", "We continue to believe that IRS should improve its access controls, which  currently rely on managers and furlough letters to communicate limits on  workspace access. While we recognize the costs of increased access  controls, government shutdowns are unique events that require additional  access controls in order to prevent potential misuse of government  resources.", "In USTR\u2019s emailed comments, its Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for  Administration neither agreed nor disagreed with the four  recommendations addressed to it. The official, however, stated that  USTR has already begun addressing our recommendations on aligning  its contingency plan with OMB guidance (recommendation 4) and  documenting its shutdown processes (recommendation 6), and has made  EOP aware of the recommendations on developing controls for physical  and virtual workspace access during a shutdown (recommendations 10  and 14).", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Secretary of Commerce, the Acting  Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security, the Commissioner of the Internal  Revenue Service, the Acting Under Secretary for International Trade, the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Trade  Representative, and other interested parties.

When more than one agency component at an agency met  these criteria, we selected the component that had the largest budget and  the greatest planned number of employees performing excepted work  during the shutdown. While the four components we selected are not  generalizable to other agency components, they do reflect variation in  size, funding type, and justification for excepted work that serve as  illustrative examples of a range of experiences. These selected agency  components are", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Homeland  Security (DHS);  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of the Treasury  (Treasury);  International Trade Administration (ITA), Department of Commerce  (Commerce); and", "Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), Executive  Office of the President (EOP).", "To address our first objective, we compared information in selected  agencies\u2019 government shutdown contingency plans to key information  elements described in OMB guidance. Specifically, we identified 14 key  information elements in the 2018 OMB Circular No. A-11 Section 124\u2014 Agency Operations in the Absence of Appropriations (Circular A-11), the  applicable guidance, at the beginning of the partial government shutdown  that began on December 22, 2018. This document details the  information agencies should include in their contingency plans, such as  significant agency activities that will continue or cease during a shutdown,  the number of employees who will continue to work during a shutdown,  and necessary actions for resuming orderly operations after a shutdown.", "Three of our four selected agency components\u2014CBP, ITA, and USTR\u2014 operated under an agency-wide plan. Therefore, we evaluated the fiscal  year 2019 contingency plans for Commerce, DHS, and EOP. Each  component of DHS has a non-public, for official use only, portion of the  agency-wide plan, and we included CBP\u2019s non-public portion in our  evaluation. Because Treasury\u2019s contingency plan did not cover IRS, we  evaluated IRS\u2019s contingency plans for this objective. We also reviewed  written responses from OMB and interviewed officials at selected  agencies to understand the reasons for any discrepancies between the  contingency plans and OMB guidance.", "To address our second objective, we assessed the extent to which  selected agency components planned for a potential prolonged  shutdown\u2014one longer than 5 days\u2014as outlined by Circular A-11, and  changed operations during the shutdown. We reviewed shutdown  contingency plans and other planning documents at CBP, IRS, ITA, and  USTR to determine agency component processes for proposing,  reviewing, and approving operational changes during a government  shutdown. We interviewed officials at these agency components to  determine what operational changes components made during the fiscal  year 2019 shutdown and the key factors that led to these changes.", "To address our third objective, we assessed selected agency  components\u2019 shutdown processes to determine the extent to which the  components followed relevant internal control principles in planning for  the fiscal year 2019 government shutdown. We reviewed our Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Internal Control  Standards) and identified key principles related to agency components\u2019  shutdown processes. Relevant internal control standards include  designing and implementing appropriate policies and procedures and  effectively communicating this information to stakeholders. This would  include policies and procedures to ensure an orderly shutdown process  and compliance with applicable laws such as the Antideficiency Act  (ADA).", "We developed a questionnaire for selected agency components based on  these internal control principles that reflected practices we determined to  be associated with effectively implementing the controls in the context of  a government shutdown, such as documentation of shutdown processes  or employee communication. We reviewed the results of this  questionnaire, reviewed agency component contingency plans and other  internal planning documents, and interviewed component officials to  determine the extent to which components followed these internal control  principles. We assessed the sufficiency of selected agency components\u2019  internal controls based on whether the evidence gathered contained  relevant details about a component\u2019s shutdown processes that  demonstrated the component would have reasonable assurance of  achieving its shutdown objectives. While we assessed agency  components\u2019 shutdown processes, we did not assess the results of those  processes, such as whether components correctly or appropriately  categorized activities as excepted from the ADA.", "We interviewed officials at selected agency components to understand  the reasons for any inconsistencies between component planning and  decision-making processes and internal control principles. We also  interviewed representatives of employee organizations at the agency  components we reviewed to determine if communication of shutdown- related policies and procedures was timely, sufficient, and transparent.", "In addition, we selected one program office within each reviewed agency  component to identify illustrative examples of how components  operationalized their shutdown processes. For CBP, IRS, and ITA, we  selected the program offices with the largest budget based on available  budget data. Based on this criterion, we selected CBP\u2019s Office of Field  Operations, IRS\u2019s Wage and Investment division, and ITA\u2019s Global  Markets office. Selection of these program offices provided for a variety of  justifications for excepted work and number of planned excepted  employees. Due to the size of USTR, the agency component does not  manage based on program offices, according to USTR officials. Because  of this, we did not select a program office within USTR. We reviewed  documents and interviewed officials in these program offices to determine  how they planned for the fiscal year 2019 government shutdown,  communicated with employees, and recalled furloughed employees back  to work, among other things.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2019 to June 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
