GAO analyzed federal, state and local, and tribal arrest, adjudication, and confinement data from 2010 through 2016 (the most recent available) from DOJ and the Department of the Interior. GAO also analyzed DOJ and HHS grant program award documentation from fiscal years 2015 through 2017, and application information for a sample of the grant programs chosen based on the amount of funding awarded and other factors.

During this period, state and local arrests of Native American youth declined by almost 40 percent from 18,295 in 2010 to 11,002 in 2016. The vast majority of Native American youth came into contact with state and local justice systems rather than the federal system.", "However, more Native American youth were involved in the federal system than their percentage in the nationwide population (1.6 percent). For example, of all youth arrested by federal entities during the period, 18 percent were Native American. According to Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, this is due to federal jurisdiction over certain crimes involving Native Americans. Comprehensive data on Native American youth involvement in tribal justice systems were not available for analysis. GAO's analysis showed several differences between Native American and non-Native American youth in the federal justice system. For example, the majority of Native American youths' involvement was for offenses against a person, such as assault and sex offenses. In contrast, the majority of non-Native American youths' involvement was for public order offenses (e.g., immigration violations) or drug or alcohol offenses. On the other hand, in state and local justice systems, the involvement of Native American and non-Native American youth showed many similarities, such as similar offenses for each group.", "DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offered at least 122 discretionary grants and cooperative agreements (grant programs) from fiscal years 2015 through 2017 that could be used to address juvenile delinquency among Native American youth. DOJ and HHS made approximately $1.2 billion in first-year awards to grantees during the period, of which the agencies awarded approximately $207.7 million to tribal governments or Native American organizations. Officials from the agencies, tribal governments, and Native American organizations identified factors they believe affect success in applying for grant programs. For example, some tribal governments and Native American organizations found being able to call or meet with federal officials during the application process helpful but found that short application deadlines are a challenge."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["American Indian and Alaska Native (Native American) youth face unique  challenges when it comes to their contact with justice systems. According  to recent reports and agency research, several risk factors make Native  American youth susceptible to becoming involved with justice systems at  the federal, state and local, and tribal levels. These risk factors include  exposure to violence; substance abuse; poverty; limited job market skills;  and tribal communities\u2019 limited funding for mental health, education,  housing, and other services. Further, these reports and research note that  tribal justice systems often lack resources and programming compared  with federal and state and local justice systems, which may not have  culturally appropriate programming to meet the needs of Native American  youth.", "When a Native American youth enters the federal criminal justice system,  the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of the Interior (DOI),  among others, have responsibility for investigating and prosecuting his or  her act of delinquency or crime. Additionally, federal agencies including  DOJ and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provide  funding through grant programs that could be used to help prevent or  address juvenile delinquency.", "Given the severity of the issues Native American youth face, there are  questions about the percent of these youth in the justice systems,  particularly at the federal level, and about the sufficiency of resources to  address the risk factors that contribute to them becoming involved in the  justice systems.", "You asked us to review information about Native American youth in the  justice systems, including demographic information about these youth;  federal grant programs that address Native American juvenile  delinquency; and tribal access to these grant programs. This report  addresses the following questions:  1.  What do available data show about the number and characteristics of  Native American youth in the federal, state and local, and tribal justice  systems?  2.  What discretionary grant programs do federal agencies fund that  could help prevent or address delinquency among Native American  youth, and to what extent do tribal governments and Native American  organizations have access to them?", "For the purposes of this review, our discussion of Native American youth  in federal, state and local, and tribal justice systems generally includes  persons who (a) were under 18 years of age at the time of arrest,  adjudication, or confinement; and (b) who were identified as Native  American based on descriptions and definitions of the agency data sets  we reviewed. As described in the report, each agency data set we  reviewed used a different definition of Native American and agencies  used different methods to identify youth as Native American for those  data sets. Throughout the report, we use the term \u201cjuvenile\u201d when  referencing justice systems and \u201cyouth\u201d in referring more generally to  individuals under the age of 18 at the time of arrest or confinement. In  addition, we use the term \u201cNative American\u201d to indicate both Alaska  Native and American Indian individuals, including the youth in the data we  reviewed. However, we use the term \u201cIndian\u201d in reference to definitions  established by statute or law.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and analyzed record-level and  summary data from federal agencies about federal, state and local, and  tribal justice systems. Specifically, we obtained and analyzed data from  five DOJ agencies and DOI\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for youth  arrested, adjudicated, or admitted to a facility (confined) during calendar  and fiscal years 2010 through 2016. The data described characteristics  such as race, age, gender, type of offense, and the year the youth came  into contact with the justice system. For purposes of our analysis, we  included Native American youth as defined by each data source and  identified by the agencies providing the data we reviewed. These data  included some youth who may have been prosecuted as adults. In regard  to type of offense, unless otherwise noted, we obtained and analyzed  information about the lead or most serious offense associated with the  youth who came into contact with the justice system, which was generally  identified in the data we obtained. We then grouped the offenses into five  broad categories\u2014drug and alcohol, person, property, public order, and  other. We assessed the reliability of the record-level and summary data  by electronically testing the data and interviewing knowledgeable DOJ  officials and determined that the data included in this report were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We  determined that some data related to arrests and sentencing either were  not reliable for our purposes, contained information already provided by  other data sources, or contained too few Native American youth  observations to provide reliable, reportable information. These data are  not included in our report.", "Additionally, we reviewed summary data in DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice  Statistics (BJS) reports, such as the Jails in Indian Country report from  2016, to describe the number of Native American youth confined in tribal  facilities. We assessed the reliability of the data we used from these  reports by reviewing related documentation and interviewing  knowledgeable BJS officials and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "We also analyzed the representation of Native American youth involved  with the federal justice system by comparing federal arrest, adjudication,  and confinement data to information provided in response to the 2010  Decennial U.S. Census, and in U.S. Census estimates from 2011 through  2016. Similarly, we analyzed the representation of Native American youth  involved with state and local justice systems by comparing state and local  arrest and confinement data to U.S. Census information.", "Because there is no single, centralized data source that contains data for  youth involved in all justice systems (federal, state and local, and tribal)  and across all phases of the justice process (arrest, adjudication, and  confinement), it is not possible to track individuals through all phases of  the justice process or identify the number of unique youth who have come  into contact with the justice system. In addition, record-level data were not  available for all phases of the justice process and for all justice systems.  Further, data are not comparable across databases because databases  vary in how they define Native American and how they determine whether  youth are Native American.", "In addition, we collected perspectives from agency officials and officials  from five selected Native American organizations regarding factors that  might contribute to the data characteristics we observed. We selected  these Native American organizations to include organizations whose  mission and scope of work focus on Native American juvenile justice  issues and that have a national or geographically-specific perspective.  The views of these Native American organizations are not generalizable  to all Native American organizations, but provide valuable insights.", "To address our second objective on federal discretionary grant programs  that could help prevent and address delinquency among Native American  youth, and tribal governments and Native American organizations\u2019 access  to those programs, we analyzed relevant programs available for funding  from fiscal years 2015 through 2017. For the purposes of the review, we  define \u201ctribal governments\u201d as the governing bodies of federally  recognized tribes. We define \u201cNative American organizations\u201d as  organizations affiliated with federally recognized tribes, such as tribal  colleges and universities, as well as non-tribal organizations that focus on  serving American Indian and Alaska Native populations, such as urban  Indian organizations. To identify these grant programs, we conducted a  keyword search of \u201cyouth or juvenile\u201d in Grants.gov\u2014an online repository  that houses information on over 1,000 different grant programs across  federal grant-making agencies. We focused on discretionary grants and  cooperative agreements (collectively referred to as grant programs  throughout our report) in this review because federal agencies generally  award discretionary grants and cooperative agreements based on a  competitive review process, whereas agencies are generally required by  statute to award other types of grants to specific entities, typically U.S.  state, local, and territorial governments. We did not include other  programs or sources of funding that could help prevent and address  delinquency among Native American youth in our review.", "We reviewed the search results of the three agencies with the highest  number of grant program matches\u2014DOI, DOJ, and HHS. We selected  programs whose activities related to the risk or protective factors  discussed in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention\u2019s  (OJJDP) Tribal Youth in the Juvenile Justice System literature review.  We also worked with DOI, DOJ, and HHS officials to identify any  additional relevant grant programs and confirmed our final list of grant  programs with agency officials. Despite these steps, it is possible that our  analysis did not identify all relevant grant programs.", "We next reviewed the funding opportunity announcements of our selected  grant programs to determine which ones specified tribes or Native  Americans as a primary beneficiary and which did not. We also  categorized each program into one or more issue areas (e.g., violence or  trauma, substance abuse, mentoring) using the risk and protective factors  discussed in the OJJDP Tribal Youth in the Juvenile Justice System  literature review as the basis for our issue area determinations.", "To determine the extent to which tribal governments and Native American  organizations had access to the grant programs we identified, we  reviewed the eligibility factors and award data. Specifically, we reviewed  the grant program funding opportunity announcements to determine  whether tribal governments or Native American organizations were  eligible to apply. We also analyzed fiscal year 2015 through 2017 award  data for every grant program we identified to determine the extent to  which tribal governments and Native American organizations received  funding. We also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of applications  selected to include applications to grant programs that funded a relatively  high estimated amount of awards or that specified tribes or Native  Americans as a primary beneficiary to determine the extent to which tribal  governments or Native American organizations applied for grant  programs we identified. We assessed the reliability of the data we used  by questioning knowledgeable officials and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting.", "To understand factors that affect the ability of tribal governments and  Native American organizations to apply successfully for the grant  programs we identified, we interviewed DOJ and HHS officials, as well as  officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 10 tribal governments and  Native American organizations that applied for or received funding from  these grant programs and analyzed their responses to identify common  themes. We selected our sample to include tribal governments and  Native American organizations that received multiple awards for grant  programs we identified, and that applied unsuccessfully multiple times to  grant programs we reviewed, among other characteristics. We also  analyzed a nongeneralizable sample of peer review statements from  unsuccessful applications to understand why tribal governments and  Native American organizations were unsuccessful in applying for some of  the grant programs we identified. The information we obtained from the  officials and peer review statements cannot be generalized more broadly  to tribal governments and Native American organizations or the  applications they submit unsuccessfully for federal funding. However, the  information provides insights into the challenges these entities face in  applying for federal funding that could help prevent or address  delinquency among Native American youth, as well as some of the  common weaknesses identified in unsuccessful applications from these  entities.

State and local justice systems have specific courts\u2013  often at the county or city level\u2013with jurisdiction over youth alleged to  have committed an act of juvenile delinquency or a crime. This  jurisdiction can be conferred by the state\u2019s laws and exercised by courts  at the city, county, or municipal levels, and each state and local entity\u2019s  processing of youth is unique. There are more than 2,400 courts across  the country with juvenile jurisdiction, and a majority of these are at the  city, county, or municipal, i.e., local, level. Generally, a youth is either  referred to juvenile court or released. Juvenile courts handle two types of  petitions: delinquency or waiver. A delinquency petition is the official  charging document filed in juvenile court by the state. A juvenile\u2019s case  may be dismissed, handled informally (without filing a petition for  adjudication), or handled through adjudication by the court. In some more  serious situations, the case can be handled by a criminal court. Juvenile  cases that are handled informally or through adjudication can result in  various outcomes, including probation, commitment to an institution or  other residential facility, another sanction (e.g., community service), or  dismissal.", "Federal. Unlike state systems, the federal justice system does not have a  separate court with jurisdiction over juvenile cases. Youth that are  proceeded against in federal court are generally adjudicated in a closed  hearing before a U.S. district or magistrate judge and their cases are  either declined or they can be adjudicated delinquent. Delinquent  adjudications can result in outcomes such as probation, commitment to a  correctional facility, or the requirement to pay restitution. Youth under  the age of 18 who are confined in federal facilities, including Native  American youth, are housed in juvenile facilities overseen by the Federal  Bureau of Prisons (BOP), which contracts with other entities to manage  those facilities.", "Tribal. Tribal justice systems vary. A number of tribes have tribal judicial  systems, some with separate juvenile courts, and others rely on state  courts or the federal system. As of April 2018, there were approximately  89 adult and juvenile jail facilities and detention centers in Indian country,  according to BIA officials.

A state generally has jurisdiction to proceed  against a youth who has committed a crime or act of juvenile delinquency  outside of Indian country. This jurisdiction is generally exercised in each  state by local courts (e.g., at the county and city levels). Federal law limits  federal jurisdiction over youth if a state has jurisdiction over the youth and  has a system of programs and services adequate for their needs. Since  the passage of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act in  1974, federal law has reflected an intent to support state and local  community-level programs for the prevention and treatment of juvenile  delinquency, and to avoid referral of juvenile cases out of the state and  local systems while balancing against the need to protect the public from  violent offenders. Consistent with this, the Federal Juvenile Delinquency  Code provides that a youth alleged to have committed an act of juvenile  delinquency, with certain exceptions, will not fall under federal jurisdiction  unless (1) the juvenile court or other appropriate court of a state does not  have jurisdiction over the youth, (2) the state does not have available  programs and services adequate for the needs of the youth, or (3) the  offense charged is a violent felony or an enumerated offense involving  controlled substances and there is a substantial federal interest in the  case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.", "Inside Indian country. For both youth and adults, the exercise of  criminal jurisdiction in Indian country depends on several factors. These  factors include the nature of the crime, the status of the alleged offender  and victim\u2014that is, whether they are Indian or not\u2014and whether  jurisdiction has been conferred on a particular entity by statute.  Additionally, the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Code generally applies to  all juveniles alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency,  whether inside or outside Indian country. As a general principle, the  federal government recognizes Indian tribes as \u201cdistinct, independent  political communities\u201d that possess powers of self-government to regulate  their \u201cinternal and social relations,\u201d which includes enacting substantive  law over internal matters and enforcing that law in their own forums. The  federal government, however, has authority to regulate or modify the  powers of self-government that tribes otherwise possess, and has  exercised this authority to establish jurisdiction over certain crimes in  Indian country. For example, the Major Crimes Act, as amended,  provides the federal government with criminal jurisdiction over Indians in  Indian Country charged with serious, felony-level offenses enumerated in  the statute, such as murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, burglary, and  robbery. The General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes Act, and Public Law 280, which are broadly summarized in table 1, are the three federal laws  central to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in Indian country.", "The exercise of criminal jurisdiction by state governments in Indian  country is generally limited to two instances: when both the alleged  offender and victim are non-Indian, or when a federal statute confers, or  authorizes, a state to assume criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian  country.

Representatives from  two of those organizations noted that when a youth comes into contact  with state juvenile justice systems, states are not required to ask about  Native American status, which results in inconsistent tracking and  underreporting of Native American youth involved with state systems.  Representatives from one of these organizations, which provides  assistance in national policy areas, noted that states are not required to  contact a youth\u2019s identified tribe to confirm the youth\u2019s tribal affiliation.  These representatives also noted that some states may inquire about  tribal affiliation when youth come into contact with the state\u2019s justice  system, but the states do not have a reliable process to identify Native  American youth. In addition, these same representatives noted that  Native American youth are often unlikely to share their ethnicity with state  officials, or anyone outside of their community. Representatives from  another organization noted that state court judges are not required to ask  about Native American status, which could also potentially result in  undercounting of Native American youth in state systems.  Representatives from another organization which commented on the  decline stated that because state and federal data only capture more  serious offenses, lesser crimes handled at the tribal level often go  unreported.", "Representatives from two of the organizations we interviewed did not  question the decline in the number of Native American youth involved in  federal and state and local systems, but noted that there has been a  movement away from criminalizing youth in general. Rather, these  representatives explained that there is more of a focus on restorative  justice, diversion, and alternatives to incarceration, as well as a  movement toward more trauma-informed care. Representatives from one  of these two organizations noted that a number of states have worked out  civil diversion agreements with local tribes, which provide opportunities  for the tribe to practice restorative justice with delinquent youth instead of  confining them.", "Regarding the distribution of Native American youth by state,  representatives from four of the five organizations we interviewed noted  that the number of youth involved with state justice systems is higher in  those states with a larger Native American population, and thus were not  surprised by the states our analysis showed to have the highest numbers  of Native American youth involved in their state and local justice systems.  These representatives also provided additional perspectives on why  some states might have higher numbers of youth involved with their  justice systems. For example, representatives from one organization  noted that in certain states, not all tribes have tribal law enforcement,  which could potentially lead to higher state involvement in Native  American juvenile cases that might otherwise be handled by tribes.

For example, the percent of youth in USMS  custody and arrested by federal LEAs during the period who were Native  American was 18 percent (246 Native American youth out of 1,358 total  youth arrested from fiscal years 2010 through 2016), as shown in table 5.", "According to DOJ officials, the federal juvenile population of Native  Americans has historically been higher than their representation in the  nationwide population due to federal government jurisdiction over certain  crimes in Indian country, which requires the federal government to  prosecute offenses that would commonly be prosecuted by states if  committed outside of Indian country. According to DOJ officials, a small  handful of federal criminal statutes apply to all juveniles, such as  immigration and drug statutes, but the federal government has been  granted greater jurisdiction over Native American youth than non-Native  American youth by federal laws that apply to crimes committed in Indian  Country, such as the Major Crimes Act. For example, one DOJ official  noted that the Major Crimes Act gives the federal government exclusive  jurisdiction over crimes such as burglary and sex offenses committed in  Indian country. This differs from the treatment of non-Native American  youth, who are not prosecuted in the federal system for the same types of  offenses, because the federal government does not have jurisdiction over  those youth for such offenses. Non-Native American youth are instead  subject to the general juvenile delinquency jurisdiction of state and local  courts. Further, DOJ officials stated that a significant portion of Indian  country is in states where Public Law 280 does not apply, and thus the  federal government generally has criminal jurisdiction for major crimes in  Indian Country. Additionally, DOJ officials stated that tribal justice  systems are often underfunded and do not have the capacity to handle  Native American youths\u2019 cases. Therefore, when both federal and tribal  justice systems have jurisdiction, they said that the federal system may  be the only system in which the youth\u2019s case may be adjudicated. For  these reasons, the number of Native American youth offenders in the  federal justice system is disproportionate to non-Native American  juveniles in accordance with population size, according to DOJ officials.", "State and local justice systems.

As figure 7 illustrates, in most states, the  percent of youth confined at state and local facilities in 2015 who were  Native American was similar to the percent of Native American youth in  the states\u2019 population. However, six states\u2014Alaska, Minnesota, Montana,  North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming\u2014the percentage of Native  Americans among the youth confined in state and local facilities was at  least 5 percentage points higher. In one state\u2014New Mexico\u2014it was 11  percentage points lower.", "Agency and organization perspectives. According to DOJ officials, as  noted above, federal jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country results in a  higher percentage of Native American youth (compared to non-Native  American youth) involved with the federal justice system. In addition, a  DOJ official noted that that certain states may have a higher percentage  of Native Americans among youth confined in that state\u2019s facilities if those  Native American youth reside more in urban or other areas that are not  Indian country, and are thus more likely subject to state and local  jurisdiction. Conversely, the official said that for those states with lower  Native American youth confined in state facilities compared to the Native  American youth population in the state overall, the youth may reside more  in Indian country, resulting in their contact with the federal judicial system  more than the state or local justice systems.", "Representatives from four of the five Native American organizations we  interviewed noted that federal jurisdiction is a key contributor to the higher  percentage of Native American youth involved at the federal justice level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Involvement Declined, Available Data Indicate Several Differences between Native American and Non- Native American Youth in the Federal Justice System", "paragraphs": ["Although the involvement of youth in the federal justice systems declined  for both Native Americans and non-Native Americans from 2010 through  2016, analysis of available data indicates that there were several  differences between the two groups in characteristics such as types of  offenses charged.

In contrast,  agency officials also noted that the federal government does not have  jurisdiction over the same types of offenses committed by non-Indian  youth and therefore those youth cannot be arrested by federal agencies  for person offenses. Rather, according to one DOJ official, the federal  government only has general jurisdiction applying to both Native  American and non-Native American youth in limited instances, such as for  certain immigration and drug offenses. The jurisdictional structure present  in Indian country requires the federal government to prosecute offenses  that would otherwise be handled in state court outside of Indian country,  according to DOJ officials.", "Representatives from all of the five Native American organizations we  interviewed noted, similarly to DOJ officials, that federal jurisdiction over  crimes in Indian country is typically for more serious offenses (specifically  under the Major Crimes Act), such as person offenses.

For example, the stated purpose of DOJ\u2019s CTAS  Juvenile Healing to Wellness Courts grant program is to support tribes  seeking to establish new courts within their existing judicial institutions to  respond to alcohol and substance use issues among youth and young  adults. (See text box below for an example of the activities a grantee  planned to implement with this grant program.) As previously discussed,  one of the top offenses we observed of Native American youth arrested  by state and local LEAs is drug and alcohol offenses.", "Department of Justice (DOJ) Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS)  Juvenile Healing to Wellness Court Grantee: Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower  Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians   In fiscal year 2015, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw  Indians, a federally recognized tribe located within the state of Oregon, received  funding from the DOJ CTAS Juvenile Healing to Wellness Court grant program. Tribal  officials told GAO that they are in the process of growing their healing to wellness court  and aim to use this grant program to reduce the criminal penalties for substance abuse  in their community. Moreover, they said that the \u201cpeace-giving court\u201d would look at  solutions such as treatment and restorative justice rather than focus on criminal fines  and incarceration. As of October 2017, tribal officials said they had three court  employees and were planning to use some of the program funding to hire a liaison  between other court systems to refer tribal members to their tribal court.", "Mental and emotional health. Sixteen of the 122 grant programs  supported activities such as improving the mental health and wellness of  youth. For example, HHS\u2019s Planning and Developing Infrastructure to  Improve the Mental Health and Wellness of Children, Youth and Families  in American Indian/Alaska Natives Communities grant program focuses  on increasing the capacity and effectiveness of mental health systems  serving tribal and urban Indian communities by designing a coordinated  network of community-based services and supports that address the  needs of Native American youth and their families.

Native Health of Phoenix explained that the grant program would allow the  organization to work on trauma-informed care, provide counseling services through role  models (with a particular interest in using Native American veterans as mentors), and  possibly expand the age group served by an existing program, Wellness Warriors,  which currently focuses on promoting healthy living for 7- to 12-year-old youth and their  families.", "Reentry and recidivism. Twelve of the 122 grant programs supported  activities such as facilitating youths\u2019 successful reintegration into their  communities and reducing the likelihood of subsequent contact with the  criminal justice system. For example, the objective of the Second Chance  Act Technology-Based Career Training Program for Incarcerated Adults  and Juveniles, administered by DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance, is to  provide career training programs for incarcerated adults and youth in the  6 to 36 months before their release and to connect them with follow-up  services after their release. Another example is DOJ\u2019s Second Chance  Act Strengthening Relationships Between Young Fathers, Young  Mothers, and Their Children grant program offered funding in fiscal year  2016. The goal of this grant program is to reduce recidivism and support  responsible parenting practices of young fathers and mothers who were  transitioning from detention, out-of-home placement, or incarceration  back to their families and communities.", "Mentoring. Eleven of the 122 grant programs supported activities such  as providing mentoring services to at-risk or high-risk youth and  researching or evaluating the impact of various mentoring programs and  practices on youth outcomes. For example, DOJ\u2019s Mentoring for Youth:  Underserved Populations grant program supports the implementation and  delivery of various mentoring services for youth with disabilities, youth in  foster care, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning  youth. Another example is HHS\u2019s Native Youth Initiative for Leadership,  Empowerment, and Development grant program. One area of interest in  the program includes peer role model development where young Native  American adults (18 to 24 years old) serve as role models for mid- adolescents (15 to 17 years old), who in turn serve as role models for  even younger members (younger than 15 years old) in their communities.", "Suicide prevention. Seven of the 122 grant programs supported  activities such as preventing or reducing the risk of suicidal thoughts or  behavior and self-harm among youth. For example, one purpose of the  Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program, formerly known as  the Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative grant program,  administered by HHS\u2019s Indian Health Service, is to support early  intervention strategies and positive youth development to reduce the risk  for suicidal behavior and substance abuse among Native American youth.  (See text box below for an example of the activities a grantee planned to  implement with this grant program.)", "Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Substance Abuse and Suicide  Prevention Program Grantee: Fairbanks Native Association  In fiscal year 2016, the Fairbanks Native Association, whose officials describe it as a  Native American non-profit organization that provides social services, education, and  behavioral health services to residents of the Fairbanks and North Pole communities as  well as other residents of Alaska, received funding from HHS\u2019s Indian Health Service\u2019s  Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program (formerly known as the  Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative grant program). According to  Fairbanks Native Association officials, one of the evidence-based practices they  implemented for the Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention Program was Coping  and Support Training (CAST). CAST is a 12-lesson skills training program used by  schools, community centers, and other organizations for middle and high school-aged  youth whose program features include building self-esteem and creating a crisis  response plan for responding to a range of suicide-risk behavior, among other activities.", "Justice system data and analysis. Seven of the 122 grant programs  supported activities such as collecting, improving the collection of, or  analyzing data related to the youth or tribal justice systems. For example,  DOJ\u2019s Annual Survey of Jails in Indian country, 2016-2019 grant program  funded the collection of information from all known correctional facilities  operated by tribal governments or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some of  the information the program sought to collect included the number of  adults and youth held, the gender of the inmates, and average daily  population, among other data.", "Runaway and homeless youth. Six of the 122 grant programs  supported activities such as providing services to youth who have run  away from home or who are experiencing homelessness. For example,  the primary goal of HHS\u2019s Transitional Living Program and Maternity  Group Homes grant program is to help runaway and homeless youth  establish sustainable living and well-being for them and, if applicable,  their dependent children through the provision of shelter and other  services.", "Cultural identity. Four of the 122 grant programs supported activities  such as promoting and preserving Native American cultural traditions to  and for tribal youth. For example, the purpose of HHS\u2019s Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance grant program is to  ensure the survival and vitality of Native American languages.", "Other.

For the other 2 grant programs, DOJ OJP officials explained that  because the focus of these programs is statewide or countywide,  eligibility under this program was limited to states and local units of  government that have developed a statewide or countywide plan to  reduce recidivism and improve outcomes for youth in contact with the  juvenile justice system. These officials added that tribal governments  would not have the capacity to respond to the requirements of these  programs as designed since tribal juvenile justice systems operate  differently than states and counties.", "The one HHS program that neither tribal governments nor Native  American organizations were eligible to apply for was the Preventing  Teen Dating and Youth Violence by Addressing Shared Risk and  Protective Factors program, administered by the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC officials explained that this grant  program was limited to funding to local, city, and county public health  departments with a demonstrated high burden of violence and the highest  capacity to prevent teen dating violence and youth violence based on  research findings on teen dating violence and youth violence prevention,  as well as lessons learned from their previous investments in these areas.

For example, DOJ OJP officials stated that  tribes might be familiar and comfortable with applying for the CTAS, a  single application for the majority of DOJ\u2019s tribal grant programs. In  addition, HHS CDC officials stated that more tribes apply and  successfully compete for grant programs that specify tribes or Native  Americans as a primary beneficiary because they are designed  specifically for tribal populations, thus allowing for \u201cculturally- appropriate activities,\u201d which may include healing and religious  practices that promote wellness, language integration that promote  cultural sustainability and identity, and traditional storytelling that  promotes life lessons and teachings.", "Officials from 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations  also provided perspectives on whether or not a grant program\u2019s focus on  tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary affected their decision  to apply for the program. Officials from 6 of 10 of the tribal governments  and Native American organizations indicated that they would consider  any grant program that met the needs of their communities, although  officials from 3 of these 6 indicated a preference in some instances for  grant programs that focused on tribes or Native Americans. Officials from  the remaining 4 of 10 tribal governments and Native American  organizations indicated that a grant program\u2019s focus or lack thereof on  tribes or Native Americans could affect their ability to apply for it.", "For example, officials from one federally recognized Oregon tribe  explained that their tribe does not apply for grant programs that do not  specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary because their  applications are not typically competitive in a state or nationwide applicant  pool. Instead, they said that their tribe applies for funding specific to their  community because they are more likely to succeed with those  applications. These officials also said that a benefit of applying for grant  programs that specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary  is that technical assistance provided to grant recipients is tailored to  tribes. Officials from another federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma noted  that their tribe prefers to apply for grant programs that specify tribes or  Native Americans as primary beneficiaries due to the limited resources  they have available to prepare grant applications, as well as the high level  of competition for nationwide federal grant programs. Finally, officials  from a tribal nonprofit corporation in Alaska that represents several  federally recognized tribes explained that although their decision to apply  for any federal grant program depends on the needs of their community,  grant programs that specify tribes or Native Americans as a primary  beneficiary understand the challenges of tribal communities, particularly  living in rural environments and having to travel vast distances to  implement grant program funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Officials from Tribal Governments, Native American Organizations, and Agencies Noted Factors that Affect Successful Application for Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["Officials from tribal governments and Native American organizations that  applied for federal grant programs that could help prevent or address  delinquency among Native American youth, as well as DOJ and HHS  officials, identified various factors they believe affect the ability of tribal  governments and Native American organizations to successfully apply for  federal grant programs.

Additionally, a non-generalizable  sample of DOJ and HHS summary statements that provide peer review  comments for unsuccessful applications that tribal governments and  Native American organizations submitted for these grant programs noted  various weaknesses within these unsuccessful applications.", "Perspectives from tribal governments and Native American  organizations. We collected perspectives from a non-generalizable  sample of 10 tribal governments and Native American organizations on  what federal practices they find helpful or challenging when applying for  grant programs related to preventing or addressing delinquency among  Native American youth. Regarding helpful federal practices during the  application process, the tribal governments and Native American  organizations most frequently responded that they found being able to  call or meet with federal officials if they had questions about or need help  on their application particularly helpful. For example, representatives from one federally recognized tribe in Nevada explained some agencies have  help desks that provide a systematic walkthrough of technical issues  applicants might encounter when applying for grant programs.

Six of 9 tribal governments and Native American organizations  noted this as a challenge. For example, officials from a federally  recognized tribe based in the Southwest said that the tribe\u2019s biggest  challenge is a short turnaround, usually 4 to 8 weeks, from a grant  program\u2019s funding opportunity announcement to its deadline.  Similarly, officials from a federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma  suggested that federal agencies provide longer application periods for  grant programs. These officials added that more time would allow the  tribes to coordinate amongst themselves better, prepare stronger  applications, and obtain the necessary tribal approvals for a grant  program.", "Collecting data for grant program applications is difficult. Four of 9  tribal governments and Native American organizations we spoke with  noted this as a challenge. For example, a representative from a  federally recognized tribe in Nevada stated that the tribe needs  accurate data for its grant applications to describe the tribe and its  needs, yet the tribe does not currently have quality data on issues  such as substance abuse or youth employment. In addition, officials  from a tribal nonprofit corporation in Alaska that represents several  federally recognized tribal governments told us that the biggest  challenge in preparing a CTAS application is collecting data specific to  their tribes\u2019 region. These officials explained that for reports on  juvenile justice, their tribes\u2019 region is sometimes grouped with another  area, which makes it difficult to extrapolate data specific to their tribes.  According to these officials, due to the challenges in obtaining these  data, preparing grant applications to address gaps and for services  needed is difficult.", "Scarcity of grant writers and other personnel makes it difficult to  complete a quality application. Four of 9 tribal governments and  Native American organizations noted this as a challenge. For  example, officials from a federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma said  that not having a grant writer is a significant challenge for the tribe  when applying for federal grant programs. These officials mentioned  that additional training sessions on grant writing and feedback from  grant reviewers would help the tribe prepare stronger applications. In  addition, representatives from a federally recognized tribe in Oregon  stated that they encounter challenges with the research and  evaluation requirements of some grant programs because hiring  someone to fulfill this role can take 2 to 3 months and the number of  qualified individuals in their service area is limited.", "Perspectives from DOJ and HHS officials.

According to DOJ and HHS officials, some of the  reasons why some tribal governments and Native American organizations  might be more successful than others are in applying for federal funding  include the following:", "Larger and better-resourced tribal governments and Native American  organizations are more successful at applying for federal funding. For  example, DOJ OJP officials explained that larger tribes with more  resources are more successful at applying successfully for grant  programs because they are able to hire grant writers to assist with  applications. In addition, officials from HHS\u2019s SAMHSA noted that  successful applicants are usually larger tribes that have ample  resources and experienced staff to write proposals for federal funding.  HHS Centers for Disease Control officials stated that larger and  better-resourced tribes with sufficient public health infrastructure and  capacity tend to apply more and to be more competitive when they do.", "Tribal governments and Native American organizations that have  received federal funding before are more likely to be successful again.  Specifically regarding the CTAS program, DOJ OJP officials explained  that once tribes are successful at one CTAS application, they are  typically successful on subsequent CTAS submissions because they  use the successful application as a template. In addition, officials from  the HHS\u2019s Indian Health Service explained that tribes that are repeat  grantees might be more likely to submit applications to even more  grants because they are well-versed in the process. Moreover,  officials from SAMHSA explained that tribes that have previously  received federal funding might be better equipped to document their  experience in a specific area in subsequent grant applications.", "According to agency officials, one of the biggest organizational  challenges that tribal governments and Native American organizations  encounter when applying to receive federal grant program funding is  obtaining and retaining staff. For example, officials from HHS\u2019s National  Institutes of Health stated that the limited scientific and grant writing staff,  as well as high staff turnover within tribes pose the biggest challenges  they face when applying for federal funding. Officials from HHS\u2019s CDC  and Administration for Children and Families operating divisions also  identified limited grant writing staff as one of the biggest challenges that  tribal governments and Native American organizations face when  applying to receive federal funding from grant programs. Moreover,  officials from HHS\u2019s SAMHSA explained that tribes have difficulty finding  qualified staff to live and work in the remote areas where many tribes are  located. Finally, DOJ OJP officials explained that some tribes might not  have sufficient resources more generally to put together a competitive  application due to specific tribal government structures and justice  systems being relatively new compared to state and local governments.", "Review of summary statements on unsuccessful applications.

USMS provided us a data set with 1,589 records for youth  admitted into USMS custody after being arrested by a law  enforcement agency (LEA). Our analysis focused on the following  key variables: fiscal year of custody start date, race, gender, age  category, original offense description, arresting agency, and  circuit. USMS collects information about individuals admitted into  custody. USMS receives youth from various LEAs and collects  information on the LEA that arrests the individual. We limited our  analysis to youth arrested by federal agencies (e.g. FBI) and did  not include youth who had been arrested by non-federal LEAs  (e.g., municipalities). USMS custody data may not represent all  individuals arrested by federal agencies, but identifies a minimum  number of arrests for a given period. We used USMS custody  data because we did not identify a data source for all federal  arrests. The data USMS provided us was limited to individuals  who were under 18 when they were admitted to USMS custody  and USMS determined the age category for each record.  2.  EOUSA\u2019s Legal Information Office Network System.

CJRP has historically achieved  response rates near or above 90 percent. However,  participation in the CJRP is voluntary and response rates from  tribal facilities have been lower. The source for the information  collected by the census, such as age, were administrative  records maintained by individual residential facilities. These  data include youth who were in custody on the day of the  census.", "We limited our analysis of the CJRP data to (1) individuals  who were under the age of 18 on the date of the census and  (2) youth who had been adjudicated\u2014we did not include youth  who were awaiting a trial or whose adjudication was  pending. Finally, we excluded youth who were located in the  Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico because no other data set  appeared to include data for these geographic areas.

This  system is BOP\u2019s case management system for tracking  information (e.g., admission type and sentencing) about prisoners  in BOP\u2019s custody. For this review, BOP provided two data sets.", "One data set was limited to youth who were adjudicated and  sentenced to a facility overseen by BOP and contained 1,324  records. Our analysis of these BOP data was focused on the  following key variables: fiscal year sentenced, age category,  race, offense, and sentence length. BOP determined the age  category for each record and the data were limited to  individuals who were under 18.", "The second data set included youth who were admitted into a  facility overseen by BOP but were not necessarily adjudicated  and contained 925 records. Our analysis of these BOP data  was focused on the following key variables: fiscal year  admitted, race, distance, and admission assignment. BOP  ensured the data were limited to individuals who were under  18. BOP provided the distance information by calculating the  distance between a juvenile\u2019s residence and the facility where  a juvenile was placed. To analyze the distance information we  created two categories of admission types: juveniles under the  supervision of the United States Probation Office and juveniles  in custody of BOP.", "Our analysis of these four DOJ data sources was limited through 2016  because when we initiated our analysis in April 2017 it was the most  current data available.", "Record-level data from the Department of the Interior\u2019s (DOI) Bureau  of Indian Affairs (BIA) for youth arrested and admitted to three BIA- operated juvenile detention centers. We reviewed juvenile detention  documents maintained by the three centers: Northern Cheyenne,  Standing Rock, and Ute Mountain Ute. The types of documents  included admission sheets and arrestee custody receipts, among  others. We created a data set of admissions to the three centers using  information contained in the documents provided. Our data set  contained 956 records and included the following variables: unique ID,  admission date, and charges (offense). Documents contained  information about multiple offenses for individual admissions and did  not identify the most serious or lead offense. As such, we included all  offenses in our analysis of the centers\u2019 information. Our analysis of  this information was limited to 2012 through 2016 because records  prior to 2012 were not available for any center when we initiated our  analysis in April 2017. However, our data set does not contain records  for 2012 for the Ute Mountain Ute center because that center did not  have any of the source documents before 2013.

The FBI\u2019s primary objective  is to generate a reliable set of crime statistics for use in law  enforcement administration, operation, and management. FBI  provided us with 7 years of data in separate annual files, which initially  contained 1,529,736 gender-specific records. To analyze race, we  summarized the data across gender. In addition, the records included  summary records for drug and gambling offenses as well as records  for specific drug offenses (e.g., sale, possession) and gambling  offenses (e.g., bookmaking, lottery). To prevent over-counting, we  excluded records with specific information from our analysis. These  steps reduced our data set to 582,089 records with which we  performed our analysis of UCR SRS data, which focused on the  following key variables: calendar year, race, state, and offense.", "The majority of law enforcement agencies submit arrest data to the  FBI through the UCR program. In 2016, about 90 percent of city,  county, university and college, state, tribal, and federal agencies  eligible to participate in the UCR Program submitted data (16,782 of  18,481). Although UCR SRS predominantly contains data from state  and local LEAs, some federal and tribal LEAs report data into SRS.  Agencies submit data monthly that must meet UCR\u2019s data quality  guidelines, such as using uniform definitions. There is no available  data for the state of Florida because, according to DOJ officials,  Florida does not follow UCR guidelines and reports only arrest totals  which cannot be housed in the UCR SRS database. Further, a few  states reported limited arrest data during the scope of our review  (e.g., Illinois). Our analysis of these data was limited through 2016  because when we initiated our analysis in April 2017 it was the most  current data available.", "Summary data from the NCJJ Easy Access to Juvenile Court  Statistics (NCJJ\u2019s juvenile court data) which is supported through  funding from DOJ\u2019s OJP. NCJJ obtains case-level and court-level  data from state and local juvenile courts. This online juvenile court  data is an interactive web-based application that allows users to  analyze the actual databases that NCJJ uses to produce its annual  Juvenile Court Statistics reports. The summary data available  represents national estimates of delinquency cases handled by U.S.  courts with juvenile jurisdiction. Our analysis of these data was limited  to 2010 through 2014 because this was the most current data  available when we conducted our analysis. The summary data we  downloaded contained 86,400 cases spanning calendar years 2010  through 2014.

This report  provides information gathered from Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019  annual survey of Indian country jails, and includes all Indian country  correctional facilities operated by tribal authorities or BIA. Our analysis  of these data was limited to the survey reports covering years 2014,  2015, and 2016, and contained the number of Native American youth  confined in tribal operated jails in Indian country as of June each year.", "We assessed the reliability of the record-level and some of the summary  data by conducting electronic testing of the data and interviewing  knowledgeable agency officials about the data systems. We assessed the  reliability of the remaining summary data by interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials about the summary data. We determined that the record-level and summary data sources included in this report were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We determined that  some record-level and summary data sources, such as certain data  related to arrests and sentencing information, contained information  already provided by other data sources or contained too few Native  American youth observations to provide reliable, reportable information.  We did not include these data sources in our report. We also determined  that some data variables in certain data sources were not reliable for our  purposes. For example, two data sources did not contain reliable  information for the race of individuals. We did not include these data  sources in our report.", "For each data source, we calculated the number and percent of Native  American and non-Native American youth involved at each phase of the  justice process (arrest, referral for adjudication, and confinement) for all  three justice systems (federal, state and local, and tribal), where data  were available. Generally, non-Native American records included Asian,  Black, and White. Some data sources included other race categories\u2014 such as Pacific Islander and Hispanic. We then analyzed the  characteristics of youth involvement with the justice system, such as the  youths\u2019 race, age category, gender, type of offense, geographic location,  outcome of the youths\u2019 involvement with the justice system, type of facility  where the youth was placed (e.g., private, state, tribal), length of  sentence, distance between youth\u2019s residence and facility, and time in  confinement, where data were available. If a record was missing a value  for the characteristic we were analyzing (e.g., race, offense, gender, or  age)\u2014for example, the value was either blank or was \u201cunknown\u201d\u2014we did  not include the record in the analysis of that characteristic.", "We also analyzed the representation of Native American youth involved  with the federal and state and local justice systems by comparing justice  system data to 2010 U.S. Decennial Census information and U.S. Census  estimates from 2011 to 2016.

We then identified the representation of Native  American youth among the total youth population for the United States  from the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census (as of April 1, 2010) and its  updated estimates from 2011 through 2016 (as of July 1 for each year).  Using these data, we compared the representation of Native American  youth among each component of the federal justice system (i.e., USMS  custody, EOUSA adjudication, and BOP confinement) to the total youth  population for the United States.", "Similarly, we also compared the representation of Native American youth  by individual states. To do this, we identified the representation of Native  American youth in FBI\u2019s UCR SRS arrest data as well as CJRP\u2019s  confinement data for individual states. We then identified the  representation of Native American youth among the youth population for  individual states from the U.S. Census\u2019s 2010 decennial data and its  updated estimates from 2011 through 2016. Using these data, we  compared the representation of Native American youth among state and  local justice systems (i.e., FBI\u2019s UCR SRS arrest and CJRP\u2019s  confinement data) to the representation of Native Americans among the  youth population for individual states.", "Because there is no single, centralized data source that contains data for  youth involved in all justice systems (federal, state and local, tribal) and  across all phases of the justice process (arrest, adjudication,  confinement), it is not possible to track individuals through all phases of  the justice system or identify the number of unique youth who have come  into contact with the justice systems. Further, data are not comparable  across data sources because data sources vary in how they define Native  American and how they determine whether youth are Native American.  Some federal agencies, such as USMS and BOP, share a unique  identifier for an individual within the federal data sources. However, for  purposes of this review and given privacy concerns related to juvenile  data, we were unable to track individuals across phases of the federal  justice system.", "We also collected perspectives from agency officials and five Native  American organizations regarding factors that might contribute to the data  characteristics we observed. We selected the five Native American  organizations to include organizations whose mission and scope focuses  in whole or in part on Native American juvenile justice issues and that  have a national or geographically-specific perspective. The views of these  organizations are not generalizable to all Native American organizations  but provide valuable insights.", "To address our second objective on discretionary grant programs that  federal agencies fund that could help prevent or address delinquency  among Native American youth, we analyzed discretionary grants and  cooperative agreements available for funding from fiscal years 2015  through 2017. To identify the discretionary grants and cooperative  agreements, we conducted a keyword search of \u201cyouth or juvenile\u201d in  Grants.gov\u2014an online repository that houses information on over 1,000  different grants across federal grant-making agencies. For the purposes  of this review, we define \u201cdiscretionary grant programs\u201d to include both  discretionary grants and cooperative agreements. We focused on  discretionary grants and cooperative agreements because federal  agencies generally award them to an array of entities based on a  competitive review process, whereas federal agencies are generally  required by statute to limit awards from the other types of grants to  specific entities, typically U.S. state, local, and territorial governments. We  then reviewed the search results of the three agencies with the highest  number of grant program matches\u2014DOI, DOJ, and the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS). Two analysts independently read  the Grants.gov summary descriptions of the programs included in these  search results and selected programs for which the description related to  risk or protective factors discussed in the DOJ Office of Juvenile  Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Tribal Youth in the  Juvenile Justice System literature review;  risk or protective factors identified in the July 2015 Technical  Assistance Network for Children\u2019s Behavioral Health brief on  American Indian and Alaska Native Youth in the Juvenile Justice  System;  juvenile justice system reform principles, findings, or  recommendations identified in Chapter 4 of the November 2014  Attorney General\u2019s Advisory Committee on American Indian/Alaska  Native Children Exposed to Violence report, Ending Violence so  Children Can Thrive;or proposals to reform the juvenile justice system identified in Chapter 6  of the November 2013 Indian Law and Order Commission Report to  the President and Congress of the United States, A Roadmap for  Making Native America Safer.", "We also used the following principles to identify and select relevant grant  programs:", "We excluded grant programs that focused specifically on victims as  opposed to at risk youth or offenders.", "We included grant programs that specify tribes or Native Americans if  the program\u2019s funding opportunity announcement mentioned youth  explicitly.", "We included grant programs that do not specify tribes or Native  Americans as a primary beneficiary if the program\u2019s funding  opportunity announcement mentioned youth explicitly and if the  program focused primarily on serving youth populations.", "After two analysts independently completed their initial determinations of  which grant programs they considered relevant, they either confirmed  their agreement or discussed any differences of opinion until they reached a consensus.

We provided a list of the grant programs  that we identified to DOJ and HHS for confirmation both during and after  fiscal year 2017. Our final list of grant programs includes 122 programs.  Despite these steps, it is possible that our analysis did not identify all  relevant grant programs.", "We next determined which of 122 grant programs we identified specified  tribes or Native Americans as a primary beneficiary and which did not by  reviewing funding opportunity announcements for the programs to  determine if the funding opportunity announcement\u2019s title, executive  summary, overview, or purpose specifically referenced tribes or Native  Americans as the main or one of few beneficiaries of the proposed grant  program funding. After a first analyst completed initial determinations of  which of the grant programs specified tribes or Native Americans as a  primary beneficiary, a second analyst reviewed those determinations and  either confirmed agreement or discussed any differences of opinion until  both analysts reached a consensus. We categorized each program into  one or more issue areas (e.g., violence or trauma, substance abuse,  mentoring, etc.). We used the risk and protective factors discussed in the  OJJDP Tribal Youth in the Juvenile Justice System literature review as  initial issue areas and added additional areas, as needed, for programs  that did not fit within the initial areas.", "To determine the extent to which tribal governments or Native American  organizations had access to the 122 grant programs, we reviewed both  the eligibility of those organizations to apply for the grant programs and  their level of success in applying for the grant programs.

We also reviewed a non-generalizable  sample of applications from 37 grant programs to determine the extent to  which tribal governments and Native American organizations applied for  these grant programs. Specifically, we requested the sample of  applications from each of the five DOJ OJP offices and bureaus and  seven HHS operating divisions from which we identified the 122 grant  programs that either had a relatively larger estimated total program  funding amount on Grants.gov for fiscal years 2015, 2016, or 2017 than  other grant programs within the same OJP offices or HHS operating  divisions or had specified tribes or Native Americans as a primary  beneficiary.

Specifically, because the  Northern Cheyenne facility is centrally located, they said it admits youth  from other tribes which have grown accustomed to sending their youth to  the facility. BIA officials also noted that the Northern Cheyenne facility  services an area where there is a high rate of delinquency among youth,  and because the facility works well with Native American youth struggling  with delinquency issues, many tribes elect to send their delinquent youth  to the facility.
