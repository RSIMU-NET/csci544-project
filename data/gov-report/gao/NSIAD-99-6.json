With these stocks prepositioned near danger spots, U.S. response times to a crisis are shortened, since only the troops and a relatively modest amount of materiel must be brought by air to an area where the stocks are located. With fewer troops stationed abroad today, prepositioning has become increasingly important. All four military services have programs to preposition a broad range of stocks to be used for various purposes. Some stocks are positioned afloat, which allows responsiveness nearly anywhere in the world, and other stocks are stored ashore near the likely areas of conflict in the Persian Gulf and Korea. This report focuses on the Army and Air Force prepositioning programs because of concerns that emerged about the sufficiency, condition, and management of their prepositioned stocks. The Navy and Marine Corps prepositioning programs are discussed in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prepositioned Materiel Helps Speed Response to Crises", "paragraphs": ["The goal of prepositioning programs is to make military equipment and supplies available to deploying forces faster than would otherwise be possible. The U.S. military can deliver equipment and supplies in three ways: by air, by sea, or by prepositioning. While airplanes travel quickly, they are expensive to use and impractical for moving all the materiel needed for a large-scale deployment. And though ships can carry large loads, they are slow. Prepositioning lessens the strain of using expensive airlift and reduces reliance on relatively slow sealift deliveries. In its 1997 Annual Report to the President and the Congress, DOD noted that moving an Army brigade of soldiers and 20,000 tons of equipment from the United States to the conflict area (by sea and air) would take 20 to 30 days. By contrast, fully deploying a prepositioned brigade should take just 4 days because only the soldiers, with a small amount of equipment, would be flown to the location of the prepositioned stocks.", "Although the concept of prepositioning is not new, it has gained importance in the post-Cold War world. Since its 1993 Bottom-Up Review, DOD has focused on maintaining capabilities to fight and win major conflicts in the Persian Gulf region and on the Korean peninsula. Concerned about the reduction in U.S. forces overseas and their ability to move forces in the time required to resolve potential conflicts quickly, the services have expanded prepositioning ashore and on ships in those regions. In the Persian Gulf, where the United States has few permanent forces, prepositioned stocks would be the primary source of combat equipment for ground troops and would be critical in setting up air bases there. In Korea, the Army has prepositioned a brigade set to augment the combat capabilities of U.S. forces there.", "While prepositioning figured prominently in the previous mobility studies performed by DOD, the Quadrennial Defense Review completed in 1997 did not consider prepositioning as a major part of its scope. Instead, DOD officials told us that prepositioning was to be reconsidered as part of the planned update to the mobility studies, scheduled to begin in 1999.", "The services generally measure the readiness of prepositioned stocks by determining their inventory fill and maintenance condition\u2014that is, do they have the required stocks on hand and are those stocks in condition to fulfill the mission. To assess inventory fill, the rate of fill is compared to the requirements. These requirements must be valid to achieve a reliable objective assessment. To assess both inventory levels and maintenance condition, the services must have reliable information about the on-hand stocks and their current condition. Other factors affecting the readiness of the prepositioned stocks are their location, that is, are they close to where they are needed, and the training of the units to use them. Unless required stocks are available and in good condition, the purpose of prepositioning may be defeated because the deploying unit will lose valuable time repairing or replacing equipment.", "To provide a context within which to assess the services\u2019 programs, we used the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), which suggests that agencies working toward results-oriented management should take three steps, including (1) defining their mission and identifying desired outcomes; (2) measuring performance; and (3) using performance information to improve organizational processes, identify gaps, and set goals for improvement.", "We have published several reports about prepositioning, including three in 1997 about various aspects of the Army\u2019s program.

Since the 1996 terrorist bombing in Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia force protection issues have been a paramount concern in the region. Without sufficient bare base equipment, airmen could be housed at host nation facilities (for example hotels, barracks, and apartments), rather than at bare base locations where special security precautions can be provided.

By late 1997, the Air Combat Command had determined the gross number of prepositioned vehicles it believes will be needed to support a major war in the Persian Gulf region. This worst-case assessment assumes no host nation support. The Air Force has not yet determined how many vehicles would be available from host nation sources, which will offset the number of vehicles that the Air Force must supply. This is part of the base support planning process. This information would be helpful in determining what vehicle requirements could be met by host nation sources. Like the bare base program, the Air Force needs to consider changes to operational plans and the move toward smaller expeditionary force deployments because these will likely change the number of vehicles required in the prepositioning program.", "The Air Force also has not defined requirements for prepositioned vehicles in Europe. The current requirement in Europe is outdated and is based on Cold War plans. As a result, at one location in Europe, the Air Force is storing and maintaining over 900 vehicles that may no longer be needed or that could be used elsewhere in the Air Force. Since no major conflict is envisioned in Europe, Air Force officials do not believe they will need a large number of vehicles there. Air Force officials told us that some vehicles may be needed to augment vehicle stocks elsewhere or to help move personnel, equipment, and supplies through European air bases to potential conflict areas. However, many of these vehicles, especially general purpose vehicles such as trucks and buses, are old and some are obsolete. Figure 3.2 shows vehicles in Europe awaiting disposition decisions.", "In recent years, the Air Force has sought in some locations to obtain vehicles from host nation sources or to lease vehicles when possible. In Korea, for example, the U.S. Air Forces, Pacific, is relying heavily on host nation support to provide general purpose vehicles for the prepositioning program. Air Force managers are concerned, however, that leasing vehicles will not solve the problems within the prepositioning program, since even general purpose vehicles may not be readily available in some areas outside of the United States. This is particularly the case in the Persian Gulf, where Air Force managers are concerned that leasing vehicles could be significantly more expensive than purchasing them. Based on experience, some support by host nations is likely. During the Gulf War, allies provided thousands of general purpose vehicles for use by U.S. forces, according to the Air Force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Has Little Reliable Data to Measure Vehicle Program Readiness", "paragraphs": ["In addition to our concerns about the requirements underpinning the program, we found that the Air Force has little reliable data with which to measure the readiness of its vehicle program.

In implementing GPRA, the Air Force must have reliable data\u2014like inventory fill and maintenance condition\u2014with which to measure the performance of its prepositioned vehicle program.", "In 1996, the Air Force Inspector General reported that the Air Force did not have an accurate accounting of the prepositioned vehicles in the Persian Gulf. In June 1998, officials from the Air Combat Command conducted physical inventories to determine how many and what type of vehicles were actually on hand. One Air Force manager estimated that it might take as much as a year to manually load this information into Air Force systems. Until that time, the Air Force will be unable to accurately assess its inventory levels in the Persian Gulf.", "The Air Force could not provide detailed information on the condition of its prepositioned vehicles. Thus, it is difficult to assess readiness comprehensively. However, much of the Air Force\u2019s vehicle fleet is aging and in poor condition. In July 1996, the Air Force Inspector General reported that prepositioned vehicles were aging and that a high number of them were not mission capable at some locations. Our examination of vehicles at storage locations we visited indicated that the condition of the vehicles is similar today. During our field visits, we found large numbers of vehicles that were not mission capable. Air Force managers noted that many vehicles are old, have surpassed the end of their projected service life, and are difficult to maintain. Furthermore, Air Force officials told us that vehicles have received a relatively low priority for funding due to a concern that considerable excesses existed throughout the Air Force after the Cold War."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Vehicles Prepositioned in Persian Gulf Region", "paragraphs": ["In the Gulf region, the Air Force\u2019s contractor reported that 977 of the 2,414 vehicles (40 percent) at major storage locations in Oman and Bahrain were not mission capable. About 13 percent were in use. (See fig. 3.3.) These figures represent the vehicles managed by the Air Force\u2019s contractor in Oman and Bahrain but do not represent all vehicles in the Gulf region.", "The Air Force\u2019s largest storage area in the Persian Gulf region is in Thumrait, Oman. At Thumrait, the Air Force stores over 1,700 of the vehicles depicted in figure 3.3. Over 40 percent of these vehicles were not mission capable as of July 1998. Officials estimated that it would take 2 to 3 years to repair the vehicles if there are no further deployments. Most vehicles are stored outside because the site does not have covered storage facilities. This exposes vehicles to the extreme heat and blowing sand of the Omani desert. During our visit, we found numerous vehicles with heat-related damage, including damaged windshields and blown tires. Figure 3.4 shows an example of damage caused by lack of storage facilities combined with extreme desert conditions.", "Even if the vehicles were mission capable, the storage site is several hours from the nearest port, and it would likely take weeks to move the vehicles from Thumrait to operating locations throughout the region. This may defeat the basic purpose of the program, which is to locate this equipment where it can be drawn quickly when needed. When vehicles are stored in centralized storage locations like Thumrait and not at the locations where they will be used, a plan for moving the vehicles quickly to their operating locations is needed. The Air Force, however, has not developed plans for moving the vehicles it has in theater to their planned operating locations. Moving these assets to their final operating locations is likely to be chaotic and prolonged, even with a plan, according to Air Force managers. Thumrait is located in a remote area of Oman that presents considerable challenges to moving vehicles to their eventual operating locations. The site is about 4 hours from the nearest port by mountainous roads. During the 3- to 4-month monsoon season, this road can be nearly impassable, and transporting vehicles could take even longer. In the event of a major conflict, quickly moving over 1,700 vehicles from this site would pose a significant challenge and is a concern to Air Force officials.", "Vehicles stored in other locations in the Gulf are also in poor condition. In an open storage location near Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, the Air Force has stored about 840 vehicles for several years without conducting maintenance, sheltering them from the elements, or establishing accountability. Many of the vehicles were left at this location in 1995 and are in poor condition, according to Air Force officials. In mid-1998, the Air Force estimated that about 600 of these vehicles could be salvaged. The Air Force is currently working to have these vehicles repaired and moved into storage at other locations in the region. The cost or time required to repair these vehicles has not been fully determined. The remaining vehicles, about 240, are not salvageable and have been, or will be, discarded.", "In some cases, maintenance problems have hampered deploying unit operations. For example, a unit that deployed in mid-1997 to an operating location in Bahrain found that 37 of the 130 vehicles (28 percent) they were issued from prepositioned stocks were not mission capable. Some of these vehicles were critical to generating combat sorties, for example, refueling trucks and aircraft towing vehicles, and needed immediate repair before they were used. Problems ranged from damaged tires to bad brakes and other major mechanical defects. These vehicles had been reported as mission capable when issued to the deploying unit. According to the inspection report of the incident, operations were hampered while unit maintenance personnel repaired the vehicles.", "Heavy peacetime use of war reserve vehicles to support operations has also contributed to condition problems. According to the Air Force\u2019s contractor in the Gulf region, Airwork Vinnell, keeping pace with the constant requests for prepositioned vehicles is extremely difficult. Representatives told us that once they repair vehicles, many of them are shipped elsewhere in the theater to support ongoing operations. They ship vehicles that are in the best working condition, leaving nonmission-capable vehicles behind at the storage locations. This frustrates their efforts to improve mission-capable rates. Also, vehicles that are returned after deployment are often in poor condition and require significant repairs before they can be restored to mission-capable status. Sometimes, vehicles are cannibalized and are returned missing significant parts, like the high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles shown in figure 3.5.

Vehicle storage and maintenance problems currently exist in some locations in the Pacific. Air Force officials reviewed operations at each base in the Pacific region in November 1997 and in a report of this visit cited improvements but also significant storage and maintenance problems at some locations. For example, at Osan Air Base, Korea, problems with the 350-vehicle fleet included (1) delayed maintenance on some vehicles due to lack of orders to initiate the work, (2) improper storage practices and unreported damage, and (3) heavy use of the prepositioned vehicles to augment the peacetime fleet at this location. The report also raised vehicle maintenance as a problem area at Kunsan Air Base, Korea. During our review, no maintenance contract had been secured for the site, and the lack of local, trained mechanics as well as extensive peacetime use of these vehicles were noted as negatively affecting the program.
