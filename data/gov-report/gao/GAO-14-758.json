As the following table shows, these large-scale data collections varied from about 11,000 consumer arbitration case records from a trade association to 173 million mortgage loans from a data aggregator. Of the 12 large-scale collections GAO reviewed, 3 included information that identified individual consumers, but CFPB staff indicated that those 3 were not subject to statutory restrictions on collecting such information. Other regulators, such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), collect similarly large amounts of data.", "CFPB has taken steps to protect and secure these data collections. For example, it created a data intake process that brings together staff with relevant expertise to consider the statutory, privacy, and information security implications of proposed consumer financial data collections. CFPB staff described a process for anonymizing large-scale data collections that directly identify individuals. In addition, CFPB had taken steps to implement an information security program that is consistent with Federal Information Security Management Act requirements, according to the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Reserve and CFPB. GAO found that CFPB had implemented logical access controls for the information system that maintains the consumer financial data collections and was appropriately scanning for problems or vulnerabilities. CFPB also established a risk-management process for the information system that maintains consumer financial data consistent with guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).", "However, GAO determined that additional efforts are needed in several areas to reduce the risk of improper collection, use, or release of consumer financial data.", "Written procedures and documentation: CFPB lacks written procedures and comprehensive documentation for a number of processes, including data intake and information security risk assessments. The lack of written procedures could result in inconsistent application of the established practices. For example, CFPB unnecessarily retained sensitive data in two collections GAO reviewed, but its staff said they plan to remove this information. GAO recommends CFPB establish or enhance written procedures for (1) data intake, including reviews of proposed data collections for compliance with applicable legal requirements and restrictions; (2) anonymizing data; (3) assessing and managing privacy risks; and (4) monitoring and auditing privacy controls; and (5) documenting results of information security risk-assessments consistently and comprehensively.", "Implementation of privacy and security steps: CFPB has not yet fully implemented a number of privacy control steps and information security practices, which could hamper the agency's ability to identify and monitor privacy risks and protect consumer financial data. GAO recommends CFPB take or complete action to (1) develop a comprehensive written privacy plan that brings together existing privacy policies and guidance; (2) obtain periodic independent reviews of its privacy practices; (3) develop and implement targeted privacy training for staff responsible for working with sensitive personal information; (4) update remedial action plans to include all identified weaknesses and realistic planned remediation dates that reflect priorities and resources; and (5) include an evaluation of compliance with contract provisions relating to information security in CFPB's review of the service provider that processes consumer financial data on its behalf.", "Paperwork Reduction Act compliance: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), agencies generally must obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval when collecting data from 10 or more entities to minimize burden and maximize the practical utility of the information collected. CFPB and OCC collect, on an ongoing basis, credit card data from different institutions\u2014representing about 87 percent of outstanding credit card balances\u2014and agreed to share data. However, OMB staff said the agencies' collections and data-sharing agreement may warrant OMB review and approval. Additional consultation with OMB regarding these collections and the data-sharing agreement would help both agencies ensure they are fully complying with the law. Furthermore, OCC had not obtained OMB approval for its credit card and mortgage data collections, which each included more than nine entities. Without approval, OCC lacks reasonable assurance that its collections comply with PRA requirements intended to reduce burden.

CFPB staff told us examiners generally  request financial institutions\u2019 account- and transaction-level data to  conduct various analyses and test for compliance with relevant federal  consumer financial laws, and they instruct institutions to alert CFPB if  their prudential regulators already have collected the requested data, so  that they can coordinate efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB Also Has Used Its Market Monitoring Authority and Voluntary Requests to Collect Data", "paragraphs": ["CFPB also has used its market monitoring authority, as well as voluntary  data submissions, to collect data.

According to the Chief Information Security  Officer, CFPB has been making steady progress towards remediating the  findings that make up this high-risk weakness; however, as of June 2014,  CFPB had not addressed all these findings or updated the scheduled  completion date in the remedial action plan to reflect the current timeline  for completing these actions.", "Ensuring that its remedial action plans are comprehensive and updated to  reflect current timeframes for remediating weaknesses would enhance  CFPB\u2019s ability to identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor the progress of  corrective efforts for security weaknesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CFPB Developed a Process for Evaluating Service Providers but Initial Assessments Were Not Comprehensive", "paragraphs": ["Under the FISMA information security program, agencies are required to  develop a risk-management process that helps ensure that information  and information systems provided or managed by another agency,  contractor, or other source are protected with appropriate information  security controls. CFPB has developed a risk management process that  covers all agreements and contracts between CFPB and service  providers that process information on its behalf. One step in the process  is conducting assessments of these service providers based on the types  of applications, tools, or services provided. Once the appropriate  assessment is conducted, CFPB generates a risk assessment and  recommendation form, including appropriate risk mitigation activities. The  form is then submitted to the appropriate approval authorities. CFPB also  tracks the implementation of its recommendations by creating risk  mitigation items and activities that will be tracked through CFPB\u2019s  remedial action plans.", "Some actions have been taken to assess whether the service provider  that processes consumer financial data on CFPB\u2019s behalf was  implementing adequate protections. We reviewed a 2012 report by the  service provider\u2019s independent auditor about certain controls the provider  had in place. The independent auditor found the controls were suitably  designed to provide reasonable assurance that control objectives would  be achieved and that the tested controls were operating effectively  throughout the review period. Officials from the provider told us that other  federal agencies for which they process data also have reviewed their  information security program. In addition, they said they had never had a  breach of the environment in which they process and maintain CFPB\u2019s  data. CFPB also conducted an initial review of this service provider to  assess the risks associated with utilizing the providers\u2019 systems and  services, and documented the findings and recommendations, which  were reviewed and approved in March 2014. CFPB\u2019s contract with the  service provider includes specific information security requirements and  states that CFPB shall conduct annual reviews to help ensure security  requirements in the contract are implemented, enforced, effective, and  operating as intended. However, CFPB did not examine how the provider  had implemented these requirements as part of its initial review of this  provider.", "Without effectively reviewing its service provider and following its own  process of tracking risk mitigation items and activities, CFPB lacks  assurance that it is fully safeguarding its information resources and  making fully informed decisions related to managing risk and  implementing risk mitigation controls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To better detect risks in consumer financial markets and improve federal  oversight of consumer financial protection laws, CFPB has collected  consumer financial data on products ranging from credit card accounts to  payday loans. CFPB has used the consumer financial data it collects to  inform required rulemakings, develop examination strategies, and issue  congressionally mandated reports. Recognizing the sensitivity of some of  the consumer financial data it has collected, CFPB has taken steps to  protect and secure these data collections, including adopting high-level  privacy and security policies and processes. For example, the agency  created a data intake process that brings together staff with relevant  expertise to consider the statutory, privacy, and information security  implications of proposals to collect consumer financial data. Staff also  described a process for anonymizing large-scale data collections that  directly identify individuals. In addition, CFPB recently developed  overarching policies on information governance and privacy impact  assessments.", "However, CFPB staff said they were primarily focused on taking  necessary actions to effectively carry out their mission during these early  years of agency operations and as a result, a number of policies and  processes were not fully documented or implemented, as required by  federal internal control guidelines or outlined in NIST guidance. In  particular:", "Lack of written procedures: CFPB lacks written procedures for its  data intake process, including for evaluating whether statutory  restrictions related to collecting personally identifiable financial  information apply to large-scale data collections, documenting  determinations of whether these collections are subject to PRA, and  assessing and managing privacy risks of these collections. CFPB has  not established written procedures for anonymizing data collections to  help ensure staff take the appropriate steps each time or for  monitoring and auditing privacy controls. In addition, CFPB did not  consistently or comprehensively document its information security  risk-assessment results. Developing written procedures with  consistent, comprehensive documentation requirements would help  provide CFPB with reasonable assurance that its collections comply  with statutory requirements and that it will not place consumers\u2019  privacy at risk.", "Incomplete implementation of privacy and security steps: CFPB  has not yet developed a comprehensive privacy plan that brings  together existing policies and guidance. It has not established a  regular schedule of periodic reviews of its privacy program, or  completed development of a role-based privacy training program.  CFPB also did not capture all information security weaknesses  identified in its remedial action plans or update the plans to include  current planned dates for remediation based on priorities and  available resources. In addition, CFPB did not comprehensively  evaluate the service provider that processes consumer financial data  on its behalf for compliance with contract provisions. Taking these  actions will help strengthen CFPB\u2019s privacy program and enhance its  ability to identify, track, and mitigate security risks to consumer  financial data stored on its systems.", "Insufficient efforts on PRA compliance: CFPB did not sufficiently  document its consultation with OMB about the information-sharing  agreement with OCC relating to the agencies\u2019 separate credit card  collections and the implications under PRA, and OMB staff told us it  warranted further review. OCC also had not sought OMB approval for  its credit card and mortgage data collections even though it now  obtains data from more than nine entities for each of these collections.  Obtaining further guidance from OMB on whether the information- sharing agreement requires CFPB and OCC to follow procedures  outlined in PRA and getting OMB approval for OCC\u2019s credit card and  mortgage data collections would help both agencies ensure they fully  comply with the law, do not unduly burden financial institutions, and  maximize the practical utility of the information collected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve CFPB\u2019s efforts to protect and secure collected consumer  financial data, we are making the following 11 recommendations to the  Director of CFPB.", "To help ensure consistent implementation of its current processes and  practices, the Director of CFPB should establish or enhance written  procedures for:  1.  the data intake process, including reviews of proposed data  collections for compliance applicable legal requirements and  restrictions and documentation requirements for consultations with  OMB about PRA applicability;  2.  anonymizing data, including how staff should assess data  sensitivity, which steps to take to anonymize data fields, and  responsibilities for reviews of anonymized data collections;  3.  assessing and managing privacy risks, including documentation  requirements to support statements about potential privacy risks in  PIAs and for determinations that PIAs are not required;  4.  monitoring and auditing privacy controls; and  5.  documenting information security risk-assessment results  consistently and comprehensively to include all NIST- recommended elements.", "To enhance the protection of collected consumer financial data, the  Director of CFPB should fully implement the following five privacy and  security steps:  1.  develop a comprehensive written privacy plan that brings together  existing privacy policies and guidance;  2.  obtain periodic reviews of the privacy program\u2019s practices as part  of the independent audit of CFPB\u2019s operations and budget;  3.  develop and implement role-based privacy training;  4.  update remedial plans for the information system that maintains  consumer financial data and related components to include all  identified weaknesses and realistic scheduled completion dates  that reflect current priorities and available resources; and  5.  include an evaluation of compliance with contract provisions  relating to information security in CFPB\u2019s review of the service  provider that processes consumer financial data for CFPB.", "To provide greater assurance of compliance with PRA, the Director of  CFPB should also consult further with OMB about whether PRA  requirements apply to its credit card data collection and information- sharing agreement with OCC, and document the result of this  consultation.", "We are also making a recommendation to the Comptroller of the  Currency.

Our review focused on  large-scale consumer financial data collections CFPB obtained under  supervisory or market monitoring authorities, as well as voluntary  requests, and not data collected related to consumer complaints or for  investigative or enforcement purposes. We studied 12 large-scale CFPB  data collections that included consumer financial data the agency was  collecting or had collected during the period from January 1, 2012 through  July 1, 2014. CFPB research staff identified and confirmed that these 12  data collections represented the extent of large-scale data collections  from multiple institutions being studied by CFPB staff during this time  period. We excluded any planned data collections or collections under  development. We focused our analysis of CFPB\u2019s data collections,  studies, and examination materials on consumer financial data collections  that occurred since January 2012, as CFPB had limited data collections  before that time.", "We physically reviewed several of CFPB\u2019s large-scale data collections  on-site: consumer credit report information, credit cards, deposit advance  products, overdraft fees, storefront payday loans, and private student  loans. For the other large-scale collections we reviewed the data field  names and descriptions: Mortgages (Corelogic contract), private-label  mortgages (Blackbox Logic contract), automobile sales, online payday  loans, credit scores, and arbitration case records. We did not assess the  appropriateness of any individual fields for which CFPB is collecting data.  We interviewed CFPB staff from the Research, Markets, and Regulation  and Supervision, Fair Lending, and Enforcement teams as well as CFPB  legal staff.", "To describe the data collections from other prudential regulators as well  as any overlap or duplication of efforts, we reviewed relevant agency  publications and interviewed officials and staff from the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration. We also  reviewed the Federal Reserve\u2019s public notifications about its collections  for conducting bank holding company stress tests (Y-14 collections),  which included notices in the Federal Register about its credit card and  mortgage data collections, and OCC\u2019s documents related its credit card  and mortgage data collections, including its contract with a data  aggregator. We also reviewed the large scale consumer financial data  collections of OCC, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve to determine whether  they contained information that directly identifies individuals.

To describe the ways in which  CFPB coordinates with other regulators on data collections, we reviewed  memorandums of understanding and information-sharing agreements  CFPB has with other federal regulators and interviewed regulatory staff.  We focused our review on the CFPB\u2019s information-sharing agreements  for large-scale data collections: one with FHFA for the National Mortgage  Database and another with OCC for the credit card database, and  interviewed relevant staff at each of these agencies about the  agreements and developments of the data sharing.", "To describe what is known about the costs and benefits of CFPB\u2019s data  collections, we reviewed CFPB contracts, reports, rulemakings,  testimonies and responses to congressional questions. To learn more  about financial institutions\u2019 experiences providing consumer financial data  and how these experiences compared with other prudential regulators,  we interviewed representatives from 9 financial institutions. We randomly  selected and interviewed eight institutions that are supervised by CFPB  and that provide credit card account data to either CFPB or OCC on an  ongoing basis. We also randomly selected and interviewed 1 additional  financial institution to interview that was supervised by CFPB but does not  provide credit card data on an ongoing basis. In addition to the interviews  with representatives of these 9 institutions, we reviewed examination  workpapers from 10 randomly selected institutions. We reviewed  information requests and supervisory letters from 46 examinations at  these institutions that were completed in 2012 and 2013. We also  reviewed reports and interviewed staff from organizations that analyzed  privacy issues, monitored consumer financial topics, and served as  industry associations for financial institutions.", "To determine the extent to which CFPB complied with federal data  collection requirements and privacy protections, we reviewed CFPB  privacy policies and information-sharing protocols, training requirements,  and public and nonpublic notices about collections involving personal or  direct identifiers.

We compared CFPB\u2019s current information  security policies and procedures against the NIST risk-assessment  framework, which emphasizes the selection, implementation, and  monitoring of security controls, and the authorization of information  systems. We reviewed and analyzed documentation and policies related  to CFPB\u2019s system security plan, risk assessments, security assessment  reports, and remedial action plans and compared each against applicable  NIST and CFPB-defined standards. We evaluated the extent to which  CFPB has established and implemented policies and procedures to  ensure its service providers provide adequate security protections over  the consumer financial data which is collected and maintained on its  behalf. This was done by reviewing and analyzing documentation of  CFPB\u2019s evaluation of a service provider and comparing it against CFBP  requirements. We reviewed prior audit work conducted by the Inspector  General for the Federal Reserve and CFPB in this area. We interviewed  the Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and other  CFPB staff about these policies, procedures, and reports. We reviewed  logical access controls for the information system component in which  CFPB stores and analyzes consumer financial data.
