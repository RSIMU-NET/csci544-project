The attributes require trade-offs and policy choices to implement. In concept, the General Schedule's (GS) design reflects some of the eight attributes, but falls short of achieving them in implementation. For example, the GS system's grade levels provide internal equity by making it easy to compare employees in the same occupation and grade level across different agencies. However, the number of grade levels can reduce transparency because making clear distinctions between the levels may be nuanced, as the basis for them hinges on, for example, how officials determine the complexity of the work.", "Performance management", "Effective performance management systems enable managers to make meaningful distinctions in performance in order to reward top performers and deal with poor performers. In 2011, five agencies piloted the Goals-Engagement-Accountability-Results (GEAR) framework to help improve performance management.

These problems include wait times at Department of Veterans Affairs  medical facilities; management of oil and gas operations by the  Department of the Interior; information technology management at the  Social Security Administration; rail safety inspections by the Federal  Railroad Administration; and acquisition management at the Departments  of Defense and Homeland Security. All of these examples share a  common problem: a breakdown of one or more human capital activities  such as robust workforce planning or performance management.", "Strategic human capital management has been a GAO high-risk area  since 2001. Since then, Congress, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), and some individual agencies have made substantial progress  toward addressing the government\u2019s human capital challenges. For  example, in 2002 Congress created the chief human capital officer  (CHCO) position in 24 agencies to advise and assist the heads of the  agencies with human capital efforts. The same law created the CHCO  Council to advise and coordinate the human capital activities of member  agencies.

Almost since its inception in 1949, questions have been raised about the GS system\u2019s  ability to keep pace with the evolving complexity and nature of federal  work, and this hearing provides an important opportunity for Congress to  review the GS system and consider how well it is aging.", "My remarks today will focus on the General Schedule and the extent to  which it has the attributes of a modern and effective classification system.

As we concluded in our report,  without careful attention to strategic and workforce planning and other  approaches to managing and engaging personnel, the reduced  investments in human capital can have lasting, detrimental effects on the  capacity of an agency\u2019s workforce to meet its mission.", "2 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(c).", "Officer (CFO) Act agencies we reviewed,10 had a lower number of  career permanent employees in 2012 than they did in 2004, 13 had a  greater number, and 1, the Department of Transportation, was  unchanged.", "Earlier this year we reported that 31 percent of all career permanent  employees who were on board in September 2012 will become eligible to  retire in September 2017. As shown in figure 3 below, not all agencies  will be equally affected by this trend. By 2017, 20 of the 24 CFO Act  agencies will have a higher percentage of staff eligible to retire than the  current 31 percent government-wide. For example, about 21 percent of  DHS staff on board as of September 2012 will be eligible to retire in 2017,  while over 42 percent will be eligible to retire at both the Department of  Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration.  Certain occupations\u2014such as air traffic controllers and those involved in  program management\u2014will also have particularly high retirement  eligibility rates by 2017.", "Various factors affect when individuals actually retire, and some amount  of retirement and other forms of attrition can be beneficial because it  creates opportunities to bring fresh skills on board and allows  organizations to restructure themselves in order to better meet program  goals and fiscal realities. But if turnover is not strategically monitored and  managed, gaps can develop in an organization\u2019s institutional knowledge  and leadership. The high projected retirement eligibility rates across  government underscore the importance of effective succession planning.", "According to OPM, factors such as a 3-year pay freeze, automatic  reductions from sequestration that included furloughs for hundreds of  thousands of employees, and reductions in training and other areas have  taken their toll on the federal workforce. In the 2013 Employee Viewpoint  Survey results, the \u201cglobal satisfaction index\u201d showed an 8-percentage- point decline since 2010. Each of the four factors that make up the global  satisfaction index showed downward trends from last year\u2019s results:  job satisfaction dropped 3 points to 65 percent, pay satisfaction was down 5 points to 54 percent, organization satisfaction fell 3 points to 65 percent, and  respondents that said they would recommend their organization  declined by 4 points to 63 percent.", "As we reported earlier this year, to identify strategies for managing the  federal workforce and plan for future needs in an era of constrained  resources, we used several approaches including convening a full-day  forum that included 25 of the 27 members of the CHCO Council. Our  analysis and recommendations based on this effort provide an important  framework for prioritizing and modernizing current human capital  management practices to meet agencies\u2019 current and future missions.  The strategies included the following:  Strengthening collaboration to address a fragmented human capital  community. Our analysis found that the federal human capital  community is highly fragmented with multiple actors inside government  informing and executing personnel policies and initiatives in ways that are  not always aligned with broader, government-wide human capital efforts.  The CHCO Council was established to improve coordination across  federal agencies on personnel issues, but according to CHCOs, the  council is not carrying out this responsibility as well as it could. This  challenge manifests itself in two ways: across organizations, with many  actors making human capital decisions in an uncoordinated manner, and  within agencies, excluding CHCOs and the human capital staff from key  agency decisions.", "Using enterprise solutions to address shared challenges. Our  analysis found that agencies have many common human capital  challenges, but they tend to address these issues independently without  looking to enterprise solutions that could resolve them more effectively.  Across government, there are examples of agencies and OPM initiating  enterprise solutions to address crosscutting issues, including the  consolidation of federal payroll systems into shared-services centers.  CHCOs highlighted human resource information technology and strategic  workforce planning as two areas that are ripe for government-wide  collaboration.", "Creating more agile talent management to address inflexibilities in  the current system. Our analysis found talent management tools lack  two key ingredients for developing an agile workforce, namely the ability  to (1) identify the skills available in existing workforces, and (2) move  people with specific skills to address emerging, temporary, or permanent  needs within and across agencies.", "As we reported earlier this year, the CHCOs said OPM needs to do more  to raise awareness and assess the utility of the tools and guidance it  provides to agencies to address key human capital challenges. CHCOs  said they were either unfamiliar with OPM\u2019s tools and guidance or they  fell short of their agency\u2019s needs. OPM officials said they had not  evaluated the tools and guidance they provide to the agencies. As a  result, a key resource for helping agencies improve the capacity of their  personnel offices is likely being underutilized.", "Among other things, in our May 2014 report we recommended that the  Director of OPM, in conjunction with the CHCO Council, strengthen  OPM\u2019s coordination and leadership of government-wide human capital  issues to ensure government-wide initiatives are coordinated, decision  makers have all relevant information, and there is greater continuity in the  human capital community for key reforms. Specific steps could include,  for example, developing a government-wide human capital strategic plan  that, among other things, would establish strategic priorities, time frames,  responsibilities, and metrics to better align the efforts of members of the  federal human capital community with government-wide human capital  goals and issues. OPM and the CHCO Council concurred with these  recommendations and identified actions they plan to take to address  them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In conclusion, strategic human capital management must be the  centerpiece of any serious effort to ensure federal agencies operate as  high-performing organizations. A high-quality federal workforce is  especially critical now given the complex and cross-cutting issues facing  the nation.", "Through a variety of initiatives, Congress, OPM, and individual agencies  have strengthened the government\u2019s human capital efforts since we first  identified strategic human capital management as a high-risk area in  2001. Still, while much progress has been made over the last 13 years in  modernizing federal human capital management, the job is far from over.  Indeed, the focus areas discussed today are not an exhaustive list of  challenges facing federal agencies and are long-standing in nature.", "Greater progress will require continued collaborative efforts between  OPM, the CHCO Council, and individual agencies, as well as the  continued attention of top-level leadership. Progress will also require  effective planning, responsive implementation, robust measurement and  evaluation, and continued congressional oversight to hold agencies  accountable for results.", "In short, while the core human capital processes and functions\u2014such as  workforce planning and talent management\u2014may sound somewhat  bureaucratic and transactional, our prior work has consistently shown the  direct link between effective strategic human capital management, and  successful organizational performance. At the end of the day, strategic  human capital management is about mission accomplishment,  accountability, and responsive, cost-effective government.", "Chairman Farenthold, Ranking Member Lynch, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
