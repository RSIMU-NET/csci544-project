These new procedures applied risk-based,  intelligence-driven screening concepts and enhanced the use of  technology to determine passenger risk prior to travel. The procedures  were intended to allow TSA to devote more time and resources at the  airport to screening the passengers TSA determined to be higher or  unknown risk while providing expedited screening to those passengers  determined to pose a lower risk to the aviation system. Further, TSA  developed the Managed Inclusion process, designed to provide expedited  screening to passengers not deemed low risk prior to arriving at the  airport. In March 2015, TSA officials stated they provided expedited  screening at essentially all of the approximately 450 airports at which TSA  performs or oversees security screening, including 126 airports where  TSA offers expedited screening in dedicated TSA Pre\uf0fcTM screening  lanes. The 126 airports where expedited screening is offered in dedicated  TSA Pre\uf0fcTM screening lanes represent about 95 percent of total air  carrier enplanements based on Federal Aviation Administration calendar  year 2013 data.", "My testimony today addresses (1) how TSA assesses the risk levels of  passengers to determine their eligibility to receive expedited screening  and (2) the extent to which TSA determined the effectiveness of its  Managed Inclusion process.

In October 2011,  TSA began to expand the concept of expedited airport screening to more  of the flying public by piloting the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM program. This pilot  program allowed certain frequent fliers of two air carriers to experience  expedited screening at four airports. These frequent fliers became  eligible for screening in dedicated expedited screening lanes, called TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM lanes, because they had opted into the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM program  through the air carrier with which they had attained frequent flier status.  TSA also allowed certain members of the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection\u2019s (CBP) Trusted Traveler programs to experience expedited  screening as part of the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM pilot. TSA provided expedited  screening in dedicated screening lanes to these frequent fliers and  eligible CBP Trusted Travelers during the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM pilot program  because TSA used information available to it to determine that eligible  passengers in these groups were lower risk. When traveling on one of the  air carriers and departing from one of the airports participating in the pilot,  these passengers were eligible to be screened in dedicated TSA Pre\uf0fcTM  screening lanes where the passengers were not required to remove their  shoes; divest light outerwear, jackets, and belts; or remove liquids, gels,  and laptops from carry-on baggage.", "Since October 2011, TSA has further expanded the known traveler  populations eligible for expedited screening. After TSA piloted TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM with certain passengers who are frequent fliers and members of  CBP\u2019s Trusted Traveler programs, TSA established separate TSA Pre\uf0fcTM  lists for additional low-risk passenger populations, including members of  the U.S. armed forces, Congressional Medal of Honor Society Members,  members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council, and Members of  Congress, among others.other agencies or entities, TSA created its own TSA Pre\uf0fcTM list  composed of individuals who apply to be preapproved as low-risk  travelers through the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM Application Program, an initiative  launched in December 2013. To apply, individuals must visit an  enrollment center where they provide biographic information (i.e., name,  date of birth, and address), valid identity and citizenship documentation,   In addition to TSA Pre\uf0fcTM lists sponsored by  and fingerprints to undergo a TSA Security Threat Assessment.

As of March 2015, about 7.2 million individuals were eligible,  through TSA Pre\uf0fcTM lists, for expedited screening. Figure 1 shows the  populations for each TSA Pre\uf0fcTM list.", "In addition to passengers who are included on one of the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM  lists, in October 2013, TSA continued to expand the opportunities for  expedited screening to broader groups of passengers through the TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM Risk Assessment program and the Managed Inclusion process,  both of which are described in greater detail below. Figure 2 shows a  snapshot from February 25, 2015, through March 3, 2015, of the  percentage of weekly passengers receiving non-expedited screening and  expedited screening, and further shows whether known crew members  experienced expedited screening, and whether expedited screening  occurred in TSA Pre\uf0fcTM lanes (for passengers designated as known  travelers or through the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM Risk Assessment program, or  passengers chosen for expedited screening using Managed Inclusion), or  in standard lanes.", "As noted in figure 2, during the week ending March 3, 2015, 28 percent of  passengers nationwide received expedited screening were issued TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM boarding passes, but were provided expedited screening in a  standard screening lane, meaning that they did not have to remove their  shoes, belts, and light outerwear, but they had to divest their liquids, gels,  and laptops. TSA provides expedited screening to TSA Pre\uf0fcTM -eligible  passengers in standard lanes when airports do not have dedicated TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM screening lanes because of airport space constraints and limited  TSA Pre\uf0fcTM throughput."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Uses Three Methods to Assess Risk for Participation in Expedited Screening", "paragraphs": ["As we found in 2014, TSA determines a passenger\u2019s eligibility for or  opportunity to experience expedited screening at the airport using one of  three risk assessment methods.

For example, TSA  determined that members of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, a  group whose members have been awarded the highest U.S. award for  valor in action against enemy forces, present a low risk to transportation  security and are appropriate candidates to receive expedited screening.  In other cases, TSA determined that members of groups whose members  have undergone a security threat assessment by the federal government,  such as individuals working for agencies in the intelligence community  and who hold active Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information  clearances, are low risk and can be provided expedited screening.  Similarly, TSA designated all active and reserve service members of the  United States armed forces, whose combined members total about 2  million people, as a low risk group whose members were eligible for  expedited screening. TSA determined that active duty military members  were low risk and appropriate candidates to receive expedited screening  because the Department of Defense administers common background  checks of its members.", "Members of the list-based, low-risk populations who requested, or were otherwise  deemed eligible, to participate in TSA Pre\uf0fcTM were provided a unique known traveler  number. Their personal identifying information (name and date of birth) along with the  known traveler number are included on lists used by Secure Flight for screening.

According to TSA, this group of eligible frequent  fliers met the standards set for the pilot based on their frequent flier status  as of October 1, 2011. According to TSA officials, TSA determined that  these frequent fliers were an appropriate population to include in the  program for several reasons, including the fact that frequent fliers are  vetted against various watchlists, such as the No-Fly list, each time they  travel to ensure that they are not listed as known or suspected terrorists,  and are screened appropriately at the checkpoint."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passenger Eligibility Based On TSA Pre\uf0fcTM Risk Assessments", "paragraphs": ["As we found in December 2014, the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM Risk Assessment  program evaluates passenger risk based on certain information available  for the passenger\u2019s specific flight and determines the likelihood that  passengers will be designated as eligible to receive expedited screening  through TSA Pre\uf0fcTM. Beginning in 2011, TSA piloted the process of using  the Secure Flight system to obtain Secure Flight Passenger Data from air  carriers and other data to assess whether the passenger is low risk on a  per-flight basis and thus eligible to receive a TSA Pre\uf0fcTM designation on  his or her boarding pass to undergo expedited screening. In September  2013 after completing this pilot, TSA decided to explore expanding this  risk assessment approach to every traveler. In order to develop the set of  low-risk rules used to determine the passengers\u2019 relative risk, TSA formed  an Integrated Project Team consisting of officials from the Offices of  Security Operations, Intelligence and Analysis, Security Capabilities, and  Risk-Based Security. The team used data from multiple sources,  including passenger data from the Secure Flight system from calendar  year 2012, to derive a baseline level of relative risk for the entire  passenger population. Our review of TSA\u2019s documentation in our 2014  report showed that TSA considered the three elements of risk  assessment\u2014Threat, Vulnerability, and Consequence\u2014in its  development of the risk assessment. These three elements constitute the  framework for assessing risk as called for in the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s National Infrastructure Protection Plan. We found that TSA  worked with a contractor to evaluate the data elements taken from  information available for passengers\u2019 specific flights and the proposed risk  model rules used to determine the baseline level of relative risk. In its  assessment of the algorithm used for the analysis, the contractor agreed  with TSA\u2019s analysis of the relationship between the data elements and  relative risk assigned to the data elements. TSA officials stated that as  of March 2015, the agency is continuing to refine the algorithm to include  additional variables to help determine passenger risk.", "As we found in December 2014, although TSA determined that certain  combinations of data elements in its risk-based algorithm are less likely to  include unknown potential terrorists, it also noted that designating  passengers as low risk based solely on the algorithm carries some risk.  To mitigate these risks, TSA uses a random exclusion factor that places  passengers, even those who are otherwise eligible for expedited  screening, into standard screening a certain percentage of the time. TSA  adjusts the level of random exclusion based on the relative risk posed by  the combinations of various data elements used in the algorithm. The  result is that passengers associated with some data combinations that  carry more risk are randomly excluded from expedited screening more  often than passengers associated with other data combinations. For  example, TSA\u2019s assessment indicated that combinations of certain data  elements are considered relatively more risky than other data groups and  passengers who fit this profile for a given flight should seldom be eligible  for expedited screening, while combinations of other data on a given flight  pose relatively less risk and therefore passengers who fit these  combinations could be made eligible for expedited screening a majority of  the time. TSA developed a risk algorithm that scores each passenger on  each flight, and passengers with a high enough score receive a TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM boarding pass designation making them eligible for expedited  screening for that trip."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Passenger Eligibility Based on Real Time Threat Assessments Using Managed Inclusion Process", "paragraphs": ["As we found in December 2014, Managed Inclusion is designed to  provide expedited screening to passengers not deemed low risk prior to  arriving at the airport. TSA uses Managed Inclusion as a tool to direct  passengers who are not on a TSA Pre\uf0fcTM list, or designated as eligible  for expedited screening via the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM Risk Assessments, into the  expedited screening lanes to increase passenger throughput in these  lanes when the volume of TSA Pre\uf0fcTM -eligible passengers is low. In  addition, TSA developed Managed Inclusion to improve the efficiency of  dedicated TSA Pre\uf0fcTM screening lanes as well as to help TSA reach its  internal goal of providing expedited screening to at least 25 percent of  passengers by the end of calendar year 2013.", "To operate Managed Inclusion, TSA randomly directs a certain  percentage of passengers not previously designated that day as eligible  for expedited screening to the TSA Pre\uf0fcTM expedited screening lane. To  screen passengers who have been randomly directed into the expedited  screening lane, TSA uses real time threat assessments including  combinations of Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs), canine teams and  Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) devices to ensure that passengers do  not exhibit high-risk behaviors or otherwise present a risk at the airport.", "According to TSA, it designed the Managed Inclusion process using a  layered approach to provide security when providing expedited screening  to passengers via Managed Inclusion. Specifically, these layers include  (1) the Secure Flight vetting TSA performs to identify high-risk  passengers required to undergo enhanced screening at the checkpoint  and to ensure these passengers are not directed to TSA Pre\uf0fcTM  expedited screening lanes, (2) a randomization process that TSA uses to  include passengers into TSA Pre\uf0fcTM screening lanes who otherwise were  not eligible for expedited screening, (3) BDOs who observe passengers  and look for certain high-risk behaviors, (4) canine teams and ETD  devices that help ensure that passengers have not handled explosive  materials prior to travel, and (5) an unpredictable screening process  involving walk-through metal detectors in expedited screening lanes that  randomly select a percentage of passengers for additional screening."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Managed Inclusion Process", "paragraphs": ["When passengers approach a security checkpoint that is operating  Managed Inclusion, they approach a TSO who is holding a randomizer  device, typically an iPad that directs the passenger to the expedited or  standard screening lane. TSA officials stated that the randomization layer  of security is intended to ensure that passengers cannot count on being  screened in the expedited screening lane even if they use a security  checkpoint that is operating Managed Inclusion. FSDs can adjust the  percentage of passengers randomly sent into the Managed Inclusion lane  depending on specific risk factors. Figure 3 illustrates how these layers of  security operate when FSDs use Managed Inclusion lanes.", "According to TSA, it designed the Managed Inclusion process to use  BDOs stationed in the expedited screening lane as one of its layers of  security when Managed Inclusion is operational to observe passengers\u2019  behavior as they move through the security checkpoint queue. When  BDOs observe certain behaviors that indicate a passenger may be higher  risk, the BDOs are to refer the passenger to a standard screening lane so  that the passenger can be screened using standard or enhanced  screening procedures. In our November 2013 report on TSA\u2019s behavior  detection and analysis program, we concluded that although TSA had  taken several positive steps to validate the scientific basis and strengthen  program management of behavior detection and analysis program, TSA  had not demonstrated that BDOs can reliably and effectively identify high- risk passengers who may pose a threat to the U.S. aviation system.  Further, we recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct  the TSA Administrator to limit future funding support for the agency\u2019s  behavior detection activities until TSA can provide scientifically validated  evidence that demonstrates that behavioral indicators can be used to  identify passengers who may pose a threat to aviation security. The  Department of Homeland Security did not concur with this  recommendation, in part, because it disagreed with GAO\u2019s analysis of  TSA\u2019s behavioral indicators. In February 2015, TSA officials told us that  they had revised the behavioral indicators, were conducting pilot tests on  the use of new BDO protocols, and anticipated concluding the testing at 5  airports in late 2015. At that time, TSA plans to make a determination  about whether the new protocols are ready for further testing, including an  operational test in 10 airports to determine the protocols\u2019 effectiveness,  which has an estimated completion date in the latter half of 2016.", "According to a TSA decision memorandum and its accompanying  analysis, TSA uses canine teams and ETD devices at airports as an  additional layer of security when Managed Inclusion is operational to  determine whether passengers may have interacted with explosives prior  to arriving at the airport. In airports with canine teams, passengers must  walk past a canine and its handler in an environment where the canine is  trained to detect explosive odors and to alert the handler when a  passenger has any trace of explosives on his or her person. For example,  passengers in the Managed Inclusion lane may be directed to walk from  the travel document checker through the passageway and past the  canine teams to reach the X-ray belt and the walk-through metal detector.  According to TSA documents, the canines, when combined with the other  layers of security in the Managed Inclusion process provide effective  security. According to TSA, it made this determination by considering  the probability of canines detecting explosives on passengers, and then  designed the Managed Inclusion process to ensure that passengers  would encounter a canine a certain percentage of the time.", "Our prior work examined data TSA had on its canine program, what these  data showed, and to what extent TSA analyzed these data to identify  program trends. Further we analyzed the extent to which TSA deployed  canine teams using a risk-based approach and determined their  effectiveness prior to deployment. As a result of this work, we  recommended in January 2013, among other things, that TSA take  actions to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of canine teams.  The Department of Homeland Security concurred with this  recommendation and has taken steps to address it. Specifically, according to TSA canine test results, TSA has conducted work to assess  canine teams and to ensure they meet the security effectiveness  thresholds TSA established for working in the Managed Inclusion lane,  and the canines met these thresholds as a requirement to screen  passengers in Managed Inclusion lanes.", "In those airports where canines are unavailable or not working, TSA uses  ETD devices as a layer of security when operating Managed Inclusion.  TSOs stationed at the ETD device are to select passengers to have their  hands swabbed as they move through the expedited screening lane.  TSOs are to wait for a passenger to proceed through the Managed  Inclusion queue and approach the device, where the TSO is to swab the  passenger\u2019s hands with an ETD pad and place the pad in the ETD device  to determine whether any explosive residue is detected on the pad.  Once the passenger who was swabbed is cleared, the passenger then  proceeds through the lane to the X-ray belt and walk-through metal  detector for screening. TSA procedures require FSDs to meet certain  performance requirements when ETD devices are operating, such as  swabbing passengers at a designated rate, and TSA data from January 1,  2014, through April 1, 2014, show that these requirements were not  always met. Beginning in May 2014, TSA\u2019s Office of Security Operations  began tracking compliance with the ETD swab requirements and  developed and implemented a process to ensure that the requirements  are met. In March 2015 TSA officials confirmed this process was still in  place.", "According to TSA, it uses unpredictable screening procedures as an  additional layer of security after passengers who are using expedited  screening pass through the walk-through metal detector. This random  selection of passengers for enhanced screening occurs after they have  passed all security layers TSA uses for Managed Inclusion, and provides  one more chance for TSA to detect explosives on a passenger."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Not Tested the Overall Effectiveness of the Managed Inclusion Process", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in December 2014, according to TSA, it designed the  Managed Inclusion process using a layered approach to security when  providing expedited screening to passengers via Managed Inclusion.

In addition, we found that TSA collected  the validation study data unevenly and experienced challenges in  collecting an adequate sample size for the randomly selected  passengers, facts that might have further affected the representativeness  of the findings.
