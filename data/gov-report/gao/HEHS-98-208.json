These laws cover a wide variety of activities ranging from ensuring workers\u2019 rights to bargain collectively, to paying income taxes, to maintaining clean air. Many of these federal laws are implemented through regulations; in addition, many states have enacted laws either supplementing federal statutes or regulating business activities in areas not preempted by federal law. While this legal framework has been developed to achieve certain societal goals, some critics have suggested that this set of federal and state laws and associated regulations makes compliance difficult and complex for employers.", "Because of your concerns about the nature and scope of these laws, you asked us to compile a list of the federal and state laws that apply to California businesses of different sizes. We agreed to select two industries within that state to illustrate compliance with selected laws. Specifically, we agreed to provide information on (1) the requirements of federal and state laws affecting the workplace, tax-related, and environmental practices of California manufacturing firms of different sizes; (2) the assistance available to firms to help identify applicable laws and understand their implications on operations; and (3) the impact workplace and tax laws have had on the human resource operations at firms in two industries: high-tech electronics and aerospace.", "To address these objectives, we discussed with federal and California state agency officials the legal requirements with which manufacturing businesses must comply and reviewed the federal and state laws to identify the legal provisions that are significant to a California manufacturing firm\u2019s operations. We also spoke to federal and state agency officials about their efforts to inform businesses of their legal responsibilities and reviewed agency publications and electronic information sources, such as Web sites. In addition, we visited seven aerospace and electronics firms to determine the implications these laws have on the firms\u2019 human resource operations. This step provided us insight on strategies that firms of various sizes use to comply with the laws. Appendix I provides more detail on our scope and methodology. We conducted our review from November 1997 to July 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Many federal and state agencies oversee the regulation of California manufacturing firms. Laws relating to the workplace and employment are overseen at the federal level by the Department of Labor (governing unemployment insurance, employee benefits such as pensions, compensation issues such as minimum wage and overtime requirements, and workplace safety); the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); and the National Labor Relations Board. At the state level, California agencies that oversee laws related to employment include the California Department of Industrial Relations (addressing workers\u2019 compensation; occupational safety and health; and labor standards covering wages, hours of work, and other employment conditions) and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (protecting individuals\u2019 rights to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination). With respect to tax law, beyond the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at the federal level, a number of state agencies are involved. The Franchise Tax Board collects personal, corporate, bank, and franchise taxes; the State Board of Equalization collects sales and use taxes, as well as other specific taxes; and the Employment Development Department collects unemployment insurance, disability insurance, employment training, and personal income withholding taxes. Environmental laws are overseen at the federal level, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and at the state level by the California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA).", "In an earlier report analyzing the framework of federal workplace regulation, we noted that the magnitude, complexity, and dynamics of this framework pose a challenge for employers of all sizes. In that report, we identified 26 key statutes and one executive order on workplace regulation that affect all types of businesses, including manufacturers. The employers and union representatives with whom we met for that study generally supported the aims of these federal laws and regulations but also called for changing agencies\u2019 approaches to developing and enforcing regulations and urged agencies to develop a more service-oriented approach to workplace regulation in general. In a more recent study that attempted to identify the impact of federal regulation on several businesses, we suggested that measuring the incremental impact of all federal regulations on individual companies, although perhaps not impossible, would be an extremely difficult endeavor. Further, while many of the companies participating in that study recognized that regulations provide benefits to society and their own businesses, they all had varied concerns about regulatory costs and the regulatory process. These concerns included perceptions of high compliance costs; unreasonable, unclear, and inflexible demands; excessive paperwork; and the tendency of regulators to focus on deficiencies.", "Recent changes in federal law and current initiatives by federal agencies are targeted to reducing the compliance burden on businesses as well as making the regulatory requirements clearer and more accessible. In 1980, the Congress passed two laws to reform the federal regulatory processes: (1) the Paperwork Reduction Act, which attempted to minimize the paperwork and reporting burdens federal agencies impose on nonfederal entities, and (2) the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which required agencies to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities, including small businesses. More recently, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA) made several changes to regulatory procedures, including (1) amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act to allow for judicial review of agency decisions, (2) requiring the publication of \u201csmall entity compliance guides\u201d to explain the actions a small business or other small entity must take to comply with a rule or a group of rules, and (3) establishing a congressional review process through which the Congress can disapprove final agency regulations. To comply with SBREFA, agencies must also answer questions from small entities concerning information on and advice about complying with statutes and regulations, including interpreting the law and applying it to specific circumstances supplied by the small entity.", "In addition to changes required by law, under the administration\u2019s National Partnership for Reinventing Government (formerly the National Performance Review), a series of initiatives was undertaken. Agencies were to identify obsolete regulations that could be eliminated, create partnerships between regulators and those being regulated, and identify specific regulations that could be revised. Agencies proposed plans for changing the way they enforced regulations to increase the use of partnership arrangements and reduce the emphasis on identifying procedural violations unrelated to performance. Agencies also revised their customer service standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Federal and State Laws Cover California Manufacturing Firms", "paragraphs": ["To conduct business in California, a manufacturing firm must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations dealing with labor, tax, and environmental concerns. The requirements of these laws and regulations cover diverse issues, such as overtime pay, unemployment insurance, and air pollution. With some exceptions (particularly with laws concerning labor issues), these requirements apply in equal force to manufacturing firms of all sizes, from the smallest to the largest. Smaller firms, though, may be exempted from certain requirements, such as those prohibiting racial or sexual discrimination and those requiring family leave. Most regulation involves both federal and state requirements, with California law frequently providing stricter requirements than those mandated under federal law.", "Table 1 broadly summarizes significant labor, tax, and environmental requirements that apply to California manufacturing firms and sets forth specific federal and state legal requirements that affect firms with different numbers of employees. For descriptive purposes, these requirements are classified into nine categories of different business issues, ranging from wage and hour matters to environmental concerns. Each of these categories represents complex regulatory schemes, originating from federal and state statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions. For a more detailed summary of these regulatory requirements, see appendix II (labor law), appendix III (tax law), and appendix IV (environmental law)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Labor, Tax, and Environmental Requirements Apply to All California Manufacturing Firms, Regardless of Number of Employees", "paragraphs": ["For the most part, these labor, tax, and environmental requirements apply regardless of the number of workers employed by a firm. However, as indicated in table 1, some of these laws have specific legal provisions that are triggered as the number of employees at a firm increases. In general, neither tax nor environmental requirements vary with an increasing number of employees. When a firm hires its first employee, it must immediately comply with all requirements for federal and state income tax withholding, federal and state unemployment insurance taxes, and federal Medicare and Social Security taxes. Similarly, any firm, regardless of its size, must generally comply with all relevant environmental requirements if it produces specific amounts of some type of pollution or handles certain amounts of specified hazardous substances.", "Some labor law requirements, though, show greater sensitivity to the number of employees in a firm. In particular, adding employees to a firm has critical impact on the application of federal civil rights laws and certain federal requirements for employee benefits. Thus, federal law includes prohibitions against racial, religious, and sexual discrimination that apply only if a firm has at least 15 employees. Certain federal requirements for employee benefits also exempt firms of smaller sizes; for example, federal requirements for 12 weeks of unpaid family leave for an employee for medical or family-related reasons apply only if a firm has at least 50 employees. In addition, some other federal requirements are triggered only after a firm hires a specified number of employees, such as the requirement to give employees 60 days\u2019 notice of a plant closing or mass layoff (100 employees) or to conduct a programmed OSHA safety inspection of a firm in a low-hazard industry (10 employees).", "In California, however, overlapping state labor law requirements have muted the impact of some of the federal thresholds, extending the same or similar requirements to smaller firms. For example, state law prohibits sexual harassment in firms of any size, and racial or sexual discrimination at all firms with at least five employees. As another example, state law requires all firms with at least five employees to allow their female employees up to 4 months\u2019 pregnancy disability leave in addition to federal family leave requirements. Regarding OSHA, California law does not exempt firms of any size from safety inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interrelationships of Federal and California State Requirements Add Complexity and Stringency to Labor, Tax, and Environmental Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Both federal and state governments play active roles in the regulation of the workplace, taxes, and the environment. The relationship between federal and state laws is complex and, to varying degrees, the requirements are intertwined. Thus, under the overall regulatory schemes, employers must comply with both federal and state laws and regulations. In the case of California, employers often face more comprehensive labor, tax, and environmental regulation by the state than by federal law. In addition, some areas of state regulation have no federal counterpart. Thus, federal regulatory reform efforts intended to lessen the burden of compliance may be limited by those requirements under state laws that are more comprehensive.", "Although some areas of labor law regulation are covered only by state law (for example, workers\u2019 compensation insurance and disability insurance), most regulation includes various forms of federal and state interaction, ranging from the total preemption of any state regulation by federal regulation to \u201cdual control\u201d by federal and state governments to the implementation of minimum federal standards by state authorities. Certain federal statutes either explicitly or implicitly preempt state regulation: ERISA, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Immigration and Nationality Act. However, other statutes\u2014for example, the Fair Labor Standards Act\u2014specifically allow dual control if the state regulation is stricter than federal requirements. Still other federal statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, allow states to set up and enforce their own regulatory program with federal approval, in lieu of a federal program.", "In California, the net effect of these combined federal and state labor law requirements is that California manufacturing firms must, in many cases, meet higher labor standards than those required by the federal government. For instance, as of March 1998 the California minimum wage was $5.75\u2014an amount that is 60 cents higher than that required under federal law. Similarly, while the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) program administers all federal health and safety standards, it includes additional state standards.", "Tax regulation is conducted independently by both federal and state governments. Each has authority to tax its citizens and corporations for the support of its operations. Therefore, a California firm must follow separate federal and state tax codes for withholding employees\u2019 federal and state income taxes, and for payment of corporate income taxes. Certain taxes\u2014Medicare and Social Security\u2014are levied only by the federal government. Unemployment insurance tax, on the other hand, is collected by both federal and state governments to run the states\u2019 federally approved unemployment compensation programs.", "Even though federal and state governments run parallel tax programs, different definitions for the same key regulatory terms create complexity for employers. For example, the definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d varies between states (including California) and the federal government. California law provides a broader definition of \u201cemployee\u201d than that found in federal law, thereby including more workers under the provisions of state income tax withholding and unemployment insurance than would be included using the federal definition. In doing so, California ensures broader coverage of its citizens under the state unemployment insurance and disability insurance programs.", "Environmental regulation has become, since the 1970s, a joint effort among federal, state, and local authorities. Traditionally, regulation of pollution control, like other \u201cpolice powers,\u201d had been left to state and local governments. However, with the passage of major federal environmental statutes in the 1970s, EPA has broad authority to set minimum standards for air, water, and hazardous substances control. Typically, state authorities have used these federal minimum standards to create their own environmental program, continuing to enforce these standards within their own state.", "As with other regulatory areas, California environmental requirements in some areas have added stringency to the federal law. Thus, under California law, employers dealing with chemicals known to the state to cause cancer have a broad requirement to give \u201creasonable and clear\u201d warning to any individual exposed to those chemicals. As another example of state regulation, employers that produce 12,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per year must develop a plan for waste reduction every 4 years, and failure to take action on the plan can lead to monetary penalties under the state program.", "Thus, in these three major areas of regulation\u2014labor, tax, and environment\u2014the combination of federal and California state law creates a complex web of regulation for employers. Moreover, California law often sets higher standards for regulatory compliance than required by federal law. Consequently, federal reform efforts may be limited in practical effect by the existence of supplementary or independent state regulatory programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many Sources of Information Are Available to Help Firms Identify Applicable Laws", "paragraphs": ["California and federal agencies have taken proactive steps to inform manufacturers about employers\u2019 duties under existing laws and regulations as well as about proposed changes in those requirements.

In addition, many federal and state agencies have established focal points and other mechanisms through which manufacturing employers can obtain information about the agency-specific laws. (See table 2.) Many agencies also provide information tailored to meet the needs of small businesses and start-up employers. However, California manufacturing employers cannot rely on a single governmental source or focal point to provide them with a comprehensive understanding of the many federal and state workplace, tax, and environmental laws that apply to them and must seek out information from the public agency responsible for enforcing the law.

Agencies have attempted to help businesses better understand their legal responsibilities and assist them to make regulatory compliance less burdensome. Manufacturers, in California and throughout the nation, can learn about their federal legal responsibilities from a multitude of publications, including law handbooks, informational brochures, and guides that federal agencies have compiled and made available to the business community. For example, IRS has a variety of publications that describe various business taxes and record-keeping requirements for small businesses. With the cooperation of the Small Business Administration (SBA), it disseminates much of this information through SBA district and regional offices. Labor has a variety of guides and a small business handbook that summarizes the laws Labor enforces. The guides aim to clarify the various duties placed on employers so they can more easily develop compliance strategies and identify the appropriate agency for questions and assistance. EPA has prepared publications that outline the federal environmental laws and regulations relevant to each industry sector as well as information about environmental problems and solutions, case studies, and tips about complying with regulations. For example, EPA\u2019s publication entitled Profile of the Electronics and Computer Industry describes the manufacturing processes in the industry and identifies federal laws that apply to the industry.

Although many agencies have tailored their Web sites to address the special needs of small businesses and start-up employers in order to comply with SBREFA, much of what the agencies have made available to small businesses is also applicable and helpful to businesses of all sizes. For example, the EEOC has developed a small business information Web site that includes laws and processes that apply to all businesses. Federal agencies have also offered businesses the opportunity via Web sites to comment on the potential burden proposed changes to laws or regulations could have on their business activities. Examples follow: IRS\u2019 Web site includes a list of tax regulations issued since August 1, 1995, with references to plain-language summaries and IRS news bulletins that provide businesses with changes in procedures and tax rulings.

For example, meeting employee health and safety requirements, as set under OSHA and similar state laws, was addressed by human resource personnel, a separate OSHA/environmental department, or the firm\u2019s production department. In the very small firm, the owner, who managed the firm\u2019s manufacturing operations, was closely involved with ensuring that health and safety requirements were met. In somewhat larger firms, this was a joint effort of staff overseeing the manufacturing activities (who ensured that safety requirements were met on the production floor) and human resource departments (who handled administrative areas such as accident reports to OSHA). In the largest firm, an environmental and safety group oversaw implementation of OSHA requirements. Similarly, human resource staff worked with accounting or payroll groups to comply with requirements related to employees\u2019 pay. For example, completing tax withholding forms or determining which employees should be paid extra for overtime to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) were examples of human resource functions that were integrated with payroll or accounting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Firms Have Integrated Regulatory Compliance Into Their Standard Policies and Operating Procedures", "paragraphs": ["At the firms we visited, efforts to comply with those federal and state laws related to hiring, termination, and other workplace issues have been integrated into the employers\u2019 standard operations. Firms have incorporated policies that meet their legal requirements into employee handbooks. For example, one firm\u2019s employee handbook included sections addressing equal employment opportunity provisions, determining which employees were exempt or nonexempt from overtime pay, managing family and medical leave and pregnancy leave, limiting contributions to the 401(k) plan, and reporting employee injuries. Firms have implemented personnel procedures in many areas to ensure compliance with legal requirements. For example, to comply closely with EEO laws, one firm distributed lists of acceptable, nondiscriminatory questions to company staff before they interviewed potential employees. Several firms have modified their leave policies to comply with FMLA. Further, firms provided training on chemical and equipment safety that met California\u2019s safety and health requirements. Notifying employees who are separating from the firm of their rights to extended health insurance coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) was also a standard procedure at firms covered by the requirement. Several firms routinely held safety committee meetings in which management and line workers discussed compliance with safety requirements. Also, completing the I-9 forms indicating that new employees were authorized to work in the United States was a routine procedure when new employees began their employment.", "The firms we visited frequently retained outside resources to perform certain tasks required by law, particularly those involving either very routine or very complex processes. Examples follow:", "To deal with routine duties involving employee payroll taxes and income tax withholding, most of the firms relied on an outside payroll service. The firms used the expertise of payroll specialists to ensure that they complied with various laws related to payroll procedures, including those requiring new employee registers, and EEO reporting. For example, with the recent requirement that new employees\u2019 names be sent to a state agency to determine if the employee has any outstanding child support due, the payroll service for several of the firms we visited will routinely forward the names of all new employees, eliminating the need for the firm itself to report the names.", "Outside firms that administered certain programs completed some required reports that were particularly complex. For example, detailed annual forms required by ERISA for pension funds were prepared for a fee by the companies administering the retirement funds at all the firms we visited.", "Three of the firms had their health insurance administrators collect insurance payments directly from former employees with coverage under COBRA, which allowed them to continue their coverage after their employment with the firm ended. Timely collection of these funds from former employees had been an administrative problem for some firms.", "As table 3 shows, firms we visited used outside help to address requirements for many human resource functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employers Had Varied Concerns About Regulatory Requirements", "paragraphs": ["During our in-depth discussions with managers from the firms visited, each expressed some frustration about certain governmental requirements imposed on them, although there was little pattern in their complaints. Certain laws were not a problem for some firms because they had not encountered a workplace situation covered under those laws, whereas others, who had considerable experience with situations covered by the laws, found them burdensome. For example, two firms found the FMLA requirements to be no problem because no employees had ever asked for that type of leave, whereas two firms with greater family leave usage found the process of categorizing and recording leave a greater concern. Compliance with requirements to accommodate the needs of disabled workers was not an issue for several firms; some said they had not had any employees who needed special accommodations. In one case, the firm had built its plant to include handicapped access ramps and bathrooms, which it believed probably eliminated the need for some special accommodations. A January 1, 1998, change in California state law that eliminated the requirement to pay certain workers extra wages for working more than 8 hours a day\u2014a state regulation that had been more stringent than the federal FLSA requirement\u2014exemplifies the variation in employers\u2019 concerns with workplace regulation. Although the regulation was repealed with the aim of permitting more flexibility in setting worker schedules, two of the firms reported that they have continued to provide overtime pay for work beyond 8 hours a day. Managers at one firm said overtime pay provides an incentive for employees to work at least their regular hours, thereby maximizing manufacturing machine use; the other firm\u2019s managers believed that the 8-hour day rule maintained employee morale and productivity.", "Managers at firms often articulated frustration with excessively difficult requirements or burdensome paperwork, particularly when the managers believed the requirement did not accomplish results.", "Some firms complained about the requirement for tracking and categorizing family and medical leave under FMLA separately from other leave, as required under federal law. Two firms, both with several hundred employees, have decided to require that all leave be approved by one specific person in order to ensure accurate and consistent approval, even though it is burdensome for that individual. Managers at one firm were particularly frustrated with the requirement to provide separate family and medical leave because they believed they already had a very liberal leave policy without the FMLA-generated paperwork requirements.", "Some firms had difficulties with requirements under the COBRA provisions that govern health insurance, particularly with defining and identifying qualifying events, such as when former spouses of employees qualify for extended coverage, and informing all qualified beneficiaries.", "Regarding EEO requirements, one manager commented that under law he is required to collect information on applicants\u2019 ethnic background for the EEO-1 form but is not allowed to ask applicants questions about race, age, and other characteristics. Another firm has decided not to let its workforce exceed 100 employees or bid on government contracts over a particular size to avoid certain EEO requirements, such as the need to prepare affirmative action plans and an EEO reporting form that it considers administratively burdensome. Another manager commented that she keeps careful records about attendance at EEO training and resolution of internal EEO investigations\u2014a time-consuming process\u2014to attempt to protect the company in the event of a lawsuit. However, some company managers believed that such steps might not be sufficient to protect the firms from potential legal liability.", "Managers at firms we visited were also frustrated about legal requirements that they believed were unclear and left them vulnerable to fines or litigation because of noncompliance. For example, two firms complained about what they perceived to be subjective, vague distinctions between workers who are and are not exempt from the overtime pay requirements under FLSA and the related state law. One called it \u201cthe most confusing part of labor law,\u201d noting that it left the company vulnerable to being out of compliance and to paying back wages. The other, commenting that some job classifications in the firm are ambiguous under the law for purposes of coverage, said it looks for a clear distinction on its own and tries to apply its determinations in a consistent manner. Managers at firms also expressed concerns about ambiguity related to employee safety and health requirements as interpreted by enforcement personnel. Managers we talked to believed that the \u201cshifting sands\u201d of enforcement personnel\u2019s interpretations of regulations made compliance more difficult. One plant manager said it seems that no matter how careful a company is in trying to meet Cal/OSHA requirements, Cal/OSHA inspectors will eventually write them up for some violation. A human resource manager at another firm said she believes that when Cal/OSHA inspects a firm, it always finds something wrong. A representative at another firm said unhappy employees have filed anonymous complaints with Cal/OSHA because they have learned that Cal/OSHA always finds something wrong if it inspects the plant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Firms Expressed Some Concerns About State Laws", "paragraphs": ["Some areas of concern were related to state laws only. One area that firms particularly expressed concern about was workers\u2019 compensation for injuries.

One manager commented that the state workers\u2019 compensation insurance board makes determinations in employees\u2019 favor more often than it should. She commented that some employees take advantage of the system and abuse the benefit; when they know they can qualify for workers\u2019 compensation, she said, they will do anything to stay out of work, including having unethical medical practitioners falsify medical reports.

Several firms had concerns about the health and safety requirements, as discussed earlier, but commented that compliance with them had improved health and safety conditions in the workplace. For example, one manager said that the ready availability of the material safety data sheets required by Cal/OSHA facilitated the identification of a chemical that was irritating an employee\u2019s eye and enabled the employee to obtain treatment. Another mentioned that when his firm used safety committees to assess compliance with safety standards, the accident rate was half the rate experienced when the committee did not meet. He also noted that, after being charged with a Cal/OSHA violation, the company would respond and correct the problem within a day or two, thereby improving workplace safety, where previously the company had refused to take action. A manager from a relatively new firm explained that a Cal/OSHA consultant had visited the firm\u2019s plant and explained the requirements it was expected to meet. As a result, it set up systems and procedures, such as an injury and illness program, that improved workplace safety. Similarly, because firms are required to provide workers\u2019 compensation, a firm manager said that representatives from the insurance company inspect the plant and assess how safety conditions can be improved. Regarding unemployment insurance, one manager complimented California\u2019s workshare program, which allows an employee to receive partial unemployment benefits when the employee\u2019s work hours have been reduced. This program allows the company to retain an employee for a part-time schedule whereas, without it, the company would have lost the employee.
