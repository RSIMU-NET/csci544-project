As part of its audits of IRS's fiscal years 2008 and 2007 financial statements, GAO assessed (1) the status of IRS's actions to correct previously reported weaknesses and (2) whether controls were effective in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. To do this, GAO examined IRS information security policies and procedures and other documents; tested controls over key financial applications; and interviewed key agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS has continued to make progress in correcting previously reported information security weaknesses.

For example, the agency (1) implemented controls for unauthenticated network access and user IDs on the mainframe, (2) encrypted sensitive data going across its network, (3) improved the patching of critical vulnerabilities, and (4) updated contingency plans to document critical business processes. However, most of the previously identified weaknesses remain unresolved. For example, IRS continues to, among other things, allow sensitive information, including IDs and passwords for mission-critical applications, to be readily available to any user on its internal network, and grant excessive access to individuals who do not need it. According to IRS officials, they are continuing to address the uncorrected weaknesses and, subsequent to GAO site visits, had completed additional corrective actions. Despite IRS's progress, information security control weaknesses continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. IRS did not consistently implement controls that were intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to its systems and information. For example, IRS did not always (1) enforce strong password management for properly identifying and authenticating users; (2) authorize user access, including access to personally identifiable information, to permit only the access needed to perform job functions; (3) encrypt certain sensitive data; (4) effectively monitor changes on its mainframe; and (5) physically protect its computer resources. A key reason for these weaknesses is that IRS has not yet fully implemented its agencywide information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively. Specifically, IRS did not annually review risk assessments for certain systems, comprehensively test for certain controls, or always validate the effectiveness of remedial actions. Until these weaknesses are corrected, the agency remains particularly vulnerable to insider threats and IRS is at increased risk of unauthorized access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of financial and taxpayer information, as well as inadvertent or deliberate disruption of system operations and services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a demanding responsibility in  collecting taxes, processing tax returns, and enforcing the nation\u2019s tax  laws.

Such a  plan assists agencies in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and monitoring  progress in correcting security weaknesses that are found in information  systems. In its annual FISMA guidance to agencies, OMB requires agency  remedial action plans, also known as plans of action and milestones, to  include the resources necessary to correct identified weaknesses.  According to IRS policy, the agency should document weaknesses found  during security assessments, as well as document only planned,  implemented, and evaluated remedial actions to correct any deficiencies.  The policy further requires that IRS track the status of resolution of all  weaknesses and verify that each weakness is corrected.", "Although remedial action plans were in place, corrective actions were not  always appropriately validated. IRS has developed and implemented a  remedial action process to address deficiencies in its information security  policies, procedures, and practices. However, this remedial action process  was not working as intended, since the verification process used to  determine whether remedial actions were implemented was not always  effective. For example, IRS had informed us that it had completed actions  to close 65 recommendations related to previously identified weaknesses,  however, we determined that 16 of the corrective actions did not mitigate  or correct the underlying control deficiencies. Without a sound  remediation process, IRS will not have assurance that it has taken the  necessary actions to correct weaknesses in its policies, procedures, and  practices. We have previously identified a similar weakness and  recommended that IRS implement a revised remedial action verification  process that ensures actions are fully implemented, but the condition  continued to exist at the time of our review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Contingency Plans Were Annually Reviewed and Tested, IRS Recognizes the Need for Further Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Continuity of operations planning, which includes contingency planning  and disaster recovery planning, is a critical component of information  protection.

In addition,  testing contingency plans is essential to determine whether the plans will  function as intended in an emergency situation.

Although  the specific plans we reviewed did not have any shortcomings, IRS\u2019s  comprehensive plan for addressing information security weaknesses  recognizes the need for further efforts to improve the agency\u2019s  contingency planning, through initiatives involving disaster recovery  planning, some of which will not be completed until 2011.

These  deficiencies represent a material weakness in IRS\u2019s internal controls over  its financial and tax processing systems. A key reason for these  weaknesses is that the agency has not yet fully implemented certain key  elements of its agencywide information security program. The financial  and taxpayer information on IRS systems will remain particularly  vulnerable to insider threats until the agency (1) begins to address and  correct prior weaknesses across the service and (2) fully implements a  comprehensive agencywide information security program that ensures  risk assessments are appropriately reviewed for all systems, tests and  evaluations of controls for systems are comprehensive, and the remedial  action process effectively validates corrective actions.
