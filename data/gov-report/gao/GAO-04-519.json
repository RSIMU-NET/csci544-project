Thirty-two foreign governments made multilateral commitments to better control MANPADS and prevent their acquisition by terrorists. However, the State Department's ability to assess further progress in MANPADS nonproliferation is limited because the multilateral forums have no mechanisms to monitor members' implementation of commitments. In addition, the State Department obtained foreign government commitments to destroy or better secure MANPADS. DOD is required annually to inventory every Stinger missile system sold overseas. However, DOD's inventory inspection process has flaws. First, DOD records on the number and destination of Stingers sold overseas are incomplete, unreliable, and largely in hard-copy form. Because DOD has not required DOD agencies responsible for end-use monitoring to retain these records, it does not know how many Stingers have been sold overseas. Second, DOD officials overseas use inconsistent practices when inspecting Stinger inventories because DOD lacks procedures for conducting these inspections. To develop technical countermeasures to minimize the MANPADS threat to aircraft, the DHS initiated a 2-year program to adapt military aircraft defense systems to commercial aircraft. However, DHS faces significant challenges such as establishing system requirements and setting reliable cost estimates. The department adopted GAO's January 2004 recommendations to implement a knowledge-based approach to this development program. For example, DHS plans to use GAO-recommended criteria that ensure product knowledge is attained at key points in system development."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in May 2003, the threat of terrorist attacks against U.S.  personnel, facilities, and interests overseas was great because of the  number and types of terrorist organizations, the lethality of terrorists\u2019  tactics, and the ability of terrorists to operate worldwide. Among these  threats, the proliferation of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS)  has been of growing concern to the United States and other governments.  MANPADS are shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile systems designed  for military use by ground forces to defend against air attacks.

We toured Stinger missile storage facilities in Germany and the  United Kingdom, observed Stinger missile inventory inspections in Turkey,  and interviewed U.S. DOD security assistance officials in those countries.  We also requested meetings with officials of the National Security Council  to discuss the prioritization of terrorist threats, but they refused to meet  with us or respond to our questions.

In December 2000, the 33 Wassenaar  Arrangement participating states adopted U.S.-proposed guidelines for  establishing a set of MANPADS export controls. While multilateral export  control regimes are a key policy instrument in the overall U.S. strategy to  combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional  weapons, they have limitations. The multilateral export control regimes are  voluntary, nonbinding arrangements among like-minded supplier countries.  While countries make no legally binding commitments in joining them,  participating countries undertake a political commitment to abide by the  goals and principles of the regime. The regimes operate on the basis of  consensus of all members and decisions on how to implement and interpret  regime decisions are left to the national discretion of each member. None  of the regimes identify specific countries as targets. Collectively the  regimes strive to stop, slow, or increase the cost and risk of detection  efforts by countries\u2019 of concern to acquire sensitive technologies and  capabilities, including MANPADS.", "The United States began selling its current MANPADS, the Stinger missile  system, to U.S. allies and U.S.-approved nations in 1982. Because the  Stinger missile system is among the most advanced of all MANPADS, the  United States has placed enhanced controls and requirements on its sale  and use. (See fig. 2 for a picture of the U.S. Stinger missile system.) Under  security assistance procedures, DOD provides defense articles, services,  and training to foreign governments and international organizations that  have been approved by the State Department and determined by the  President as supporting U.S. national security and foreign policy  objectives, according to DOD. In comments on a draft of this report, DOD  said that each proposed transfer of Stinger missiles is thoroughly vetted by  many different organizations and offices, thus providing DOD a high level  of confidence that the missiles under security assistance programs do not  pose a terrorist threat.", "The Stinger missile system is one of only a few weapons systems that are  subject to \u201cenhanced end-use monitoring\u201d by DOD. If a Stinger missile  system sale is approved through the Foreign Military Sales process, State  and DOD sign and extend a letter of offer and acceptance (LOA) to the  customer nation. The LOA serves as a contract agreement between the  United States and the customer nation and requires the customer nation to  allow DOD to conduct annual inspections to ensure the Stinger systems are  being used and stored as required under the terms of the sale. Countries  that purchase Stinger missile systems from the United States are legally  bound to cooperate with these inspections or risk damaging future military  sales and cooperative relations with the United States.", "Notwithstanding U.S. controls over its Stinger missile systems, the concern  over a potential MANPADS attack against commercial aircraft has grown in  recent years. According to the U.S. government, terrorists are aware of the  severe economic consequences that a MANPADS attack could wreak on  the U.S. economy. In November 2002, terrorists used a MANPADS to attack,  but miss, a commercial airliner in Mombasa, Kenya\u2014the first such attack  outside an area of conflict. Following this attack, according to DOD  officials, the National Security Council created an interagency task force to  pursue several options to reduce the risk of MANPADS attack, including  the feasibility of transferring counter-MANPADS technology from U.S.  military aircraft to U.S. commercial aircraft. In response to the conference  report accompanying the Emergency Wartime Supplemental  Appropriations Act, 2003, DHS began to review a variety of technical  options for counter-MANPADS systems with a goal of selecting a system  within 2 years for use on the U.S. commercial aircraft fleet.

Estimates of the global inventory of MANPADS range from  500,000 to 750,000 weapons, with approximately 1 percent outside the  control of national governments, according to intelligence sources. In  addition, according to the State Department, the numbers of MANPADS in  the global inventory are difficult to estimate because destruction of  MANPADS systems is not always publicized and the systems\u2019 effective  lifetimes depend on how they are stored and maintained. Table 1 shows the  20 countries that have developed or produced MANPADS since the 1950s.", "During the cold war, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies  provided MANPADS to several client states in surrogate cold war conflicts.  For example, the U.S. government transferred hundreds of Stinger missiles  in the mid-1980s to Afghan rebels that were fighting Soviet forces in  Afghanistan. U.S. intelligence officials stated that a number of these  weapons may have fallen into the hands of terrorist groups. The State  Department estimates that at least nine nonstate groups, including al  Qaeda, have obtained some type of MANPADS.", "Some MANPADS produced during the cold war were surplus to countries\u2019  defense needs in the 1990s. These MANPADS became widely available on  the black and gray arms markets where terrorists could acquire them. The  black arms market consists primarily of weapons that have been stolen  from government or private holdings, seized by combatant forces, supplied  by state sponsors to subnational groups, or produced illegally. Black  market transfers usually involve a small number of arms that do not move  through official licensing channels and are difficult to detect. Gray arms  sales can be large and involve sales of advanced weapons systems. Such  sales generally move through official government licensing channels and  rely on false documentation or other deceptive means to disguise the  buyer, supplier, type of weaponry, or another component of the transaction.  There are known black markets in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Iraq, Lebanon,  Somalia, Southeast Asia, and Yemen, according to the State Department.  Gray arms shipments of MANPADS to Africa have been delivered mostly to  countries that divert the weapons to subnational groups.", "The new security challenges in Iraq have added to the global stockpile of  MANPADS available on the black and gray markets. According to  intelligence sources, thousands of MANPADS may have been provided to  Iraqi security forces or were stolen during hostilities in Iraq immediately  following the collapse of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. Therefore,  the number of MANPADS outside national controls may have doubled.", "The U.S. government is also concerned that thousands of MANPADS under  the control of some foreign governments may be vulnerable to theft and  possible transfer to terrorist groups through the black and gray markets.", "Some countries lack stringent national export standards, which increases  the likelihood that MANPADS will fall into the hands of terrorists,  according to the State Department. For example, China, Egypt, former  Yugoslavia, North Korea, and Pakistan have produced MANPADS but are  not Wassenaar Arrangement members. In 2000, Wassenaar Arrangement  members adopted the first multilateral guidelines for controlling the export  of MANPADS and strengthened these guidelines in 2003.", "In addition, the U.S. government is concerned about the physical security  and inventory controls of MANPADS within certain countries\u2019 arsenals,  where MANPADS are vulnerable to theft and possible transfer to terrorist  groups. For example, as of September 2003, the U.S. government had  identified at least 17 countries whose security over their MANPADS  stockpiles raised concerns. These countries included Bosnia and  Herzegovina, Liberia, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and Serbia.

Frequently called heat-seeking  missiles, most MANPADS models employ sensors that search for and home  in on the target\u2019s infrared signature, often the engine. Newer MANPADS can  recognize specific aircraft characteristics and reject simple  countermeasures or distractions, according to a defense manufacturer.  MANPADS are effective up to approximately 15,000 feet in altitude and 3  miles in range. Thus, while aircraft generally are safe from MANPADS when  flying at cruising altitude (30,000 feet), they are most vulnerable during  take off and landing.", "MANPADS systems are relatively easy to use but do require training. An  individual rests the weapon on his or her shoulder, looks through a sight,  and pulls a trigger.

Furthermore, Stinger  shipping records were missing for two main reasons, as follows:  First, the Army, DSCA, and SAO officials stated that most shipping  records are in hard-copy form, and some were lost or misfiled over the  years.", "Second, Army and DSCA officials said that there has been great pressure  in recent years, particularly in the 1990s, to reduce paperwork at U.S.  missions and offices overseas. Therefore, many older Stinger records  were likely destroyed during efforts to dispose of older paperwork.", "In comments on a draft of this report, DOD said that it has recordkeeping  requirements for implementing agencies and SAOs regarding security  assistance management. However, we found that these general  recordkeeping requirements apply to Foreign Military Sales case managers,  not to DSCA or SAOs, and to financial management purposes, not end-use  monitoring. Furthermore, Army officials said that they were unaware of  any requirement to maintain Stinger shipping records. DOD said that DSCA  would amend the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) to  specifically identify the recordkeeping standards for end-use monitoring  activities to ensure that the requirements are clear.", "No single DOD office has maintained copies of all the Stinger shipping  records. The two main offices that maintain such records\u2014the Army and  the SAOs\u2014have some of the Stinger shipping records. In addition, DSCA  has a database containing additional data on defense articles, including  Stingers, authorized and delivered under the Foreign Military Sales  program. However, we found discrepancies in the numbers of Stingers that  different DOD offices show were sold to foreign governments. For  example, one SAO reported in its 2003 inventory inspection of all Stinger  missiles in its recipient country that it found approximately 30 percent  more Stingers than the number that the Army stated had been provided to  that country. In a second example, a different SAO in 2002 reported the  total number of Stingers received by the recipient country over the years  as 156 missiles fewer than the number that the Army had on record.", "According to data from the U.S. Army, the United States has exported 7,551  Stinger missiles to 14 countries (plus Taiwan) since 1982 through DOD\u2019s  foreign military sales program (see table 2). The Army reconstructed its  information for us from a combination of its remaining original shipping  records and limited inventory inspection records dating back to 1982. As a  result of being constructed from incomplete data, some of the numbers in  the table likely under-represent the number of Stingers sold. We  determined that Army data are not a reliable single source of information  on the numbers and destinations of Stingers the United States has exported  overseas. Because of our concerns about the reliability of the Army data,  we looked at DSCA data on the number of Stinger systems exported by the  United States since 1982. According to our analysis of the DSCA data, the  United States has exported 8,331 Stinger missiles to 16 countries (plus  Taiwan). This data is from DSCA\u2019s 1200 Series database, which shows the  quantities and dates of Stingers delivered to foreign governments. DSCA  provided us with this data, which we consolidated in this table. We  performed data reliability checks on the 1200 Series database and  determined that it was sufficiently reliable for comparison against the  information provided by the Army. As table 2 shows, there are significant  discrepancies between Army and DSCA data on the number of Stinger  missiles the U.S. has exported to foreign countries. For example, Army data  shows the U.S. has not exported any Stinger missiles to Egypt. However,  DSCA data indicates the U.S. has exported 89 Stingers to Egypt.", "Because some SAOs lack Stinger shipping records and cannot always get  complete records from the Army, officials at DSCA and the three SAOs we  visited said that SAO officials have in some cases relied on foreign  government records. However, in August 2000, we reported that relying  on the foreign government\u2019s records might pose a risk to achieving 100  percent accounting of the missiles because the reliability of accountability  systems varies from country to country. We further reported that DSCA had  discovered discrepancies in foreign governments\u2019 Stinger missile  inventories after completing its annual inventory in December 1999. DSCA  officials stated in August 2000 that they would investigate these  discrepancies. We recommended that DOD reconcile discrepancies in  foreign governments\u2019 Stinger missile inventories where discrepancies  existed. DSCA said that its 2000 inventory results showed no discrepancies  that warranted corrections. However, the 2000 inventory required  inspection of only 5 percent of Stingers and used unreliable Stinger control  records. As of April 2004, our specific recommendation had not been  implemented.", "Some SAO officials stated that they prefer to receive Stinger serial number  information from DOD. However, because DOD does not have complete  original shipping records, SAO officials have sometimes had to rely on the  recipient country or the European Stinger Project Group to provide records  to perform the inventory inspections. For example, DSCA officials said that  in 2003 the Japanese government provided the only available Stinger  records in Japan. At one of the SAOs we visited, the latest SAO official  arrived in 2003 to find there was no Stinger paperwork on record. At  another SAO we visited, SAO officials had no record of the Stingers  purchased from the United States and relied solely on the European  consortium for serial number records for consortium-produced Stingers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stinger Inventory Inspections Are Impaired by Inconsistent Practices and Incomplete Inventory Records", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s inventory inspection efforts are impaired because DOD lacks  procedures for conducting Stinger inspections and requirements for  keeping inspection records.

However, a DSCA official made this  statement.  5. DOD said that the 2000 inventory results showed no discrepancies that  warranted corrections. However, the 2000 inventory required  inspection of only 5 percent of Stingers and used unreliable Stinger  control records. As of April 2004, our specific recommendation had not  been implemented. 6. DOD stated that our finding that in 2003 the Japanese government  provided the only available Stinger records in Japan is incorrect. DOD  stated that the relevant U.S. office in Japan conducted a 100 percent  inventory of Stingers in-country and provided corresponding serial  numbers to DSCA. However, we asked DOD for documentary evidence  to show that this inventory did not rely on foreign government Stinger  records, but DOD provided none.  7. DOD said that it implemented our 2000 recommendation through  issuance of DSCA Policy Memorandum 02-43, dated December 4, 2002,  which established SAO responsibilities for end-use monitoring. This  guidance instructed SAOs to conduct routine end use monitoring with  host nations, using a December 1996 pamphlet, End-Use Monitoring of  Defense Articles & Services, incorporated into Appendix 5 of a June  2001 document, The Management of Security Assistance, to be found at  a listed Web site. We reviewed these documents and found them  insufficient to address our 2000 recommendation. For example, the  2002 DSCA Policy Memorandum lists a requirement to conduct routine  end-use monitoring, but does not provide procedures or detailed  guidance for doing so.  8. We said that DSCA has gaps in its inventory inspection records and that  DSCA has no procedures for SAOs to report the results of their Stinger  inventories. DOD commented that DSCA provided specific reports that  we requested and that DSCA Policy Memorandum 03-10 mandates that  the Combatant Commands consolidate and provide Stinger inventory  reports to DSCA by December 1 of each year. First, DSCA did not  dispute our finding that DSCA has maintained a total of 18 annual  inventory inspection reports from SAOs over the 22-year history of  Stinger sales or that for 2002, DSCA had on record inventory inspection  reports for 6 of 16 countries (plus Taiwan). Second, DSCA did not  provide only those reports it mentioned in response to our specific  request. On September 16, 2003, we requested from DSCA all inventory  inspection records related to Stingers, including records for those  countries that we planned to visit. On October 17, 2003,DSCA provided  requested records for multiple countries, including 4 countries that we  did not plan to visit; it did not provide the requested records for the  United Kingdom, which we did plan to visit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Jeffrey D.
