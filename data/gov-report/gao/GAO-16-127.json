This report examines (1) the extent to which selected U.S. airports and airlines have plans for responding to communicable disease threats from abroad and to which a national aviation-preparedness plan guides preparedness, and (2) the challenges that U.S. airports and airlines have faced when responding to threats and any actions taken to address them.", "GAO reviewed available documents and interviewed representatives from 14 U.S. international airports\u2014selected to reflect a range of activities and facilities\u2014and the 3 major U.S. airlines. GAO also reviewed applicable federal requirements and international obligations and guidance for U.S. airports and airlines, and interviewed officials and reviewed documents from federal agencies and aviation stakeholder groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["All of the 14 airports and 3 airlines GAO reviewed have plans for responding to communicable disease threats from abroad, although the United States lacks a comprehensive national aviation-preparedness plan aimed at preventing and containing the spread of diseases through air travel. U.S. airports and airlines are not required to have individual preparedness plans, and no federal agency tracks which airports and airlines have them. Consequently, it is not clear the extent to which all U.S. airports and airlines have such plans. The plans GAO reviewed generally addressed the high-level components that GAO identified as common among applicable federal and international guidance, such as establishment of an incident command center and activation triggers for a response. GAO identified these components to provide a basis for assessing the breadth of the plans. The plans GAO reviewed for each airport were developed by, or in collaboration with, relevant airport stakeholders, such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) airport staff. As provided in Annex 9, the Chicago Convention, an international aviation treaty to which the United States is a signatory, obligates member states to develop a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks. The Department of Transportation (DOT) and CDC officials contend that some elements of such a plan already exist, including plans at individual airports. However, FAA has reported that individual airport plans are often intended to handle one or two flights with arriving passengers, rather than an epidemic, which may require involvement from multiple airports on a national level. Most importantly, a national aviation-preparedness plan would provide airports and airlines with an adaptable and scalable framework with which to align their individual plans\u2014to help ensure that individual airport and airline plans work in accordance with one another. DOT and CDC officials agree that a national plan could add value. Such a plan would provide a mechanism for the public-health and aviation sectors to coordinate to more effectively prevent and control a communicable disease threat while minimizing unnecessary disruptions to the national aviation system.", "Aviation stakeholders GAO spoke with identified multiple challenges in responding to communicable disease threats and actions they took or would take in response. For example, airline and airport representatives told GAO they sometimes experienced difficulties sharing timely and accurate information about threats, and some reported that they improved communication by developing tools, such as standardized forms, to collect and share relevant information. Employees at aviation services firms that GAO spoke with\u2014including contract workers who clean aircraft\u2014raised concerns about the availability of training and access to equipment to control exposure to communicable diseases. Some airports GAO reviewed developed additional mechanisms to ensure adequate training and preparation during the Ebola threat. A national aviation-preparedness plan could serve as the basis for testing communication mechanisms among responders to ensure those mechanisms are effective prior to a communicable disease outbreak as well as to provide the basis for ensuring that airport and airline staff receive appropriate training and equipment to reduce their risk of exposure to communicable diseases during an outbreak."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOT work with relevant stakeholders, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, to develop a national aviation-preparedness plan for communicable diseases. DOT agrees a plan is needed, but suggests public health agencies lead the effort. GAO continues to believe the recommendation is correctly directed to DOT, as discussed in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2014, almost 52-million international air travelers entered the United  States, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expects that  number to continue to increase as the global economy continues to  develop. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014 and 2015 renewed  concerns about the spread of communicable diseases through air travel.  More than any other mode of transportation, air travel creates the  potential for an infection to move quickly from one part of the world to  another. In response to Ebola there were proposals in the United States  to restrict travel and trade to and from affected countries, although public  health officials advised permitting travel to allow access to medical  supplies and qualified personnel to contain the epidemic. While deaths  and illnesses may be the most visible effect of an outbreak,  communicable disease threats also create economic costs. In the case of  the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, for  example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the  overall cost at $33 billion of global gross domestic product in 2003. North  American airline revenue losses alone were estimated at $1 billion, while  Asia Pacific airlines lost an estimated $6 billion.", "We have found\u2014in lessons learned from the response to the 2009 H1N1  influenza pandemic\u2014that interagency planning and exercises build  formal networks and informal relationships that are valuable during a  response. Further, in the aviation area, international guidance for  aviation stakeholders\u2014including guidance for civil aviation authorities  such as FAA\u2014points to the importance of preparedness plans for  communicable disease threats, with recommendations designed to  reduce exposure to the disease and improve the response to health- related emergencies by establishing mechanisms for rapid decision- making and action.", "In light of recurring communicable disease threats, the continued growth  in international air travel, and the need to prepare for future threats, you  asked us to review issues related to the preparedness of the U.S. aviation  system to respond to pandemics and other health crises. This report  examines (1) the extent to which selected airports and airlines have  preparedness plans to respond to communicable disease threats from  abroad and the extent to which a national aviation-preparedness plan  guides preparedness, and (2) what challenges U.S. airports and airlines,  including their contractors, have faced when responding to communicable  disease threats and any actions they have taken to respond to those  challenges.", "To conduct this work, we identified and reviewed applicable federal  requirements, international obligations, as well as federal and  international guidance for U.S. airports and airlines with international air  traffic. We interviewed officials and reviewed available documents from  five federal departments that represent the key federal departments with  responsibilities for preparing for and responding to communicable disease  threats from abroad\u2014the Departments of Transportation (DOT), Health  and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), State, and Labor  and their relevant components, including DOT\u2019s Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Labor\u2019s  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). We identified  high-level components that were common among applicable federal and  international guidance, as well as corroborating information collected from  aviation stakeholders whom we spoke with. Then, we developed a list of  high-level components for airport and airline communicable-disease  preparedness plans to provide a basis for assessing the breadth of the  plans. We compared these components against the available plans  collected from 14 airports and three airlines that we selected for review  during our study. We did not evaluate the plans for sufficiency or level of  preparedness. We selected for review 14 airports that met one or more of  our selection criteria, which included being a large hub airport with CDC  staff on-site; receiving the largest and second largest number of  international passengers from at least one of five world regions; having  enhanced passenger entry-screening procedures in place for Ebola; and  having experience with a confirmed Ebola case. We selected for review  the three U.S. airlines that handle the largest quantity of international  travelers. In addition to reviewing the plans, we administered a  questionnaire to each of the 14 airport operators on preparedness at their  airport, such as the plans and procedures they have in place for a variety  of circumstances. We interviewed a range of stakeholders to discuss  preparedness plans and potential opportunities to improve preparedness,  as well as to identify challenges airports and airlines have faced in  responding to communicable disease threats, including Ebola, and  actions stakeholders have taken to address those challenges. These  stakeholders include representatives from the 14 selected airports and  their local airport stakeholders\u2014such as first responders, local public  health officials, CBP officials, and CDC officials, if applicable; the three  selected U.S. airlines; airport, airline, and flight attendant industry  associations; the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); the  labor union representing airport- and airline-service workers; and  contracted aviation-services employers and their employees. We also  identified challenges and actions through our attendance at an ICAO  global symposium. Additional detail on the scope and methodology of our  review is contained in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A number of communicable disease threats have raised concern  regarding international transmission and travel since the 2003 SARS  epidemic, which was the first major new disease of the 21st century,  according to the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations.  WHO described that 2003 epidemic as a watershed event, because it  revealed how much the world had changed in terms of the impact that  communicable diseases can have in a highly mobile and closely  interconnected world. Figure 1 provides information about major  communicable disease epidemics since 2002.", "The International Health Regulations (IHR) are an international  agreement of the World Health Assembly, the governing body of WHO,  and were originally adopted by the Assembly in 1969 to address certain  disease threats. The IHR have evolved since then in response to the  growth in international travel and trade and the emergence of  international disease threats. Most recently, the IHR were revised in 2005  following the SARS epidemic. WHO implements and oversees the IHR  and\u2014together with its partners, such as the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO)\u2014helps member states build response capacities.", "ICAO takes a key role in coordinating the international aviation response  to public health risks. Through the IHR, WHO member states have  agreed to build core capacities at designated ports of entry, such as  airports, to limit the spread of public health risks\u2014such as communicable  disease threats\u2014while at the same time minimizing any unnecessary  interference with travel and trade.", "ICAO develops international standards and recommended practices  (SARPs) for civil aviation systems, in cooperation with its member states  and global aviation organizations. Member states, including the United  States, are obligated to establish regulations or take other appropriate  steps to implement the ICAO standards within their own civil aviation  systems. In the United States, different agencies are responsible for  different aspects of the civil aviation system, as discussed below. The  SARPs include some health-related standards and recommended  practices based on the most recent IHR obligations. To encourage  member states to comply with these health-related SARPs, ICAO has  developed a template for the development of national aviation public- health emergency-preparedness plans, which are obligations under the  IHR. The Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and  Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA) also  works to bring together international, regional, national, and local  organizations to develop a coordinated approach to preparedness and  response. Other international organizations, notably Airports Council  International (ACI) and IATA, also provide assistance to airports and  airlines, respectively, in preparing for communicable disease threats.", "In the United States, a number of federal agencies, aviation stakeholders,  and others have roles and responsibilities in preparing for, assessing, and  responding to communicable disease threats in the aviation system. Each  of the federal agencies involved in preparing for or responding to  communicable disease threats from abroad have a different mission,  including those described below, that affects their responsibilities for  protecting against communicable disease threats. DHS and HHS are the  lead agencies in a response to a communicable disease threat, and other  federal agencies provide support as necessary.", "Within DHS, CBP aims to safeguard America\u2019s borders thereby  protecting the public from dangerous people and materials while  enhancing the nation\u2019s global economic competitiveness by enabling  legitimate trade and travel. CBP officials at ports of entry, including  airports, conduct the primary inspection of arriving international  travelers and have authority to permit or deny admission to the United  States.", "Within HHS, CDC has defined its mission as protecting America from  health, safety, and security threats, both foreign and domestic. With  its partners, such as CBP, CDC responds to sick travelers who arrive  in the United States at major airports, seaports, or land border  crossings, when warranted. CDC alerts travelers about disease  outbreaks and steps they can take to protect themselves. CDC also  has the authority to quarantine passengers traveling from foreign  countries, if necessary, to protect the general population and respond  to disease threats to the United States.", "Within DOT, FAA is responsible for safety of flight in the United States  and the safe and efficient movement of air traffic in the national  airspace system, as well as for the safety of U.S. airlines, other U.S.  operators, and FAA-certificated air crews worldwide. As part of this  responsibility, the agency regulates and certificates airports, airlines,  and airmen and provides guidance through advisory circulars and  other means.", "Within the Department of Labor, OSHA aims to assure safe and  healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting  and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach,  education, compliance, and assistance.", "The Department of State (State) has the authority to grant visas,  which allow foreign citizens to travel to a U.S. port of entry (generally  an airport) and request permission to enter the United States.", "Depending on location and threat, these agencies along with aviation  stakeholders and their partners\u2014including local public health  authorities, first responders, contracted aviation-services firms, and  others\u2014may each have a role in preparing for or responding to a  communicable disease incident. That is, the specific response actions  taken by individual entities, such as airports and airlines\u2014as well as  federal, state, and local authorities\u2014will depend on the operating  characteristics of the airline or airport, disease characteristics, and the  type and level of threat that exists. Finally, some roles and responsibilities  for a response to a threat in the aviation system are established in law or  by agreement and others may be defined in preparedness plans. Airports  are required by FAA regulations to develop airport-emergency plans  (AEP), which must address a variety of hazards, including aircraft  incidents and accidents, acts of terrorism, fires, natural disasters,  hazardous materials, power failures, or water rescues. These plans are  not required to address communicable disease threats.", "The risk of disease transmission in an airport and aboard airlines may be  heightened during a communicable disease epidemic, although airports,  airlines, and public health authorities may have to address travelers with  more common communicable diseases such as tuberculosis or measles  at any time. The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa provides an  example of a regional epidemic that triggered governments and aviation  stakeholders to take additional precautions during each stage of air travel  to minimize the spread of the disease. Figure 2 shows routine and  potential enhanced safety measures that may be taken before, during,  and after flights by a variety of stakeholders.", "Before boarding an aircraft, passengers may be prevented from travel if  they have a communicable disease that could pose a public health threat  during the flight. For example, in the United States, DHS and HHS can  identify travelers who are not allowed travel, based on public health  threats. Airlines may only refuse to board a passenger\u2014or otherwise  restrict or delay travel\u2014with a communicable disease under DOT  regulations if that passenger poses a direct threat to the health and safety  of others. Additionally, the Department of State can restrict visas for  foreign travelers with a communicable disease, preventing them from  entering the United States. Governments in areas experiencing such an  outbreak may screen passengers exiting the area and restrict or  discourage the transport of ill or possibly contagious passengers. Under  the IHR, these decisions may be made based on recommendations from  WHO, although states can make their own entry- and exit-screening  decisions. During the SARS epidemic, WHO recommended screening  travelers before their departure from affected areas on international flights  for symptoms associated with SARS and advising travelers with  symptoms to postpone travel. To date, WHO has not recommended  screening passengers departing from a U.S. airport, and the United  States has never instituted such a precaution, according to CDC officials.  Aviation stakeholders have questioned the legal authority by which the  United States could implement exit screening. According to CDC officials,  such screening could be done under HHS\u2019s quarantine and isolation  authorities.", "CDC regulations require pilots to immediately report to CDC any deaths  or the occurrence of any travelers with signs or symptoms that may  indicate a communicable disease infection during international flights  coming to the United States. In the case of an ill traveler, CDC guidance  recommends that the aircraft\u2019s crew take practical measures to protect  themselves and others. These measures may include avoiding direct  contact with bodily fluids, and if indicated, isolating ill passengers who  exhibit specific signs or symptoms consistent with a communicable  disease, as well as providing ill passengers with tissues or a mask. In  conducting its assessment, CDC may also request that aircraft  crewmembers hand out information about health risks or collect and  report information on a suspected ill passenger\u2019s travel history, as done  during the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa. According to CDC  officials, reporting suspected ill travelers before the flight\u2019s arrival gives  ground-based responders preparation time to provide for medical  assessment and treatment of the traveler upon arrival, if warranted.", "Once an aircraft with a suspected ill passenger approaches an airport,  decisions about where to park the aircraft, how to respond to the  suspected ill passenger, and how to deplane other passengers may be  coordinated among stakeholders, according to ICAO guidance. Federal or  local public health officials, first responders (e.g., fire or emergency  medical technicians), airport authorities, air traffic control personnel, or a  combination of these stakeholders may make these decisions and lead  certain components of the response based on the situation and available  response protocols or preparedness plans. If a communicable disease is  confirmed, CDC is to follow established protocols and work with state and  local public health authorities to assess and provide interventions to other  travelers onboard the aircraft, if necessary.", "Passengers infected with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or blood-borne  communicable diseases may contaminate aircraft or airports with bodily  fluids. Whether any measures beyond routine airline- and airport-cleaning  practices are necessary will depend upon the characteristics of the  disease in question, according to CDC guidance. For international flights,  CDC may require additional cleaning or disinfection to prevent the  transmission of a communicable disease. Airline representatives told us  that they may also opt for a more thorough decontamination as a  precaution. Decontamination may be carried out by airport or airline staff  or by contracted aviation-services firms. During flights, cabin crew may  clean potentially infectious material to protect other passengers, and CDC  provides guidance on how to carry out this targeted cleaning. The  occupational health and safety of airline, airport, or contracted aviation- service employees on the ground is overseen by OSHA, which sets and  enforces workers\u2019 health and safety standards related to communicable  diseases and provides guidance on personal protective equipment,  decontamination, and handling waste contaminated by potentially  infectious material, with certain exceptions. On board an aircraft in  operation, responsibility for the health and safety of employees is divided  between the FAA and OSHA. FAA is responsible for all working  conditions of flight crew (i.e., pilots, flight engineers, and flight navigators)  and for most, but not all, working conditions of cabin crew (e.g., flight  attendants).", "According to DOT\u2019s origin-and-destination ticketing data, almost 52- million air passengers entered the United States from other countries in  2014, including returning U.S. citizens. While the United States does not  receive non-stop commercial flights from all countries, including the West  African countries that suffered the recent Ebola outbreak, passengers  come from every corner of the globe and fly into airports both large and  small. Figure 3 shows passenger arrivals from five regions of the world  and the top five airports receiving passengers whose travel originated  from each of these regions in 2014 (for a total of 12 airports), based on  the original departure airport in the ticket itinerary. Together, these 12  airports received about 50 percent of the total number of passengers  coming into the United States from abroad in 2014\u2014accounting for more  than 25 million passenger arrivals.", "Even if an ill passenger on an international flight is not detected while  onboard an aircraft, he or she may be identified after arrival during the  customs and immigration inspection process. After an international flight  arrives in the United States, passengers are to undergo routine inspection  or possibly enhanced screening for communicable diseases under  authorities held by HHS and DHS (by agreement). During primary  inspection, CBP staff are expected to visually observe arriving  international travelers for certain signs and symptoms of communicable  diseases during their routine interactions with travelers and then notify  CDC, as appropriate. CBP and CDC may investigate further by asking  specific questions during primary inspection\u2014such as inquiring about  travel to affected areas\u2014or by conducting additional assessments such  as taking body temperatures during secondary or tertiary screening.", "For passengers who are asymptomatic (not displaying symptoms) but at  heightened risk for a communicable disease, CDC officials may also  establish a means of ongoing monitoring. For example, asymptomatic  passengers from Ebola-affected countries\u2014Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra  Leone\u2014receive a Check and Report Ebola (CARE) kit upon arriving in  the United States if they are found to be at heightened risk of exposure.  The kit contains guidance and tools to measure and report symptoms to  local public health officials for the 21-day disease incubation period. Local  public health authorities are responsible for protecting public health within  their jurisdictions. While CDC and state and local public health agencies  coordinate closely on many issues, state and local public health  authorities may, at their discretion and based on their legal authority,  impose restrictions or requirements in their jurisdictions that are more  stringent than those issued by CDC.", "In certain extraordinary circumstances, passengers or flights from areas  experiencing a communicable disease outbreak could be redirected to  designated U.S. airports with the capacity to receive them. This process  is commonly referred to as \u201cfunneling,\u201d and it may involve re-routing  passengers by changing their itineraries or directing flights to certain  airports. Beginning in October 2014, for example, CBP directed all flights  to the United States with passengers whose recent travel included Ebola- affected countries to be routed to one of the following five designated  airports where CBP and CDC staff conducted enhanced entry screening  procedures:", "Newark Liberty International Airport,", "Washington Dulles International Airport,", "Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and", "Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport  John F. Kennedy International Airport,  Prior to passenger re-routing by airlines, these five airports accounted for  94 percent of existing arrivals from the affected countries in West Africa  (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), according to CBP officials, all of  which arrived on connecting flights through other countries. Travelers  who might have arrived at a different airport are now re-routed by  airlines\u2014or \u201cfunneled\u201d\u2014to arrive at one of these five designated airports.  Any non-military U.S. health personnel returning from the Ebola-affected  countries also have to return via these airports and go through enhanced  screening.", "Airports that are not designated to receive passengers from areas  affected by a communicable disease outbreak may still encounter  individuals who have recently traveled from affected areas even when  funneling has been put in place. There have been Ebola-related  responses at airports that were not identified for funneling, for example.  One way this could happen is by a passenger traveling on a \u201cbroken  ticket\u201d\u2014a separate itinerary for travel between the affected country and  the United States via an intermediate destination, such as a country in  Europe. In this instance, a passenger from an affected country may have  bought two tickets\u2014one to Europe and a separate ticket to the United  States, following a layover. Another scenario is that a passenger could  have transferred to a domestic flight after passing through a designated  airport and developed symptoms of infection on the later flight. In cases  such as these, CDC officials or local public health authorities, or both,  may conduct public health assessments and follow-up activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airports and Airlines That We Reviewed Have Plans, but a Comprehensive National Aviation- Preparedness Plan Does Not Exist", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Airports and Airlines That We Reviewed Generally Have Communicable- Disease Preparedness Plans", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Airports and Airlines We Reviewed Have Preparedness Plans", "paragraphs": ["All of the 14 airports and three airlines we reviewed have plans\u2014often  contained in multiple documents\u2014in place for responding to  communicable disease threats from abroad.

Establishment of an incident command center.  2.  Coordination among various stakeholders.  3.  Selection and use of personal protective equipment for various  stakeholders.  4.

Not all airports had a separate  communicable-disease preparedness plan that alone addressed all six  high-level components. For example, when asked about communicable- disease preparedness planning, representatives from 11 of the 14  airports reported that the procedures for responding to these threats at  their airport were contained in multiple documents, ranging from a  general emergency preparedness plan, such as the airport-emergency  plan (AEP)\u2014required by FAA regulations, but not required to specifically  address communicable diseases\u2014to a disease-specific preparedness  plan, such as a pandemic influenza response plan. Other types of  documents included a checklist for first responders; standard-operating  procedures for a specific disease, such as Ebola; and CDC\u2019s  communicable-disease response plans (which are discussed more  below). During the Ebola outbreak, representatives from eight airports  that we reviewed reported developing an additional Ebola-specific  response plan or adapting an existing plan.", "All three of the airlines we reviewed have a preparedness plan for  responding to communicable disease threats. The plans themselves were  not available to us because of their proprietary nature; however, based on  our conversations with airline representatives and a review of summary  information regarding their plans, we can report that the three airlines\u2019  plans addressed the following four high-level components:  1.  Establishment of emergency response team and designation of  emergency response center.  2.  Description of the triggers that inform the level and nature of a  response.  3.  Activation triggers for the response team and response center.  4.  Identification of roles and responsibilities for relevant stakeholders.", "Furthermore, all three airlines stated that they carry universal precaution  kits that include equipment to respond to suspected communicable  diseases onboard aircraft flying internationally.", "As noted above, some airports have in place a CDC communicable- disease response plan (CDRP)\u2014specifically 18 total airports that  currently have (or had) a CDC quarantine station on site, 11 of which  were included in our review. CDRPs fulfill part of WHO\u2019s IHR obligations  for establishing core capacity at designated points of entry. The CDRPs,  according to CDC officials, were developed in coordination with relevant  stakeholders and partners at each airport and based on a framework  provided by CDC to airport quarantine stations. The existence of a CDRP  at an airport does not preclude an airport operator or other airport  stakeholders from developing and maintaining one or more additional  preparedness plans or documents. In fact, representatives from all but  one of the airports that we reviewed that have a CDRP reported having  additional preparedness documents (10 of 11 airports). Representatives  from 3 of those 10 airports that reported having plans contained in  multiple documents do not view the CDRP as the airport\u2019s main  preparedness plan for communicable diseases. One CDC official from the  Quarantine and Border Health Services Branch noted that CDRPs at  some airports are more developed than others and recognized that CDC  quarantine staff in collaboration with relevant airport stakeholders are  continually updating and improving the CDRPs. Figure 4 shows the 16  U.S. airports that currently have a CDC quarantine station and the 2  airports that formerly had one. Each of these quarantine stations is also  responsible for enforcing quarantine regulations at all airports within its  assigned jurisdiction.", "DOT officials told us that in 2010, DOT and the aviation industry  requested that CDC expand its outreach to further the development of  CDRPs beyond airports with quarantine stations on site to airports without  them. CDC officials told us that since that request, the agency has been  working to expand the coverage of CDRPs to select U.S. airports. These  officials told us that they are in the process of identifying priority airports  using criteria that include the number and origins of arriving international  passengers. These officials reported that at least three airports (one of  which was included in our review) without quarantine stations on site  have already collaborated with CDC to develop an airport preparedness  plan for communicable disease threats. According to these officials,  however, CDC response efforts to disease outbreaks, such as the cholera  outbreak following the Haiti earthquake in 2010, have slowed these  outreach efforts. CDC officials said they hope to complete this effort in the  next several years, but do not have a specific established completion  date.", "FAA officials told us that they encourage airports and airlines to develop  preparedness plans for communicable disease threats. For example, in  July 2009, FAA Office of Airport Safety and Standards issued a  CertAlert to FAA airport inspectors to encourage airport operators to  either update their pandemic flu plans\u2014plans that airports may have  developed in response to the avian influenza threat of H5N1 that began in  2003\u2014or, for those that did not have a plan, to develop such a plan for  their airport. In late 2014, FAA officials told us that they began planning  an update of the July 2009 CertAlert, but it was delayed due to the Ebola  response. As of August 2015, no updated CertAlert has been issued.", "FAA officials told us that they do not track or review airport or airline  plans\u2014in part because they lack adequate public health expertise, which  they believe CDC would have, to assess whether an airport\u2019s or airline\u2019s  plan would be effective at preventing or reducing the spread of  communicable diseases. FAA officials further noted that communicable  diseases rarely threaten the safety of flight, which is FAA\u2019s primary  regulatory jurisdiction. CDC officials in the Division of Global Migration  and Quarantine office told us that they review CDRPs every 2 years at  the 16 airports with quarantine stations currently on-site, and the CDC  quarantine station staff at the airport review them during the in-between  years. However, CDC officials noted that they do not formally track the  development of any preparedness plans for communicable disease  threats at airports that do not currently have a quarantine station on site.", "Airports and airlines are not required to develop and maintain  preparedness plans for communicable disease threats. And neither FAA  nor CDC systematically tracks which airports and airlines have such  plans. Thus, FAA and CDC officials could not tell us the full extent to  which airports that receive international passengers and airlines that  operate international flights have preparedness plans in place.

When we asked  representatives from three airports specifically about DOT guidance for  preparedness plans during interviews, representatives from two airports  were familiar with the Manual, but noted that it was outdated. An official  from DOT\u2019s Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response  told us that DOT has no plans to update it, in part, because in DOT\u2019s  view, everything contained in the document can be found on other  websites and doing so might create a document that could not be rapidly  updated, as might be necessary in facing an emerging public health  threat.", "The guidance for specific disease threats that is published by CDC also  provides some information for those attempting to develop plans or  procedures for responding to a specific disease threat. For example, CDC  published several guidance documents for airport and airline employees  regarding Ebola, including guidance for personal protective equipment for  airport and airline cleaning crews and interim guidance about Ebola  infection for airline crews, cleaning personnel, and cargo personnel.  Local public health entities also provide resources, such as public health  advisories, that airports reported using to help develop such plans.", "Finally, some international guidance and technical assistance is available  to airports and airlines in developing communicable disease plans. For  example, in 2009, ACI, in collaboration with ICAO, published the Airport  Preparedness Guidelines for Outbreaks of Communicable Disease to  help airports. Through CAPSCA, ICAO works to bring international,  regional, national, and local organizations together to combine efforts and  develop a coordinated approach to respond to public health risks.

In 2010, ICAO, by resolution,  further urged member states to ensure that the public health sector and  the aviation sector collaborate to develop a national preparedness plan  for aviation to help prevent the spread of communicable diseases through  air travel, and that member states establish requirements for the  involvement of stakeholders, such as airport operators and airlines, in the  development of the plan. In guidance to member states for developing a  national aviation-preparedness plan, ICAO recommends that such a plan  include guidance that is generic to all communicable diseases. This  guidance can then be adapted for specific diseases. Officials from the  DOT office responsible for coordinating U.S. policy for presentation to  ICAO told us that it is the responsibility of each member state to either  implement regulations or other appropriate measures to comply with  ICAO standards or to file a \u201cdifference\u201d with ICAO.", "While the United States has not developed a national aviation- preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks, DOT and CDC  officials contend that some elements of such a plan already exist.  Specifically, officials from DOT\u2019s Office of Intelligence, Security, and  Emergency Response and FAA\u2019s Office of National Security Programs  and Incident Response, as well as CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration  and Quarantine, told us that some elements of a national aviation- preparedness plan are encompassed in various documents that include  airports\u2019 individual plans, including CDRPs at airports with quarantine  stations on site. However, FAA reported to ICAO in 2010\u2014by way of  answering an ICAO questionnaire on member states\u2019 fulfillment of this  standard\u2014that individual airport plans are intended to handle one or two  flights with inbound passengers and not respond to a full epidemic, which  may require a response involving multiple airports on a national level.  Officials from CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine also told  us that while the United States does not have a national aviation- preparedness plan, past planning efforts, such as the 2005 National  Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and its associated 2006 implementation  plan developed in response to the avian influenza threat of H5N1, as  well as CDC\u2019s Risk-Based Border Strategy (RBBS), helped inform their  decision making in the national-level response to Ebola as this response  pertained to the screening and risk assessment of passengers arriving  from the affected countries. The pandemic influenza national strategy and  implementation plan, however, are neither aviation-specific nor designed  to address communicable disease outbreaks of various types (e.g.,  different diseases), as we have found in past work. Furthermore, CDC  officials told us that the RBBS has been superseded by CDRPs, which  represent the most up-to-date preparedness efforts at U.S. airports.", "DOT and CDC officials also told us that while a national aviation- preparedness plan could have value, they do not believe that their  respective agencies should be the lead in the development of such a  plan. DOT officials said that a national aviation-preparedness plan for  communicable disease outbreaks would be valuable to support a unified  approach where multiple entities, including DOT, have input into the  plan\u2019s development and can then test and exercise the plan. These  officials also noted that while DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary serves as the  liaison to ICAO for Annex 9 to the Chicago Convention, in which the  relevant ICAO standard is contained, complying with an ICAO standard  could be led by any number of other federal agencies. DOT officials  believe that while DOT should be a key contributor to the development of  a national aviation-preparedness plan, HHS should be the lead federal  agency in developing such a plan, in part because DOT does not have  sufficient public health expertise, which they believe HHS does. CDC  officials noted that since communicable disease is just one of many  threats to the commercial aviation sector, a broader, all-hazards national  aviation plan that includes communicable disease as a component may  be more prudent or warranted. These officials also noted that a stand- alone plan may not be necessary, as they believe that the elements  currently in place are sufficient, as reflected in the successful national  Ebola response effort. Yet these officials also stated that they could see  value in aspects of a national aviation-preparedness plan where  stakeholders come together to discuss preparedness, resulting in a  document that is collaborative and likely agreed upon by relevant parties.  CDC officials told us that if a national aviation-preparedness plan were to  be developed, DOT would be in the best position to lead the effort  because FAA and DOT have stronger and deeper ties to the relevant  stakeholders that would be involved in such a broad effort. While the DOT  and CDC may not agree on which agency should lead the development of  a national aviation-preparedness plan, DOT\u2019s Office of the Secretary is  the liaison to ICAO for Annex 9 to the Chicago Convention, in which the  relevant ICAO standard is contained, and is responsible for overseeing  the aviation sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A National Plan Aims to Provide an Adaptable and Scalable Framework", "paragraphs": ["ICAO\u2019s guidance to member states in developing a national aviation- preparedness plan also recommends that such a plan contain guidance  that is generic to all communicable diseases and can be adapted to  specific diseases. It also recommends that specific measures adopted at  individual airports correspond to defined communicable disease threat  alert levels, such as WHO\u2019s pandemic alert phases or a national public- health authority\u2019s alert levels, to help ensure that procedures are scaled  up and down as circumstances of the public health threat change.  Adopting measures that correspond to different risk levels or types of  diseases would provide individual airports with an adaptable and scalable  framework with which to align their plans\u2014without which airports could  find it challenging to prepare for a national response effort. For example,  representatives from four airports that were not designated to conduct  enhanced-screening for Ebola reported developing their own Ebola- specific response plans during the Ebola outbreak\u2014sometimes with and  sometimes without input from federal stakeholders. The airports did this in  part because they did not know what their responsibilities would be in the  long run or to what extent they would need to have procedures in place in  the event that a suspected ill passenger was traveling on a broken  ticket. An adaptable and scalable framework would subsequently  improve harmonization of individual plans across airports and airlines\u2014 helping ensure that the individual plans work in accordance with one  another for a national level response effort\u2014and serve as the basis for  training airport and airline staff and crew.

DOT officials reported not being involved in or consulted on the  decision to funnel passengers from Ebola-affected countries to five  airports and implement enhanced entry-screening procedures. And while  the officials believe that funneling passengers was a good decision in the  case of the Ebola threat, they expressed concern about what might  happen during future national-level communicable disease response  efforts if decisions affecting aviation are made without their input. For  example, in response to the avian influenza threat of H5N1 that began in  2003, national efforts included discussions on funneling all international  passengers through 30 U.S. airports and screening all arriving  passengers\u2014an option provided under RBBS.", "Representatives from three of the four airports that we spoke with about  this issue, as well as ACI representatives, expressed concern that  funneling all arriving international passengers to 30 airports and  screening them was unrealistic due to the resource requirements it would  impose on airports and delays that could ripple across the national  airspace system. DOT officials further noted that from an air traffic control  perspective, many major U.S. airports are already at or near full capacity  and shifting a significant amount of air traffic to these airports could result  in gridlock. CDC officials acknowledged that funneling passengers to 30  airports and screening them all was a worst-case scenario and pointed  out that RBBS was designed to be flexible and scalable and to serve as  an adaptable framework for entry-screening at airports, as the RBBS  framework did for the Ebola outbreak. DOT officials highlighted that  because the number of passengers coming from the Ebola-affected  countries is quite small relative to the total number of international  passengers entering the United States (less than 25,000 out of almost 52- million total passenger arrivals in 2014), the impact from re-routing  passengers to five airports and the time and resources needed to conduct  the enhanced screening did not result in an unreasonable impact on the  national aviation system. This may not be the case if the communicable  disease threat were to come from China, for example, or another region  with large numbers of passengers or flights to the United States.", "DOT officials also reported that they did not always have the opportunity  or were provided insufficient time to review or comment on CDC Ebola  guidance or fact-sheets addressed to aviation stakeholders. For example,  a DOT official told us that because similar information was often posted in  multiple places and because documents that the officials had reviewed in  the past got renamed, revised, and re-published, the DOT official had to  continue to watch out for published CDC guidance that included  recommendations for the aviation industry. The DOT official highlighted  that CDC guidance did not always have the DOT issues portrayed  correctly and that failure to adequately coordinate with DOT could have  safety consequences in some circumstances. For example, if a  disinfectant that is used to clean suspected Ebola contamination is not  compatible with the aircraft materials (e.g., aluminum) or is used in the  wrong manner, such as using too concentrated a solution, the aircraft  could be damaged, which could negatively affect its airworthiness.  Officials from CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine  acknowledged that some CDC webpages about Ebola developed prior to  the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in 2014 contained misinformation  related to aircraft disinfectants, but noted that the information was  promptly removed once officials became aware of the problem.

While CDC requires pilots on international flights to U.S.  airports to immediately notify CDC of ill travelers suspected of having a  communicable disease\u2014as determined by signs and symptoms\u2014flight  crews must focus on safely operating the aircraft during critical phases of  a flight such as takeoffs and landings.

CDC officials  also stated that a lack of proper equipment (thermometer, for example) on  the aircraft may limit flight crews from providing a rapid and detailed  notification of illness. CDC makes available guidance and tools to report  traveler death or disease that outline reporting requirements and  requested information. However, airport responders and CDC officials  said that airlines do not use a common template to record or  communicate this requested information. Inaccurate or untimely  information can slow down an appropriate response (such as conducting  assessments before travelers have exited the aircraft) or trigger  precautions unnecessarily.

With the  anticipated growth in international air travel, the recurring threat of  communicable diseases from abroad, and the potential economic cost of  disrupting air travel, it is imperative that the U.S. aviation system is  sufficiently prepared to help respond to any communicable disease threat.  The 14 airports that we reviewed (11 of which have CDC-developed  CDRPs) had a plan or plans in place that in combination with one another  met the six high-level components that we identified as common  components in federal and international guidance. CDC is working to  expand development of CDRPs to select U.S. airports that the agency is  currently identifying, using criteria involving the origins and the total  volume of international arriving passengers, but it is uncertain when CDC  will be able to complete this effort. Furthermore, Annex 9 to the Chicago  Convention obligates member states to establish a national aviation- preparedness plan\u2014a plan intended to provide a mechanism for the  public health sector to coordinate with the aviation sector in the event of a  communicable disease threat. Yet DOT and CDC officials acknowledge  that only certain \u201celements\u201d of a national aviation-preparedness plan are  in place. Such a plan could help maximize an effective response to a  public health threat, while minimizing potential inefficiencies in the  national response effort and unnecessary disruptions to the national  aviation system. A national aviation-preparedness plan that is generic to  all communicable diseases and can be adapted for specific diseases  would provide individual airports and airlines with an adaptable and  scalable framework with which to integrate their individual plans and  promote harmonization of individual plans across airports and airlines. As  such, the plan could also serve as the basis for testing communication  mechanisms among responders to help ensure those mechanisms are  effective. In addition, it could help ensure that airport and airline staff have  received appropriate training and access to properly maintained  equipment during an outbreak to reduce the risk of exposure to  communicable diseases. Finally, DOT officials expressed concern about  their lack of involvement in decisions made during the Ebola outbreak that  involved the aviation sector. Developing and maintaining a national  aviation-preparedness plan could foster a shared understanding and  agreement among all relevant stakeholders, and help balance the needs  of the aviation and public health sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To help improve the U.S. aviation sector\u2019s preparedness for future  communicable disease threats from abroad, we recommend that the  Secretary of Transportation work with relevant stakeholders, such as the  Department of Health and Human Services, to develop a national  aviation-preparedness plan for communicable disease outbreaks.

We then conducted follow-on interviews with the 14 airport  operators and relevant local stakeholders, who generally included first  responders, local public health officials, CBP officials, and CDC officials, if  applicable, about their preparedness. We also collected from the 14  selected airports and 3 selected airlines relevant and available  preparedness plans for communicable disease threats. We identified and  reviewed applicable federal requirements and international obligations,  including the International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s (ICAO) Standards  and Recommended Practices, and guidance for U.S. airports and airlines  with international air traffic.

We consulted with representatives from the union that  represents these employees to identify nine aviation-service employees  with whom we spoke, and we conducted interviews with two of the four  firms that these nine employees worked for, as well as three of the four  airports they worked at. We also identified challenges to responding to  communicable disease threats and actions taken by stakeholders during  our attendance at a Global Symposium\u2014convened by ICAO in  collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2014of the  Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public  Health Events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA) program, which is a global,  collaborative arrangement that works to bring together international,  regional, national, and local organizations to develop a coordinated  approach to preparedness and response. We also collected and reviewed  available after-action reports that airports used to assess their responses  to simulated communicable disease incidents.

These include screening passengers to detect travelers who  may have an infectious disease (ill travelers), utilizing temperature  screening to diagnose ill travelers, and using data analysis to identify  disease outbreaks and potential traveler movement patterns."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Temperature-Screening Technologies", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel routinely observe  travelers during their primary inspection and refer those that show  symptoms of a communicable disease\u2014or those recently traveling from  an area of concern\u2014for further assessment by Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) staff or other health authorities. Additional  screening, such as was carried out during the Ebola threat, may include  more targeted assessments during enhanced screening. According to the  CBP, there are three main screening methods used for identifying  passengers entering the United States who may have communicable  diseases during the Ebola outbreak: (1) collecting advance passenger  information, (2) visual inspection or taking of temperatures, and (3)  questioning travelers. All of these methods are used for screening  airplane passengers arriving in the United States, but only temperature  measurement is associated with on-site health technology. Temperature  checks may be conducted with contact or noncontact thermometers, but  outside of the current Ebola response, this check is typically not common  and only done in the setting of assessment of a suspected ill traveler  reported to CDC, according to CDC officials.", "Entry screening for Ebola at enhanced screening airports in the U.S.  includes using non-contact infrared thermometers, under the enhanced  screening protocols put in place to address the disease threat. Non- contact thermometer-based temperature measurement is a simple  enough premise, but an agency official suggested it has both low  sensitivity and specificity for detecting passengers with infectious  disease. In other words, such temperature measurement alone has a low  chance of correctly identifying ill travelers and a low chance of correctly  excluding healthy travelers. In the case of enhanced screening for Ebola,  CDC officials or CBP contractors use thermometers that are commercially  available following primary inspection by CBP personnel. To date, no  mass screening of airplane passengers\u2014where every passenger\u2019s  temperature is taken\u2014has been conducted at a U.S. airport. During the  recent Ebola outbreak, for example, only passengers with recent travel to,  from, or through outbreak countries, such as Sierra Leone, were identified  for temperature screening.", "Internationally, both non-contact infrared thermometers as well as thermal  scanners have been used for entry and exit passenger screening for  communicable diseases, including Ebola and severe acute respiratory  syndrome (SARS). For example, in 2009, during the H1N1 influenza  pandemic, many international airports\u2014but not U.S. airports\u2014 implemented temperature-screening procedures. However, the literature  reports questionable effectiveness from temperature screening, stemming  in part from the aforementioned low sensitivity. Some of the performance  issues result from variabilities in temperature measurements exceeding  the threshold for fever indication\u2014variabilities of up to 3 degrees Celsius  under some circumstances, such as after smoking, whereas fever can be  indicated by an elevation of 1 degree Celsius for Ebola, for example.  Temperature variability results from several factors including metabolism,  medication, environment, and conditions, such as certain cancers, which  are not quarantinable diseases of concern for airport screening purposes.  Further, passengers who are in the incubation period of illness may not  exhibit fevers, given that such periods of several infectious diseases  typically last longer than most flights. According to scientific literature,  camera-based thermograms have been used internationally. For  example, camera-based temperature measurement, followed by ear- based temperature measurement, has been tentatively shown to be  effective for monitoring Dengue Fever in Taiwan. Dengue fever is not a  U.S. quarantinable disease, and another study indicated uncertainty that  temperature screening is effective for mitigating community transmission  of this disease. Generally, however, thermal cameras are more expensive  than thermometers and their precision is not better. A possible reason for  deploying thermal cameras is the eventual capacity to screen large  numbers of travelers rapidly, but the benefits of this approach have not  been established.", "The CDC has developed a \u201cBig Data\u201d approach for identifying and  tracking communicable disease outbreaks through data collection and  analysis. Information provided by BioMosaic can be used to help  determine the risk of international spread of disease and to target  potential CDC intervention by identifying potential threats, although it  cannot be used to identify specific ill individuals. Launched in 2011 by the  CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, BioMosaic is a data  analytics tool that works with collections of data, including news sources,  historical travel information, and public databases to map the health and  demographics of foreign-born populations within the United States (e.g.,  diaspora), as well as disease outbreaks internationally.", "For example, in 2014, the CDC reported the first confirmed cases of  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infections in the United  States and, by using BioMosaic, was able to identify the major points of  entry into the country, as well as the volume of travelers entering from  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

These technologies are at  various stages of development and their effectiveness and cost  considerations are not established.", "Airlines use a variety of approaches in responding to ill passengers during  flight. United Airlines is currently exploring the use of telemedicine,  whereby some technology can be used on board an aircraft to provide a  remotely located doctor with information\u2014such as vital signs\u2014needed for  diagnosis and determining whether a flight diversion is needed.", "Development of altered air circulation devices may also mitigate the  spread of communicable diseases. Currently, air in an aircraft is filtered  by high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, but effectiveness relies on  the air\u2019s passing through the filters. If a pathogen circulates widely within  an aircraft cabin prior to being filtered, there may be an increased chance  of person-to-person transmission of the disease. Air-circulation-altering  devices may provide more isolated air environments for each passenger,  but these devices have not yet been developed to the point where they  have been tested or validated.", "Recent research used meta-genomic examination of the content of  airplane lavatories by sequencing and detecting the relative abundance of  select pathogens (not quarantinable infectious diseases, however). By  isolating and determining the sequence from genetic material found in  passenger bio-waste, the researchers were able to determine the types of  antibiotic resistance carried by passengers\u2019 microbes. Researchers were  also able to identify specific pathogens, as well as their relative  abundance based on the geographic origin of the samples. This method  is potentially useful for global surveillance of communicable diseases,  antibiotic resistances, and transmission routes. However, there are  potential challenges to implementing this approach. For example, the  researchers identified that implementing this method from all flights on a  weekly basis would be challenging, given the current state of technology.", "Additionally, developments in point-of-care technology\u2014methods that can  be used in doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals, or on the field (e.g., at an airport),  instead of a laboratory\u2014are increasing the speed of diagnosis as well as  the variety of diseases that can be targeted. For example, companies  have developed FDA-approved tests for human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) that do not require laboratory equipment and can provide results in  as little as 20 minutes. Some tests for communicable diseases, such as  influenza, have been developed and FDA-approved, but studies have  indicated the sensitivities can be variable.
