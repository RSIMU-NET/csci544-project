Under the statute, however, certain articles, including fresh produce, are not required to be marked individually. For these items, the container holding the article must be marked by the country of origin. U.S. Customs Service rulings provide that when fresh produce is taken out of its container and put into an open bin or display rack, there is no obligation to identify the items by the country of origin.", "Three states\u2014Florida, Maine, and Texas\u2014have enacted country-of-origin labeling laws for fresh produce. Florida requires all imported fresh produce to be identified by the country-of-origin by, for example, marking each produce item or placing a sign or label adjacent to the bin. Maine requires country-of-origin labeling for fresh produce at the retail level when it has been imported from countries identified as having specific pesticide violations. Texas requires country-of-origin labeling for fresh grapefruit. In addition, labeling laws for fresh produce have been proposed in at least five other states: California, Connecticut, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Virginia.", "Most large grocery stores carry over 200 produce items. Fresh produce is often imported to fill seasonal needs when U.S. production is not sufficient to cover demand or to satisfy the demand for tropical fruits not normally grown in the United States. Two-thirds of imported fresh produce arrives between December and April, when U.S. production is low and limited to the southern portions of the country. The majority of these imports are warm-season vegetables like peppers, squash, and cucumbers, although some imports, such as tomatoes, occur year round.", "Total U.S. consumption of fresh produce has increased 43 percent since 1980, from about 56 billion pounds to nearly 80 billion pounds in 1997, the latest year for which the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has compiled such data. During this same period, the amount of fresh produce the United States imported more than doubled\u2014from 7.5 billion pounds to 16 billion pounds. The domestic share increased by one third\u2014from about 48 billion to about 64 billion pounds.", "In 1997, most imported produce came from Mexico, Canada, and Chile, as shown in figure 1.", "The United States is also the world\u2019s largest exporter of fresh produce, valued at $2.9 billion in 1998. Three-fourths of exported U.S. produce goes to Canada, the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, and Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainties Exist About the Costs Associated With Compliance and Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["Complying with mandatory country-of-origin labeling for fresh produce could change the way retailers and others involved in the production and distribution of produce do business, thereby affecting their costs and consumers\u2019 choices. Furthermore, such a law could be difficult to enforce."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Magnitude of Compliance Costs and the Responsibility for These Costs Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The fresh produce industry and retailers will have to incur costs to comply with a mandatory country-of-origin labeling law. The additional efforts and associated costs for compliance would depend on the specific requirements of the law and the extent to which current practices would have to be changed. For example, some produce is already labeled with a brand sticker. In these cases, compliance would require adding the name of the country to the sticker. For unlabeled produce, the additional effort would be more significant.", "Associations we spoke with representing grocery retailers are particularly concerned that a labeling law would be unduly burdensome for a number of reasons. First, retailers would have to display the same produce items from different countries separately if each individual item is not marked, which in some cases would result in only partially filled bins. According to these retailers, consumers are less likely to buy from such bins because they are less appealing, causing the retailers to lose sales. Second, retailers report that they do not have sufficient display space to separate produce and still stock all the different varieties consumers want. Large grocery stores usually carry over 200 produce items. Third, because the country of origin of retailers\u2019 produce shipments may vary each week, retailers would incur costs to change store signs and labels to reflect the origins of the different shipments. According to the Food Marketing Institute, an association representing grocery retailers, it would take about 2 staff hours per store per week to ensure that imported produce is properly labeled. Costs would also be incurred if retailers were required to maintain paperwork at each store as evidence of the origin of these multiple shipments. Florida does not require its retail stores to maintain paperwork documenting the country of origin.", "It is unclear who would bear the burden of compliance. A law requiring retailers to ensure that produce is properly labeled would initially place at least some of the compliance costs on retailers. However, retailers would not necessarily bear all these costs. Retailers could raise prices to pass their costs to consumers. However, if consumers reduce their purchases of fresh produce in response, retailers will absorb part of the cost through lower sales volume. For produce that does not have close substitutes, and for which consumer demand is relatively insensitive to price changes, retailers are likely to be more successful in passing costs on to consumers through price increases without experiencing significant declines in sales volume.", "Retailers may decide to require their suppliers to either package produce or label individual produce items. If retailers can impose this requirement without paying more for the same quantity and quality, they will have shifted the labeling costs to their suppliers. Consumer responses may also influence the eventual effect of a country-of-origin law. If consumers prefer domestic produce, they may buy more domestic and less imported produce, which would allow domestic producers to gain market share and/or raise their prices. However, if foreign countries respond by imposing their own labeling requirements, and if this resulted in foreign consumers\u2019 buying less U.S. produce, then U.S. exports could suffer.", "It is also possible that a country-of-origin labeling requirement would result in fewer choices for consumers. This would occur if retailers decide to stock more prepackaged produce, which would already be labeled, and fewer bulk items, which would have to be labeled. Furthermore, if a law required labeling for imported produce only, retailers could decide to stock fewer imported produce items in order to avoid the compliance burden.", "An additional cost would be borne by restaurants and other food service providers if the labeling law applies to them. They would have to let their customers know the country of origin of the produce they use, which could involve, for example, changing information on menus each time the source of the produce changed. According to the National Restaurant Association, the cost of changing menus would be \u201cprohibitive.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Would Need Enforcement Resources for an Inherently Difficult Task", "paragraphs": ["According to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA officials we spoke with, enforcing a labeling law would require significant additional resources. The agency enforcing such a law would have to implement a system to ensure that the identity of produce is maintained throughout the distribution chain. While inspectors could ensure that retailers have signs or labels in place and could review documentation\u2014if it were available\u2014they might not be able to determine from a visual inspection that produce in a particular bin was from the country designated on the sign or label. Such documentation is often unavailable at the retail store.", "It is also unclear who would be responsible for these inspections. Grocery store inspections for compliance with federal health and safety laws are now generally conducted by state and local officials, often under memorandums of understanding with the Food and Drug Administration. USDA officials pointed out that if state and local governments were to carry out the inspections required by a federal country-of-origin labeling law, such a law would have to specify the states\u2019 enforcement role and provide funding for enforcement activities.", "In commenting on a Senate amendment to the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill regarding country-of-origin labeling, FDA expressed \u201creservations about its priority as a public health issue, its cost to administer, and [FDA\u2019s] ability to enforce it.\u201d FDA further noted that the cost of enforcement \u201cwould be significant,\u201d and \u201cit is unclear that enforcement would even be possible.\u201d Among other enforcement problems, FDA cited the need for accompanying paperwork to verify country-of-origin labels and said this would place \u201can enormous burden\u201d on industry. FDA estimated that the federal cost for 1-year\u2019s monitoring under this proposed amendment would be about $56 million.", "The three states that have labeling laws vary in their degree of enforcement. In Florida, which has a mandatory labeling law for all imported produce, enforcement occurs during the course of routine state health inspections that are conducted about twice each year in every store. During the routine inspections, officials check the shipping boxes and packages in the store against the display signs or labels\u2014a task they estimate requires about 15 minutes per visit. However, they said they sometimes have no reliable means to verify the accuracy of these signs and labels. When violations are found, Florida officials said that it takes 5 minutes to process paperwork for new violations and 30 minutes for repeat violations. Figure 2 shows produce labeled in Florida grocery stores.", "According to the Inspection Manager for Maine\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Maine does not enforce its country-of-origin labeling requirements because the list of countries to be identified keeps changing and paperwork to verify the country of origin is often unavailable. In Texas, the labeling law applies only to grapefruit. According to a Texas Department of Agriculture official, grapefruit is rarely imported into Texas, and the labeling law is not currently being enforced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Labeling Law Could Have Trade Implications", "paragraphs": ["Depending on what it might require and how it might be implemented, a law mandating country-of-origin labeling for fresh produce could have adverse trade implications. U.S. trading partners might challenge the law\u2019s consistency with international trade obligations or take steps to increase their own country-of-origin labeling requirements. Moreover, according to USDA officials, enacting a labeling law could make it more difficult for the United States to oppose foreign countries\u2019 labeling requirements that it finds objectionable.", "Any labeling law would need to be consistent with U.S. international trade obligations in order to withstand potential challenges from U.S. trading partners. International trade rules that the United States has agreed to, such as those embodied in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), permit country-of-origin labeling. For example, WTO provisions recognize the need to protect consumers from inaccurate information while minimizing the difficulties and inconveniences labeling measures may cause to commerce. WTO rules require, among other things, that the labeling of imported products must not result in serious damage to the product, a material reduction in its value, or an unreasonable increase in its cost. Correspondence from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) stated that our trading partners could raise concerns that country-of-origin labeling requirements adversely affect their exports by raising costs.", "Similarly, NAFTA requires that any country-of-origin marking requirement must be applied in a manner that would minimize difficulties, costs, and inconveniences to a country\u2019s commerce. USTR and Department of State officials stated that Mexico requested consultations to discuss its concerns that one recently proposed U.S. country-of-origin labeling bill would violate certain NAFTA provisions on country-of-origin marking.", "USDA officials and food industry representatives expressed concern that mandatory country-of-origin labeling at the retail level could be viewed as a trade barrier and might lead to actions that could hurt U.S. exports. For example, a country currently exporting produce to the United States may be concerned about additional costs if its exporters are required to label loose produce. Such a country could respond by enacting or more strictly enforcing retail labeling laws that could hinder U.S. exports. The officials were also concerned that adopting mandatory country-of-origin labeling at the retail level could complicate U.S. efforts to address other countries\u2019 labeling laws that the United States found objectionable. According to USDA officials, the United States has opposed certain country-of-origin labeling in other countries for various reasons, including concerns about the potential of those laws to raise the costs of U.S. exports and discourage consumers from purchasing imported goods.", "While U.S. representatives have worked informally and cooperatively to oppose certain foreign country-of-origin labeling requirements, the United States has not formally challenged any such requirements within the WTO. WTO officials said they were unaware of any formal challenges to any country\u2019s country-of-origin labeling requirement. However, USDA and WTO officials agreed that the absence of any formal challenge does not necessarily indicate that existing country-of-origin labeling requirements are consistent with WTO rules. Moreover, the absence of formal challenges to existing laws does not preclude these laws from being challenged in the future. Finally, because the United States is such a large importer and exporter of fresh produce, officials with USDA and the Department of State pointed out that a U.S. labeling law is more likely to be formally challenged than are other countries\u2019 laws.", "In February and March 1999, we surveyed U.S. embassy agricultural attach\u00e9s in 45 countries with which the United States exports and imports agricultural products to determine which countries have and enforce country-of-origin labeling requirements for fresh produce at the retail level. Our survey included 28 countries that account for most of the U.S. produce imports and exports and 17 countries that USDA identified as having produce labeling requirements. Of the 28 countries, 13 (46 percent) require country-of-origin labeling for bulk produce at the retail level, and 15 require such labeling for packaged produce. Attach\u00e9s in these countries reported the countries with requirements generally have a high level of compliance and moderate to high levels of enforcement.Appendix I identifies the U.S. trading partners that require country-of-origin labeling for fresh produce and the scope of their requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labeling Would Provide Limited Benefits in Responding to Outbreaks of Foodborne Illnesses", "paragraphs": ["Considerable time\u2014several weeks or months\u2014generally passes between the outbreak of a produce-related illness, the identification of the cause, and a warning to the public about the risks of eating a specific produce item, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA officials. By the time a warning is issued, country-of-origin labeling would benefit consumers only if they remembered the country of origin or still had the produce, or if the produce were still in the store. Consequently, country-of-origin labeling would be of limited value in helping consumers respond to a warning of an outbreak.", "Several factors contribute to the delays in identifying causes of foodborne illness, including how quickly consumers become ill after purchasing and eating the food and whether they seek medical attention. State and local agencies report known or suspected foodborne illnesses to CDC, which uses this information to identify patterns of related illnesses\u2014outbreaks\u2014and to work with state, local, and FDA officials to identify the source. Once the source is identified, state and local public health officials generally issue a warning to the public if the product is still available in the marketplace.", "In most cases of foodborne illness, however, officials are not able to identify the specific point at which the food associated with the outbreak became contaminated. Between 1990 and 1998, CDC identified 98 outbreaks of foodborne illnesses linked to fresh produce. In 86 of these cases, the point of contamination was never identified. The remaining 12 cases were traced to contamination in food handling and to seed that was contaminated. Appendix II provides information on outbreaks of illnesses related to contaminated fresh produce since 1990.", "Because of the time needed to identify the cause of an outbreak, country-of-origin labeling would not generally be useful in preventing more consumers from becoming ill. For example, when cyclospora-contaminated raspberries from Guatemala caused outbreaks of illnesses in 1996 and 1997, many individuals did not become ill until a week or more after they ate the fruit.", "CDC officials said that country-of-origin labeling might be a starting point in tracing the source of contamination if a person who had eaten a contaminated product remembered the source for that product. However, they said that more detailed information identifying every step from farm to table\u2014for both domestically grown and imported produce\u2014would be of greater use in tracing the source of an outbreak and identifying the practices that resulted in the contamination. Identifying such practices may enable officials to devise control measures that could be used throughout the industry to decrease the potential for additional illnesses. CDC officials also pointed out that a country-of-origin labeling law would be more useful to them if it required retailers to keep better records, including invoices and shipping documents. Such records would allow investigators to identify the source of produce that was in grocery stores at a particular time in the past.", "Finally, FDA and CDC officials observed that a law exempting food service establishments from country-of-origin labeling would be of limited value because many identified outbreaks have been traced to food served in restaurants or at catered meals. U.S. consumers are eating more meals, including more fresh produce, outside the home. Indeed, a significant portion of the illnesses that were traced to Guatemalan raspberries were contracted from meals eaten outside the home."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Consumers Favor Labeling, Other Information Is More Important to Them", "paragraphs": ["Surveys representing households nationwide, sponsored by the produce industry between 1990 and 1998, showed that between 74 and 83 percent of consumers favor mandatory country-of-origin labeling for fresh produce at the retail level. However, when asked to rate the importance of several types of labeling information, households reported information on freshness as most important, followed by information on nutrition, storage and handling, and preparation tips.

In the same survey, about half of consumers reported having concerns about health and safety and growing conditions, and about one-third had concerns with cleanliness and handling when buying imported produce. Despite these concerns, officials with USDA, CDC, and FDA, told us that sufficient data are not available to compare the safety of domestic and imported produce. However, CDC officials told us that, in the absence of specific food production controls, the potential for contaminated produce increases where poor sanitary conditions and polluted water are more prevalent.", "In addition, Consumers Union\u2014a nationally recognized consumer group\u2014used data collected by USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service to compare the extent to which multiple pesticide residues were found in selected domestic and imported fresh produce. For its analysis, Consumers Union developed a toxicity index, which it used to compare the pesticide residues. According to this analysis, pesticide residues on imported peaches, winter squash, apples, and green beans had lower toxicity levels than those found on their domestically grown counterparts. In contrast, the pesticide residues on domestically grown tomatoes and grapes were less toxic than their imported counterparts. The study acknowledges that almost all of the pesticide residues on the samples were within the tolerance levels allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

We also examined documents and interviewed officials with consumer groups, including the National Consumers League, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the Safe Food Coalition. We also analyzed the results of eight consumer surveys conducted from 1990 to 1998 to determine consumer opinions regarding mandatory country-of-origin labeling. The surveys were identified by industry experts and through literature searches. For the data we included in our report, we obtained frequency counts, survey instruments, and other documents, in order to review the wording of questions, sampling, mode of administration, research strategies, and the effects of sponsorship. We used only data that we judged to be reliable and valid.", "Five surveys, conducted between 1990 and 1998, represented households nationwide that have purchased fresh produce in the past year. These surveys were published by Vance Publishing Corporation for The Packer newspaper and were published in its annual supplement, Fresh Trends. Another nationwide survey was conducted by the Charlton Research Group in 1996 for the Desert Grape Growers League. Two surveys of Florida consumers were conducted by the University of South Florida\u2019s Agriculture Institute in 1997 and the University of Florida in 1998.", "We also spoke with officials and obtained documents from CDC, FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service, Florida\u2019s Department of Health, the Environmental Working Group, and Consumers Union about the relative safety of imported and U.S. produce.", "We conducted our review from November 1998 through March 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Erin Lansburgh, Assistant Director Beverly A.
