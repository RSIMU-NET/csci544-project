Comparable historical data on DOD's contractor workforce are not available. In fiscal year 2011, DOD reported that it contracted for services performed by an estimated 710,000 contractor full time equivalents (FTEs)--a workforce equal to about 90 percent of the size of DOD's civilian workforce of 807,000 FTEs. Using fiscal year 2013 constant dollars, GAO's analysis of DOD spending on contracted services shows obligations peaked in fiscal year 2010 at about $195 billion, more than twice the amount spent in fiscal year 2001. This spending decreased to about $174 billion in fiscal year 2012.", "DOD has taken some steps to improve its understanding and management of its total workforce; however, several shortcomings remain. Specifically, DOD has yet to assess the appropriate mix of its military, civilian, and contractor personnel capabilities in its strategic workforce plan as required by law. Further, DOD has not updated its policies and procedures to reflect current statutory requirements to use its civilian strategic workforce plan and the inventory of contracted services to determine the appropriate mix of personnel to perform DOD's mission. Moreover, DOD's strategic human capital plan does not contain certain required elements and information and several factors limit the accuracy of its inventory of contracted services. As a result, the department is hampered in making more informed strategic workforce mix decisions, which is crucial to meeting DOD's congressional mandate to manage its total workforce.", "Although DOD is not required to perform analysis to identify a list of core or critical functions across the department as a whole, DOD has identified broad core mission areas of the department. However, its current policies do not fully reflect federal policy concerning the identification of critical functions. Office of Federal Procurement Policy Policy Letter 11-01 requires agencies to identify and ensure that they retain control over critical functions that are core to the agency's mission, but may be contracted out to the private sector. DOD's policies and procedures predate the publication of this requirement, and consequently contain no reference to it. Absent specific policies and procedures on this process, DOD may lack assurance that it retains enough government employees to maintain control over these important functions.", "DOD components used various methods and data sources, including their inventories of contracted services, to estimate contractor FTEs for budget submissions, but GAO's analysis found that the contractor FTE estimates have significant limitations and do not accurately reflect the number of contractors providing services to DOD. Components encountered challenges, to include the use of estimating techniques based on inventory data that may not be accurate and the lack of a crosswalk between the inventory and specific budget codes. While the Army has a process that addresses these challenges, it may be several years before the remaining DOD components are able to do the same. DOD is taking steps to help the remaining components address these challenges, but, in the meantime, the budget does not provide an explanation of how the contractor FTE estimates are derived and what limitations apply."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD revise its policies and procedures to incorporate (1) legislative requirements for workforce planning and (2) federal requirements for the identification of critical functions.

DOD\u2019s total workforce consists of  three main components: military personnel (including the active military  and the reserve and guard forces), civilians, and contractors providing  support to the department. For fiscal year 2012, DOD budgeted for a  military workforce of about 2.3 million active and reserve servicemembers  and a civilian workforce of about 800,000 full time equivalents (FTEs),  including foreign nationals and indirect hires. The active military and  reserve and guard forces are charged with implementing the National  Military Strategy and performing military essential functions in support of  DOD\u2019s various missions. DOD\u2019s civilian workforce performs a wide variety  of responsibilities, including providing care for active duty personnel, their  dependents, and wounded servicemembers; managing financial  accounting systems; and providing mission-essential combat-support  functions that traditionally have been performed by the uniformed military,  such as logistics support, maintenance, and carrying out cyber and  intelligence efforts. In addition, a key component of this workforce also  provides deployable civilian experts to Afghanistan and other theaters of  operation. Augmenting the military and civilian workforces, DOD has  increasingly relied on contractors both overseas and in the United States  to perform many of the same functions as civilian employees, including  management support, communication services, interpreters who  accompany military patrols, base operations support (e.g., food and  housing), weapon systems maintenance, and intelligence. In its inventory  of contracted services, DOD reported that it spent about $145 billion for  contracted services in fiscal year 2011, provided by an estimated 710,000  contractor FTEs. DOD\u2019s workforce management is governed by a  complex statutory and regulatory framework, and each component of  DOD\u2019s total workforce is governed by different rules that direct how the  department manages its total workforce. $17.8 billion in fiscal year 2001 to nearly $23.5 billion in fiscal year 2008.  Further, DOD\u2019s obligations for contracted services more than doubled  from fiscal years 2001 to 2009. The sequestration as a result of the  Budget Control Act of 2011 requires spending cuts in fiscal year 2013  totaling about $40 billion through across-the-board, proportional  reductions in funding provided in the appropriations acts for most defense  accounts, including accounts related to DOD\u2019s civilian workforce and  contracted services. To prepare for the sequestration, the Secretaries of  the Military Departments issued guidance in January 2013 to their  respective departments to direct actions intended to reduce costs.  Further, section 955 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal   calls for the Secretary of Defense to develop an efficiencies  Year 2013plan to achieve savings in funding for contractor and civilian workforces  commensurate with the savings in military pay due to currently planned  reductions to active duty end strength.", "The current and long-term future fiscal pressures facing DOD underscore  the importance of a strategic approach to recruit, develop, and retain the  right number of individuals with the necessary skills and competencies for  DOD to meet its mission and contract for services where appropriate.

As  we noted in February 2013, strategic human capital management in DOD  and across the federal government continues to be a GAO high-risk area  because critical skill and competency gaps could undermine agencies\u2019  abilities to accomplish their missions. Current budget and long-term  future fiscal pressures coupled with a potential wave of employee  retirements could produce gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge  that may threaten the government\u2019s capacity to effectively address  complex challenges. Strategic human capital planning that is integrated  with broader organizational strategic planning is essential for ensuring  that agencies have the talent, skills, and experience they need to cost- effectively execute their current and future mission and program goals.  Specifically, with regard to DOD, our work has emphasized that effective  planning can enable the department to have the right people, with the  right skills, doing the right jobs, in the right places, at the right time by  making flexible use of its military and civilian workforces and appropriate  use of contractors.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, Pub.

We relied on data from DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 Future Years  Defense Program (FYDP), the Comptroller Information System (CIS) from  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, and other  DOD budget documents. We determined that these data, collectively,  were sufficiently reliable for use in discussing historical and future trends  of the military and civilian workforces. We assessed the reliability of the  data by comparing the data against other available data sources,  conducting electronic testing of the data, and discussing any limitations of  the data with appropriate DOD officials. DOD does not have comparable  information on DOD\u2019s contractor workforce, but to determine the size of  the contractor workforce, we obtained estimates of contractor FTEs from  DOD\u2019s inventory of contracted services from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal  year 2011. To report on obligated dollars for contracted services, we  reviewed the obligated dollars for contracted services from fiscal year  2001 to fiscal year 2012 and the projected obligations for contracted  services from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014. We relied on budget  data on obligations for contracted services. Based on discussions with  appropriate DOD officials and our comparison of the trends in the budget  data against other data sources, we believe the contracted service  obligation data are sufficiently reliable to serve as context of overall  trends for contracted services.

We selected these components based on the  amount of their obligations for contracted services and the large number  of contractor FTEs they identified in their fiscal year 2011 inventory of  contracted services, the most current inventory available at the time of  our review. We reviewed relevant guidance that directed the DOD  components on how to use the inventory of contracted services to provide  contractor FTE information in their budget submissions for fiscal years  2013 and 2014.

Further, DOD cited other factors that led  to growth within the civilian workforce, such as the department\u2019s new  cyber mission and areas specifically designated by Congress. The  following are examples that DOD officials have cited as contributing to the  change in the size and mix of DOD\u2019s workforce.", "Military to civilian/contractor conversion: DOD officials stated that  about 50,000 military positions were converted to DOD civilian  positions or contractor performance since fiscal year 2004 to devote  more military positions to support of ongoing military operations.  Conversion to civilian performance may not be one-for-one due to  differences in military and civilian availability and productivity rates.  For example, civilians who are typically hired must be qualified for  their position, whereas military personnel often require on-the-job  training in addition to technical training received prior to assignments.  DOD\u2019s military to civilian conversions were partly due to the high pace  of operations that occurred after September 11, 2001, which created  significant stress on the military\u2019s operating forces. Further, in late  2003, DOD reported that studies had found thousands of military  personnel were being used to accomplish work tasks that were not  military essential. DOD found that civilians or contractors could  perform these tasks in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than  military personnel. The Navy and the Air Force reduced their military  end strength when functions performed by military billets, or positions,  were converted to civilian or contractor performance. Conversely,  when the Army and the Marine Corps converted functions performed  by military billets to DOD civilians, they retained these military billets  to be used in the operating force.", "Contractor to civilian conversion (in-sourcing): DOD officials  noted that in-sourcing, or converting previously contracted functions to  performance by civilians, has been an effective tool for the  department to rebalance its workforce, realign inherently  governmental and other critical and core functions to government  performance, and in many cases, generate resource efficiencies for  higher priority goals. In April 2009, the Secretary of Defense  announced his intention to reduce the department\u2019s reliance on  contractors and increase funding for new civilian authorizations. In our  February 2012 report, DOD officials stated that they could not  determine the number of contractor FTEs whose functions were in- sourced because DOD contracts for services, not positions,  and the  number of contractor FTEs used to perform a service is determined by  each private sector provider. Nonetheless, one of the data elements  DOD is required to collect and include in its inventory of contracted  services is the number of contractor FTEs performing each identified  activity pursuant to a contract.", "Growth of acquisition workforce: DOD officials noted that  rebuilding the acquisition workforce is another reason for growth. In  our June 2012 report, we reported that according to DOD officials, the  civilian acquisition workforce gained about 17,500 positions from fiscal  year 2009 to December 2011. As noted previously, a portion of this  growth was attributed to in-sourcing. The acquisition workforce had  experienced significant erosion in some areas of expertise due to a  nearly 50 percent cut in its workforce during the 1990s. This reduction  took place as part of DOD\u2019s larger effort to reduce its civilian  workforce by nearly 20 percent overall during that time. When we  evaluated DOD\u2019s approach to this force reduction in 1992, we found  that it was not oriented toward shaping the makeup of the workforce,  resulting in significant imbalances in terms of shape, skills, and  retirement eligibility. At that time, we found that the department\u2019s  efforts were hampered by incomplete data and lacked a clear strategy  for avoiding the adverse effects of downsizing and minimizing skills  imbalances. The downsizing produced serious imbalances in the skills  and experience of the highly talented and specialized civilian  acquisition workforce, putting DOD on the verge of a retirement-driven  talent drain that has had long-lasting implications. To help alleviate  some of these long standing challenges and provide additional funds  for the recruitment, training, and retention of acquisition personnel, in  2008, Congress established the Defense Acquisition Workforce  Development Fund (DAWDF). DOD officials stated that of the  approximately 17,500 positions, about 5,850 were hired using  DAWDF funds.", "Growth of cyber security workforce: DOD officials stated that focus  on the new cyber mission increased the size of the cyber workforce.  DOD\u2019s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review designated cyberspace  operations as a key mission area and discussed steps the department  was taking to strengthen capabilities in the cyber domain, including  developing a department-wide comprehensive approach to DOD  operations in cyberspace that will help build an environment in which  cyber security and the ability to operate effectively in cyberspace are  viewed as priorities for DOD. According to the Quadrennial Defense  Review, to aid its efforts in countering cyberspace threats, DOD  established the U.S. Cyber Command in 2010 to lead, integrate and  better coordinate the day-to-day defense, protection, and operation of  DOD networks. In November 2011, we reported that DOD established  a cybersecurity workforce plan but faced challenges in determining  the size of its cybersecurity workforce because of variations in how  work is defined and the lack of an occupational series specific to  cybersecurity. For these reasons, in February 2013, we included  workforce planning for cybersecurity personnel as a factor in  designating human capital management as a high risk area for the  federal government.", "The withdrawal from Iraq and planned withdrawal from military operations  in Afghanistan will impact both the military and, to some extent, the  civilian workforce. DOD currently projects a reduction in its civilian  workforce by 2 percent from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017.  Several factors have prompted the department to develop plans to  reshape and possibly reduce the numbers of civilians performing certain  functions, while other needs may require additional civilian positions.  DOD and military service officials identified the following factors as key  drivers of projected future change within DOD\u2019s total workforce.", "Shift in focus to Pacific region: DOD is refocusing its strategy in the  Asia-Pacific region in the interest of promoting regional security with  its allies in the area. DOD officials stated that this restructuring could  result in a reshaped force and might require changes to installations  and support as forces are restructured.", "Budget constraints and uncertainty: DOD, as well as the entire  federal government, is currently operating in a fiscally constrained  environment. The Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military  departments, and other organizations within DOD have issued  guidance to their commands on immediate actions that can be taken  to mitigate some, but not all, of the effects of a constrained budget in  the near-term. Actions include implementing a civilian hiring freeze,  reducing temporary employees, and furloughing the civilian workforce.", "Efficiency initiatives: As the federal government confronts growing  fiscal challenges and DOD faces competition for funding, DOD  announced efficiency initiatives in 2010, which the Secretary of  Defense stated were to reduce duplication, overhead, and excess,  and instill a culture of savings and restraint across the department.  Some of the efficiency initiatives focused directly on civilian workforce  levels, including the goals of reducing civilian positions in offices and  commands across DOD, attempting to hold the civilian workforce level  constant at fiscal year 2010 levels, the elimination of some civilian  senior executive positions, and the disestablishment of the Business  Transformation Agency and Joint Forces Command.", "Continued growth of cyber workforce: According to officials we  spoke to from each of the services, DOD is continuing to focus its  resources on emerging threats such as cyber attacks. For example,  efforts are underway to further develop and implement the cyber  mission. Each service has its own part in this mission and expects a  continued hiring increase in civilian personnel with skills in  cybersecurity. Further, the Secretary of Defense recently stated that  the cyber mission is critical for the department and will continue to be  an investment priority.", "Equipment reset: Military service officials stated that the equipment  that returns from the military operations in Afghanistan will be sent to  depots for repair and maintenance. Reset work, which is performed, in  part, by the civilian workforce, will take two to three years to  complete.", "Medical assistance for returning servicemembers: More than a  decade of fighting two wars has resulted in a large number of soldiers,  marines, sailors, and airmen needing medical care, including, among  other things, adjusting to the use of prosthetic limbs and treatment for  post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries. DOD  officials stated that it will be important to retain and recruit additional  medical personnel to continue to provide for the medical needs of  servicemembers, who can sometimes require long-term care.", "We analyzed the active component of the military and civilian workforce  to provide further perspectives on areas of growth between fiscal years  2001 and 2011. Our analysis of active component end strength and  civilian FTEs by force and infrastructure categories shows that between  fiscal years 2001 and 2011, the civilian workforce generally grew while  the active component workforce generally declined in most force and  infrastructure categories compared to fiscal year 2001. For example, from  fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2011, the acquisition infrastructure   and the defense health program civilian workforce grew by 15  workforcepercent and 57 percent respectively, while the active component declined  in those categories by 16 percent and 3 percent respectively. Further,  according to DOD officials, the growth from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal  year 2011 of the civilian workforce in certain categories such as operating  forces and command and intelligence was in large part due to military to  civilian conversions. Table 2 shows the growth and decline of various  force and infrastructure categories.", "Historical information on the trends of the contractor component of DOD\u2019s  total workforce since 2001 that would be comparable to information  known about the military and civilian components is not available. This  has occurred in part because DOD contracts for services, not individuals,  and because DOD was not required to track such information until 2008  when Congress required DOD to compile its first annual inventory of  contracted services, starting with the services DOD contracted for in fiscal  year 2007. To date, DOD has submitted annual inventories of contracted  services to Congress for fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and  2011. However, DOD officials cautioned against comparing the number  of contractor FTEs reported across fiscal years because of differences in  the estimating formula, changes in reporting for the research and  development category, and other factors. In fiscal year 2011, DOD  reported that about 710,000 contractor FTEs were performing various  functions pursuant to contracts for services\u2014about 90 percent of the size  of DOD\u2019s civilian workforce of 807,000 FTEs. Further, in its fiscal year  2011 inventory, DOD reported that these 710,000 contractor FTEs  provided services to DOD under contracts with obligations totaling about  $145 billion.FTEs reported and obligation dollars reported in DOD\u2019s inventory of  contracted services for fiscal years 2008 through 2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Some Steps Useful for Determining the Appropriate Mix of Its Workforce, but Shortcomings Remain", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken some steps to improve its understanding and  management of its workforce, including service-specific efforts to obtain  better data about the workforce; however, several shortcomings remain.

In the most  recent version of the strategic workforce plan issued in March 2012, DOD  included information submitted by 11 functional communities, which are  groups of employees who perform similar functions. We found that 2 of  the 11 functional communities included in the plan\u2014the medical and  human resources functional communities\u2014provided data on the mix of  their workforces, while 9 communities provided partial or no data. For  example, the logistics and information-technology functional communities  provided only the military and civilian workforce data and did not include  contractor workforce data. In September 2012, we recommended that  DOD direct the functional communities to collect information that identifies  not only the number or percentage of personnel in its military, civilian, and  contractor workforces but also the capabilities of the appropriate mix of  those three workforces, and DOD partially concurred with this  recommendation.

Prior to these 2011 changes, the legislation  governing DOD\u2019s personnel required that the department use the least  costly form of personnel consistent with military requirements and other  departmental needs. Section 129a was revised to clarify that when  determining the most appropriate and cost efficient mix of military, civilian,  and contractor personnel to perform the mission of the department, that  the attainment of a DOD workforce sufficiently sized and comprised of the  appropriate mix of personnel necessary to carry out DOD\u2019s mission and  the core mission areas of the armed forces takes precedence over cost.  The law also specifies that the Secretary of Defense shall establish  policies and procedures that shall specifically require DOD to use, among  other things, the civilian strategic workforce plan and the inventory of  contracted services when making determinations regarding the  appropriate workforce mix. Although DOD Instruction 1100.22 had  already addressed the requirement that risk mitigation take precedence  over cost in making workforce decisions prior to the enactment of section  129a, DOD has not yet implemented the new requirement that  determinations regarding the appropriate workforce mix be made using  the civilian strategic workforce plan and the inventory of contracted  services. As a result, DOD decision makers may lack key elements  necessary to make appropriate, informed decisions concerning DOD\u2019s  mix of personnel because the department has not updated its existing  policies and procedures or issued new guidance for determining  workforce mix that reflects the new statutory requirements.

Using the fiscal year 2010  inventory and applying inflationary factors, the Navy used an average  contractor FTE cost of $180,119 to derive a contractor FTE figure of 924  for this sub activity group. Navy budget officials told us they used the  same average contractor FTE cost for all of its different types of services.", "Both services\u2019 fiscal year 2010 inventories were based primarily on data  from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  system. DOD has acknowledged that FPDS-NG has a number of  limitations that affect the utility, accuracy, and completeness of the  inventory data. For example, FPDS-NG does not identify more than one  type of service purchased for each contract action, is not able to capture  any services performed under contracts that are predominantly for  supplies, and cannot provide the number of contractor FTEs used to  perform each service, among other things. DOD officials acknowledge  that the use of derived average cost figures can result in inaccurate  reporting of contractor FTEs. For example, Navy budget officials noticed  that the funding for satellite lease services had decreased significantly,  but the contractor FTE estimate related to the services remained stable.  The budget officials believed that since the program had moved from the  development phase of its life cycle to the maintenance phase, the number  of contractor FTEs needed for the program would be less than 10  compared to the approximately 1,000 FTEs calculated for budget  purposes. The budget officials decided not to make adjustments to the  projections because they wanted to use a consistent approach to derive  the contractor FTEs. In January 2011, we reported that Army manpower  and OSD officials raised concerns about the use of average labor rates  and ratios to project contractor FTEs given the tendency of those  averages to obscure variations in the underlying data. Further, our  analysis showed that the use of these averages resulted in significant  variations for some specific categories of services and particular  contracts.", "For the fiscal year 2013 budget submissions, budget officials from the  remaining three components we examined used other data sources they  considered to be more reliable for their contractor FTE projections. These  officials explained that the fiscal year 2010 inventories were not aligned to  their budget data, were outdated or were not appropriate for budget  projection purposes. For example, DISA and DLA budget officials noted  that the most current inventory data available at the time the components  were preparing their fiscal year 2013 budgets reflected contracts that  were active in fiscal year 2010. Further, component budget officials noted  that object class codes (used in preparing the budget) and product  service codes (used in tracking contracts in FPDS-NG) often did not have  a direct relationship, making the translation between the two categories  subjective. For example, object class 25.1, which is used to delineate  advisory and assistance services, is broad enough to encompass  numerous product service codes associated with multiple categories of  services. As a result, DISA and DLA relied on program managers to  provide their projections on what level of contractor FTEs would be  funded by the operation and maintenance budget requests.", "Army budget officials explained that they did not use the inventory data  compiled from the Army\u2019s Contractor Manpower Reporting Application  (CMRA) system when preparing their fiscal year 2013 budget submission.  The CMRA system is intended to capture data directly reported by  contractors on each service performed at the contract line item level,  including information on the direct labor dollars, direct labor hours, total  invoiced dollars, the functions and mission performed, and the Army unit  on whose behalf contractors are performing the services. It also captures  selected information from FPDS-NG and the Army\u2019s accounting systems  (to include budget codes). While DOD\u2019s AT&L and P&R leadership  considers the Army as currently having a reporting process and  infrastructure in place that fully complies with inventory legislative  requirements, CMRA data was not available in time. Instead, budget  officials relied on the Army\u2019s Structure and Manpower Allocation System  (SAMAS), which according to budget and program officials contains  civilian, military, and contractor personnel information and is used during  the Army\u2019s program and budget development process. However, an Army  manpower official explained that SAMAS does not include object class  data, dollars projected for contracted services, or information on  inherently governmental and closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. Table 4 summarizes the methods used by DOD  components in our review to derive their respective contractor FTE  projections.", "The Comptroller issued updated guidance in June 2012 for the fiscal year  2014 through 2018 budget submissions. The updated guidance  incorporated two significant changes from the 2011 guidance. The  components are now required to (1) include contractor FTE estimates for  not only the operation and maintenance account, but also for non- operation and maintenance accounts including the procurement and  research, development, test and evaluation budget accounts and (2)  report contractor FTE and budget data together, rather than separately for  different budget accounts.", "According to Navy and Air Force officials, for the fiscal year 2014 budget  submission, they followed the same approach used to project contractor  FTEs that they did for their fiscal year 2013 budget submission; that is,  they derived an average contractor FTE cost from their fiscal year 2011  inventory data. Therefore, the resulting projections will have the same  limitations as their fiscal year 2013 projections. Navy and Air Force  officials indicated that they used an average contractor FTE cost derived  from their inventory to generate estimates for procurement and research,  development, test and evaluation contractor FTEs in the same manner as  they did for operation and maintenance-related activities. DLA and DISA  officials indicated that they followed the same process as they did for their  fiscal year 2013 budget submission whereby they relied on inputs from  their program managers.", "According to Army budget officials, the Army used a different process to  project contractor FTEs for their fiscal year 2014 budget submission.  These officials told us that the Army used information contained in its  inventory of contracted services, which was compiled using data from its  CMRA system, as well as the results of its reviews as the basis for its  fiscal year 2014 contractor FTE projections. Army budget and manpower  officials noted that several factors facilitated the use of CMRA data for its  fiscal year 2014 budget contractor FTE projections. First, Army budget  officials noted that they received fiscal year 2011 CMRA data in sufficient  time to use for the fiscal year 2014 budget submission. Further, as part of  the Army\u2019s inventory review process, when the individual commands  reviewed the inventory data associated with their contracted services,  they had assigned budget codes to the CMRA data so that it could be  aligned with the Army\u2019s budget lines of accounting. In this regard, during  the Army\u2019s inventory review process, Army command officials assigned  budget codes to the CMRA contract data through a web based  application. This process allowed budget officials to gain additional insight  into the types of services included in each line of accounting, and align  contractor FTES in the budget submissions in an easier and more  transparent manner.", "At the conclusion of our review, DOD released the fiscal year 2014  Operation and Maintenance Overview, which reported that DOD  requested about $52.5 billion for contracted services in the operations  and maintenance account and projected that about 223,000 contractor  FTEs would be funded with that amount. During our review of the  document, we found that the funding amounts and the contractor FTE  summary information for each military department did not match the  figures that the military departments reported as part of their individual  fiscal year 2014 budget submissions. When we inquired as to the  possible reasons for the discrepancies, a Comptroller official, with  knowledge of the Operation and Maintenance Overview document, told  us that a variety of factors could have contributed to the differences,  including that the overview document excluded Health Program and  Research and Development contracts that the military services included  in their budget documents. The Comptroller official, however, did not  know the exact reasons for the discrepancies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Taking Steps to Improve the Accuracy of Contractor FTE Projections Included in Future Budget Submissions", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials recognize that the contractor FTE information provided in  their fiscal year 2013 and 2014 budget submissions had significant  limitations, but noted that DOD has initiatives underway to improve the  accuracy of components\u2019 inventories of contracted services and the  linkage between the inventories and budget data. However, according to  DOD officials, these initiatives are not expected to be fully implemented  for several years.", "DOD officials stated that having a reliable, current inventory of contractor  FTEs is a fundamental building block for developing future contractor FTE  estimates. DOD has initiated efforts to improve inventory data by  collecting manpower data directly from contractors, using the Army\u2019s  CMRA system as the model. To do so, DOD directed its components in  November 2012 to include a reporting requirement in new and current  contracts for services to collect direct labor hours from contractors, which  can subsequently be used to calculate contractor FTEs performing each  service or function. In addition, DOD is developing a department-wide  CMRA system to collect and house this data. DOD officials expect to  have a fully functional system available for all components to begin to use  in fiscal year 2014 and that components will be in compliance with the  reporting requirement by 2016.", "One challenge identified by Comptroller and manpower officials is the  need to link contractor manpower information in the inventories of  contracted services to specific budget lines of accounting. There are  approximately 2,200 contract codes, referred to as product and service  codes, in the FPDS-NG inventory and the CMRA inventory that  correspond to specific types of services which, according to acquisition  officials, need to be linked to roughly 21 budget codes. According to an  Army official, the Army CMRA as implemented contains both budget  codes and product service codes; therefore, it is not be dependent on  DOD\u2019s crosswalk effort. For example, the Defense Acquisition University  has mapped 17 product and service codes to one budget code related to  printing and reproduction. According to an acquisition official, the  department recently formed a working group comprised of officials from  the acquisition community and the Comptroller\u2019s office to develop a more  complete crosswalk between the product and service codes and the  budget lines of accounting. This acquisition official also told us that formal  guidance related to the crosswalk is expected to be issued in April 2013  and modifications to financial systems to capture product and service  code information should occur in 2014.", "Finally, although DOD officials do not expect these initiatives to be fully  implemented for several years, one could expect to see incremental  improvements in the fidelity of contractor FTE projections as DOD  components compile more accurate and complete inventories and  conduct the required reviews of that inventory data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD manages a large and diverse workforce that is tasked with  accomplishing a wide variety of missions, from shipyard maintenance to  cybersecurity. Over the past decade and in the context of fighting two  wars, both the military and civilian parts of this workforce have grown in  number, as has spending on contracted services, but the department now  faces a changing environment that includes a strategic shift and a period  of fiscal constraint that will likely last for some time. As DOD decides how  to face these changes, total workforce management and planning will be  important elements of ensuring the department\u2019s continued ability to meet  the unique requirements of its missions. To be successful, the department  must carefully consider what critical skills and competencies are needed  to meet these requirements, and what strategies it can use to monitor and  plan for retaining those skills in its workforce. Ensuring that its guidance is  up to date would aid the department in assessing an appropriate  workforce mix, properly identifying critical functions as required by the  Office of Federal Procurement\u2019s Policy\u2019s September 2011 memorandum,  and mitigating inappropriate risks that may be posed by contractors  performing certain functions.", "Congress, recognizing the importance of identifying the extent to which  DOD relies on contractors to help carry out its mission, has enacted new  legislative requirements over the past five years requiring DOD to collect  data on its contractor workforce and make determinations about the  nature of the activities that contractors perform, and amended legislation  to require DOD to include contractor workforce information in DOD\u2019s  strategic planning and total force management efforts and budget  requests. DOD\u2019s approach to including projected contractor FTE  information in its fiscal year 2013 and 2014 budget requests had a  number of limitations and DOD acknowledges that the FTE information  does not accurately reflect the number of contractors performing work in  support of DOD. The department is taking steps to improve the accuracy  of the data contained in its inventory of contracted services and enable  the inventory and required reviews to be used to project contractor FTEs  for budgetary purposes, but it may be several years before DOD is able to  do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure DOD\u2019s workforce mix guidance reflects the current  statutory requirements for total force management policy set forth in 10  U.S.C. \u00a7 129a as well as the regulatory requirements set forth in the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy\u2019s September 2011 policy letter, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to revise DOD\u2019s existing workforce  policies and procedures to address the determination of the appropriate workforce mix, and  identification of critical functions.", "Until such time that DOD is able to accurately project contractor FTE  estimates it presents in budget submissions using the inventories and  required reviews, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to include an explanation in  annual budget exhibits of the methodology used to project contractor FTE  estimates and any limitations of that methodology or the underlying  information to which the methodology is applied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with  both recommendations. DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix III.  Additionally, DOD provided technical comments on the draft report, which  we incorporate as appropriate. We provided a draft of this report to the  Office of Management and Budget, but we did not receive comments.", "DOD made two overarching comments in its agency response to our draft  report. First, DOD commented that it is concerned by the emphasis we  placed on the strategic workforce plan as it relates to the department\u2019s  total force management and resulting workforce size and structure. DOD  stated that the plan is an integral tool in informing policies and procedures  for retention, recruitment, and accession planning and it helps inform the  demographic makeup of its civilian personnel inventory, including the  talent, competencies, education, and skills of that workforce. DOD stated  that it uses a capabilities-based approach to determine the size and  structure of the workforce needed to implement national military and  security strategies. These capabilities are based on the department\u2019s  mission, function, and task hierarchy, and are informed by workload, risk  mitigation, and resource availability. According to DOD, it justifies its  workforce size based on mission workload, rather than competency or  skill gaps. We agree that DOD\u2019s mission workload should determine the  size of its total workforce. However, the type of personnel\u2014military,  civilian, or contractor\u2014that performs the work is dependent on the nature  of the work and circumstances of its performance. DOD is required by law  to establish policies and procedures that require the use of the strategic  workforce plan when making determinations of the appropriate mix of  total workforce personnel necessary to perform its mission, and to include  in the strategic workforce plan an assessment of the appropriate mix of  military, civilian, and contractor personnel capabilities, which it has not  included to date. While the primary focus of this report is not on DOD\u2019s  strategic workforce plan, we have reported in this and a body of prior  work, that without knowledge of the skills and competencies that are  necessary to perform its mission workload and any associated gaps in  those skills and competencies, DOD may be challenged to appropriately  identify its current and future civilian workforce needs. Moreover, without  assurance that its civilian workforce possesses the necessary skills and  competencies, DOD may not be able to readily convert the performance  of a function from contractor to civilian personnel, should DOD determine  that it would be more appropriate to do so. Therefore, a fully developed  strategic workforce plan that addresses the statutory requirements to  include an assessment of the appropriate mix of military, civilian, and  contractor personnel capabilities and report on the results of competency  and skill gap analysis, could serve as an important resource for the  department as it makes workforce mix decisions, especially in light of  current fiscal constraints and budgetary pressures.", "DOD commented that it is also concerned by the apparent lack of  reference in our draft report to the Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  and Execution process carried out annually across the department,  especially as these processes relate to the size and shape of the  department\u2019s total force. DOD explained that the process provides  direction on spending levels, mission priorities, and strategic goals, which  then impact decisions regarding force structure and operational  capabilities, and ultimately addresses prioritization and resource  alignment. We agree with DOD that the Planning, Programming,  Budgeting, and Execution process is an important aspect of workforce  planning and decisionmaking; both requirements and resources drive  workforce decisions. We noted in our draft report that various OSD  officials stated that the workforce requirements determination process is  part of the department\u2019s Planning, Programming, Budgeting and  Execution process to help ensure fully informed risk and cost decisions  are translated into justified and transparent manpower requirements.  Further, we noted the roles and responsibilities of the various offices  involved in developing workforce requirements, including as part of the  budget process. However, we also noted that a recently enacted statute  requires that DOD and prioritize the attainment of a workforce sufficiently  sized and comprised of the appropriate mix of military, civilian and  contractor personnel to carry out DOD\u2019s mission over cost. Our report  addresses steps DOD is taking to implement statutory requirements to  develop and utilize certain policies, analyses, and tools to aid in making  such workforce mix determinations. As DOD stated, the budgeting  process involves prioritization of requirements and making trade-offs  among competing needs as part of resource allocation. Therefore, having  the most reliable and accurate information is imperative for making well  informed budgetary and other workforce planning decisions.  Consequently we believe, DOD should continue to take steps to obtain  and develop the information and data that will allow it to make more  informed and strategic workforce mix decisions, such as analyses of the  gaps in skills and competencies within the civilian workforce, identification  of the functions that are critical to the department\u2019s mission, and the  collection of more accurate and complete information regarding  contractors performing work in support of DOD.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to revise the  department\u2019s existing workforce policies and procedures to address the  determination of the appropriate workforce mix and identification of critical  functions. As we noted in our report, DOD has not issued new guidance  or revised existing guidance to reflect the current statutory and other  federal requirements for total force management policy. Specifically, we  reported that DOD\u2019s primary policies for determining workforce mix\u2014 DOD Directive 1100.4 and DOD Instruction 1100.22\u2014largely reflect  current statutory requirements set forth in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 129a for DOD  policies concerning workforce mix, though there are several recent  amendments that have yet to be incorporated, such as that DOD has not  yet implemented the new requirements that determinations regarding the  appropriate workforce mix be made using the civilian strategic workforce  plan and the inventory of contracted services. Further, we reported that  the guidance similarly does not reflect federal requirements for the  identification of critical functions as required by Office of Federal  Procurement Policy\u2019s Policy Letter 11-01. In response to our draft report,  DOD stated in its agency comments that DOD Directive 1100.4. is  currently undergoing revision and entering the formal issuance process  for signature by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. Further, DOD stated  that the updated directive will authorize and direct the revision of the  instruction. We noted in our report that OSD officials told us that they  were in the process of revising both the directive and instruction, and they  provided us with a draft of the revised directive. DOD should issue this  revised guidance in a timely manner and ensure that revisions to both  guidance documents address statutory requirements related to  determinations of the appropriate mix of the department\u2019s workforce and  federal requirements to identify critical functions in order for  decisionmakers to make better informed decisions regarding the mix of  personnel and ensure that the department retains enough government  employees to maintain control of functions that are critical to its mission.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation to include an  explanation in annual budget exhibits of the methodology used to project  contractor FTE estimates and any limitations of that methodology or the  underlying information to which the methodology is applied. DOD stated  in its agency comments that its financial management regulations and  annual budget submission guidance memorandums issued by the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) are the means used to  explain budget exhibit preparation methodologies and the guidance  directs how components are to develop and display budgetary estimates.  DOD stated in its comments that this office will strengthen the annual  guidance as improvements are made in the inventory of contracted  services. Further, DOD stated that if a component\u2019s methodology  deviates from the process defined in the annual guidance, a footnote  explaining the deviation will be included in the contracted services section  of the Operation and Maintenance Overview book within the budget. We  recognize DOD has efforts underway to improve its inventory of  contracted services, including its use in providing contractor FTEs within  its annual budget exhibits. While footnoting any component  methodologies that deviate from DOD\u2019s guidance is a step in the right  direction, most components use methodologies that reflect inherent  limitations that undermine the utility and accuracy of the FTE estimate.  DOD acknowledged during the course of this review that the contractor  FTE information provided in their fiscal year 2013 and 2014 budget  submissions had significant limitations. Consequently, to improve  transparency, we continue to believe that DOD should disclose the  methodologies used and any limitations thereof until such time DOD is  able to accurately project contractor FTEs.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the  Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller, the Office of Management and  Budget, and appropriate congressional committees.

We did not  independently assess the accuracy or reliability of the underlying data  supporting the fiscal year inventories. However, we reviewed our prior  work, which addressed limitations of the inventory data. Due to the lack of  consistent reporting of contractor FTE data, we reviewed the obligated  dollars for contracted services from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year  2012 and the projected obligations for contracted services from fiscal year  2013 through fiscal year 2014. We relied on budget data on obligations  for contracted services (object class 25). Based on discussions with  various OSD officials, we excluded object classes 25.3 that represent  dollars obligated for goods and services from federal sources. We  adjusted the current dollars to constant fiscal year 2013 dollars using the  Fiscal Year GDP Price Index to eliminate the effects of inflation. GAO has  designated DOD\u2019s financial management area as high risk due to long- standing deficiencies in DOD\u2019s systems, processes, and internal controls.
