In 2011, the MIG reported that it was redesigning its national provider audit program. Previously, its audit contractors were using incomplete claims data to identify overpayments. According to MIG data, overpayments identified by its audit contractors since fiscal year 2009 were not commensurate with its contractors' costs. The MIG's redesign will result in greater coordination with states on a variety of factors, including the data to be used. It remains to be seen, however, whether these changes will result in an increase in identified overpayments. The table below highlights the MIG's core oversight activities, which were implemented from fiscal years 2007 through 2009. The MIG's core oversight activities present an opportunity to enhance state efforts through the provision of technical assistance and the identification of training opportunities. The MIG's assessment of state program integrity efforts during triennial onsite reviews and annual assessments will need to address data inconsistencies identified during these two activities. Improved consistency will help ensure that the MIG is appropriately targeting its resources.

CMS\u2019s expanded role presents an  opportunity to assist and improve the effectiveness of state activities, but  also requires that federal resources are targeted appropriately and do not  duplicate state activities.", "Medicaid is jointly funded by federal and state governments. It is one of  the largest social programs in the federal budget\u2014covering about   67 million people in fiscal year 2010\u2014and one of the largest components  of state budgets. In fiscal year 2010, Medicaid expenditures totaled about  $401 billion, with a federal share of $270 billion and a state share of   $132 billion. As a result of flexibility in the program\u2019s design, Medicaid  consists of 56 distinct state-based programs. The challenges inherent in  overseeing a program of Medicaid\u2019s size and diversity make the program  vulnerable to improper payments, which may be the result of fraud,  waste, and abuse. Because of the program\u2019s risk of improper payments  as well as insufficient federal and state oversight, we added Medicaid to  our list of high-risk programs in January 2003. CMS estimated that  Medicaid improper payments were $21.9 billion for fiscal year 2011.", "States are the first line of defense against Medicaid improper payments.  Specifically, they must comply with federal requirements to ensure the  qualifications of the providers who bill the program, detect improper  payments, recover overpayments, and refer suspected cases of fraud and  abuse to law enforcement authorities. At the federal level, CMS, an  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is  responsible for supporting and overseeing state Medicaid program  integrity activities.", "In 2005, we testified that CMS needed to increase its commitment\u2014both  the alignment of resources and strategic planning\u2014to helping states fight  Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse. Subsequently, the DRA established  the Medicaid Integrity Program and included other provisions designed to  increase CMS\u2019s support for state activities to address Medicaid fraud,  waste, and abuse. The DRA provided appropriations to implement the  Medicaid Integrity Program, and the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA) enacted in March 2010 gave CMS and states  additional provider and program integrity oversight tools.", "You asked GAO to testify today on Medicaid program integrity.

MSIS does not contain billing  information, such as the referring provider\u2019s identification number or  beneficiary\u2019s name, because it is a subset of the claims data  submitted by states.

Because states also routinely review and audit  provider claims, the MIG recognized that coordination was key to avoiding  duplication of effort. In 2011, the MIG reported that it was redesigning its  national provider audit program to allow for greater coordination with  states on data, policies, and audit measures. According to MIG data,  overpayments identified by its review and audit contractors over the first   3 years of the national audit program were not commensurate with the  contractors\u2019 costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Core MIG Activities Were Implemented Gradually from 2006 to 2009", "paragraphs": ["The DRA provided CMS with the resources to hire staff whose sole duties  are to assist states in protecting the integrity of the Medicaid program.  The MIG\u2019s core activities were implemented gradually from fiscal year  2006 to 2009. The DRA provided start up funding of $5 million for fiscal  year 2006, increasing to $50 million for each of the subsequent 2 fiscal  years, and $75 million per year for fiscal year 2009 and beyond. One of  the first activities initiated by the MIG in fiscal year 2007 was  comprehensive program integrity reviews to assess the effectiveness of  states\u2019 activities, which involved eight, week-long onsite visits that year.  One of the last activities to be implemented was the statutorily required  National Provider Audit Program where MIG contractors review and audit  Medicaid provider claims. In fiscal year 2005, we reported that CMS  devoted 8.1 full time equivalent staff years to support and oversee states\u2019  anti-fraud-and-abuse operations, which, in 2010, had grown to 83 out of  the 100 DRA authorized full time equivalent staff years. Table 1  describes six core MIG activities and the fiscal year in which those  activities began.", "Figure 2 shows MIG expenditures by program category for fiscal year  2010. The Medicaid Integrity Institute accounted for about 2 percent of  the MIG\u2019s fiscal year 2010 expenditures, while the National Provider Audit  Program accounted for about half of expenditures.", "At the outset, the MIG recognized that effective coordination with internal  and external stakeholders was essential to the success of the Medicaid  Integrity Program. In a report issued prior to establishment of the  program, we found that CMS had a disjointed organizational structure and  lacked the strategic planning necessary to face the risks involved with the  Medicaid program. We identified the need for CMS to develop a  strategic plan in order to provide direction to the agency, its contractors,  states, and its law enforcement partners. In designing and implementing  the program, the MIG convened an advisory committee consisting of   (1) state program integrity, Medicaid, and MFCU directors from 16 states;  and (2) representatives of the FBI, HHS-OIG, and CMS regional offices.  This committee provided planning input and strategic advice and  identified key issues that the MIG needed to address, including  \uf0b7  The MIG\u2019s efforts should support and complement states\u2019 Medicaid  integrity efforts, not be redundant of existing auditing efforts.  \uf0b7  Program integrity activities of the MIG and other federal entities  require coordination with states regarding auditing and data requests.  \uf0b7  The focus of state activities should be shifted from postpayment  audits to prepayment prevention activities.", "The advisory committee also highlighted the lack of state resources for  staffing, technology, and training. CMS\u2019s July 2009 Comprehensive  Medicaid Integrity Plan, the fourth such plan since 2006, stated that  fostering collaboration with internal and external stakeholders of the  Medicaid Integrity Program was a primary goal of the MIG.", "In implementing more recent statutory requirements, CMS again stressed  the need for effective coordination and collaboration. CMS\u2019s commentary  accompanying the final rule on the implementation of Medicaid RACs  acknowledged the potential for duplication with states\u2019 ongoing efforts to  identify Medicaid overpayments. States have been responsible for the  recovery of all identified overpayments, including those identified since  fiscal year 2009 by the MIG\u2019s audit contractors. The new requirement for  states to contract with an independent Medicaid RAC introduces another  auditor to identify and collect Medicaid overpayments. The Medicaid RAC  program was modeled after a similar Medicare program, which was  implemented in March 2009 after a 3-year demonstration. Because  Medicare RACs are paid a fixed percentage of the dollar value of any  improper payments identified, they generally focused on costly services  such as inpatient hospital stays. Our prior work on Medicare RACs noted  that the postpayment review activities of CMS\u2019s other contractors would  overlap less with the RACs\u2019 audits if those activities focused on different  Medicare services where improper payments were known to be high,  such as home health. Because Medicaid RACs are not required to be  operational until January 1, 2012, the extent to which states will structure  their RAC programs to avoid duplication and complement their own  provider review and audit activities remains to be seen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The MIG Is Redesigning the National Provider Audit Program, Whose Returns Were Not Commensurate with Contractors\u2019 Costs", "paragraphs": ["In its most recent annual report to the Congress, the MIG indicated that it  was redesigning the National Provider Audit Program. According to the  MIG, the National Provider Audit Program has not identified  overpayments in the Medicaid program commensurate with the related  contractor costs. About 50 percent of the MIG\u2019s $75 million annual budget  supports the activities of its review and audit contractors. From fiscal  years 2009 through 2011, the MIG authorized 1,663 provider audits in 44  states. However, the MIG\u2019s reported return on investment from these  audits was negative. While its contractors identified $15.2 million in  overpayments, the combined cost of the National Provider Audit Program  was about $36 million in fiscal year 2010. The actual amount of  overpayments recovered is not known because states are responsible for  recovering overpayments and the MIG is not the CMS entity that tracks  recoveries. Actual recoveries may be less than the identified  overpayments.", "The National Provider Audit Program has generally relied on MSIS, which  is summary data submitted by states on a quarterly basis that may not  reflect voided or adjusted claims payments. As a result, the MIG\u2019s audit  contractors may identify two MSIS claims as duplicates when the state  has already voided or denied payment on one of these claims. For their  program integrity efforts, states use their own MMIS data systems, which  generally reflect real-time payments and adjustments of detailed claims  for each health care service. States are required to have a SURS  component that performs data mining as a part of their program integrity  efforts. The MIG\u2019s review contractors use data mining techniques that  may be similar to those employed by states, and they may not identify  any additional improper claims.", "Moreover, MIG officials told us that the National Provider Audit Program  did not prioritize the activities according to the dollar amount of the claim,  that is, it did not concentrate its efforts on audits with the greatest  potential for significant recoveries. Although the amount of overpayment  identified from any given audit can vary by thousands or millions of  dollars, the MIG\u2019s comprehensive reviews of several states\u2019 Medicaid  integrity programs show that these states identified significantly higher  levels of overpayments in 1 year than the National Provider Audit  Program identified over 3 years. For example, the number of national  provider audits (1,663) over three fiscal years was similar to the number  that New York conducted in fiscal year 2008 (1,352), yet CMS reported  that New York had identified more than $372 million in overpayments\u2014 considerably more than the $15.2 million identified through national  provider audits.", "The MIG\u2019s proposed redesign of the National Provider Audit Program  appears to allow for greater coordination between its contractors and  states on a variety of factors, including the data to be used. In fiscal  year 2010, the MIG launched collaborative audits in 13 states. For these  audits, the states and the MIG agreed on the audit issues to review and,  in some cases, states provided the MIG\u2019s audit contractors with more  timely and complete claims data. These collaborative projects (1) allowed  states to augment their own audit resources, (2) addressed audit targets  that states may not have been able to initiate because of a lack of staff,  and (3) provided data analytic support for states that lacked that  capability. Although these activities are ongoing and the results have not  yet been finalized, such collaborative projects appear to be a promising  approach to audits that avoids a duplication of federal and state efforts.

In addition, we found inconsistencies  between the information reported in the comprehensive reviews and in  the assessments for several states that were conducted at about the  same time. For example, there was a significant discrepancy for one state  in the number of staff it reported as being dedicated to program integrity  activities. According to the MIG, knowing the size of state program  integrity staff helps it to more appropriately tailor content during training  events. Improved consistency will help the MIG ensure that it is targeting  its training and technical assistance resources appropriately.

Our review of a sample of  assessments revealed missing data and a few implausible measures,  such as one state reporting over 38 million managed care enrollees. In  other states, there were dramatic changes in the data reported from 2007  to 2008, which either raises a question about the reliability of the data or  suggests that states be allowed to explain significant changes from year  to year.

The most common topics included the  National Provider Audit Program, policy and regulatory requirements on  disclosures, provider exclusions and enrollment, and requests for  statistical assistance related to criminal and civil court actions. Examples  of assistance provided to the states by the MIG included (1) hosting  regional state program integrity director conference calls to discuss  program integrity issues and best practices; and (2) helping develop a  State Medicaid Director Letter (issued in July 2010) on the return of  federal share of overpayments under PPACA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Integrity Institute Trains State Staff and Facilitates Networking", "paragraphs": ["The federally sponsored Medicaid Integrity Institute not only offers state  officials free training but also provides opportunities to develop  relationships with program integrity staff from other states.

From fiscal years  2008 through 2012, the institute will have trained over 2,265 state  employees at no cost to states. Given the financial challenges states  currently face, it is likely that expenditures for training and travel are  limited.
