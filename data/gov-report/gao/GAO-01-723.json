By the end of fiscal year 2000, the Office of Community Services had awarded $30 million in Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program grants to 24 states and 12 tribal organizations to fund 54 separate projects to help meet the home energy (heating and cooling) needs of low-income households. These grants ranged from $50,000 to $1.6 million. Most of the 54 REACH projects have educated low-income clients about home energy efficiency through group workshops or on individual home visits. Many REACH projects have involved energy-related repairs to homes and budget counseling, and three state REACH projects are developing consumer cooperatives to purchase electricity or bulk fuels, such as heating oil. However, some REACH projects have included social services not directly related to meeting home energy needs. The legislation authorizing REACH identifies the following three performance goals for individual REACH projects, (1) reduce the energy costs of participating households, (2) increase the regularity of home energy bill payments, and (3) increase energy suppliers' contributions to reduce eligible households' energy burden. Of the six project evaluations completed by states as of May 2001, only one project's design and implementation allowed statistically valid conclusions to be made about the effect of project services on participant energy use. The five other state project evaluations had analytical problems and other shortcomings that limited their usefulness in assessing project results. The Department of Health and Human Services has not yet developed a comprehensive plan for how it can best communicate summary information on best practices and lessons learned from the REACH program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Paying for home heating and cooling can be difficult for low-income families. With this year\u2019s rising prices for natural gas, electricity, and other fuels, meeting utility bills has become even harder for the nation\u2019s neediest citizens. The federal government has spent about $1.8 billion in each of the past 2 years to help low-income households pay for home heating and cooling through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Within this larger program, the Congress established the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program, which provides grants that fund demonstration projects to test various approaches to help low-income families reduce their energy usage and become more self-sufficient in meeting their home energy needs. In a sense, the REACH program serves as a \u201claboratory\u201d for identifying better ways to ensure that low-income families can afford home heating and cooling.", "Through the REACH program, the Office of Community Services (OCS)\u2014 part of the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014provides grants to states and tribal organizations to conduct demonstration projects. The states must conduct these projects through community-based organizations; tribal organizations may conduct projects themselves or through other community-based organizations. OCS has funded 54 REACH grants since the program began in fiscal year 1996, using an annual budget of about $6 million, which is about one-half of 1 percent, on average, of the total funding for LIHEAP. REACH projects have provided weatherization materials, workshops on energy efficiency measures for homes, and budget counseling, and have formed consumer cooperatives to purchase home energy. State projects run for 3 years, and state grantees are required to contract for third-party evaluations and to report after the conclusion of the projects on the effectiveness of the approaches that they have tried.", "In the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Amendments of 1998, the Congress required that we evaluate the REACH program and include in our report information on states\u2019 evaluations of their projects.

As agreed with your staff, our report addresses (1) grant recipients, amounts, and project activities; (2) the goals of the REACH program; (3) the methodologies and results of states\u2019 project evaluations; and (4) plans to communicate lessons learned from REACH projects and to foster the further use of successful approaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress established the REACH program to   minimize the health and safety risks that result from high energy burdens   prevent homelessness as a result of inability to pay energy bills, increase the efficiency of energy usage by low-income families, and target energy assistance to individuals who are most in need.", "The REACH legislation requires that project plans provide a variety of services and benefits, which may include energy efficiency education, residential energy demand management services, counseling related to energy budget management and payment plans, and negotiations with home energy suppliers on behalf of eligible households. The legislation further requires each state\u2019s plan to describe performance goals for its projects and the indicators the state will use to measure whether each project has achieved its performance goals.", "OCS\u2019 stated purpose for the REACH projects is to demonstrate the long- term cost-effectiveness of supplementing energy assistance payments with nonmonetary benefits that can increase the ability of eligible households to meet energy costs and achieve energy self-sufficiency. REACH is part of a much larger program, LIHEAP, which primarily provides financial assistance to low-income households for home heating and cooling. REACH projects may target their services to a portion of the population eligible for LIHEAP, such as a geographic area or type of client (households with elderly people, for example).", "Since fiscal year 1996, REACH funding has ranged from $5.5 million to $6.8 million annually, while the total funding for LIHEAP has ranged from $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion. Over the course of the REACH program, its funding has averaged about one-half of 1 percent of total LIHEAP funds. The legislation establishing REACH provided for funding it from LIHEAP\u2019s incentive program for leveraging nonfederal resources. This incentive program provides additional monies to states that, in the previous year, obtained additional assistance for low-income households\u2019 energy needs from such sources as state funds, utility companies, and private charities. The REACH legislation provides that, for each fiscal year, the Secretary of HHS may allocate up to 25 percent of the funding for this incentive program to the REACH program, and HHS has allocated approximately this amount each year since the REACH program was first funded in fiscal year 1996.", "Through the REACH program, OCS awards grants to states and to tribes, tribal organizations, and insular areas (generally referred to in this report as \u201ctribal organizations\u201d). OCS issues annual requests for grant proposals and then awards grants on a competitive basis. On average, about one-third of the applicants from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2000 received a REACH grant. OCS\u2019 Division of Community Demonstration Programs manages the REACH program.", "State and tribal organization grants differ in a few ways. OCS has established a 3-year time frame for states to complete their projects, in part to allow time for states to contract with the community-based organizations that carry out the states\u2019 REACH projects. Tribal projects have a 17-month time frame if the tribal organization carries out the project itself, or a 3-year time frame if the tribal organization chooses to use a community-based organization. Unlike states, tribal organizations are not required to conduct evaluations on the effectiveness of their project approaches, but tribal organizations do submit final reports on their projects to OCS. In addition, OCS has established differing maximum grant amounts for state and tribal grants. According to the director of OCS\u2019 Division of Community Demonstration Programs, these caps on grant amounts reflect the differing amounts that states and tribal organizations receive in their LIHEAP allotments and resulted from focus meetings with tribal representatives held by OCS\u2019 LIHEAP staff prior to the first REACH request for grant proposals.", "OCS\u2019 annual requests for grant proposals, referred to as program announcements, provide criteria for program eligibility, proposals, selection of projects to fund, and states\u2019 evaluations of their projects. Only states and tribal organizations that receive LIHEAP grants are eligible to participate in REACH, and the households that may receive REACH project services are those eligible for LIHEAP assistance. In its program announcements for fiscal years 1996 through 2000, OCS required states\u2019 and tribal organizations\u2019 proposals for REACH grants to address the following elements:the organizational experience and capability of the community-based or tribal organization(s) conducting the project;   project staff skills and responsibilities;   state-level management and organization of the project;   project theory and design, including the target population and needs to be addressed, activities, expected outcomes, goals, and work plan;   budget appropriateness and justification;   expected beneficial impact; \u201cholistic\u201d strategies addressing the economic and social barriers to self- sufficiency, and project innovations (required for state proposals only);   community empowerment of areas characterized by severe poverty, high unemployment, or other indicators of socioeconomic distress (required for state proposals only); and   evaluation of the project.", "OCS uses the above proposal elements in its criteria for selecting which projects to fund. OCS convenes panels to review and score the grant proposals against the criteria; state and tribal organization proposals are assessed separately. Factors in addition to the scoring may be used in making selections, such as geographic distribution and OCS\u2019 past experiences with the applicants.", "States\u2019 evaluations of their projects are to address how effectively each project was implemented, and whether and why the expected results and goals were or were not achieved.

(Tribal organizations have not received such funding because, to date, the tribal organizations have chosen to carry out their REACH projects themselves and are not required to contract for third- party evaluations.)

Almost all of the REACH projects included multiple activities and addressed more than one of the following areas: reducing energy use for home heating and cooling by increasing efficiency;   helping clients pay for energy bills through budget planning, consumer education, consumer cooperatives, and other methods; reducing the use of other utilities (water and electric lighting); and   providing social services not directly related to home heating and cooling needs.", "Appendix I provides further details about the types of activities included in REACH project plans and the number of projects conducting each type of activity.", "The most common project activity has been energy efficiency education, which was included in 45 of 53 projects. This education has been provided through group workshops for the projects\u2019 clients or through in-home counseling of individual households. Some grantees have also developed energy educational materials, such as pamphlets or videos, some of which were designed for children. Other activities aimed at reducing energy use have included home energy audits and weatherization. Home energy audits were used by 25 REACH projects, often in conjunction with weatherization of the home or education in how to reduce energy use. In a home energy audit, a detailed inspection of the home is carried out to identify repair and weatherization needs and practices of the household that result in inefficient energy use. For example, doors and windows are inspected for drafts, attics for insulation needs, and furnaces for maintenance needs. Families may be advised of energy-saving practices such as turning down their thermostats at night or using fans to reduce the need for air conditioning.", "Twenty REACH projects have provided home weatherization work by construction contractors. While the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program helps many low-income families, some homes need repairs that exceed the per-house dollar limit of the DOE program. The REACH projects that included weatherization typically went beyond the services provided by the DOE program or served clients who had not been addressed by the DOE program. Some REACH projects worked in conjunction with DOE\u2019s program. In addition, 20 REACH projects provided clients with do-it-yourself weatherization kits and training in how to install the weatherization measures. The kits included items such as caulk, weather-stripping, and plastic coating for windows.", "Budget counseling was provided in 30 of the REACH grant projects. Such counseling helps clients to plan ahead for paying for their essential needs, including energy bills; to identify areas where they could cut costs; and to become better informed about credit practices. Budget planning can help low-income households avoid utility cutoffs due to unpaid bills, which are followed by the need to pay reconnection fees and past-due bills. Utility cutoffs are not uncommon for low-income households. According to OCS data, during the 1992-93 heating season, 1 million LIHEAP-eligible households (3.3 percent of such households) reported that they were unable to use their main source of heat for 2 hours or more because they were unable to pay for their main heating fuel. Sixteen REACH projects also negotiated with energy vendors on behalf of their clients to obtain payment plans or forgiveness of past-due bills, and four projects provided funds to help pay past-due bills and/or reconnection fees. Seven projects provided consumer education on utility deregulation and the consumer choices provided by deregulation.", "Some REACH projects addressed the use of utilities for purposes other than heating and cooling. Thirteen projects provided energy-efficient light bulbs. Energy-efficient lighting was the only focus of the two grants received by American Samoa because the Samoan government determined that this was the one measure most likely to reduce the high cost of electricity for their low-income households. Six projects addressed water conservation in the home by providing devices such as low-flow showerheads or repairing plumbing. Such plumbing measures also reduce energy usage for hot water heaters.", "Some REACH projects included social services not directly related to home energy needs. Seventeen of the REACH projects provided social services through case management. For example, Nebraska\u2019s fiscal year 1996 grant project included caseworker visits to help families identify and address their concerns in areas such as improving job prospects, eating nutritional food, and obtaining health services. Only Indiana\u2019s project provided funds to help clients pay past-due rent or mortgage payments. Six projects included job skill or employment development services. For example, Indiana\u2019s fiscal year 1997 grant included the use of REACH funds for job skill training, transportation to work, and day care; $258,000 of Indiana\u2019s planned project budget addressed such services to help clients move from welfare to work. In many states, services that support the transition of welfare recipients to the workforce\u2014such as job training, transportation, and child care\u2014are provided by the much larger Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program ($22.6 billion in federal and state funding in fiscal year 1999). \u201cOCS is interested in having Applicants approach the energy needs of low-income families within a holistic context of the economic, social, physical, and environmental barriers to self-sufficiency. Thus applicants should include in their REACH Plan an explanation of how the proposed projects(s) will be integrated with and support other anti-poverty or development strategies within the target community or communities.\u2026 Thus REACH initiatives are expected to be closely coordinated with other public and private sector programs involved with community revitalization, housing rehabilitation and weatherization, and family development.\u201d", "Similar language has been included in each program announcement requesting REACH grant proposals. Furthermore, the criteria used to select grant proposals to fund have included holistic program strategies and project innovations. REACH grant proposals are scored on a number of criteria\u2014such as the organization\u2019s experience and the project strategy and design\u2014and each criterion has a maximum number of possible points. Out of a total of 100 possible points, state proposals for fiscal years 1996 through 2000 could receive up to 10 points in the selection process for the criterion \u201cholistic program strategies and project innovations.\u201d When asked about this criterion and the non-energy-related activities, REACH program officials said that the criterion might need to be clarified and that they also had some concerns about the emphasis on nonenergy activities in a few projects. However, they also noted that the legislation sets broad purposes for REACH, including preventing homelessness and minimizing health and safety risks resulting from high energy burdens on low-income households. Because energy burden is defined as home energy expenditures divided by household income, the officials stated that some grantees had chosen to address increasing clients\u2019 incomes.", "Some REACH projects have involved innovative activities. Examples of innovative activities include the installation of solar and/or wind power for low-income households in two tribal projects: the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (fiscal year 2000 grant) and the Cherokee Nation (fiscal year 1997 grant). Another innovative activity used in three state projects was the formation of consumer cooperatives to reduce the cost of energy to low-income households. Vermont\u2019s fiscal year 1997 project formed a cooperative and purchased a home heating oil company. The other two state projects\u2014New York\u2019s and Connecticut\u2019s\u2014are forming cooperatives to purchase energy from deregulated utilities, allowing low- income households to aggregate their purchasing power and negotiate lower prices. Pennsylvania\u2019s fiscal year 2000 project is addressing cooling needs in urban areas, following a number of heat-related deaths among elderly residents, particularly in urban row houses. The project is both introducing an innovative use of heat-reflective coatings on roofs of inner city row houses and providing fans and safety devices that permit windows to be locked in both open and closed positions.", "REACH grantees have also developed innovative ways of working with other organizations and delivering services. The project of the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida tribes in Alaska trained AmeriCorps personnel to provide energy efficiency education. Because these personnel remain in the Alaskan villages, the project proposal stated that the impact of the services would continue beyond the completion of the grant period. Nevada\u2019s project for its fiscal year 2000 grant is using the concept of individual development accounts to provide clients with matching funds for their savings. The REACH clients\u2019 savings accounts are to be used for replacing the furnace or appliances, changing to a lower cost fuel, or paying higher winter utility bills. Kentucky\u2019s project used volunteers from local organizations to install weatherization kit materials in the homes of disabled and elderly clients who could not do the work themselves."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Replication of REACH Project Activities", "paragraphs": ["After REACH projects are completed, some project activities may be replicated in a state\u2019s or tribal organization\u2019s LIHEAP program, if the state or tribal organization chooses to do so. (The state or tribal organization may also choose to use its own funding to continue the activities.) The legislation authorizing LIHEAP allows states to spend up to 5 percent of their allotted LIHEAP funds for services that encourage and enable households to reduce their home energy needs and therefore their need for energy assistance. According to LIHEAP program officials, such services may include energy efficiency education, budget counseling, and assistance in obtaining discounts or payment plans from energy vendors. According to states\u2019 fiscal year 2001 plans, 25 of 50 states and the District of Columbia planned to use a portion of their LIHEAP funds for energy use reduction services, and their planned services included energy education, energy needs assessment, liaison with energy vendors, budget counseling, and case worker services for clients. The legislation also allows states to spend up to 15 percent of their allotted LIHEAP funds for low-cost weatherization or other energy-related home repair for low-income households. States may also apply to HHS for waivers to use up to 25 percent of their allotment for this purpose. Forty-four of 50 states and the District of Columbia planned to provide weatherization in fiscal year 2001.", "Several types of activities used in REACH projects may not be covered by these provisions of LIHEAP, such as forming or expanding energy consumer cooperatives, installing solar and wind power units, providing efficient light bulbs, and providing matching funds for clients\u2019 savings to be used for energy purposes. It is uncertain whether states may use LIHEAP funds if they wish to continue or expand such activities after the conclusion of their REACH project. LIHEAP officials noted that because LIHEAP is a block grant program, states decide how to design their programs and interpret the statutory provisions regarding energy use reduction services and weatherization. Furthermore, LIHEAP\u2019s funding caps in these areas, as well as the need among low-income households for direct assistance with energy bills, would determine the extent to which the activities tested in a REACH project could be provided more broadly to a state\u2019s or tribal organization\u2019s LIHEAP clients."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "REACH Program Lacks Performance Goals and Measurable Indicators", "paragraphs": ["The legislation authorizing REACH identifies performance goals to be used by individual REACH projects.

Furthermore, HHS\u2019 performance plans do not address how the REACH program relates to the larger LIHEAP program of which it is a part.", "The legislation authorizing the REACH program requires that REACH project plans describe performance goals for each project, which are to include   a reduction in the energy costs of participating households over 1 or more   an increase in the regularity of home energy bill payments by eligible   an increase in energy vendor (such as utility companies) contributions towards reducing energy burdens of eligible households.", "The legislation further requires that project plans include a description of the indicators that each state will use to measure whether the performance goals have been achieved. For example, in addressing the performance goal of more regular energy bill payments, Oregon\u2019s proposal for its fiscal year 1999 grant specified the following indicator: 50 percent of households with past-due energy bills will reduce their arrearages by 40 percent after 12 months of participation. In addition, OCS requires states to address how results will be measured in their plans for evaluating their projects.", "Despite the program\u2019s use of project-level performance goals and indicators, the REACH program as a whole lacks performance goals and measurable indicators. According to a REACH official, the Administration for Children and Families decided not to address the REACH program in its performance plan, which was developed to meet the requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. While agencies\u2019 performance plans do not have to include the complete array of goals and measures used in managing individual programs, the development and use of performance goals and indicators can be beneficial to any federal program. Specifically, performance goals and measurable indicators can   help a program to focus its efforts on achieving results and on those activities most closely linked to program goals,   provide a clearer basis for selecting projects to fund,   provide a basis for determining how well the program is performing and what has been achieved in return for the resources invested in it, and facilitate reporting to the Congress and the public on the program\u2019s performance.", "For the REACH program in particular, performance goals and measurable indicators could address two needs: They could both provide a basis for grant selection and enhance effectiveness in carrying out federal roles. First, as described above, OCS has selected several grant proposals that used a substantial portion of their grant funding for activities that were not directly related to home energy needs, such as job skill or employment development services. The use of performance goals could help OCS to better target grant selection to projects that are closely linked to program goals. Second, the federal roles in the REACH program are not fully addressed by the project-level goals. For example, the federal role in the REACH program currently includes selecting grantees, providing program guidance, helping to strengthen project design and states\u2019 evaluations of their projects, and providing information to grantees and others involved in providing energy assistance. The effectiveness of federal efforts in the program could be enhanced by results-oriented performance measures addressing these roles.", "Furthermore, the performance plan for the Administration for Children and Families (which includes OCS) does not address the relationship between REACH and LIHEAP, or between REACH and other related federal programs, such as DOE\u2019s Weatherization Assistance Program. Performance plans can be useful tools for identifying the need for coordination among programs, and for ensuring that the goals of related programs are congruent and that crosscutting efforts are mutually reinforcing. In the case of REACH, HHS could use this performance plan to articulate REACH\u2019s purpose in demonstrating and providing incentives for LIHEAP grantees to try new approaches. Without HHS\u2019 addressing the relationship between REACH and LIHEAP, in particular, it is unclear whether HHS expects the REACH program to have a broader impact on the activities of LIHEAP grantees, beyond a particular REACH grant project and its limited time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Project Evaluations Have Limitations, but the Program Is Taking Action to Improve Future Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["The six states that received funding in fiscal year 1996 have prepared evaluation reports: California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, and Oregon.

California and Maryland experienced difficulties in collecting complete income or utility data and experienced client attrition at rates that call into question the likelihood that project effects could be assessed.", "To some extent, these state REACH projects faced common challenges: (1) forming an adequate control/comparison group against which to compare project outcomes; (2) maintaining client participation in project activities; (3) collecting complete, accurate, and reliable data (such as client income and utility bills); and (4) adjusting (\u201cnormalizing\u201d) energy consumption data for changes in weather.", "A properly formed control group, composed of people who did not receive REACH project services but who are similar in other respects, allows a comparison of what might have happened in the absence of the project. Project designs that lack a control group can demonstrate that changes occur in such factors as energy use, but the changes cannot be attributed to the project since other factors might be responsible for the changes. Any preexisting differences between a test group and a control group could also be the cause of any observed project effects and, therefore, should be addressed in the project\u2019s design.", "Attrition of participants can reduce the amount of data available for analysis and introduce biased results. Attrition bias can occur if those remaining in the project systematically differ from those who dropped out in ways that are likely to affect the outcome of the project.", "Lack of complete, reliable, and accurate data will result in imprecise or biased results. Data that are not collected for an entire heating or cooling season, for example, can lead to faulty assessments of typical energy use.", "Failure to normalize energy use data makes it difficult to determine the extent to which changes in energy use result from project activities or from changes in weather that affect the need to heat or cool a residence. For example, if the postproject data on energy use reflect a warmer winter than the preproject data, a valid comparison of energy use for these two periods should adjust the data to help determine if perceived energy savings were due to warmer winter temperatures or to project activities.", "In addition, other shortcomings precluded an overall assessment of the projects\u2019 effectiveness. None of the evaluation reports addressed one of the three project-level performance goals stated in REACH legislation and program announcements:  increasing energy suppliers\u2019 contributions to reduce the energy burdens of eligible households. In addition, although the REACH program announcements have stated that an objective of every state project plan should be to measure whether its activities are more cost-effective in the long term than energy assistance payments alone, none of the project evaluation reports provided such an analysis. Finally, most of the evaluation reports did not report lessons learned or best practices that could be valuable to other projects. For example, if the report had discussed the strategies used to successfully collect energy use data, this information could have been useful to other projects.

First, OCS has developed guidance for project planning and evaluation in its demonstration programs, which include the REACH program. According to REACH officials, this guidance was first given to REACH grantees in 1997 or 1998. While this was too late to help the fiscal year 1996 grantees plan their evaluations and related data needs, the guidance addresses many of the evaluation limitations noted above and, if followed by state grantees, could help to improve future evaluations. For example, the guidance discusses   selecting an evaluator\u2014indicators of a good evaluator and questions to ask in an interview;   using a logic model (described below) to design and evaluate a project;   addressing challenges to gathering data on project participants, such as their reluctance to provide income data;   using comparison groups that are as similar as possible and over- recruiting for comparison groups to allow for attrition; and   developing evaluation reports that are clear and complete.", "The guidance was revised in 2000 to increase its emphasis on the logic model, according to REACH program officials. A logic model identifies underlying assumptions of the project, project activities (such as energy efficiency education), immediate and intermediate outcomes expected from the activities (such as improved understanding of behaviors that can affect energy use in the home), and final project goals (such as a reduction in energy use). The REACH program encourages grant applicants to use a logic model in their applications and project planning.", "Second, the REACH program provides technical assistance to grantees in their project and evaluation planning. States that receive grants are required to submit evaluation plans, which are reviewed by REACH program officials and the consulting firm that is providing technical assistance to the program. The REACH officials and consultant then discuss with the project team any improvements that are needed, and the grantee submits a revised evaluation plan. Once an acceptable evaluation plan is completed, the REACH program sends a letter to indicate approval of the plan. According to officials of the REACH program\u2019s consulting firm, they emphasize improving the logic model to strengthen the projects\u2019 designs and their ability to measure whether expected outcomes and goals are achieved by project activities. REACH officials also review draft evaluation reports and may ask states to revise and improve them.", "Third, guidance and assistance with evaluations have also been provided through program conferences. The REACH program held conferences for evaluators in July 2000 and July 2001.  At the July 2000 evaluators\u2019 conference, the participants discussed logic models, common issues in gathering and analyzing data, evaluation methods, and lessons learned. Developing quality evaluations has also been discussed at the annual REACH program conferences, and evaluators as well as representatives of states, tribal organizations, and community-based organizations may participate in the conference. For example, the REACH conference held in January 2001 included a presentation and discussion on developing logic models, indicators, and evaluation plans. In addition, as the state grantees reported on their completed fiscal year 1997 projects, the conference participants discussed many specific evaluation issues.", "While the REACH program and its consultants can assist grantees in planning their evaluations, conducting the evaluation is a responsibility shared among the states, the community-based organizations with whom the states contract, and third-party evaluators. State officials monitor and oversee the projects and the evaluation reports. Staff of the community- based organizations are responsible for collecting the data needed to complete the evaluation. The staff of the community-based organizations may need training to understand the importance of data gathering and to carry out this task effectively. Third-party evaluators help to design the evaluation, analyze data, and prepare the evaluation report. Some of the problems we noted in the six completed evaluations related to reporting, such as not clearly explaining methods of analysis or data limitations. For future REACH evaluations to improve, the states, community-based organizations, and evaluators\u2014as well as the REACH program and its technical assistance consultants\u2014must carry out their functions well."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Not Yet Planned How to Communicate REACH Project Successes and Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["OCS has not yet planned how it can best communicate information to state officials and others about the results of REACH projects, such as what approaches prove to be the most successful in meeting the home energy needs of low-income households. As the REACH program proceeds and state grantees complete additional project evaluations, more information will become available about which approaches demonstrated in REACH projects were successful and which were less successful. In addition to evaluating the results of their projects, grantees report on the processes and procedures they used to carry them out. Completed REACH projects will provide information and tools such as   pamphlets, videos, and other materials for energy efficiency education;  forms for collecting data from clients; and   experiences and lessons learned in such areas as how to leverage contributions from energy vendors and how to coordinate among various organizations involved in energy assistance.", "A comprehensive communications plan would help ensure that this information is put to good use by identifying what information to communicate, to what audiences, and by what methods. A communications plan would also estimate the amount of funding needed for communications. REACH program officials realize that publications such as summaries of successful approaches could provide information in a form more readily accessible than the individual evaluation reports. Other OCS programs have developed summary publications of best practices and have found them to be frequently requested, according to the director of OCS\u2019 Division of Community Demonstration Programs. For instance, one publication provided lessons learned from 8 years of OCS demonstration programs (not including the REACH program, which had not yet begun at the time). As the REACH program matures and more information becomes available, OCS will have a better basis for identifying and summarizing best practices. For instance, information will become available from six project evaluations that are due during the fall of 2001 (from the state grants awarded in fiscal year 1997), and by the end of 2002, a total of 19 state projects will probably have completed their evaluations.", "To date, the REACH program\u2019s communications efforts have included developing a Web site and providing information through conferences. According to program officials, the REACH Web site, located within OCS\u2019 Web site for its demonstration programs, is expected to become available in the summer of 2001. Currently, a pilot version of the REACH Web site is available at the Web site of the REACH program\u2019s consulting firm. According to REACH program officials, the OCS Web site will provide the same types of information as the pilot Web site. The pilot REACH Web site includes the current OCS program announcement requesting proposals for REACH grants,   summaries of past and ongoing REACH projects,   summaries of the REACH program conferences, and  listings of contact points for grants and evaluations.", "Conferences are also used to communicate project results and lessons learned. The REACH program hosts an annual conference for certain people involved with REACH projects. According to the REACH program announcements, state grantees are expected to fund travel by the state project directors, community-based organization project directors, and chief evaluators to the annual conference in each of the 3 years of the project. Tribal organizations, which have a shorter project term, are to fund travel to one conference. At the conferences, grantees that are finishing their projects make presentations about their project approaches and results. REACH program officials also provide information geared to new grantees about program and reporting requirements. The conference has also included topical presentations; for example, the conference in January 2001 included presentations on the characteristics of good project evaluation methods, solar power, and designs for low-energy-usage homes. According to REACH officials, they and their consulting firm have also arranged for presentations on REACH projects at the annual LIHEAP conference and other energy-related conferences.", "Grantees also have responsibilities for communicating about their REACH projects. OCS requires that states\u2019 REACH project plans address disseminating results of the individual projects among LIHEAP grantees, utility companies, and others interested in increasing the self-sufficiency of the poor. States are allowed to budget up to $5,000 of each grant for dissemination purposes. Tribal organizations are allowed to budget up to $1,000 for dissemination purposes.

Considering the recent rise in home heating and cooling costs, the REACH program\u2019s role in testing approaches to help low-income families to meet their home energy needs is an important one and should be clearly articulated. We believe that the development of performance goals and measurable indicators could provide the Congress with better information about what has been accomplished for the resources expended. Furthermore, performance goals could provide HHS\u2019 Office of Community Services with a clearer basis for selecting grant proposals to fund. In addition, by addressing the relationship between LIHEAP and REACH in its performance plan, HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families could clarify the role of the REACH program and whether it expects REACH to have an effect on the activities of LIHEAP grantees, beyond a particular REACH grant and its limited time frame.", "Some of the REACH projects funded to date have included activities other than addressing clients\u2019 home heating, home cooling, and energy payment needs, such as job skill or employment development services. The REACH program\u2019s requests for proposals with \u201cholistic approaches\u201d may have been misconstrued by grant applicants and by those reviewing proposals to allow projects to use REACH funds for non-energy-related activities. However, with only about $6 million in funding annually, we question whether non-energy-related activities\u2014including some activities typically addressed through other, much larger social service programs\u2014are an effective use of limited REACH program funds.", "While the evaluations conducted on the first year of state grants have many shortcomings that limit their usefulness in assessing project effectiveness, the REACH program recognizes the problems and has been taking steps to help improve future project evaluations. It is too soon to gauge the effectiveness of these efforts, but we noted some improvements in states\u2019 plans for the next set of evaluations. We encourage the REACH program to continue its efforts to improve the design and methodology of evaluations because valid evaluations are vital to realizing the potential of the REACH program in testing new approaches.", "With only six project evaluations completed, there is currently not enough information to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of the REACH program. By the end of 2002, a total of 19 state projects will probably have completed their evaluations, and OCS will have awarded a total of about 80 grants, roughly half of them to states, which will eventually report on project results. While the legislation authorizing the REACH program requires this GAO review, it does not require HHS to report to the Congress as more information on project results becomes available. Developing program performance goals and measurable indicators and obtaining better data on the REACH program\u2019s effectiveness would enable HHS to provide the Congress the information that it needs to assess the program. Furthermore, the legislation did not specify an ending date for the REACH program, as is sometimes the case for demonstration programs. It may be appropriate to reassess the REACH program during 2003 and consider whether and how long it should continue.", "Finally, the lack of a comprehensive plan for communicating the results of REACH projects and fostering the further use of effective approaches could limit the impact of the REACH program. Without well-planned and adequately funded communications, the results of REACH projects may fail to have an impact on LIHEAP and other programs that provide energy assistance to low-income families. Summaries reporting on best practices could be more effective as communication tools than the state evaluation reports themselves for reaching the state, federal, and community officials involved in addressing the home energy needs of low-income households. To the extent that OCS shares such information among the state, tribal, and community-based organizations that provide energy assistance, the organizations can make better-informed decisions about replicating successful approaches and avoiding problematic ones. Furthermore, well- informed organizations can avoid \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d by, for instance, not investing in developing energy education materials that may already be available.

First, HHS disagreed with our assessment that language in its program announcements on holistic program strategies may have been misconstrued to encourage non-energy-related activities. We continue to believe that HHS should review the language of its program announcement, as it plans to do, to ensure that the REACH program does not fund activities that are not directly related to the home energy needs of low-income households. The language in the program announcement is used as criteria for reviewing and selecting grant proposals, as well as for providing guidance to applicants for grants. Our recommendation concerns only REACH program funds; grantees would not be precluded from using other sources of funds for such activities or from coordinating with other social service efforts. Second, HHS stated that the term \u201cresidential energy\u201d is understood to include all household energy use, not just home heating and cooling. However, we note that the authorizing legislation does not define the term \u201cresidential energy.\u201d Therefore, we believe that HHS should apply the definition of home energy in the authorizing legislation\u2014namely, a source of heating or cooling in residential dwellings.

Instead, they assessed changes from pre-REACH to post-REACH project points within each of the groups separately.", "The study did not assess the impact of the project by comparing the change in energy use of the two REACH groups to the change in energy use of the control group.", "The report also noted that participants might not have been assigned to groups in a random manner, leaving the possibility that the changes observed could be the result of factors other than the services provided.

These factors also adversely affect the report\u2019s analysis and conclusions. For example, assignment to the test and control groups appears not to have been on a random basis. Test group selection resulted in a group of households with the highest energy use, whereas control group selection resulted in a group of households with the lowest energy use. Such assignment issues weaken the conclusions that can be made about the effect of REACH services on energy use.

The technical comments have been incorporated as appropriate.", "Several more substantive technical comments are addressed individually below. 2.  The authorizing legislation defines home energy as \u201ca source of heating or cooling in residential dwellings.\u201d While HHS argues that residential energy commonly refers to all household energy use, for the purposes of this review, we used the narrower definition stated in the legislation. We have also changed the wording of our third recommendation, concerning the use of REACH program funds, to clarify that REACH program funds should be used for activities directly related to the home heating and cooling needs of low-income households. We do not dispute that a broad range of services is authorized in the legislation, but these services should relate to home heating and cooling. 3.  We are not including the possibility of expanding the program in our matters for congressional consideration because the effectiveness of the REACH program has not yet been determined and because we believe that HHS should be required to report to the Congress in 2003 on the REACH program\u2019s effectiveness. 4.  While coordination among programs is addressed in a general way in the REACH program announcements, we believe that HHS should more specifically articulate its view of the REACH program\u2019s purpose and relationship to LIHEAP in the Administration for Children and Families\u2019 performance plan. We also note that a performance plan is more readily accessible to the Congress, the public, and other agencies than the program announcements intended for potential grant applicants. 5.  Our draft report did not state that the use of randomized control groups is the only acceptable design, so we have not made any wording changes. Although there are legitimate questions concerning using randomized control group designs in social service programs, such designs have sometimes been effectively used. For instance, when resources are not sufficient to provide services to all who are eligible, random assignment to control groups can be feasible and ethical and provide convincing results. When randomized control groups are not feasible, evaluations can be designed to use nonequivalent control groups, and, with suitable caveats, such designs may yield defensible results. Regardless of the design used, evaluations of project results must be able to distinguish between results that are most likely due to the project services and results that may be due to other, external factors. 6.  We have added language indicating that the Office of Community Services is aware of the evaluation challenges that we cite. 7.  Pages 14 and 15 of our report describe the legislative authority and restrictions on the use of LIHEAP funds, as well as the need to use much of LIHEAP\u2019s funding for direct assistance with energy bills. We also report that, as allowed by law, 25 states plan to use a portion of their fiscal year 2001 LIHEAP funds for activities such as energy education and budget counseling and 44 states plan to provide weatherization services. As HHS\u2019 comments note, opportunity exists to continue some of the activities tested under REACH grants through states\u2019 LIHEAP funds. We have made minor wording changes to more clearly recognize that not all REACH activities may fall within the legislative and funding constraints of the LIHEAP program. 8.  Coordinating with other programs is not the same as spending REACH grant funds for non-energy-related activities. We believe that HHS\u2019 planned efforts to clarify language in its program announcement should help ensure that REACH funds are used only for activities directly related to the home energy needs of low-income households and should provide a clearer basis for reviewing and selecting proposals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Julie Gerkens, Kathleen Gilhooly, Curtis Groves, Rachel Hesselink, Judy Pagano, and Don Pless made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
