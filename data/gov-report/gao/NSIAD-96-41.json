We also reviewed maintenance and repair invoices, visited a sample of ships, and interviewed responsible MSC personnel. We used the ships\u2019 operational schedules to visit ships that were about to complete an overhaul. For four of the five programs we were able to visit a ship that was in for overhaul, but this was not possible for the T-5 tankers. Therefore, we visited a tanker that was in its full operational status. (App. I lists the ships that we visited.)

Part of the reason for this practice is a disconnect between headquarters-level invoice reviewers and field-level personnel, whose main concern is the operation but not the cost of the ships\u2019 repair. In fiscal year 1994 alone, MSC spent $93.8 million to maintain and repair the ships in the five contractor-operated programs we reviewed. Given the large amounts of money spent on maintenance and repairs, it is imperative that MSC have effective controls over these expenditures. MSC lacks controls in three general areas: verification of crew-performed repairs, review of invoices for subcontracts, and oversight of repair work performed during overhauls.

Contractors can apply toward the thresholds (1) overtime and straight time performed by extra crew (beyond those normally required), (2) overtime by the regular crew performing minor repairs, and (3) industrial assistance (work done by subcontractors, not by the ships\u2019 crews). Contractors are to report how they meet their thresholds in minor repair reports. After contractors meet these minor repair thresholds, they can be reimbursed by MSC for all minor repairs.

According to an MSC instruction, proper knowledge of receipt or disposition of goods/services during the invoice certification process will reduce the chances of fraudulent claims being paid. However, MSC reviews minor repair reports and invoices for over-threshold repairs without adequate supporting documentation to show that work was done.", "Contractors for two of the three programs had been paid by MSC for over-threshold repairs. As of October 10, 1995, one of the contractors had received $685,946 from MSC for over-threshold repairs for fiscal years 1991 through 1995. MSC paid a second contractor $741,360 for over-threshold repairs for fiscal year 1994 alone.

MSC had never requested or reviewed the complete supporting documentation for the contractor\u2019s minor repair reports during the 5-year contract period that would have uncovered this practice. For the life of the contract, the contractor reported nearly $6 million in crew-performed repairs in their minor repair reports. Of this amount, MSC reimbursed the contractor $685,946 for over-threshold minor repairs.", "MSC\u2019s contract allows its contractor to apply to the minor repair threshold repairs done by the ship\u2019s regular crew while on overtime but not during straight-time work hours. Because MSC does not require the contractor to submit supporting documentation, however, it has no proof that the contractor has not manipulated the reporting of overtime.", "Field staff for this program told us that, at a recent meeting with MSC headquarters personnel, they had recommended that the contractor be required to submit crew overtime sheets as supporting documentation for its minor repair reports. However, MSC headquarters personnel have taken no action in response to this recommendation.", "For this program, we requested supporting documentation from the contractor for one ship\u2019s minor repair report, which totaled $25,859 and covered about 5 months. We reviewed this documentation to verify that the crew had actually listed this overtime work on their timesheets. We found that for this minor repair report, $8,406 of repairs had been performed by the ship\u2019s regular crew during straight-time hours. Another $860 was unsupported by crew overtime sheets. When we disclosed our findings to program officials, they stated that they were unaware that the contractor was not complying with the contract and said that they would investigate the matter further.", "It is particularly important that MSC fully review supporting documentation for the minor repair reports because the Naval Criminal Investigative Service has found erroneous overtime documentation practices on the part of ship contract operators. These practices involved (1) ship officers\u2019 fraudulent rewriting of crew members\u2019 overtime sheets, (2) the contractor\u2019s application of nonreimbursable work toward the minor repair thresholds, and (3) the doublebilling of MSC for the same hours of work.

The contracting officer told us that MSC did not request this documentation because the paperwork was excessive and burdensome for MSC. According to the contract, the cleaning and maintenance of the ship are paid for in the fixed-price portion of the contract. Cleaning and maintenance work is not to be included in the contractor\u2019s listing of minor repairs; nor is it to be billed as a reimbursable expense.", "While the contract contains a list of sample minor repairs, it does not contain a similar list of cleaning jobs. We asked contracting officials whether such lists might clarify what jobs can and cannot be claimed as minor repairs and therefore be reimbursable. They told us that the contract was already too specific and that adding such a list would be adversarial to the contractor because distinguishing between cleaning and minor repairs is by nature subjective.", "During our review, we requested that the contractor for this second ship program provide supporting documentation for one of its minor repair reports. We reviewed this documentation for three ships for a 3-month period. We traced the contractor-generated list of minor repairs back to original timesheets filled out by the crew members.

DCMC declined to review this contractor\u2019s purchasing system because the dollar value of its subcontracts was so low.", "MSC stated that for all but this one contract, MSC has required the contractors to maintain DCMC-approved purchasing systems.", "We analyzed the April 1995 DCMC audit of a contractor for two of the ship programs in our review. The DCMC auditors evaluated, among other things, whether the contractor had awarded subcontracts competitively and performed adequate price analysis and negotiations. At the end of its review, DCMC approved the contractor\u2019s purchasing system. However, it noted several weaknesses in this system and recommended corrective action. For example, DCMC found that only 54.5 percent of the contractor\u2019s purchase orders had been awarded competitively. For purchase orders under $25,000, only 48 percent had been awarded competitively. Finally, DCMC found that for awards without competition, 63 percent of the purchase order files neglected to include detailed evidence of effective price analysis or negotiation. Among the agency\u2019s recommendations was that the contractor \u201cassure that effective price analysis is performed for each applicable single-sole source purchase order over $10,000 and to a lesser degree those under $10,000.\u201d The contractor notified MSC that it intended to implement DCMC\u2019s recommendations.", "Despite the weaknesses revealed in the DCMC audit of this contractor, MSC has not adjusted its oversight of the contractor\u2019s awarding of subcontracts under $25,000. On the basis of what is submitted by the contractor to support subcontract invoices, the MSC invoice reviewer has no way of knowing whether the subcontract was awarded competitively or not. Neither does the supporting documentation show whether or how the contractor determined that prices were fair and reasonable. We asked the invoice reviewer for this program whether he had ever made deductions based on his determination that the price charged was not reasonable. He said that he only remembered questioning the reasonableness of price in two cases, in 1991 and 1992. One involved whether a technical representative had flown first class or coach, and the other involved whether the technical representative had rented the appropriate rental car. In neither case did the invoice reviewer determine that a deduction was necessary. We believe that these cases involved determining allowability of costs rather than reasonableness of costs. That is, under the terms of MSC\u2019s contracts with its ship operators, government regulations on travel apply. Allowing a technical representative to fly first class and drive a luxury rental car would violate the terms of MSC\u2019s contracts.", "On the other hand, during our review of invoices for the ship program that does require documentation of fair and reasonable prices, we found that invoices consistently included evidence of competitive bidding or a justification for a sole-source subcontract. We also found several cases in which an MSC field unit had deducted amounts from the contractor\u2019s invoices for inadequate documentation. For example, the field unit had deducted amounts for repairs and for repair parts because documentation did not indicate that the charges were fair and reasonable. We also saw a case in which the field unit deducted fax and telephone charges because the contractor had not submitted a statement explaining the nature of calls made to ensure the calls had been made for official government business. By contrast, for the contractor whose subcontracting weaknesses were cited by DCMC, we saw an invoice for $1,456.73 for telephone calls for a 3-day period. The invoice contained no indication of whether any of these calls were for official government business, yet the invoice was approved for payment.", "In our review of this same contractor\u2019s invoices, we found an invoice whose price appeared excessive.

When we asked for an explanation of this invoice, the invoice reviewer said that he did not know whether the lamps had been repaired or whether the lampshades had simply been replaced.", "After we requested supporting documentation from the contractor on this invoice, we found that MSC had paid $260 per lamp to repair 10 lamps and replace their lampshades, when it could have purchased new lamps for $210 each (excluding the costs of installation). Work on the other 10 lamps was less extensive, ranging from simply replacing the lampshades to replacing the toggle switches and/or modifying the lamp bases.

This requirement is intended to help MSC ensure that it receives fair and reasonable prices for large repair jobs and that the work is needed. Because the contractor for this program breaks large jobs down into multiple smaller ones, it is evading the contractual requirement to obtain the contracting officer\u2019s prior approval. Contractor officials told us that they routinely split jobs into segments because these ships needed to be ready to go to sea with 4 days\u2019 notice.

During our review, we asked MSC officials whether they had taken any action to prevent contractors from issuing multiple work orders and thereby evade the requirement to seek MSC\u2019s prior approval.

This work was for ship cleaning that was done by the same subcontractor on the same ship over a 3-month period. After we requested that the contractor provide us with evidence that this work had been competitively awarded, we found that the contractor had obtained quotations from three subcontractors on the price per square foot for cleaning the ship. The contractor awarded the work to the lowest bidder based on a single price quotation. It then split the job into 18 smaller ones involving the cleaning of different parts of the ship.", "In another case, this same contractor submitted 71 separate invoices totaling $202,294 for welding-related work done by one subcontractor on one ship over a 4-month period.

This lack of assurance is due at least in part to the fact that MSC has no agencywide requirement for its representatives to be present during ship overhauls. This presence during an overhaul enables a representative of MSC to observe the condition of items of equipment when these items are opened and inspected and to determine the extent of needed repairs. In addition, the presence of an MSC representative enables MSC to monitor the extent of the repairs to prevent unneeded work.

During one overhaul, we found that for $271,755 of a total $544,135 (about 50 percent) in change orders, the contract operator\u2019s and the shipyard\u2019s estimates were identical. For $427,111 of this change order work (about 78 percent), the \u201cnegotiated\u201d prices between the shipyard and the contract operator were the shipyard\u2019s estimated prices. The lack of clear written guidance on the authority and responsibilities of the MSC representative contributed to MSC\u2019s failure to obtain negotiated prices on this overhaul. Because the MSC representative did not independently estimate change orders, MSC had no assurance that it did not pay excessive prices.", "During this overhaul, the MSC representative was simply providing the administrative contracting officer with a statement that funds were available for the work.

MSC has no written guidance regarding oversight responsibilities for this work, and it has not established procedures for taking deductions if the authorized work is not completed.", "An MSC representative for one ship program told us that he routinely inspects the work of additional crew members during overhauls.

The MSC representative who actually inspects the approved work items does not receive or review the bill for this work, and no one at MSC asks for the results of his inspection when the bill for the work is reviewed. Second, MSC does not require the contractor to obtain prior approval when changing the work items used to justify the extra crew members. The contracting officer for this program told us that she does not see why the contractor cannot deviate from the special work items it submitted as justification for its extra crew members.", "We visited one ship from this program on the last day of its overhaul. During that visit we observed, as did an MSC representative, that many of the work items used to justify the ship\u2019s extra crew had been only partially completed or not completed at all. According to the MSC representative, this was not an isolated case, since on other overhauls he found that the work used to justify the extra crew had not been completed. Later that day we were told by the ship\u2019s master and chief mate that the work items had changed, and we were given a handwritten list of changes that had not been approved by MSC.

Until MSC makes its trustworthiness evaluation, the contractor\u2019s active crew list contains the dates the crew members\u2019 forms were submitted.

Therefore, we had to match an old crew list (containing the dates the forms had been submitted) to recently completed evaluations in MSC\u2019s trustworthiness file. Eight of the 29 evaluations were completed within 4 months.
