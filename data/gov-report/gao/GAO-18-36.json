Specifically, from fiscal years 2003  through 2016, improper payments have been estimated to total over   $1.2 trillion government-wide. The most recent government-wide  improper payment estimate reported for fiscal year 2016 was  $144.3 billion, an increase of approximately $7.6 billion from the  $136.7 billion estimate reported for fiscal year 2015. It is important to  note that these estimates themselves may not be accurate, reliable, or  complete, as we have reported that the federal government is unable to  determine the full extent of improper payments and to reasonably assure  that actions are taken to reduce them.

We believe that the requirement for  agencies to publicly report the improper payment risk assessment  information has helped hold agencies accountable and provided  additional transparency to the agencies\u2019 improper payment processes, as  well as assisted Congress and others in their oversight of government- wide improper payments. However, if OMB is going to rely on each  agency\u2019s OIG to ensure quality risk assessments, it is important that these reviews are performed consistently throughout the federal  government. In our May 2017 report, we found that OIGs inconsistently  reported agencies\u2019 compliance with the IPERA criterion for conducting  program-specific risk assessments. For example, certain OIGs reported  agencies as noncompliant when agencies did not consider all nine risk  factors, as outlined in IPIA, OMB guidance, or both, during program- specific risk assessments, whereas other OIGs reported agencies as  compliant with this IPERA criterion, despite also finding issues with the  agencies\u2019 consideration of the nine risk factors. To help ensure that  government-wide compliance under IPERA is consistently determined  and reported, we recommended in May 2017 that the Director of OMB  coordinate with the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and  Efficiency (CIGIE) to develop and issue guidance, either jointly or  independently, to specify what procedures should be conducted as part of  the OIGs\u2019 IPERA compliance determinations.

Programs and activities that  fell below these thresholds were not assessed for susceptibility to  significant improper payments. State officials told us that they  believed the $100 million threshold limitation was reasonable because  State predicted that it was improbable one of its programs would have  an improper payment estimate of at least 10 percent in order to meet  the IPIA threshold of $10 million. According to State officials, State\u2019s  justification for its assessment threshold was based on many factors,  including sampling of expenditures, past external audits, and internal  OMB Circular A-123 reviews.

Subsequent to fiscal year 2016, with the  exception of NASA, which did not include its OIG\u2019s activities, the federal  agencies that were identified as lacking properly designed control  activities drafted or updated their procedures to help ensure that all  programs and activities were assessed for susceptibility to significant  improper payments. Without proper control activities, NASA may not be  identifying all programs and activities that should be included in its  improper payment risk assessments. If a program or activity is not  assessed for risk, then an agency could be at risk of noncompliance with  IPIA or nonadherence to OMB guidance as the risk assessment process  is a crucial step in determining programs and activities that are  susceptible to significant improper payments and thus subject to  additional reporting and monitoring requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following recommendation to NASA:  The Administrator of NASA should take steps to revise the agency\u2019s  procedures for conducting improper payment risk assessments to include  the activities of its OIG in its risk assessment process to help ensure that  all programs and activities are assessed for susceptibility to significant  improper payments at least once every 3 years as required by IPIA.

In its  comments, State questioned the practicality of our proposed  recommendation; however, State stated that it updated its procedures  to lower the assessment threshold to the minimum dollar threshold of  $10 million. We noted that this threshold aligns with the IPIA threshold  of $10 million. We reviewed State\u2019s updated procedures and  confirmed that State had revised its dollar threshold for conducting  risk assessments, which effectively addressed our preliminary  findings. Therefore, we have removed the recommendation from our  report.", "In its comments, SSA stated that it believed that its risk assessment  reporting fully complied with OMB guidance. SSA stated that it  considered the nine required risk factors but only reported on the risk  factors that were applicable to the agency. However, given that SSA  reported that it considered six risk factors and did not indicate in its  AFRs that the other factors were not applicable to SSA, we continue  to believe that SSA did not report, as directed by OMB guidance, on  all the risk factors considered in its improper payment risk  assessments for fiscal years 2015 and 2016.", "In its comments, USAID stated that our draft report was inaccurate in  stating that USAID did not adhere to OMB reporting directives. USAID  stated that an e-mail from OMB provided USAID relief from improper  payment reporting. However, OMB\u2019s e-mail did not explicitly provide  USAID a waiver from the OMB risk assessment reporting directives.   Moreover, USAID reported in its AFRs for fiscal years 2014 through  2016 that it conducted annual risk assessments for the time period  covered in this audit. As stated in appendix III, USAID did properly  report the basis for grouping programs and activities for fiscal years  2014 through 2016, and the agency also properly reported a listing of  all programs and activities that were assessed for fiscal year 2016.  Accordingly, we believe that USAID also should have followed all  OMB risk assessment reporting directives for the time period covered  for our audit, and we believe that our report accurately characterizes  this issue.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the heads of the 24 CFO Act agencies, the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget, and other interested parties.

At the time of our review, the latest 3-year period was fiscal  years 2014 through 2016.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed improper payment risk  assessment requirements in IPIA, as amended, and the related guidance  in OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, including the  OMB directives for agencies\u2019 risk assessment reporting, and OMB  Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Effective Estimation and  Remediation of Improper Payments (OMB M-15-02). We analyzed these  statutes and guidance to identify key criteria that agencies must meet for  reporting on improper payment risk assessments. IPIA, as amended,  identifies seven risk factors and OMB guidance includes two additional  risk factors that agencies are to consider in their improper payment risk  assessment to determine susceptibility to significant improper payments.  Additionally, for fiscal years 2014 through 2016, OMB M-15-02 directed  agencies that conducted improper payment risk assessments to disclose  in their AFRs or PARs the basis for grouping programs and activities for  improper payment risk assessments. For fiscal years 2015 and 2016,  OMB Circular A-136 directed agencies to report (1) a listing of programs  and activities that were assessed for susceptibility to significant improper  payments in a given year, regardless of whether a program or activity was  deemed risk-susceptible, and (2) the risk factors considered during their  improper payment risk assessments. We analyzed the AFRs or PARs of  the 24 CFO Act agencies for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 to determine  whether each agency met the key OMB reporting criteria described  above. For our review, we focused on whether the agencies reported the  risk assessment information in their AFRs or PARs and did not evaluate  the quality of improper payment risk assessments completed.", "For any agencies that did not meet the reporting directives outlined in  OMB guidance for their improper payment risk assessments, we  interviewed appropriate agency officials to determine why those agencies  did not meet these key criteria. For fiscal year 2017, a revised version of  OMB Circular A-136 that was issued in August 2017 no longer directs  agencies to report improper payment risk assessment information in the  agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2017 AFRs and PARs. Subsequent to the issuance  in August 2017 of a revised version of OMB Circular A-136 and after we  notified OMB of our views on the importance of certain data, OMB staff  stated that they plan to direct agencies to report additional risk  assessment data. Specifically, in September 2017, OMB staff told us that  they plan to direct agencies to provide a listing of all programs and  activities assessed during their risk assessments on  www.paymentaccuracy.gov for fiscal year 2017 reporting, and that they  plan to continue to direct agencies to report this listing for subsequent  fiscal years. In addition, although the basis for grouping programs and  activities for improper payment risk assessments and the risk factors  considered during the risk assessments will not be required to be  reported in fiscal year 2017 AFRs and PARs, OMB staff stated that they  plan to revise the guidance for fiscal year 2018 so that agencies report  such information in their AFRs and PARs.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed IPIA, as amended; the  related OMB guidance; and relevant internal control standards to  determine the relevant control activities needed to help ensure that  agencies conduct improper payment risk assessments for all programs  and activities at least once every 3 years. For this objective, we selected  nine CFO Act agencies that did not report improper payment estimates  for any programs or activities in fiscal year 2015 or 2016 except those  estimates that were required to be reported pursuant to the Disaster  Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. These nine agencies were the  Departments of Commerce, Energy, the Interior, Justice, and State; the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the National Science  Foundation; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the U.S. Agency  for International Development. We reviewed these agencies\u2019 procedures  for conducting improper payment risk assessments and interviewed  agency officials to determine whether the agencies designed and  documented control activities to include all programs and activities in an  improper payment risk assessment at least once every 3 years. To verify  each agency\u2019s assertions that all programs and activities are reviewed at  least once every 3 years, we compared the line item for gross outlays  contained in each agency\u2019s Statement of Budgetary Resources for the  relevant period to outlay data provided by each agency for each program  and activity covered by improper payment risk assessments for fiscal  years 2014 through 2016. When we identified differences between the  two data sources, we interviewed agency officials to understand the  cause for the differences and obtained any supporting documentation to  ensure that all significant programs and activities were properly assessed.", "While our second objective focused on certain significant control activities  related to the selected agencies\u2019 inclusion of programs and activities in  their improper payment risk assessments at least once during fiscal years  2014 through 2016, we did not evaluate all control activities and other  components of internal control. If we had done so, additional deficiencies  may or may not have been identified that could impair the effectiveness of  the control activities evaluated as part of this audit.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2016 to November 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
