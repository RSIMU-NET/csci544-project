Instead, we limited our efforts to entities established as corporations by the federal government. These entities could be independent corporations, wholly or partially sponsored by the federal government, or corporations located within the executive branch.

We recorded information from these sources in a standardized data collection instrument that we then sent to the financial services institutions for validation and to obtain missing data. The information related to Year 2000 readiness is largely unverified, self-reported data obtained directly from the institutions and regulators, except for instances where we have already assessed an institution\u2019s Year 2000 readiness efforts in other reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government provides, or assists in providing, a number of diverse financial services programs to help meet identified goals. For example, some of these programs provide credit or loan guarantees for housing, education, business, and the export of various products, as well as insurance for pension plans and deposits in financial institutions. Federal departments or agencies directly operate some of these financial programs. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs provides direct and guaranteed loans to help veterans purchase homes. Similarly, the Small Business Administration provides credit to small businesses that may be unable to secure financing elsewhere. Other programs are operated by special entities created by the federal government, and they use appropriated and/or private funds. These entities, called financial services institutions for the purposes of this report, are predominately government corporations and government-sponsored enterprises.", "There are no uniform and clear criteria to define a government corporation. However, the following characteristics are referred to by public administration experts as appropriate for government corporations.", "They are predominantly of a business nature.", "They produce revenue and are potentially self-sustaining.", "They involve a large number of businesslike transactions with the public.", "They require greater flexibility than the customary type of appropriations budget ordinarily permits.", "These corporations can have assets wholly owned by the federal government or have both government and private equity. Government corporations typically have boards of directors or advisory boards that are to provide oversight over operations and help ensure that the corporations comply with their government charters. Collectively, federal agencies and government corporations operated financial programs that had a face value of $6.0 trillion outstanding in on- and off-balance sheet obligations and assets at the end of 1996, according to budget documents. This amount included $165 billion in direct loans, $805 billion in loan guarantees, and $5.0 trillion in insurance.", "Government-sponsored enterprises provided an additional $1.7 trillion to this total for the same period. Government-sponsored enterprises are federally established, privately owned and operated corporations that were created to increase the flow of credit to specific economic sectors. Congress limited government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 activities to specified economic sectors and gave them benefits, such as exemption from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration requirements and limited access to federal funds under specific conditions, to help them accomplish their public missions. They typically receive their financing from private investment sources.", "Government-sponsored enterprises engage in financial services activities, such as issuing capital stock and short- and long-term debt instruments, guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities, purchasing loans and holding them in portfolio, funding designated activities, and collecting fees for guarantees and other services. Government-sponsored enterprises generally do not receive government appropriations. Although the enterprises\u2019 charters state that their obligations must include a statement that they are not guaranteed by the United States, the enterprises\u2019 federal ties cause their securities to receive preferential treatment in financial markets. For example, the enterprises generally can borrow at rates that are only slightly above Treasury borrowing rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Financial Services Institutions", "paragraphs": ["We identified a total of 22 financial services institutions as being appropriate for this study; the type of financial services the institutions were authorized to engage in; and whether the institution was a government corporation, a government-sponsored enterprise, or another type of government entity (see table 1). Of the 22 financial services institutions, 11 were authorized to engage in lending activities, such as direct loans and loan guarantees; 9 were authorized to provide insurance protection, such as deposit or crop insurance; and 7 were authorized to perform secondary market activities, such as purchasing and assembling existing loans into pools for investors or for their portfolios. (As shown in table 1, a number of financial services institutions were authorized to engage in more than one category of financial services activity.)", "Of the 22 financial services institutions we identified, 12 were government corporations. All but two of the government corporations\u2014the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\u2014were categorized by statute as being wholly owned corporations. FDIC was categorized as a mixed-ownership government corporation as was the National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility, which is administered by NCUA. Six of the 22 financial services institutions were privately owned government-sponsored enterprises. Four institutions were included in the \u201cother\u201d category: a federally chartered private financial institution (National Consumer Cooperative Bank); an independent government-controlled corporation (Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation); a nonprofit, membership corporation (Securities Investor Protection Corporation); and a nonprofit, public corporation (Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation). See appendix I for additional information on the purposes and funding sources of the financial services institutions covered in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight Mechanisms and Controls", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent of oversight that these financial services institutions were subject to, we obtained from the institutions information on their coverage by, or their voluntary adherence to, selected oversight mechanisms and controls. Specifically, the financial institutions reported whether there was a federal safety and soundness regulator, independent annual financial audits, Office of Inspector General (OIG) authority to perform reviews, and/or coverage by selected federal laws that address management and financial accountability and performance issues (see table 2). All of the institutions reported full or partial coverage by at least two of the five selected oversight mechanisms and controls. Government-sponsored enterprises all had a safety and soundness regulator, but the government corporations tended to be subject to other oversight mechanisms and controls.", "All six of the government-sponsored enterprises had federal safety and soundness regulators. Five of these six institutions reported not being covered by OIG authority, and all six reported not being subject to or voluntarily adhering to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. As agreed with your office, we did not independently determine the applicability of the federal statutes to the institutions.", "In contrast to the government-sponsored enterprises, most of the government corporations reported coverage by OIG audits and full or partial adherence to GPRA and the CFO Act, which were intended to promote accountability and control. Only one of the government corporations, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, reported having a safety and soundness regulator.", "Of the four other financial services institutions, two (the National Consumer Cooperative Bank and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation) reported having federal safety and soundness regulators. The remaining two institutions (the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation and Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation) reported coverage by at least three of the four other oversight mechanisms and controls.", "All of the financial services institutions had independent audits of their annual financial statements by either certified public accounting firms, Offices of Inspectors General, or GAO. See appendixes II and III for additional information on the 22 financial services institutions\u2019 coverage by, or voluntary adherence to, various oversight mechanisms and controls, including their adherence to selected federal statutes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Independence, Authority, and Fees", "paragraphs": ["For the nine institutions with federal safety and soundness regulators, we obtained information on the regulators\u2019 independence, regulatory authorities, and fees. There were six safety and soundness regulators for the nine institutions (two of the regulators had responsibility for two or more of the financial services institutions), and their independence and regulatory authorities varied. With respect to regulatory authorities, the government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 regulators (Department of the Treasury, Farm Credit Administration for the Farm Credit System and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, Federal Housing Finance Board, and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight) tended to have more authority than the government corporation regulator (Risk Management Agency) and the other entities\u2019 regulators (Farm Credit Administration for the National Consumer Cooperative Bank and SEC). All of the government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 regulators and one of the other entity regulators were able to levy fees on the regulated financial services institution, but the other two regulators relied wholly or partially on appropriated funds to pay for their oversight expenses.", "Two of the six safety and soundness regulators (Federal Housing Finance Board and Risk Management Agency) had responsibilities for corporate and management governance activities that could potentially impair their independence. In prior reports, we identified independence and objectivity as key criteria for effective regulatory oversight. Specifically, we reported that regulators should have an arm\u2019s-length relationship with the regulated institution to ensure objectivity in assessing and controlling an institution\u2019s risk-taking activities. As we noted in our 1997 report, the Federal Housing Finance Board cannot be considered to be an arm\u2019s-length regulator, because it is involved in the corporate governance or management of the Federal Home Loan Banks. For example, the Federal Housing Finance Board is responsible for appointing six directors to each Federal Home Loan Bank\u2019s board and preparing the Federal Home Loan Bank System\u2019s annual financial statements. Likewise, the Risk Management Agency lacked an arm\u2019s-length relationship with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 established the functions of the Office of Risk Management (now the Risk Management Agency) as supervising the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and administering and overseeing all aspects of the programs authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Thus, the Risk Management Agency is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.", "As a group, the government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 regulators tended to have more authority than the other regulators (see table 3). The greatest variation in the powers of these regulators related to enforcement powers and the authority to establish rules and regulations governing the regulated institutions\u2019 operations. For example, only the Farm Credit Administration and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight had the specific authority to take formal enforcement actions, such as issuing cease and desist orders or assessing civil money penalties. See appendix IV for additional detail regarding the enforcement authorities of the six regulators.", "Four of the six regulators had the authority to levy assessments or fees on the financial services institution to recoup the costs associated with performing safety and soundness oversight of the institution (see table 4). The other two regulators (Risk Management Agency and SEC) relied wholly or partially on appropriated funds to pay for their oversight costs and activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indicators of Potential Exposure", "paragraphs": ["Congress created the government corporations, government-sponsored enterprises, and other financial services institutions discussed in this report to provide direct and indirect benefits to society, such as increased home ownership and insurance against certain losses. Meeting these societal goals often means that the institutions\u2019 programs and activities create potential exposure to losses that a private sector financial services institution would not assume. In some credit programs, the federal government bears the risk for less creditworthy borrowers, often giving credit for longer periods or at a lower cost to the borrower than would the private market. Many federal insurance programs cover complex, case-specific, or catastrophic risks that the private sector has historically been unwilling or unable to cover. For example, in some insurance programs, the federal government provides coverage against depositor losses up to a specified amount from failures of insured institutions or insures most defined-benefit pension plans sponsored by private employers in accordance with certain prescribed coverage and payment limits and restrictions.", "To obtain a general indication of the potential exposure these financial services institutions pose to the federal government, we asked the institutions to provide information on (1) assets and liabilities from their audited 1996 financial statements; (2) commitments and contingencies reported in the notes to the 1996 financial statements; (3) explicit government backing of the institution\u2019s liabilities, commitments, and contingencies; and (4) other financial information, such as borrowing authority (see table 5 and app. V). It is important to note that the figures reported as commitments and contingencies, and any federal backing thereof, generally represent the broadest possible measure of the potential exposure these financial services institutions could pose to the federal government not the loss considered probable or reasonably possible.", "The issue of explicit versus perceived federal government responsibility must also be considered. Of the 12 government corporations, 9 reported that their liabilities, commitments, and contingencies were in whole or in part explicitly guaranteed or backed by the federal government. The federally guaranteed portion of the government corporations\u2019 liabilities, commitments, and contingencies ranged from 100 percent (five corporations), specific portions (three corporations), to a specific maximum amount (one corporation). Of the institutions categorized as other, only the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation reported a federal guarantee for a portion of its liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. None of the government-sponsored enterprises, which are privately owned, reported an explicit federal government liability for their obligations. However, although an institution\u2019s charter may state that its obligations are not guaranteed by the United States government, the institution\u2019s federal ties may cause creditors to believe that the federal government would not allow the institution to default on its obligations. As we noted in past work, government-sponsored enterprises can generally borrow at rates that are only slightly above Treasury borrowing rates, largely due to the market\u2019s perception of an implicit federal guarantee. And, the government has intervened in the past to strengthen the position of some troubled government-sponsored enterprises absent any formal obligation to do so. Whether the federal government would intervene if such an institution were to become financially troubled would depend on a variety of complicated and specific circumstances.", "Twenty-one of the financial services institutions reported commitments and contingencies with a face amount ranging from $5 million to $2.7 trillion in their 1996 financial statements (see table 5). The commitments and contingent liability amounts shown reflect the maximum theoretical exposure to the federal government. The actual loss, even under fairly extreme economic conditions, is likely to be significantly lower and could even be zero. For example, FDIC reported $2.7 trillion in total commitments and contingencies. This number primarily represents the total amount of FDIC-insured deposits and would be the accounting loss that would occur if all depository institutions failed and the assets acquired as a result of the resolution process provided no recoveries. As of December 31, 1996, the assets of all FDIC-insured institutions totaled $5.6 trillion, and the combined equity capital of these institutions was $461 billion. Moreover, the deposit insurance fund held $35.7 billion that would be available to cover losses to the insurance fund. Of the $2.7 trillion of maximum loss exposure, FDIC estimated $180 million as the amount of losses \u201cfor which the risk was less than certain but still considered reasonably possible,\u201d and an additional $79 million as the amount of loss deemed probable.", "Another illustration of the need to use caution in interpreting and using the total commitments and contingencies data presented in table 5 is the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Of the $37.6 billion in total commitments and contingencies reported by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, $31.4 billion represented the total face value of the three types of political risk investment insurance it provides (inconvertibility of currency, expropriation, and political violence). Investors may obtain all three coverages, but claim payments may not exceed the single highest coverage amount. In addition, claim payments are limited or reduced for other factors, such as stop-loss agreements and recoveries from other sources. Taking these and other factors into consideration, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation estimated that its \u201ccurrent exposure to claims\u201d or reasonably possible loss for its political risk insurance program was $6.4 billion, and an additional $103 million as the amount of loss deemed probable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Readiness in Achieving Year 2000 Compliance", "paragraphs": ["We surveyed both the financial services institutions and the relevant regulators on Year 2000 compliance efforts. The 22 financial services institutions provided information regarding their status in achieving Year 2000 compliance using the 5 readiness phases and the corresponding recommended schedule for completing each phase that we described in our recent Year 2000 Assessment Guide (see table 6). There were no significant differences among the types of financial services institutions and their reported readiness. A number of the institutions reported that they had their Year 2000 readiness assessed by external auditors or other independent outside entities.", "The awareness phase includes such activities as defining the Year 2000 problem, gaining executive level support and sponsorship, establishing a team, and developing an overall strategy. The recommended completion date for the awareness phase was December 1996. All 22 institutions reported completing this phase.", "The assessment phase includes assessing the Year 2000 impact on the institution, identifying core business areas and processes, analyzing systems supporting the core business areas, and setting priorities for their conversion or replacement. The recommended completion date for the assessment phase was August 1997. Sixteen of the 22 institutions reported they had completed this phase. The remaining six institutions reported that this phase was in progress.", "The majority of the institutions were in the process of completing the renovation, validation, and implementation phases. The renovation phase includes such activities as converting, replacing, or eliminating selected platforms, applications, databases, and utilities. The recommended completion date for the renovation phase is August 1998. The validation phase includes testing, verifying, and validating converted or replaced platforms, applications, databases, and utilities and testing them in an operational environment. The implementation phase includes implementing the converted or replaced platforms, applications, databases, utilities, and interfaces. According to our recommended schedule, both the validation and implementation phase activities are to be performed on or by December 1999.", "We asked each of the six regulators what actions they had taken to ensure that their regulated financial services institutions would be in compliance with the Year 2000 computer conversion (see table 7). The reported data indicated that the regulators had extensive efforts under way to monitor the Year 2000 conversion efforts of regulated institutions. These efforts range from issuing guidance to requiring external auditor reviews or performing examinations on the institution\u2019s Year 2000 compliance status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine which financial services institutions are independent corporations, sponsored in whole or in part by the federal government, or corporations within the executive branch, we defined financial services institutions as entities whose enabling legislation authorized them to provide direct loans or credit, guarantee loans or mortgage-backed securities; insurance (deposits, pension funds, crops, etc.); or secondary market activities related to loans (mortgages, student loans, etc). We then used prior GAO reports, the President\u2019s 1998 Budget Appendix, reference documents, and studies/articles identified during our literature/Internet search to develop a list of institutions. This list was then shared with the Congressional Research Service, Congressional Budget Office, Department of the Treasury, and Office of Management and Budget and refined to reflect their comments.", "To identify the extent to which these institutions were subject to selected oversight mechanisms and controls, we used prior GAO reports, the President\u2019s Budget, and the institution\u2019s enabling legislation to determine if the institution had a federal safety and soundness regulator. We did not determine for this report if the regulators were effectively using these authorities to supervise the financial services institutions. However, we have addressed the oversight activities of some regulators in other reports.", "To determine if other internal and external oversight mechanisms and controls existed that might serve to alert Congress to potential problems, promote market discipline, or lead to correction of a problem, we completed a data collection instrument (DCI) for each institution that focused on control mechanisms that could be used regardless of the presence or absence of a safety and soundness regulator. Specifically, we focused on (1) adherence to selected federal statutes (Government Corporation Control Act of 1945, Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982, and Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990); (2) independent OIG personnel; (3) externally audited financial statements; and (4) independent credit rating reports. We sent the completed DCI to the financial services institutions for validation and to obtain missing data items.", "To provide information on the independence and authorities of any safety and soundness regulators for these financial services institutions, we used legal statutes, published regulations, and prior GAO reports to complete a DCI for each identified regulator. The DCI focused on the regulator\u2019s standard-setting authorities; enforcement powers; and ability to levy direct fees or assessments (examination fees, user fees, general assessments, and other mechanisms). In addition, the regulator DCI obtained information on the total costs incurred by the regulator for its examination and oversight activities and the funding sources used to offset any costs that were not charged to the institution. The DCIs were sent to the regulators for validation and to obtain missing data items.", "To address the objective of potential exposure, we first determined whether or not the federal government had an explicit liability for the activities of the financial services institution on our listing. We made this determination on the basis of an analysis of the institution\u2019s enabling legislation and prior GAO reports. We obtained information on the extent of potential exposure for each financial services institution using the most recent available audited financial statements and/or the President\u2019s Budget. Specifically, we obtained information on the institutions\u2019 total assets and liabilities and their commitments and contingencies. These data were recorded in a DCI that was subsequently sent to each institution for validation and to obtain missing data items.", "To provide information on the state of readiness of these institutions to achieve Year 2000 compliance and the regulators\u2019 efforts in this area, we used both the institution and regulator DCIs. The institution DCI was keyed to the five broad phases of readiness that we developed and used in previous Year 2000 compliance assessments. The regulator DCI focused on efforts taken by the regulator to ensure the institution\u2019s readiness, including issuance of guidance, examination of progress, coverage by external or internal auditors, and submission of reports. For this particular objective, we relied almost entirely on the institutions and regulators to provide the needed data. The information on FDIC\u2019s Year 2000 readiness was based on our prior work on this subject, which was validated by FDIC.", "We did our work between November 1997 and April 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or their designees.

However, he provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "We received written comments from OMB, which are reprinted in appendix VI. OMB had two primary concerns with the scope of this report. Its first concern was with the exclusion of numerous government entities that engage in financial services activities that result in potential liabilities. OMB stated that the report did not address government agencies and departments, such as the Small Business Administration, that directly engage in credit and insurance activities similar to those undertaken by the financial services institutions covered in the report. We agree that the U.S. Treasury has a potential liability from financial services institutions within the federal government regardless of whether the credit or insurance program is conducted under a corporate entity or directly by an executive branch department. However, we feel that it is useful for this report to focus on financial services institutions that are independent corporations, sponsored in whole or in part by the federal government, or corporations within the executive branch because the oversight, issues, and concerns can be affected by an institution\u2019s status as a corporation. We revised and added information early in this report to recognize that some of the financial institutions are in fact parts of executive branch departments and agencies or constitute entire agencies themselves.", "Second, OMB expressed concern that in presenting data on potential liability we did not ultimately identify which were the most appropriate indicators of the potential liabilities of these financial services institutions. We agree. Due to the wide range of financial activities undertaken by the institutions and the unique nature of the associated potential liabilities, identifying a set of indicators that would be most appropriate for measuring the government\u2019s exposure for all 22 of the institutions would require analyses beyond the agreed-upon scope of this report. For example, the unique purposes of each institution and various economic and other circumstances that might affect its condition would have to be considered. However, we believe that the information contained in this report can be useful for Congress and the executive branch in identifying specific institutions for more focused and in-depth analysis. OMB also provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the date of this report.
