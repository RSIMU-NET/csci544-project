OPM monitors overall implementation and  identifies corrective actions when deficiencies are found. OPM conducts  this oversight through three primary means: delegated examining unit  audits, human resource management evaluations, and special studies.", "However, in our prior work, we have identified the need for more effective  oversight in such areas as agencies\u2019 use of hiring authorities, agencies\u2019  classification programs, the conversion of political appointees to career  positions, and the Senior Executive Service performance-based pay  system. With respect to agencies\u2019 use of hiring authorities, for example,  to help strengthen the government\u2019s ability to compete in the labor market  for top talent, and to improve the federal hiring process, we  recommended in 2016 that the Director of OPM, in conjunction with the  CHCO Council, should determine whether opportunities exist to refine,  consolidate, eliminate, or expand agency-specific authorities to other  agencies and implement changes where OPM is authorized.", "OPM agreed with the recommendation and in December 2018, OPM said  that it continues to research and examine streamlining opportunities, such  as those identified in its July 2018 study on excepted service hiring  authorities, as part of the broader initiative to modernize federal hiring  practices under the President\u2019s Management Agenda. However, OPM did  not provide a time frame for implementation. In its March 2019  Congressional Justification for the fiscal year 2020 budget request, OPM  included legislative proposals for new hiring authorities such as highly  qualified experts and temporary appointments to help agencies meet  critical needs as well as a change to the criteria for granting direct hire  authority.", "While OPM has made some progress in this area, it will be important for  the agency to follow through on its planned actions to streamline hiring  authorities. To fully implement the recommendation, OPM or another  entity, if reorganized, needs to complete these efforts and, as appropriate,  develop legislative proposals in consultation with the CHCO Council.", "Thank you, Chairman Connolly, Ranking Member Meadows, and  Members of the Subcommittee.
