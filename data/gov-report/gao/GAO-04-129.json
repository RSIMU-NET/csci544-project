The plan was to burn up to 900  acres.  On May 5, 2000, the prescribed burn exceeded the capabilities of the  National Park Service, spread to other federal and nonfederal land, and was  characterized as a wildfire.  On May 13, 2000, the President issued a major  disaster declaration, and subsequently, the Secretary of the Interior and the  National Park Service assumed responsibility for the fire and the loss of  federal, state, local, tribal, and private property.  The fire, known as the  Cerro Grande fire, burned approximately 48,000 acres in four counties and  two Indian pueblos, destroyed over 200 residential structures, and forced  the evacuation of more than 18,000 residents.", "On July 13, 2000, the President signed CGFAA into law.  Under CGFAA,  each claimant is entitled to be compensated by the United States  government for certain injuries and damages that resulted from the Cerro  Grande fire.  CGFAA required that FEMA promulgate and publish  implementing regulations for the Cerro Grande program within 45 days of  enactment of the law.  On August 28, 2000, FEMA published Disaster  Assistance: Cerro Grande Fire Assistance: Interim Final Rule in the  Federal Register (Interim Rule).  FEMA modified the Interim Rule with a  set of implementing policies and procedures on November 13, 2000.  FEMA  updated these policies and procedures in January and March 2001.  After  reviewing public comments on the Interim Rule, FEMA finalized and  published Disaster Assistance: Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Final Rule  (Final Rule) on March 21, 2001.", "The Congress initially appropriated $455 million to FEMA for the payment  of such claims and $45 million for the administration of the Cerro Grande  program.  In March 2002, FEMA requested, but did not receive, additional  appropriated funding of $80 million to cover additional claims and  administrative costs.  In December 2002, FEMA revised its estimate and  requested additional appropriated funding of $155 million, including   $5 million for administrative costs.  The revised estimate was based on  more complete claim information since the final date to submit claims had  passed on August 28, 2002.  In February 2003, FEMA was appropriated an  additional $90 million, of which up to $5 million may be made available for administrative purposes.  FEMA stated that only $2 million was used in  fiscal year 2003 for administrative purposes.  In October 2003, FEMA  received an additional appropriation of $38.062 million, of which 5 percent  may be made available for administrative costs. After FEMA allocated a  specific amount for administrative costs, it had a maximum of   $578.6 million available for the payment of claims under CGFAA.  During  the audit, FEMA provided revised claim data that reflected the amounts  shown in table 1.", "The claimed amounts that FEMA approved for payment through   September 9, 2003, included $51.5 million of approved subrogation claims.   Pending claims included expected payments for individual, business,  governmental, and pueblo claims, and projected liabilities consisted of  potential future appeals, potential arbitrations, and contingency for judicial  review.", "CGFAA requires that FEMA submit an annual report to the Congress that  provides information about claims submitted under the act.  This annual  report is to include the amounts claimed, a description of the nature of the  claims, and the status or disposition of the claims, including the amounts  paid.  FEMA\u2019s report is to be issued annually by August 28.  CGFAA, as  amended, requires that we conduct annual audits on the payment of all  claims made and report the results of the audits to the Congress within 120  days of FEMA\u2019s issuance of its annual report.  The act also requires that our  report include a review of all subrogation claims for which insurance  companies have been paid.  In May 2003, we issued our second report on  the audit of Cerro Grande claim payments made from inception through  August 28, 2002.  The report stated that FEMA properly processed and paid  claims but overstated amounts paid in its report to the Congress and made  two recommendations regarding the reconciliation of the approved and  paid amounts in its payment approval and accounting systems.

This form  summarizes all amounts recommended for payment, including those  amounts previously paid through a partial payment.  The POL form must be  signed by the claimant subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, which  establishes criminal penalties for false statements.  Once a signed POL  form is received, an OCGFC authorized official sends a Letter of Final  Determination to tell the claimant the total amount of compensation being  offered under CGFAA.  Accompanying this letter is a Release and  Certification form that the claimant signs if he or she accepts the OCGFC  compensation determination, thereby releasing the federal government  from any additional claims arising from the Cerro Grande fire.

FEMA  reconciled the total amounts approved for payment to the amounts actually  paid as of June 30, 2003, which was the cutoff date for its annual report,  and as of August 31, 2003.  FEMA officials stated they would continue to  perform these reconciliations periodically.  In reviewing FEMA\u2019s annual  report to the Congress required by CGFAA, we found that while  improvements were made in how FEMA represented the detailed claim  information in its report, claim information was no longer summarized in  the report, making it less useful and transparent.", "In our May 2003 report, we recommended that FEMA reconcile the  amounts approved for payment in its payment approval system to amounts  actually paid in its accounting system and correct all identified errors in its  payment approval system.  We also recommended that FEMA perform  monthly reconciliations of the approved and paid amounts for as long as  both systems are used to track and report paid amounts or request  additional funding.", "In response to our recommendations, OCGFC implemented a detailed  process that consisted of compiling the claimed amounts by individual  claims from both the accounting system and the payment approval system  and matching the amounts approved and paid for each claim.   It also  performed an overall reconciliation of the total amounts approved and paid  through June 30, 2003.", "In performing the detailed matching process, OCGFC compared the  individual claim approval data and claim payment data from August 28,  2000, through February 19, 2003, and performed periodic comparisons of  individual claims from February 20, 2003, to May 31, 2003, and from June 1  to June 30, 2003.  When OCGFC identified differences between amounts  reported as paid by FEMA\u2019s accounting system and OCGFC\u2019s payment  approval system, it recorded the adjustments and corrections into its  payment approval system to eliminate duplication and made note of data  entry errors, which did not require adjustments.  The identified differences  generally consisted of the following:  Duplicate approved amounts that represented a claimed amount that  was approved for payment more than once.  For example, in one case  OCGFC approved a final payment of $934,802.  Since the claimant  appealed, the amount was not paid.  While the claim was being  appealed, OCGFC approved a partial payment of $919,802.   Both of  these amounts appeared as approved payments in its payment approval  system.   After we brought this duplicate approval to OCGFC\u2019s attention  during our prior review, it subsequently removed the original unpaid  amount from its system during its claims comparison process later in  fiscal year 2003.", "Data entry errors by claim reviewers when entering data into the  payment approval or accounting systems.  For example, if an incorrect  identification number was used to process a payment, no comparison  could be made between the approved amount recorded by claim  number in the approval system and the paid amount recorded by  claimant\u2019s identification number in the accounting system.  To resolve  the situation, OCGFC listed the approved amount as an unmatched item  until it located the matching payment that was recorded to a different  identification number.", "In addition to these comparisons of individual claim amounts, FEMA\u2019s  Financial and Acquisition Management Division (FAMD) performed a  complete reconciliation of the total amounts that were approved for  payment and paid as of June 30, 2003.  We reviewed this overall  reconciliation of the total claim amounts approved and paid under CGFAA,  from inception through June 30, 2003, and found that all corrections and  adjustments identified during OCGFC\u2019s comparison were made.  FAMD  also performed a similar reconciliation of total approved and paid amounts  through August 31, 2003, and stated that it plans to perform this overall  reconciliation more regularly, at least quarterly.", "In our prior report, we noted that FEMA improperly reported unreconciled  amounts that were approved for payment in its prior annual reports to the  Congress as amounts actually paid.  In its 2003 annual report to the  Congress, FEMA continued to include claimed amounts approved for  payment in a detailed schedule of claim information, but it properly  identified the amounts as such instead of as paid or expended amounts.   However, FEMA\u2019s report no longer summarized information on the  amounts claimed, amounts approved, and the estimated liabilities for the  remainder of the program.
