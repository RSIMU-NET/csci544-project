EPA responds to all public comments, but it cannot deny a permit on the basis of community concerns if all regulatory requirements for protecting drinking water are met. However, earlier involvement could give communities more time to contact appropriate state or local officials to address concerns that are not within the scope of EPA's authority. In Michigan, where EPA issues injection well permits, communities believe that their concerns are often not fully resolved; in some instances, communities have filed legal actions and complaints to prevent well construction. In contrast, the three states to which EPA has authorized responsibility for issuing permits have enacted requirements for earlier and more public involvement. Overall, they believe that early involvement better addresses community concerns, mitigates controversial issues, and avoids litigation. EPA addresses environmental justice issues in two basic ways--first, as part of its process for deciding whether to issue a permit for well construction, and second, in response to specific civil rights complaints filed with the agency after permits are issued. EPA encourages its regional offices issuing construction permits to determine if minority and low-income populations are disproportionately affected by a proposed well's location. Individuals and communities may appeal EPA permit decisions with EPA's Environmental Appeals Board or, for other permit decisions, file complaints under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act with EPA's Office of Civil Rights. Only one community has filed complaints related to deep injection wells; these complaints did not result in changes to the permit decisions. Court decisions have recently limited the basis for filing Title VI complaints, making the process an unlikely avenue for changing permit decisions. Current financial assurance requirements may not ensure that adequate resources are available to close a commercial deep injection well in the event of bankruptcy or ceased operations. While only four sites have gone into bankruptcy or ceased operating since the program began in 1980; two did not have adequate financial resources to plug and abandon wells and for the other two, financial assurance was not tested because other companies purchased and continued operating the wells. EPA has questioned the adequacy of some financial assurance requirements in other programs that are similar to those for Class I deep injection wells. EPA's Office of Inspector General has reported that financial assurance requirements for another waste management program, which the requirements for deep injection wells mirror, may not be adequate to close facilities; an EPA working group is also reviewing similar aspects of financial assurance requirements for a different type of injection well for possible changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Billions of gallons of hazardous liquid waste are injected into underground  wells each year. These wells, known as Class I deep injection wells, are  built to contain hazardous waste\u2014from the pharmaceutical, chemical  manufacturing, and metalworking industries, among others\u2014below the  lowest underground source of drinking water. Class I deep injection wells  may either be owned and used by a facility to handle the waste it generates  itself (noncommercial wells) or may be wells operated by companies that  accept waste from multiple facilities and may be far from any particular  waste-generating site (commercial wells). Thirteen commercial wells  operate in the United States; they are located in Louisiana, Ohio, and  Texas. In addition, two commercial wells have been constructed in  Michigan but are not yet operating. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act  (SDWA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for  establishing standards for and issuing permits for the construction and  operation of these wells. EPA can authorize states to administer the  program\u2014giving them primacy\u2014as long as the state requirements are at  least as stringent as the federal requirements. EPA has granted primacy to  Louisiana, Ohio, and Texas. Michigan has not applied for primacy and has  no plans to do so because it does not believe it has enough wells to  warrant devoting staff and resources to permitting and regulating them.", "In order to operate a commercial well that accepts hazardous waste, well  owners need to obtain several different permits that establish conditions,  including requirements under EPA regulations. First, under  the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, owners must obtain a  construction permit, which, among other things, specifies how the well is  to be constructed to prevent the injected waste from migrating to sources  of drinking water. The wells must also be located in geologically suitable  areas\u2014areas that are not susceptible to earthquakes\u2014to ensure that the  waste will not migrate. Second, under the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act (RCRA), owners must obtain a permit to ensure that any  above-ground treatment and storage facilities can be operated safely;  owners frequently treat and store the waste on the surface before injecting  it below ground. Under RCRA, they must also demonstrate that injected  waste will be contained within a defined underground area. Finally,  owners must have a UIC operating permit from EPA or the state before  injecting any waste. Both UIC and RCRA regulations require EPA or the  state to obtain public comments before they issue permits.", "According to a 2001 EPA study of the risks associated with Class I wells,  deep injection wells are relatively safe. Nonetheless, communities where  commercial wells are located have raised concerns about the hazards that  these wells may pose. In particular, they point out that the aboveground  activities at the well site, such as trucks that transport waste and  treatment and storage facilities that handle waste, increase the possibility  of accidental hazardous waste spills, noise, and odor pollution, and may  reduce property values.", "Several grassroots and environmental organizations have also voiced  environmental justice concerns, charging that low-income, minority  communities are unfairly targeted as locations for hazardous facilities of  all types, including commercial deep injection wells. Executive  Order 12898, issued in 1994, directs federal agencies, as appropriate, to  identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse health and  environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority  and low-income populations. Although this order does not create a right to  judicial review, individuals who have environmental justice concerns may  file a petition for review with EPA\u2019s Environmental Appeals Board, if EPA  is the involved party, or a Title VI complaint with EPA\u2019s Office of Civil  Rights, if the involved party is a recipient of EPA financial assistance, such  as a state office.", "Finally, EPA requires a Class I well owner or operator to establish  financial assurance to cover the estimated cost of the plugging and  abandonment of the well. Financial assurance can be provided in several  approved forms, such as trust funds or as surety bonds. Each year, the  owner or operator must review the cost estimate on which the financial  assurance is based to determine whether it is still adequate to cover  anticipated costs due to inflation and make any needed changes.", "You asked us to examine the extent to which EPA and the states  (1) address community concerns in permitting well construction,  (2) address environmental justice issues in the construction permit  process, and (3) ensure that financial assurances adequately protect the  taxpayers if an owner goes bankrupt. To address these issues, we, among  other things, examined the permitting process in the four states that have  commercial Class I deep injection wells: Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, and  Texas. Because Michigan does not have primacy, EPA manages the  permitting process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Disposing of wastewater through underground wells began in the 1930s,  when oil companies started pumping brine produced from oil and gas  production into porous rock formations underground. This disposal  method is more cost effective than treating and reusing wastewater. This  disposal method was increasingly used by the chemical and petrochemical  industries in the 1960s and 1970s, and EPA raised concerns that injected  waste could contaminate underground drinking water. Underground water  supplies are used to provide about 50 percent of the public water in the  United States and are vulnerable to contamination. The Safe Drinking  Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 authorized EPA to regulate underground  injection wells in order to protect drinking water sources. EPA published  regulations establishing the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program  in 1980, specifying safeguards to prevent injection wells from endangering  underground sources of drinking water.", "The UIC program encompasses five classes of underground wells.  Class I wells, which are the focus of this report, inject hazardous and  nonhazardous waste from manufacturing and other sources below  the lowermost underground source of drinking water located within a  quarter mile of the well. Approximately 500 Class I wells operate  nationwide, many concentrated in midwestern and southern states. The  other four classes range from Class II wells involved in oil and natural gas  production to Class V wells that include waste from agricultural runoff and  septic systems.", "Of the 473 Class I deep injection wells that exist nationwide, only 13 wells  are at commercial sites that accept and inject hazardous waste from  various manufacturing facilities, according to the most recent EPA data  (2001). Two more commercial wells have been constructed in Michigan  and are awaiting final approval for operation. The other noncommercial  Class I wells are owned by companies that use them exclusively to  dispose of their own manufacturing waste. Because hazardous waste is  injected into Class I wells, EPA imposes stringent technical requirements  on the wells to protect drinking water supplies through both UIC and  RCRA regulations.", "Class I hazardous well owners and operators must meet certain  requirements to construct a well. For example, they must review the area  to ensure that the site is geologically suitable. One purpose of this review  is to ensure that other existing or abandoned wells nearby do not provide  avenues for the injected waste to enter underground sources of  drinking water.", "To obtain final approval to operate a deep injection well, owners and  operators are required to, among other things    properly design the well to ensure that the waste will not migrate into an  underground source of drinking water;    assure that injection pressure does not cause fractures in the injection  zone or migration of fluids;    provide plans for closing the well and post-closure care;    demonstrate and maintain financial assurance (trust fund, bond, or other  approved forms) to ensure that the well can be properly plugged and  abandoned;    establish monitoring and reporting requirements; and    demonstrate that the injected waste will not migrate beyond the injection  zone for 10,000 years, if otherwise prohibited hazardous waste will be  injected into the well.", "Well owners must design and construct a well shaft that is made of three  or more protective layers of pipe or tubing that go into the injection zone.  Wastewater is injected through the innermost part of the constructed well  shaft, referred to as the injection tubing. (See fig. 1.)", "Owners of Class I injection wells must obtain RCRA permits if they plan  to treat and store waste before injecting it. These permits are for building  and operating treatment and storage facilities. RCRA prohibits the land  disposal of restricted hazardous waste unless EPA determines the  prohibition is not required in order to protect human health and the  environment for as long as the waste remains hazardous. Under UIC  program regulations, EPA requires owners to demonstrate, among other  things, that, to a reasonable degree of certainty, the restricted hazardous  waste will not migrate out of the injection zone for 10,000 years. EPA  determines compliance with this requirement through its computer  simulation models, which the owners use to enter their specific data to  demonstrate the movement of injected waste under certain geologic  conditions. If the owner successfully demonstrates that waste will not  migrate out of the injection zone, EPA will grant an exemption to the  RCRA regulation, sometimes referred to as a land ban petition or a  no-migration petition.", "The permitting of deep injection wells can raise environmental justice  concerns within a community, and permit decisions may be challenged  based on environmental justice concerns. Executive Order 12898,  issued in 1994, directed federal agencies to incorporate environmental  justice as part of their missions. Agencies are to identify and address  disproportionately adverse human health or environmental effects on  minority or low-income populations of their programs, policies, or  activities. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination  on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity  that receives federal funding; individuals may appeal permit decisions if  they believe the prohibited discrimination occurred. Section 601 of the act  prohibits intentional discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national  origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance.  Section 602 provides federal departments or agencies with the authority  to issue rules or regulations implementing the objectives contained in  section 601.", "To ensure that financial resources are available to close wells if they  cease operation, EPA requires financial assurance from owners under the  UIC and RCRA programs. Owners must provide financial assurance for  plugging and abandonment of wells and closing associated RCRA  treatment and storage facilities. For both the UIC and RCRA programs,  owners can provide financial assurance through approved methods such  as trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, or insurance. The amount of  financial assurance needed is based on the estimated cost of the plugging  and abandonment of the well or closing the treatment and storage facility.", "For example, the estimated cost for plugging and abandonment of one  well in Michigan was $25,000, while the estimate for another well in Ohio  was $250,000; the variation in cost was due to difference in the sizes and  depths of the two wells. Each year owners must also certify that the  financial assurance is adequate and make any necessary changes to the  type or amount of financial assurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Concerns Could Be More Comprehensively Addressed Before Draft Permits Are Completed", "paragraphs": ["Under EPA regulations, communities can raise concerns during the  required public comment process for deep injection well permits after a  draft permit is issued. EPA bases final approvals on whether a proposed  well meets technical and safety requirements under its regulations and  does not have authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act to deny a  permit on the basis of other concerns. Earlier public involvement would  allow more time for individuals to approach appropriate state or local  officials with any other concerns. When states are the permitting authority,  they provide more and earlier opportunities for obtaining community  concerns.

When the  draft is complete, EPA or state officials establish a list of interested  parties\u2014citizens and local government representatives\u2014and mail a fact  sheet describing the proposed well. The public must be given at least  30 days from the date of the draft permit notice to submit written  comments or request a public hearing, in which case the hearing time and  place are also published in the local newspapers. Last, EPA or a state  office makes a final permit decision and prepares written responses to the  public comments. Figure 2 shows the permitting process, including  opportunities for public comment.", "Because the agency and the prospective well owner have already  expended time and resources to develop the draft permit, communities  have raised concerns that the opportunity for commenting on the  proposed construction permit is often too late in the process to have any  effect. EPA does not have authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act to  deny a permit if it meets technical and safety requirements, even if the  application raises other community concerns. We also believe that, after  this much investment, well owners may not be as willing to make changes  in their planned operations and communities may not have enough time to  contact appropriate state and local officials to have their nontechnical  concerns addressed.", "Both EPA and the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA)  have noted the importance of getting the public involved early in the  permitting process. For example, in January 2001, EPA reported that it is  important to involve the public early in its decision-making process  because stakeholders (such as owners or city officials) and the public  have perspectives that can greatly improve the quality of decision making.  Similarly, in December 2001, NAPA raised concerns about how the public  has missed opportunities to provide timely input in the permitting process.  Without timely participation, the public is less able to affect important  decisions at the state and local level, such as site location.", "Not providing an opportunity for early public involvement may result in  extensive community opposition to proposed wells. For example, the two  proposed wells in Romulus, Michigan generated extensive opposition.  Community concerns included issues such as possible damage to the  interstate highway as a result of increased traffic traveling to the wells.  EPA only has authority to base permitting decisions on SDWA  requirements and does not consider the impact of traffic on the interstate  highway or the safety of transporting hazardous waste to Class I facilities.  These particular wells have generated substantial public comment and  legal action by community members. In 1996, the applicant, Environmental  Disposal Systems (EDS), applied for a construction permit. The public was  first notified of the draft permit 15 months later. After another 2 years, and  significant public comments, EPA issued the construction permit without  significant modifications.

For example, the Texas Commission on  Environmental Quality (TCEQ) must notify the public when it first  receives a completed permit application\u2014unlike EPA, which requires  public notification after the permit is drafted. Texas\u2019s process increases  the opportunity for the public to provide comments at a point when the  state can better address the comments. In addition, in making permitting  decisions, TCEQ must determine that the well is in the public interest,  considering the following issues:    compliance history of the applicant;    whether the applicant will maintain adequate insurance for bodily injury  and property damage caused by accidents, or will otherwise demonstrate  financial responsibility; and    whether there is a reasonably available practical, economic, and feasible  alternative to an injection well.", "In addition, the well must not impair existing rights, including mineral  rights. If the well is not in an industrial area, the applicant must make a  reasonable effort to ensure that the burden on local law enforcement,  emergency medical or fire-fighting personnel, or public roadways will be  reasonably minimized or mitigated.", "All three states have also enacted additional requirements to address  community concerns. For example, under its RCRA program, Texas  requires that new commercial hazardous waste management facilities,  including those associated with Class I deep injection wells, be more than  2,640 feet from an established residence, church, school, day care center,  surface water body used for a public drinking water supply, or public park.", "States have also taken other steps to address community concerns. For  instance, for one commercial Class I deep injection well in Ohio, state  officials assisted a community in speaking directly with the prospective  well owner.

EPA\u2019s  Office of Environmental Justice oversees the implementation of  environmental justice, and it has drafted national guidance that will assist  EPA staff in evaluating potential environmental justice concerns and  taking actions to address them. To date, the national guidance has been  reviewed internally within EPA, but EPA has not yet published it for  comment in the Federal Register.

Regional  officials said that environmental justice assessments are routinely being  performed for Class I deep injection wells, although the regional  guidelines only encourage EPA staff to conduct an assessment that  considers demographic make up and the potential health risks that the site  might pose to area residents. For example, in assessing demographics for  issuing a permit for a facility, such as a waste treatment facility, staff in  EPA region V would determine whether the number of low-income and  minority residents living within a specific radius of the facility is greater  than or equal to two times the average low-income and minority  population in the state. If that were the case, EPA staff would conduct  community outreach efforts, such as holding public meetings or  workshops, to better understand and respond to community concerns.  Regional officials said they might decide that issuing a permit would  present additional risks to a community already affected by other  environmental sites and they would, therefore, impose special permit  requirements, such as limiting the amount of waste injected into wells or  requiring increased monitoring, to ensure safe operation.

Members  of only one community\u2014Romulus, Michigan\u2014have challenged permit  decisions for a commercial Class I deep injection well on environmental  justice grounds. In 1998, two individuals filed petitions with EAB to review  EPA\u2019s issuance of construction permits to Environmental Disposal  Systems (EDS). Among other things, the petitions claimed that (1) the  permits and EPA\u2019s response to written comments were not provided in a  timely manner for public review to two libraries, (2) EDS should be  required to conduct a survey of the surrounding area to determine the  location of other deep injection wells because the Michigan Department of  Environmental Quality information was unreliable, and (3) the EPA  environmental justice demographic analysis was flawed because it used  data from a 2-mile radius instead of a 4-mile radius, which would have  included a larger minority population. In October 1998, the EAB concluded  that the petitions did not provide a basis for review of the permit decision.  Specifically, the board found that the alleged delay in permit notification  and responses to comments did not affect the petitioner adversely because  EPA provided 6 extra days for public comments. Regarding the survey for  other wells, the EAB stated that the petitioner did not provide any support  for his claim that data from the Michigan Department of Environmental  Quality was unreliable. The EAB stated that the region did not rely only on  this data and that there was no indication that EPA\u2019s conclusion was  erroneous. Lastly, regarding the use of the 2-mile radius for the  demographic analysis, the EAB deferred to the EPA region\u2019s decision that  2 miles was an appropriate radius for the analysis, stating that determining  the radius is a highly technical judgment based on the probable dispersion  of pollutants.", "Another Romulus citizen filed a Title VI complaint with EPA\u2019s OCR,  which was accepted for review in December 2001, raising three issues  regarding Michigan\u2019s RCRA permit decisions on the sites\u2019 treatment and  storage facilities. (Michigan has primacy for RCRA.) Two of these issues  concerned procedural matters which OCR rejected. OCR dismissed the  third issue: that citizens of Romulus were disproportionately exposed to  pollution and other environmental dangers. OCR found that the facility  would not adversely impact the community because EPA had concluded  that the wells would not damage water, air, or soil quality, nor would they  increase noise pollution.

The board rejected these claims and denied review on  these issues, stating that the petitioner had failed to show that the permit  would not protect drinking water sources of populations within 2 miles  of the well site or that citizens at a greater distance would not  be protected.

While the well needs to be closed for safety reasons,  it does not pose immediate environmental concerns because construction  was not completed and waste had not been injected into the well,  according to EPA and state officials. If the company does not provide  adequate financial assurance and obtain authorization to operate the  well, the state will try to compel the company to close the well and, if  unsuccessful, will use its own funds to close it.", "EPA and state officials responsible for overseeing the 13 commercial  Class I wells currently in operation believe that the owners\u2019 or operators\u2019  financial assurances provide enough funds to close their wells in the event  of bankruptcy.

UIC financial requirements are based on RCRA requirements  and, therefore, the OIG recommendations are relevant to the UIC program.  According to the OIG, the risk associated with financial assurance  provided by insurance, surety bonds, and trust funds may be higher than  EPA initially estimated for its financial assurance regulations, and funds  may not be available when needed. Specifically, for state financial  assurance programs for RCRA facilities, insurance provided by captive  insurance companies may be inadequate for covering closure and  post-closure costs. Captive insurance companies are wholly owned  subsidiaries of the corporation they are insuring; if the parent company  experiences financial difficulty, state financial assurance programs can  have little confidence that the captive insurance company will provide the  funds needed to pay for closure. These insurance policies are also high  risk if they cannot be assigned to different owners when a RCRA facility is  sold. The OIG recommended that EPA issue guidance for state financial  assurance programs to reduce risks associated with insurance policies and  that EPA investigate complex insurance issues with states to determine  whether additional guidance is needed.", "The OIG report also noted that state officials had difficulty determining  whether the dollar amounts provided for financial assurance were  adequate to cover all costs for closing facilities. Program officials  reviewing financial assurance statements often rely on subjective  judgment and are unaware of automated information available to assist in  their reviews. This situation prompted the OIG to recommend that EPA  help states obtain the automated information for reviewing cost estimates.", "In October 2001, responding to the OIG report, EPA requested public  comments on the report\u2019s conclusions. Specifically, EPA requested  comments from the states, the insurance industry, and the regulated  community on the need for additional guidance on insurance used as  financial assurance for RCRA facilities. In addition, EPA requested  comments on any additional requirements for insurers in general, such  as a possible requirement that insurers have a minimum rating from  commercial rating services. By requiring insurers to have ratings that  reflect relatively strong financial conditions, EPA expects to reduce the  risk to the agency or to a state if the insurer fails to provide the funding  required for closing a facility. According to an EPA official, as of May 2003,  the agency is continuing to review the public comments received and will  then decide whether proposed changes to financial assurance  requirements are needed. The agency has not set a specific time frame for  proposing changes.", "In July 2002, EPA also formed a UIC work group to review the adequacy of  financial assurance requirements for Class II oil- and gas-related injection  wells, but not Class I deep injection wells because of their relatively small  number. However, the concerns about adequacy are similar. The work  group was formed because EPA officials recognized that the requirements,  issued in 1984, might need updating and because regional offices were not  implementing the requirements consistently. Specifically, the regional  offices were not using a standard approach for calculating the plugging  and abandonment costs, which posed problems for operators with  permitted facilities in more than one EPA region. Officials also observed  that under present economic conditions it is increasingly difficult for  owners to meet the financial assurance requirements, but failure to do  so risks contaminating underground drinking water sources. The work  group is to  identify financial assurance alternatives to those currently in use,    develop guidance for providing consistency in calculating plugging and  abandonment costs,    determine whether states are requiring adequate financial assurance for  plugging and abandonment of injection wells, and    prepare possible modifications of the financial assurance language  contained in the SDWA.", "The work group expects to complete all of its objectives by April 2004."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The public participation process EPA currently uses is not as effective  as it could be in addressing the broad range of community concerns  about Class I deep injection wells. Because EPA\u2019s current requirements  call for the agency to notify the public after it drafts the permit, rather  than when it receives a permit application, we believe the process is  essentially too late to have a meaningful effect, and that it reduces public  confidence in the process. In contrast, when states involve the community  early, they have experienced better community relations\u2014which EPA  believes is important and wants to achieve\u2014and have avoided costly,  time-consuming delays.", "The ultimate test of whether financial assurances are adequate is an  owner\u2019s bankruptcy. If an owner declares bankruptcy and the financial  assurances are found to be inadequate, drinking water sources may be at  risk and the public may be required to bear the cost of closing a well.  Consequently, any uncertainties about the adequacy of financial  assurances need to be minimized. Both the potential burden to the  taxpayer if adequate financial resources are not available and the potential  problems pointed out by the OIG and by EPA\u2019s own working group call for  action to review and improve these requirements to determine if  improvements are necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To allow more time for community concerns to be addressed, we  recommend that the Administrator, EPA, involve communities earlier in  the permitting process for constructing a well.", "Furthermore, to ensure that requirements are adequate to cover the costs  of plugging and abandonment of Class I hazardous deep injection wells  and thereby reducing the public\u2019s financial risk, we recommend that  the Administrator, EPA, review and, if warranted, strengthen financial  assurance requirements for Class I hazardous deep injection wells. In so  doing, the Administrator should    consider the applicability of the Office of the Inspector General\u2019s findings  and recommendations for RCRA financial assurance, and    consider the applicability of the results and recommendations of the  ongoing work group for Class II wells."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to EPA for its review and comment. EPA  did not agree with the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations for  improving the UIC program and stated that the report contained various  factual and technical errors. We continue to believe that our report is  accurate and that our recommendations are sound. We have made some  changes to clarify our findings.", "EPA raised several principal objections to the report. First, EPA stated  that our report mischaracterizes its authority under the UIC program and  the relevant scope of public involvement and comment; to this end it  suggested that our report and recommendations attribute responsibilities  to the UIC program beyond the scope of the SDWA. It was not our intent  to attribute responsibilities to the UIC program beyond the scope of the  SDWA and we have made clarifications to reflect that some community  concerns are not within the scope of EPA\u2019s authority. The report clearly  sets forth the public comment process that EPA follows and explains that  the agency cannot deny a permit on the basis of community concerns if  the permit applicant meet all regulatory requirements. While EPA does not  have authority to address certain nontechnical community concerns under  the SDWA, we believe that public involvement before the draft  construction permit is issued would allow more time for the community to  have its nontechnical concerns addressed at the state or local level. In  addition, nothing in the SDWA precludes EPA from involving communities  earlier in the permitting process, before draft construction permits are  issued. Indeed, involving the community earlier in the process is  consistent with, and in the spirit of, EPA\u2019s policy stressing the importance  of early public involvement.", "Second, EPA stated that our report mistakenly implies a significant  deficiency in the financial assurance requirements for deep injection  wells and that this finding is inconsistent with a long history of success  of financial assurance provisions for Class I wells. We disagree that the  financial assurance requirements for deep injection wells have a long  history of success, and we believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest  a re-examination of these requirements. Our report describes instances  in which owners have failed to provide adequate financial resources  and demonstrates there is a potential burden to the taxpayer if financial  assurance requirements are not adequate. EPA further states that our  recommendation to review the financial assurance requirements  inappropriately relies on experiences from another program (RCRA).  We have clarified this section of our report to more clearly state that we  are in fact discussing financial assurance requirements for the RCRA  program. Nevertheless, we disagree that the lessons learned from the  RCRA financial assurance requirements are inapplicable to Class I  Hazardous deep injection wells. In the preamble to the final rule  promulgating the financial assurance requirements for Class I hazardous  deep injection wells, EPA stated that it had determined that most of the  RCRA financial assurance requirements should apply to Class I wells. EPA  noted that many wells have RCRA surface facilities that already must  comply with RCRA requirements and that wells are major facilities that  may require substantial resources to plug properly. We believe that this  reasoning still applies today, and that it is appropriate for EPA to consider  corresponding changes to the financial assurance requirements for Class I  hazardous deep injection wells. EPA further states that our discussion of  its financial assurance work group is misleading because the group is  examining an entirely different class of well. Our report acknowledges that  the EPA working group is examining the requirements for Class II oil and  gas wells, but we believe that certain aspects of those wells, such as a  standard method for calculating plugging and abandonment costs, may  also be applicable to Class I wells. We have clarified our recommendation  to state more directly that EPA should \u201cconsider\u201d the results and  recommendations from the working group for Class I wells.", "Finally, EPA stated that the report contains factual and technical errors  that it pointed out during the development of the report. We do not believe  this assertion is fair or accurate. In accordance with GAO\u2019s normal  practice, based on oral comments received during our exit conference  with EPA officials we incorporated changes into the draft report.

The  company initiated the process in 1990 by applying for two Class I deep  injection well construction permits. As of May 2003, EDS had not yet  started operating the wells due to a myriad of events that caused delays,  including relocating the well site, building a storage and treatment facility,  participating in several public hearings, and facing challenges to EPA\u2019s  permit decisions filed with EPA\u2019s Environmental Appeals Board and a  Title VI complaint filed with EPA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. EDS also needs a  RCRA operating permit from the state to begin hazardous waste  operations. EPA officials anticipate approving the no-migration petition in  mid-2003, and at that time Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental  Quality will consider the issuance of the RCRA operating license. The  following chronology details the significant events that occurred during  this lengthy process:    1990\u2014EDS applied to EPA for construction permits for two Class I deep  injection wells in Romulus, Michigan, which is located near the Detroit  Metropolitan Airport. City council members supported the wells\u2019  construction, adopted a resolution welcoming EDS and, under an  agreement with EDS, planned to receive around $1 million in royalties  from EDS once the wells began operating.    1991\u2014In August 1991, the Romulus City Council passed a resolution  rescinding its earlier welcoming resolution to EDS. After obtaining  relatively few public comments on the draft construction permits, EPA  issued a final construction permit in October.    1993\u2014EDS had almost completed the construction of one well when  significant public outcry developed because of the well\u2019s location within  the city. Concerned members of the community were represented by an  environmental group called Romulus Environmentalists Care About  People (RECAP). As a result of this concern, the city of Romulus filed a  lawsuit against EDS claiming that the wells were in an area that was not  properly zoned for business activity. The city of Romulus won a  preliminary injunction prohibiting any further activity by EDS and  staying any further court proceedings until the city had exhausted its  administrative remedies. Members of RECAP were elected to the  Romulus City Council. The well that was under construction has since  been plugged.    1995\u2014The local zoning board determined that the proposed well did  not fall within acceptable uses for the district in which it was to be  constructed. The board denied EDS\u2019s request for a variance.    1996\u2014The Wayne County Circuit Court affirmed both of the local zoning  board\u2019s decisions. The state of Michigan passed a law requiring that any  company accepting commercial hazardous waste for disposal in an  injection well have treatment and storage facilities on site that have been  permitted by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ).  Under the new law, EDS would need a storage and treatment facility  construction permit from Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental  Quality (MDEQ) if it planned to construct and operate wells in Michigan.  Also in 1996, because EDS was still interested in establishing its deep  injection well business, EDS purchased additional land in Romulus near  the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. In May, EDS applied to EPA for  construction permits for two injection wells.    1997\u2014EPA issued draft construction permits in August and accepted  public comments from September through October.    1998\u2014In March, after responding to a significant number of public  comments on the draft construction permits, EPA issued permits  for constructing the two wells. Members of the community raised  environmental justice concerns, and two citizens filed appeals with EPA\u2019s  Environmental Appeals Board raising a number of concerns about the  wells, including environmental justice concerns. The board denied review.    1999\u2014EDS submitted its permit application to the state for the planned  waste treatment and storage facilities for the wells. MDEQ officials found  the application technically complete and arranged to obtain public  comments on the draft permit. MDEQ referred the permit application to a  site review board---a 10-member board charged with investigating and  deliberating on the impact of the proposed facility on a local community.  The Site Review Board held numerous open meetings and public hearings,  receiving oral and written comments on many issues from local  community officials, the public, EDS, and MDEQ. In March 2000, the board  voted to recommend that the MDEQ deny the construction permit for  several reasons, including an increase in traffic volumes, and the lack of  need for the facility. The board did not find any fault with the technical  aspects of the facility\u2019s design or operation.    2000\u2014During the Site Review Board\u2019s deliberations, it was disclosed that  the proposed storage and treatment facilities and wells were located in a  protected wetlands area. EDS applied for a wetlands construction permit  during the site review board process. The permit was issued by the MDEQ  in June. The wetlands permit was challenged by the cities of Romulus and  Taylor in a contested case hearing with MDEQ that was subsequently  dropped.    2001\u2014After determining that the Site Review Board did not provide a  defensible basis for denial, the MDEQ issued a construction permit for the  treatment and storage facility associated with the injection wells. The  permit contained special conditions requiring EDS to mitigate the  legitimate concerns raised by the Site Review Board in its  recommendation for denial, including limiting the traffic volume and  adding an emergency access road. The cities of Romulus and Taylor and  Wayne County appealed the permit decision to the Wayne County Circuit  Court, arguing that the MDEQ should have followed the board\u2019s  recommendation, that the facility is not needed, and that the facility  should not be allowed in a wetland. The circuit court affirmed the MDEQ  decision. The case is currently under review by the Michigan Court of  Appeals, and as of May 2003 no decision has been issued.    2002\u2014A citizen filed a Title VI complaint with EPA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights  raising a number of issues, including the fact that the community was  disproportionately exposed to pollution and other environmental dangers.  EPA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights investigated the complaint but did not find any  violations of Title VI.    2003\u2014In January and April public hearings were held on the EDS no- migration petition.

To further understand the  process for addressing community concerns, we obtained and analyzed  information on how the process worked for individual wells that were  approved for operation and for two wells under construction in the state  of Michigan.

In  addition, we obtained and analyzed information on the number and status  of environmental justice appeals and Title VI complaints filed with the  agency, including those involving commercial Class I wells. We also  analyzed recent court decisions that impact the basis for determining  whether discrimination has occurred under Title VI.

Our report describes the opportunities  provided for public comment in Michigan, but it does not conclude  that additional opportunities should have been provided.
