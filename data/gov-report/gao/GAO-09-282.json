For example, most provisions assign liability to a particular entity regardless of fault--that is, commuter rail agencies could be responsible for paying for certain claims associated with accidents caused by a freight railroad. The provisions also vary on whether they exclude certain types of conduct, such as gross negligence, from the agreements. The provisions also require that commuter rail agencies carry varying levels of insurance. Because commuter rail agencies are publicly subsidized, some liability and indemnity provisions can expose taxpayers as well as commuter rail agencies to significant costs. Federal statutes, STB decisions, and federal court decisions are instructive in interpreting liability and indemnity provisions, but questions remain. In response to industry concerns, Congress enacted the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (ARAA), which limited overall damages from passenger claims to $200 million and explicitly authorized passenger rail providers to enter into indemnification agreements. However, questions remain about the enforceability and appropriateness of indemnifying an entity for its own gross negligence and willful misconduct. A federal court of appeals, in a recent decision regarding Amtrak, overturned an earlier court opinion, holding that it was against public policy to indemnify for gross negligence and willful misconduct because this could undermine rail safety. STB, however, has held, when setting the terms of agreements between Amtrak and freight railroads, that it is against public policy to indemnify an agency against its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Several factors influence the negotiations of liability and indemnity provisions, including the freight railroads' business perspective, the financial conditions at the time of negotiations, the level of awareness or concern about liability, and federal and state laws. For example, some freight railroad officials told us they are requesting more insurance coverage for new commuter rail projects than what they had required in some past agreements, in part, because ARAA's liability cap has not been tested in court and does not cover third-party claims. Statutes governing Amtrak also influence the negotiations between Amtrak and other railroads. Options for facilitating negotiations on liability and indemnity provisions include amending ARAA; exploring alternatives to traditional commercial insurance; providing commuter rail agencies with more leverage in negotiations; and separating passenger and freight traffic, either physically or by time of day. For example, officials from commuter rail agencies and freight railroads suggested amending ARAA to expand the scope of the liability cap to include third-party claims. Although each of these options could facilitate negotiations on liability and indemnity provisions, each option has advantages and disadvantages to consider."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Freight rail and passenger rail services are important to the nation\u2019s  mobility and economy. Freight railroads play a critical role in the  movement of freight throughout the United States, carrying over 40  percent of domestic intercity freight (as measured by ton-miles), including  bulk commodities; intermodal freight (e.g., containers and trailers); and  hazardous materials. Demand for freight rail service has increased over  the last 25 years and is expected to continue growing in the coming  decades. For example, according to Department of Transportation (DOT)  estimates, freight rail tonnage will increase to 3.5 billion tons, or by about  88 percent, from 2002 to 2035. As the demand for freight rail services  increases across the country, demand for passenger rail services, including  intercity passenger rail and commuter rail, is also growing. For example,  the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), the nation\u2019s  intercity passenger rail provider, has reported 6 consecutive years of  growth in ridership, with almost 29 million passengers in fiscal year 2008.  Similarly, commuter rail is an increasingly popular choice for communities  as they look to different forms of public transportation for relief from  highway congestion. Twenty-one commuter rail agencies now operate in  communities across the country, and 5 more commuter rail systems are  expected to initiate service within the next 5 years.", "Both Amtrak and commuter rail agencies often share rights-of-way with  each other and with freight railroads. Because Class I freight railroads  own the majority of existing railroad rights-of-way in the United States,  Amtrak and commuter rail agencies must often negotiate with freight  railroads to purchase, lease, or pay to access their rights-of-way.  Commuter rail agencies generally must also negotiate with Amtrak to use  Amtrak-owned rights-of-way. As we have previously reported, negotiating  agreements that govern the shared use of rights-of-way can be challenging,  especially on issues such as liability and indemnity. Although the  passenger rail and the freight rail industries maintain good safety records,  mixing passenger and freight trains on the same rights-of-way entails  certain risks, as the deadly September 2008 crash involving a Metrolink  commuter rail train and a freight train in Chatsworth, California,  illustrates. Consequently, as a condition for using their rights-of-way,  freight railroads seek certain liability protections from the costs and risks  associated with potential passenger rail accidents. For example, a freight  railroad might require that the commuter rail agency contractually  indemnify the railroad from any liability in the event of a passenger  accident and procure a certain level of insurance coverage to guarantee its  ability to pay the entire allocation of damages. Amtrak also sometimes  requires certain liability protections when hosting commuter rail  operations. Accepting such liability and indemnity terms can raise a  number of issues for the commuter rail agencies. As a result, contract  negotiations between commuter rail agencies and freight railroads can  stall or fail.", "Three federal agencies\u2014the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the  Surface Transportation Board (STB), and the Federal Transit  Administration (FTA)\u2014are responsible for different aspects of passenger  rail and freight rail services in the United States. In particular, FRA  administers and enforces the federal laws and related regulations that are  designed to promote safety on railroads, such as track maintenance,  inspection standards, equipment standards, and operating practices.  Freight railroads, Amtrak, and commuter rail agencies are subject to FRA  regulations. STB is responsible for the economic regulation of interstate  surface transportation, primarily freight railroads, within the United  States. STB has jurisdiction to resolve compensation and access issues  between freight railroads and Amtrak in the event of an impasse in  negotiations. In addition, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement  Act of 2008 authorizes STB to provide nonbinding mediation between  public transportation authorities, including commuter rail agencies, and  host carriers in the event of an impasse in negotiations regarding trackage  use. Unlike FRA and STB, FTA is not principally a regulatory agency.  Rather, FTA is the primary source of federal financing for locally planned,  implemented, and operated transit capital investments. As a form of public  transit, commuter rail projects are eligible for FTA funding.", "You asked us to undertake a comprehensive study of the liability and  indemnity provisions governing passenger and freight rail services. This  report addresses the following questions:    What are the characteristics of liability and indemnity provisions in  agreements among passenger and freight railroads, and what are the  resulting implications of those provisions?", "How have federal and state courts and STB interpreted the contractual  liability and indemnity provisions of passenger and freight railroad  agreements?", "What factors influence the negotiations of liability and indemnity  provisions among passenger and freight railroads?", "What are potential options for facilitating negotiations of liability and  indemnity provisions among passenger and freight railroads?", "To address these questions, we obtained information from all existing and  proposed commuter rail agencies and Class I freight railroads through site  visits or telephone interviews. Specifically, we conducted semistructured  interviews with officials from the 21 existing commuter rail agencies, 5  proposed commuter rail agencies, and the 7 Class I freight railroads. We  also visited 3 existing commuter rail agencies, 2 proposed commuter rail  agencies, and 2 Class I freight railroads. We used a variety of criteria to  select these entities for site visits, including the number of contracts each  freight railroad maintains, data on the ridership levels of existing  commuter rail agencies, and whether proposed commuter rail agencies  plan to purchase or lease freight-owned rights-of-way. We also obtained  and analyzed the liability and indemnity provisions in agreements between  commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and freight railroads. In some cases, a  commuter rail agency could have more than one agreement with Amtrak  or a freight railroad or could have agreements with multiple railroads if its  service extends onto tracks owned by more than one railroad. We also  interviewed Amtrak, FTA, and FRA officials; STB staff; as well as selected  state departments of transportation officials, representatives from a  variety of industry associations, and a law firm representative who has  served as a consultant to commuter rail agencies.

With two exceptions, liability and indemnity agreements between  commuter rail agencies and freight railroads are primarily no-fault  arrangements\u2014that is, responsibility for specific liability in any incident is  assigned to a particular entity, regardless of fault. For example, in a no- fault agreement, a commuter rail agency might indemnify a freight railroad  by assuming liability for commuter equipment damage and passenger  injury in a derailment, regardless of whether the freight railroad\u2019s  maintenance of the tracks could be blamed for a given incident. Similarly,  a freight railroad could indemnify a commuter rail agency by assuming  liability for freight rail equipment and track maintenance, even if the  commuter rail agency was solely responsible for causing an accident. In  contrast, a fault-based agreement assigns responsibility for an incident to  the party that caused the incident. Of the 33 commuter rail agency and  freight railroad agreements we reviewed, 21 were no fault, 10 contained a  combination of no-fault and fault provisions, and 2 were premised on a  fault-based allocation of risk.", "Although most of the agreements between commuter rail agencies  freight railroads are no-fault arrangements, the liability and indemnity  provisions vary regarding the type of conduct allowed. For example, 9  of  the 31 agreements with all or some no-fault provisions explicitly exclude  certain types of conduct from the no-fault arrangement. conduct is any type of conduct specifically identified in the agreement as  conduct beyond simple negligence and can be defined in a number of  ways, including willful and wanton misconduct, gross negligence, or  conduct that might result in punitive damages.

Another 10 of  the 31 agreements with all or some no-fault provisions, in contrast,  explicitly include conduct that exceeds simple negligence as covered under the no-fault provisions.

The required level of insurance in existing  commuter rail agency and freight railroad agreements ranges from $ 75  million to $500 million. Agreements vary on the exact requirements for  insurance, such as what level of liability can be absorbed by the comm rail agency\u2014referred to as a self-insured retention\u2014before the railroa must use commercial insurance. For example, some agreements that we  analyzed set the level at which the commuter rail agency must purchase  insurance for risk at above $5 million, while other agreements set the leve at $1 million.

Regarding excluded conduct, 8 of the 17 agreements explicitly exclude  certain conduct; the remaining agreements are silent concerning whether  any conduct is excluded.

Officials in Florida, for example, said a fault-based agreement would be  ecause of the costs of  much more expensive than a no-fault agreement b investigating accidents. These officials said that a no-fault agreement was  the best way to compensate litigants quickly. Furthermore, officials at a  freight railroad said that an accident can have multiple causes and an  investigation may not settle which party was at fault; therefore, a fault- based approach can result in disputes between commuter rail agencies  and freight railroads over which party is responsible for paying for claim These officials also said that contrary to some views, passenger and frei railroads have strong incentives to operate safely, even if they may not be  liable for some accidents that they cause.

From the freight railroads\u2019 perspective, commuter  rail agencies\u2019 compensation offers for the use of freight-owned rights-of- way are often inadequate, and when they are not compensated for all of  the costs incurred from hosting a commuter rail train, the result is that the  fr eight railroads subsidize the commuter rail service.

First, clarifying that the statute  applies to commuter rail agencies would eliminate the uncertainty about its applicability in the absence of a court decision. In addition, such a  clarification, along with the inclusion of nonpassenger claims in the  liability cap, could lower costs for commuter rail agencies by limiting the  amount of insurance that freight railroads require commuter rail agenciesto carry. For example, officials from one commuter rail agency stated thato make it clear that it applied to commuter rail  gencies and covered nonpassenger claims, freight railroads would be less  if ARAA were amended t a likely to seek insurance beyond the $200 million liability cap to cover  claims to which the cap does not apply.

Officials from freight railroads also stated  that a clear federal cap on liability for commuter rail agencies could  eliminate the need to adapt to various state laws that can affect liability and indemnity negotiations.

Officials from one freight railroad  stated that ARAA already applies to commuter rail agencies and limits the  amount of liability insurance commuter rail agencies are required to  obtain to $200 million. According to these officials, although there is some  lack of clarity about the statute\u2019s applicability to commuter rail agencies  and the statute does not cover all types of claims, these issues can be  addressed by requiring the commuter rail agency to obtain comprehensive  insurance coverage or through other provisions in the agreements. For  example, adequate insurance coverage can mitigate the issues that may  arise from various and conflicting state laws by providing protection for  various kinds of liabi lities. Similarly, although ARAA does not cover  liability claims resulting from a hazardous materials spill, an agreement  can be structured in such a way that these claims are covered. According  to these freight railroad officials, the provisions in ARAA provide adequate protections for negotiating railroad liability and indemnity provisions.  Furthermore, these officials told us it may be difficult to make some  changes to the statute without opening up its entire liability section to  reexamination. Finally, some commuter rail agency officials stated that  amending ARAA could cause them to have less favorable liability  provisions than they currently enjoy. For example, officials from several  commuter rail agencies told us that they carry less insurance than the $2 million cap. According to officials from one commuter rail agency,  amending ARAA to clarify that the $200 million liability cap applies to all  commuter rail agencies could result in higher levels of insurance and  increased costs for this commuter rail agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commuter Rail Agency, Amtrak, and Freight Railroad Officials Identified Alternatives to Traditional Commercial Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Commuter rail agency, Amtrak, and freight railroad officials and  representatives from the insurance industry identified the following three  alternatives to traditional commercial insurance options that could  increase the availability and affordability of liability insurance coverage:  Insurance pool.

This company may be either a single-parent  captive, which is owned by a single entity that insures the risks of its  parent company, or a group captive, which is owned by multiple entities  and the owners are also the policyholders. Usually, the owners of a group  captive are fairly homogenous and have similar risks, such as a group of  commuter rail agencies, although this is not a requirement of a captive. A  captive would allow a commuter rail agency or a group of commuter rail  agencies to self-insure for liability or provide liability insurance for its  members outside of the traditional commercial insurance market.", "Risk retention group. Similar businesses with similar risk exposures  create their own liability insurance company to self-insure their risks as a  group. Risk retention groups were established through the Product  Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981, as amended by the Liability Risk  Retention Act of 1986, which partially preempts state insurance laws by  allowing risk retention groups to operate in states in which they are not  domiciled. Commuter rail agencies, therefore, could form a risk retentio group without having to consider the various state laws that could affect  their liability negotiations with freight railroads.", "Commuter rail agencies\u2019 insurance coverage is usually structured in layers of $25 m illion  beyond the self-insured retention, up to the total amount of insurance coverage (e.g., $200  million).

First, some commuter rail agency officials  stated that their commuter operations were already very safe; therefore, they would not benefit from an insurance pool with other commuter rail agencies. Similarly, according to an insurance broker, larger commuter rail  agencies, or those with a better risk profile, may not join a pool or might  leave the pool if they could obtain cheaper insurance coverage on the  commercial insurance market. Their decision not to participate in the poo would lead to adverse selection, with only smaller or riskier commuter rail agencies remaining in the pool, which could reduce some of the  advantages that a pool would provide. Second, some commuter rail agenc officials stated that they have not had problems obtaining insurance  because of the soft, or competitive, insurance market. According to an  insurance broker, pooling insurance during a soft market is likely more  expensive than obtaining individual commercial insurance policies  because of the administrative and capital costs of maintaining an  insurance captive or risk retention group. In addition, some commuter rail  agency officials stated that insurance pools can be difficult to administer  and require decisions about who will participate, whether participation  will be voluntary or mandatory, and what should be done if claims exceed  y  the pool\u2019s reserves. However, if the insurance market became less  competitive, pooling might provide a more affordable option, particularly  for new or smaller commuter rail agencies that could have difficulty  obtaining coverage.l  For example, Florida set up an insurance poo because of a severe shortage of catastrophe property reinsurance capacity,  stricter policy terms and conditions, and sharp increases in property  catastrophe cover rates following Hurricane Andrew. Finally, one  commuter rail agency official stated that it could be difficult for  participating agencies to reenter the commercial insurance market if, for  example, an insurance pool falls apart because it is undercapitalized\u2014that  is, there is a risk for commuter rail agencies in ending their current  insurance policies to join a pool. Amtrak officials also stated that these  pooled insurance options are unlikely to be viable without federal  financial backing or verifiable commercial reinsurance.

Commuter rail agency and  freight railroad officials most frequently identified the Price-Anderso as a model for providing railroad liability insurance. Under this m odel,  commuter rail agencies would obtain primary insurance up to a certain  amount and could pool their assets to obtain secondary insurance  coverage for incidents with claims that exceed the primary insurance  amount. The federal government could also be called upon to provide  additional funding if an incident\u2019s claims exceeded both the primary and  secondary insurance coverage. Officials from one freight railroad stated  that a Price-Anderson type of insurance program could address current  n Act  limitations in the railroad insurance market because the act contem appropriations if additional funding is needed, among other benefits.
