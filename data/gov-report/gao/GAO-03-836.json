States have revised tort laws under which malpractice lawsuits are litigated to help constrain malpractice premium and claims costs. Some of these tort reform laws include caps on monetary penalties for noneconomic harm, such as for plaintiffs' pain and suffering. Congress is considering legislation similar to some states' tort reform laws. GAO examined how health care provider responses to rising malpractice premiums have affected access to health care, whether physicians practice defensive medicine, and how growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments compares across states with varying tort reform laws. Because national data on providers' responses to rising premiums are not reliable, GAO examined the experiences in five states with reported malpractice-related problems (Florida, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and West Virginia) and four states without reported problems (California, Colorado, Minnesota, and Montana) and analyzed growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments across all states and the District of Columbia."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Actions taken by health care providers in response to rising malpractice premiums have contributed to localized health care access problems in the five states reviewed with reported problems. GAO confirmed instances in the five states of reduced access to hospital-based services affecting emergency surgery and newborn deliveries in scattered, often rural, areas where providers identified other long-standing factors that also affect the availability of services. Instances were not identified in the four states without reported problems. In the five states with reported problems, however, GAO also determined that many of the reported provider actions were not substantiated or did not affect access to health care on a widespread basis. For example, although some physicians reported reducing certain services they consider to be high risk in terms of potential litigation, such as spinal surgeries and mammograms, GAO did not find access to these services widely affected, based on a review of Medicare data and contacts with providers that have reportedly been affected. Continuing to monitor the effect of providers' responses to rising malpractice premiums on access to care will be essential, given the import and evolving nature of this issue. Physicians reportedly practice defensive medicine in certain clinical situations, thereby contributing to health care costs; however, the overall prevalence and costs of such practices have not been reliably measured. Studies designed to measure physicians' defensive medicine practices examined physician behavior in specific clinical situations, such as treating elderly Medicare patients with certain heart conditions. Given their limited scope, the study results cannot be generalized to estimate the extent and cost of defensive medicine practices across the health care system. Limited available data indicate that growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments has been slower in states that enacted tort reform laws that include certain caps on noneconomic damages. For example, between 2001 and 2002, average premiums for three physician specialties--general surgery, internal medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology--grew by about 10 percent in states with caps on noneconomic damages of $250,000, compared to about 29 percent in states with limited reforms. GAO could not determine the extent to which differences in premiums and claims payments across states were caused by tort reform laws or other factors that influence such differences. In commenting on a draft of this report, three independent reviewers with expertise on malpractice-related issues generally concurred with the report findings, while the American Medical Association (AMA) commented that the scope of work was not sufficient to support the finding that rising malpractice premiums have not contributed to widespread health care access problems. While GAO disagrees with AMA's point of view, the report was revised to better clarify the methods and scope of work for this issue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medical malpractice insurance premium rates increased rapidly in some  states beginning in the late 1990s after several years of relative stability,  similar to previous cycles of rising premiums that occurred during the  1970s and 1980s. Between 2001 and 2002, premium rates for the specialties  of general surgery, internal medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN)  increased by about 15 percent on average nationally, and over 100 percent  for certain of these specialists in some states. In response to these rising  premiums, representatives of health care providers\u2014including physicians,  hospitals, and nursing homes\u2014and the media have reported that  physicians have moved out of states experiencing the highest increases,  retired, or reduced or eliminated certain high-risk services. Policymakers  are concerned that, if these provider actions are occurring, they may limit  consumers\u2019 access to health care. Additionally, fear of malpractice  litigation may encourage physicians to practice \u201cdefensive medicine,\u201d for  example, ordering additional tests or procedures, thus increasing total  health care costs. In an effort to mitigate rising malpractice costs, states  have passed various tort reform laws, some of which include caps to  restrict the size of damage award payments and other measures to limit  costs associated with malpractice litigation, and Congress is considering  similar federal legislation.", "Because of your concerns about rising malpractice insurance premiums  and associated implications for the health care system, we agreed to  examine the following questions:  1.  How have health care provider responses to rising malpractice  insurance premiums affected consumers\u2019 access to health care?  2.  What is known about how rising premiums and fear of litigation cause  health care providers to practice defensive medicine?  3.  How does the growth in medical malpractice insurance premiums and  insurer payments for malpractice claims compare in states with  varying levels of tort reform laws?", "GAO also recently issued a related report that more fully describes the  extent of malpractice insurance premium growth and the factors that  contributed to that growth. Its findings are summarized on pages 9  through 11 of this report.", "To evaluate how actions taken by health care providers in response to  malpractice premium increases have affected consumers\u2019 access to health  care, we interviewed providers and their representatives, including the  American Medical Association (AMA), the American Health Care  Association, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and many of their  state-level counterparts. (See app. I for the complete list of national and  state associations we contacted during the course of our work.) In the  absence of reliable national sources of data concerning provider responses  to rising malpractice premiums, we focused our review on nine states  selected to encompass a range of malpractice premium pricing and tort  reform environments. Five of these states were among those cited by AMA  and other national health care provider organizations as malpractice  \u201ccrisis\u201d or \u201cproblem\u201d states based on such factors as higher than average  increases in malpractice insurance premium rates, physicians\u2019 reported  difficulties obtaining malpractice insurance coverage, and reports of  actions taken by providers in response to the malpractice-related  pressures of rising premiums and litigation. The remaining four states  were not cited by provider groups as experiencing malpractice-related  problems. In the five states with reported problems, provider  organizations reported through surveys and anecdotal reports several  actions taken by physicians in response to rising malpractice premiums.  Although we did not attempt to confirm each report cited by state provider  groups, we targeted follow-up contacts with local providers where the  reports suggested potentially acute consumer access problems or where  multiple reports were concentrated in a geographic area. In these five  states, we contacted 49 hospitals and 61 physician practices or clinics to  corroborate the reports and explore the implications for consumers\u2019  access to health care. We also analyzed Medicare part B physician claims  data from 1997 through 2002 to assess whether utilization of certain  services deemed to be of higher risk for a malpractice claim, such as spinal  surgery and mammograms, has declined for the Medicare-covered  population. Because of limitations in the Medicare data that precluded its  use in analyzing utilization of certain other physician services such as  hospital emergency and obstetrical care, we relied exclusively on the  reports of access problems provided by state provider associations and  our follow-up with local providers to assess access to these services.", "To determine what is known about the extent of defensive medicine  practices, we reviewed available empirical studies, including those  examining the costs of defensive medicine and the potential impact of tort  reform laws on mitigating these costs. We also explored the issue with  medical provider organizations and examined the results of recent surveys  in which physicians were asked about their own defensive medicine  practices.", "To assess premium growth, we analyzed malpractice premium rates  reported by insurers to the Medical Liability Monitor (MLM) for the  specialties of general surgery, internal medicine, and OB/GYN\u2014the only  three specialties for which these data are reported\u2014across all states and  the District of Columbia from 1996 through 2002. To assess growth in  malpractice claims payments, we analyzed state-level data on claims paid  on behalf of all physicians reported by insurers to the National  Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) from 1996 through 2002 for all states and  the District of Columbia. We compared trends in 12 states with tort  reforms that include caps on noneconomic damages, such as for plaintiffs\u2019  pain and suffering (4 states with a $250,000 cap and 8 states with a  $500,000 or less cap) to 11 states (including the District of Columbia) with  more limited tort reforms and to the average for all states. We focused our  analysis on those states with noneconomic damage caps as a key tort  reform because such caps are included in proposed federal tort reform  legislation and because published research generally reports that such  caps have a greater impact on medical malpractice premium rates and  claims payments than some other tort reform measures. We also reviewed  available empirical studies that examined the relationship between tort  reforms and malpractice insurance premiums and claims payments.", "We conducted our work from September 2002 through June 2003  according to generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix  II provides more details about our scope and methodology, and a list of  related GAO products is included at the end of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, patients injured while receiving health care can sue  health care providers for medical malpractice under governing state tort  law, usually the law of the state where the injury took place. Laws  governing medical malpractice vary from state to state, but among the  goals of tort law are compensation for the victim and deterrence of  malpractice.", "Nearly all health care providers buy medical malpractice insurance to  protect themselves from potential claims that could cause financial harm  or even bankruptcy absent liability coverage. For example, the average  reported claims payment made on behalf of physicians and other licensed  health care practitioners in 2001 was about $300,000 for all settlements,  and about $500,000 for trial verdicts. Under a malpractice insurance  contract, the insurer agrees to investigate claims, to provide legal  representation for the health care provider, and to accept financial  responsibility for payment of any claims up to a specified monetary level  during an established time period. The most common policies sold by  insurers provide $1 million of coverage per incident and $3 million of total  coverage per year. The insurer provides this coverage in return for a fee\u2014 the medical malpractice premium.", "Medical malpractice premium rates differ widely by medical specialty and  geography. Premiums paid by traditionally high-risk specialties, such as  obstetrics, are usually higher than premiums paid by other specialties,  such as internal medicine. Premium rates also vary across and within  states. Across states, for example, a large insurer in Minnesota charged  base premium rates of $3,803 for the specialty of internal medicine,  $10,142 for general surgery, and $17,431 for OB/GYN in 2002 across the  entire state. In contrast, a large insurer in Florida charged base premium  rates in Dade County of $56,153 for internal medicine, $174,268 for general  surgery, and $201,376 for OB/GYN, and $34,556, $107,242, and $123,924,  respectively, for these same specialties in Palm Beach County. In addition  to the wide range in premium rates charged, the extent to which premiums  increase over time also varies by specialty and geographic area. Beginning  in the late 1990s, malpractice premiums began to increase at a rapid rate  for most, but not all, physicians in some states. For example, between 1999  and 2002, the Minnesota insurer increased its base premium rates by about  2 percent for each of the three specialties, in contrast to the Florida  insurer that increased its base premium rates by about 98, 75, and 43  percent, respectively, for the three specialties in Dade County."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rising Claims Costs Among Factors Contributing to Malpractice Insurance Premium Increases", "paragraphs": ["Since 1999, medical malpractice premium rates for certain physicians in  some states have increased dramatically. In a related report issued in   June 2003, we examined the extent and causes of these recent increases.  More specifically, we reported on (1) the extent of increases in medical  malpractice insurance rates in seven states, (2) factors that have  contributed to the increases, and (3) changes in the medical malpractice  insurance market that may make the current period of rising premium  rates different from earlier periods of rate hikes. Key findings from that  report include the following.", "Among the seven states we analyzed, the extent of medical malpractice  premium increases varied greatly not only from state to state but across  medical specialties. For example, among the largest writers of medical  malpractice insurance in the seven states, increases in base premium rates  for general surgeons from 1999 to 2002 ranged from 2 percent in  Minnesota to 130 percent in and around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Across  specialties, one carrier raised premiums for the area in and around El  Paso, Texas, during this period by 95 percent for general surgery, 108  percent for internal medicine, and 60 percent for OB/GYN.", "Multiple factors have contributed to the recent increases in medical  malpractice premium rates. First, since 1998, the greatest contributor to  increased premium rates in the seven states we analyzed appeared to be  increased losses for insurers on paid medical malpractice claims.  However, a lack of comprehensive data at the national and state levels on  insurers\u2019 medical malpractice claims and the associated losses prevented  us from fully analyzing the composition and causes of those losses.  Second, from 1998 through 2001, medical malpractice insurers  experienced decreases in their investment income as interest rates fell on  the bonds that generally make up around 80 percent of these insurers\u2019  investment portfolios. While almost no medical malpractice insurers  experienced net losses on their investment portfolios over this period, a  decrease in investment income meant that income from insurance  premiums had to cover a larger share of insurers\u2019 costs. Third, during the  1990s, insurers competed vigorously for medical malpractice business, and  several factors, including high investment returns, permitted them to offer  prices that, in hindsight for some insurers, did not completely cover their  ultimate losses on that business. As a result of this, some companies  became insolvent or voluntarily left the market, reducing the downward  competitive pressure on premium rates that had existed through the 1990s.  Fourth, beginning in 2001, reinsurance rates for medical malpractice  insurers also increased more rapidly than they had in the past, raising  insurers\u2019 overall costs.", "While the medical malpractice insurance market as a whole had  experienced periods of rapidly increasing premium rates in the mid-1970s  and mid-1980s, the market has changed considerably since then. These  changes are largely the result of actions insurers, health care providers,  and states have taken to address increasing premium rates. Beginning in  the 1970s and 1980s, insurers began selling \u201cclaims-made\u201d rather than  \u201coccurrence-based\u201d policies, enabling insurers to better predict losses for  a particular year. Also in the 1970s, physicians, facing increasing  premium rates and the departure of some insurers, began to form mutual  nonprofit insurance companies. Such companies, which may have some  cost and other advantages over commercial insurers, now make up a  significant portion of the medical malpractice insurance market. More  recently, an increasing number of large hospitals and groups of hospitals  or physicians have left the traditional commercial insurance market and  sought alternative arrangements, for example, by self-insuring. While such  arrangements can save money on administrative costs, hospitals and  physicians insured through these arrangements assume greater financial  responsibility for malpractice claims than they would under traditional  insurance arrangements and thus may face a greater risk of insolvency.  Finally, since the periods of increasing premium rates during the mid- 1970s and mid-1980s, all states have passed at least some laws designed to  reduce medical malpractice premium rates. Some of these laws are  designed to decrease insurers\u2019 losses on medical malpractice claims, while  others are designed to more tightly control the premium rates insurers can  charge. These market changes, in combination, make it difficult to predict  how medical malpractice premiums might behave in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Use Tort Reform to Help Contain Costs Associated with Medical Malpractice", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the affordability and availability of malpractice  insurance and to reduce liability pressure on providers, states have  adopted varying types of tort reform legislation. Tort reforms are  generally intended to limit the number of malpractice claims or the size of  payments in an effort to reduce malpractice costs and insurance  premiums. Also, some believe tort reforms can lower overall health care  costs by reducing certain defensive medicine practices. Such practices  include the overutilization by physicians of certain diagnostic tests or  procedures primarily to reduce their exposure to malpractice liability,  therefore adding to the costs of health care. State tort reform measures  adopted during the past three decades include    placing caps on the amount that may be awarded to plaintiffs for damages  in a malpractice lawsuit, including noneconomic, economic, and punitive  damages;    abolishing the \u201ccollateral source rule\u201d that prevents a defendant from  introducing evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s losses and expenses have been  paid in part by other parties such as health insurers, or damage awards  from being reduced by the amount of any compensation plaintiffs receive  from third parties;    abolishing \u201cjoint and several liability\u201d to ensure that damages are  recovered from defendants in proportion to each defendant\u2019s degree of  responsibility, not each defendant\u2019s ability to pay;    allowing damages to be paid in periodic installments rather than in a lump    placing limits on fees charged by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers;  imposing stricter statutes of limitations that shorten the time injured  parties have to file a claim in court;    establishing pretrial screening panels to evaluate the merits of claims  before proceeding to trial; and    providing for greater use of alternative dispute resolution systems, such as  arbitration panels.", "Among the tort reform measures enacted by states, caps on noneconomic  damage awards that include pain and suffering have been the focus of  particular interest. Cap proponents believe that such limits can result in  several benefits that help reduce malpractice insurance premiums, such as  helping to prevent excessive awards and overcompensation and ensuring  more consistency among jury verdicts. In contrast, cap opponents believe  that factors other than award amounts affect premiums charged by  malpractice insurers and that caps can result in undercompensation for  severely injured persons.", "Congress is currently considering federal tort reform legislation that  includes several elements adopted by states to varying degrees, including  placing caps on noneconomic and punitive damages, allowing evidence at  the trial of a plaintiff\u2019s recovery from collateral sources, abolishing joint  and several liability, and placing a limit on contingency fees, among  others."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implications of Rising Malpractice Premiums on Access to Health Care", "paragraphs": ["Actions taken by health care providers in response to rising malpractice  premiums have contributed to reduced access to specific services on a  localized basis in the five states reviewed with reported problems.

However, we also determined that many of the reported  physician actions and hospital-based service reductions were not  substantiated or did not widely affect access to health care. For example,  our analysis of Medicare utilization data suggests that reported reductions  in certain high-risk services, such as some orthopedic surgeries and  mammograms, have not widely affected consumer access to these  services. To help avoid consumer access problems, some hospitals we  contacted have taken certain steps, such as assuming the costs of  physicians\u2019 liability insurance, to enable physicians to continue practicing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Care Provider Actions Taken in Response to Malpractice Pressures Have Limited Access to Certain Services in Some Localities", "paragraphs": ["We confirmed examples in each of the five states where access to services  affecting emergency surgery and newborn deliveries has been reduced.

The problems we confirmed were limited to  scattered, often rural, locations and in most cases providers identified  long-standing factors in addition to malpractice pressures that affected the  availability of services.", "Florida: Among several potential access problems we reviewed in Florida,  the most significant appeared to be the reduction in ER on-call surgical  coverage in Jacksonville. We confirmed that at least 19 general surgeons  who serve the city\u2019s hospitals took leaves of absence beginning in May  2003 when state legislation capping noneconomic damages for malpractice  cases at $250,000 was not passed. According to one hospital  representative, the loss of these surgeons reduced the general surgical  capacity of Jacksonville\u2019s acute care community hospitals by one-third.  The administrator of the practice that employs these surgeons told us that  at least 8 are seeking employment in other states to avoid the high  malpractice premiums in Florida. Hospital officials in Jacksonville told us  that other providers, including some orthopedic surgeons and  cardiovascular surgeons, had also taken leave as of May 2003 due in part  to the risks associated with practicing without surgeons available in the  ER for support in the event of complications. According to one  Jacksonville area hospital official, her hospital has lost the services of 75  physicians in total due to leaves of absence taken by the physicians.  Hospital and local health department officials said that the losses of  surgeons have caused a reduction in ER on-call surgical coverage at most  acute care hospitals in the city; the health department official said patients  requiring urgent surgical care presenting at an ER that does not have  adequate capacity must be transferred to the nearest hospital that does,  which could be up to 30 miles away. Within the first 11 days after most of  the physicians took leave, 120 transfers took place. Although the hospital  officials we interviewed expected that some of the physicians would  eventually return to work, they believe timing may depend on passage of  malpractice reform legislation during a special legislative session expected  to take place this summer.", "Mississippi: Reductions in ER on-call surgical coverage and newborn  delivery services have created access problems in certain areas of  Mississippi. We confirmed that some surgeons along the Gulf Coast who  formerly provided on-call services at multiple hospitals are restricting  their coverage to a single ER and others are eliminating coverage entirely  in an effort to minimize their malpractice premiums and exposure to  litigation. Officials of two of five hospitals we spoke with in the three Gulf  Coast counties told us they have either completely lost or experienced  reduced ER on-call surgical coverage for certain services. These  reductions in coverage may require that patients be transferred greater  distances for services. Some family practitioners and OB/GYNs have  stopped providing newborn delivery services, creating access problems in  certain rural communities. An official from one hospital in a largely rural  county in central Mississippi told us that it closed its obstetrics unit after  five family practitioners who attended deliveries stopped providing  newborn delivery services in order to avoid a more than 65 percent  increase in their annual premium rates. Pregnant women in the area now  must travel about 65 miles to the nearest obstetrics ward to deliver. Loss  of obstetrics providers in other largely rural areas may require pregnant  women in these areas to travel farther for deliveries. A provider  association official told us that malpractice pressures have worsened long- standing difficulties associated with recruiting physicians to the state, and  providers also said that low Medicaid reimbursement rates and insufficient  reimbursement for trauma services also influence physician practice  decisions.", "Nevada: Reductions in ER on-call surgical coverage have created access  problems in Clark County. To draw attention to their concerns about  rising medical malpractice premiums, over 60 orthopedic surgeons in the  county withdrew their contracts with the University of Nevada Medical  Center, causing the state\u2019s only Level I trauma center to close for 11 days  in July 2002. The center reopened after a special arrangement was made  for surgeons to temporarily obtain malpractice coverage through the  Medical Center and the governor announced his support for state tort  reform, prompting the return of approximately 15 of the surgeons,  according to medical center staff. Another hospital in the county has  closed its orthopedics ward and no longer provides orthopedic surgical  coverage in its ER as orthopedic surgeons have sought to reduce their  malpractice exposure by decreasing the number of hospitals in which they  provide ER coverage, according to a hospital official. Clark County has  had long-standing problems with ER staffing due in part to its rapidly  growing population, according to providers.", "Pennsylvania: Some areas in Pennsylvania have experienced reductions  in access to emergency surgical services and newborn delivery services.  For example, one rural hospital recently lost three of its five orthopedic  surgeons. As a result, orthopedic on-call coverage in its ER has declined  from full-time to only one-third of each month. At the same hospital,  providers reported that four of the nine OB/GYNs who provide obstetrical  care in two counties stopped providing newborn delivery services because  their malpractice premiums became unaffordable and another left the  state to avoid high premiums. Some pregnant women now travel an  additional 35 to 50 miles to deliver. According to a hospital official, the  remaining four OB/GYNs were each in their sixties and near retirement.  This hospital reported that the loss of the physicians was largely due to the  rising cost of malpractice insurance, but also identified the hospital\u2019s rural  location, and the area\u2019s large Medicaid population and low Medicaid  reimbursement rates as factors contributing to the physicians\u2019 decisions to  leave. Trauma services in Pennsylvania have also been affected in some  localities. For example, a suburban Philadelphia trauma center closed for  13 days beginning in December 2002 because its orthopedic surgeons and  neurosurgeons reported they could not afford to renew their malpractice  insurance. The situation was resolved when a new insurance company  offered more affordable coverage to the surgeons and the governor  introduced a plan to reduce physician payments to the state medical  liability fund, according to a hospital official.", "West Virginia: Access problems due to malpractice concerns in West  Virginia involved ER specialty surgical services. One of the state\u2019s major  medical centers lost its Level I trauma designation for approximately 1  month in the early fall of 2002 due to reductions in the number of  orthopedic surgeons providing on-call coverage. During this time, patients  who previously would have been treated at this facility had to be  transferred to other facilities at least 50 miles away. The hospital\u2019s Level I  designation was restored when additional physicians agreed to provide on- call coverage after the state extended state-sponsored liability insurance  coverage to physicians who provide a significant percentage of their  services in a trauma setting. The state\u2019s northern panhandle lost all  neurosurgical services for about 2 years when three neurosurgeons who  served the area either left or stopped providing these services in response  to malpractice pressures, requiring that all patients needing neurosurgical  care be transferred 60 miles or more, limiting patients\u2019 access to urgent  neurosurgical care. Full-time neurosurgical coverage was restored to the  area in early 2003 through an agreement with a group of neurosurgeons at  one of the state\u2019s major academic medical centers. A hospital official from  this area reported that efforts to recruit a permanent full-time  neurosurgeon have been unsuccessful. Provider groups told us that  malpractice concerns have made efforts to recruit and retain physicians  more difficult; however, they also identified the rural location, low  Medicaid reimbursement rates, and the state\u2019s provider tax on physicians  as factors that have made it difficult to attract and retain physicians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Reported Provider Actions Were Not Substantiated or Did Not Widely Affect Access to Health Care", "paragraphs": ["Despite some confirmed reductions in ER on-call surgical coverage and  newborn delivery services that were related to physicians\u2019 concerns about  malpractice pressures and affected access to health care, we also  identified reports of provider actions taken in response to malpractice  pressures\u2014such as reported physician departures and hospital unit  closures\u2014that were not substantiated or that did not widely affect access  to health care. Our contacts with 49 hospitals revealed that although 26  confirmed a reduction in surgeons available to provide on-call coverage  for the ER, 11 of these reported that the decreases had not prevented them  from maintaining the full range of ER services and 3 reported that the  surgeons had returned or replacements had been found. Hospital  association representatives reported that access to newborn delivery  services in Florida had been reduced due to the closures of five hospital  obstetrics units. However, we contacted each of these hospitals and  determined that these units were located in five separate urban counties,  and each hospital reported that demand for its now closed obstetrics  facility had been low and that nearby facilities provided obstetrics  services. In West Virginia, although access problems reportedly  developed because two hospital obstetrics units closed due to malpractice  pressures, officials at both of these hospitals told us that a variety of  factors, including low service volume and physician departures unrelated  to malpractice, contributed to the decisions to close these units. One of  the hospitals has recently reopened its obstetrics unit.", "Provider groups also asserted that some physicians in each of the five  states are moving, retiring, or closing practices in response to malpractice  pressures. In the absence of national data reporting physician movement  among states related to malpractice concerns, we relied on state-level  assertions of departures that were based on a variety of sources, including  survey results, information compiled and quantified by provider groups,  and unquantified anecdotal reports. (See table 1.)", "Although some reports have received extensive media coverage, in each of  the five states we found that actual numbers of physician departures were  sometimes inaccurate or involved relatively few physicians.", "Reports of physician departures in Florida were anecdotal, not extensive,  and in some cases we determined them to be inaccurate. For example,  state medical society officials told us that Collier and Lee counties lost all  of their neurosurgeons due to malpractice concerns; however, we found at  least five neurosurgeons currently practicing in each county as of April  2003. Provider groups also reported that malpractice pressures have  recently made it difficult for Florida to recruit or retain physicians of any  type; however, over the past 2 years the number of new medical licenses  issued has increased and physicians per capita has remained unchanged.  In Mississippi, the reported physician departures attributed to recent  malpractice pressures were scattered throughout the state and  represented 1 percent of all physicians licensed in the state. Moreover, the  number of physicians per capita has remained essentially unchanged since  1997.  In Nevada, 34 OB/GYNs reported leaving, closing practices, or retiring due  to malpractice concerns; however, confirmatory surveys conducted by the  Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners found nearly one-third of these  reports were inaccurate\u20148 were still practicing and 3 stopped practicing  due to reasons other than malpractice. Random calls we made to 30  OB/GYN practices in Clark County found that 28 were accepting new  patients with wait-times for an appointment of 3 weeks or less. Similarly,  of the 11 surgeons reported to have moved or discontinued practicing, the  board found 4 were still practicing.  In Pennsylvania, despite reports of physician departures, the number of  physicians per capita in the state has increased slightly during the past 6  years. The Pennsylvania Medical Society reported that between 2002 and  2003, 24 OB/GYNs left the state due to malpractice concerns; however, the  state\u2019s population of women age 18 to 40 fell by 18,000 during the same  time period. Departures of orthopedic surgeons comprise the largest single  reported loss of specialists in Pennsylvania. Despite these reported  departures, the rate of orthopedic surgeries among Medicare enrollees in  Pennsylvania has increased steadily for the last 5 years, as it has  nationally. (See fig. 1.)", "In West Virginia, provider groups did not provide us with specific numbers  of physician departures, but did offer anecdotal reports of physicians who  have moved out of state or left practice.

Evidence was based on surveys conducted by state and national medical  and specialty provider groups and anecdotal reports by state provider  groups, generally between 2001 and 2002. The most frequently cited  service reductions included spinal surgeries and joint revisions and repairs  (all five states), mammograms (Florida and Pennsylvania), and physician  services in a nursing home setting (Florida and Mississippi).", "Survey data used to identify service cutbacks in response to physician  concerns about malpractice pressures are not likely representative of the  actions taken by all physicians. Most surveys had low response rates\u2014 typically 20 percent or less.

First, the manner in which damage caps are administered can influence  the ability of the cap to restrain claims and thus premium costs. Some  states permit injured parties to collect damages only up to the specified  level of the cap regardless of the number of defendants, while other states  permit injured parties to collect the full cap amount from each defendant  named in a suit. Malpractice insurers told us that imposing a separate cap  on amounts recovered from each of several defendants increases total  claims payouts, which can hinder the effectiveness of the cap in  constraining premium growth. Second, tort reforms unrelated to caps can  also affect premium and claims costs. For example, California tort reform  measures not only include a $250,000 cap but also allow other collateral  sources to be considered when determining how much an insurer must  pay in damages and allow periodic payment of damages rather than  requiring payment in a lump sum, among other measures. Malpractice  insurers told us that these provisions in addition to the cap have helped to  constrain premium growth in that state. In Minnesota, which has no caps  on damages but has relatively low growth in premium rates and claims  payments, trial attorneys maintain that prescreening requirements reduce  claim costs and premiums by preventing some meritless claims from going  to trial. Third, state laws and regulations unrelated to tort reform, such as  premium rate regulations, vary widely and can influence premium rates.  Some states such as Minnesota and Mississippi tend not to regulate rates,  while others, such as California, require state approval of the premium  rates charged by insurers. Finally, insurers\u2019 premium pricing decisions  are affected by their losses on medical malpractice claims and income  from investments, and other market conditions such as the level of market  competition among insurers and their respective market shares.

Several studies published prior to 1994 were  reviewed by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in its  comprehensive 1994 report on defensive medicine, which we included in  our review. In addition, we also explored the issue with medical provider  organizations and examined the results of several recent surveys,  including those conducted by national health care provider organizations,  in which providers were asked about their own defensive medicine  practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Malpractice Premium Rate and Claims Payments Growth", "paragraphs": ["To assess the growth in medical malpractice premium rates and claims  payments across states, we compared trends in states with tort reforms  that include noneconomic damage caps (4 states with a $250,000 cap and 8  states with a $500,000 or less cap) to the 11 states (including the District  of Columbia) with limited reforms and the average for all states. We  focused our analysis on those states with noneconomic damage caps as a  key tort reform because such caps are included in proposed federal tort  reform legislation and because published research generally reports that  such caps have a greater impact on medical malpractice premium rates  and claims payments than some other types of tort reform measures. We  did not separately assess trends in the 28 states with various other tort  reforms because of the wide range of often dissimilar and incomparable  tort reforms that are included among these states. Because research  suggests that any impact of tort reforms on premiums or claims can be  expected to follow the implementation of the reforms by at least 1 year,  we grouped states into their respective categories based on reforms that  had been enacted no later than 1995 and reviewed premium rate and  claims payment data for the period 1996 through 2002. We relied upon a  summary of state tort reforms compiled by the National Conference of  State Legislatures (NCSL) to place states within the reform categories and  reviewed the information with respect to the 9 study states for accuracy in  February 2003. (See table 4.)", "To assess the growth in medical malpractice premiums, we analyzed state- level malpractice premium rates for the specialties of general surgery,  internal medicine, and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) reported by  insurers to the Medical Liability Monitor (MLM) from 1996 to 2002. Our  analysis does not capture the experience of other physician specialties and  other types of medical providers such as hospitals and nursing homes.  MLM reports base premium rates that do not reflect discounts or rebates  that may effectively reduce the actual premium rates charged. We  generally excluded data from insurers that did not consistently report  premium rates across most of the years studied. We also excluded  surcharges for contributions to state patient compensation funds (PCF)  because these were inconsistently reported across states and years. We  adjusted rates for inflation using the urban consumer price index. We  calculated a composite average premium across all three specialties, as  well as specialty-specific average premiums, for each year. We then  analyzed growth rates in these average premiums from 1996 through 2002  across all states.", "To assess the growth in medical malpractice claims payments, we  analyzed state level claims payment data from the National Practitioner  Data Bank (NPDB) from 1996 to 2002, which had been adjusted to 2002  dollars. We calculated average per capita claims payments and their  growth rates for each state across this time frame. Assuming a 1-year lag  to allow the reforms to affect these indicators, we calculated overall  averages of these indicators from 1996 to 2002, and used these averages to  compare average per capita payments and their rates of growth across the  reform categories.", "The NPDB claims data we analyzed contain notable limitations. First, they  include malpractice claims against licensed physicians only, and not  against institutional providers such as hospitals and nursing homes.  Secondly, as we have previously reported, NPDB claims may be  underreported. When physicians are not specifically named in a  malpractice judgment or settlement, the related claims are not reported to  the data bank, and certain self-insured and managed care plans may be  underreported as well. The extent to which this underreporting occurs is  not known. Finally, NPDB data do not capture legal and other  administrative costs associated with malpractice claims.", "We examined other sources of information on claims payments, and found  none to be a comprehensive data source for each state that captures  malpractice claims costs from all segments of the malpractice insurance  market\u2014commercial insurers, physician-mutual companies, and self- insured and other groups. For example, data reported to the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) have been used in other  research; however, data are not reported consistently across states and  exclude payments from certain insurers. According to NAIC officials, the  laws that dictate reporting requirements differ by state, and not all  insurers are required to report in every state. They also stated that  exempted insurers can include those operating in a single state and certain  physician mutual companies. In all states, self-insured groups, which  represent a substantial proportion of the medical malpractice insurance  market, are exempted from reporting. Similarly, the Insurance Services  Office (ISO) is a private organization providing state-level price advisory  information to state insurance regulators. However, ISO does not operate  in all states, nor does it uniformly collect data on hospital claims, or claims  from physician mutual companies, and represents only 25 to 30 percent of  the total medical malpractice market. Physician Insurers Association of  America is an association of physician mutual companies; however, it does  not share proprietary state-level claims data. Jury Verdict Research is a  private research organization that collects data from several different  sources, including attorneys and media reports, among others. Some have  criticized the accuracy of this data set for several reasons, including a  varied and unsystematic data collection process and because large verdict  awards may be more likely to be included than smaller verdict awards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Summary of Selected Research Designed to Measure Defensive Medicine Prevalence and Costs", "paragraphs": ["Table 5 summarizes the scope, methods, results, and limitations of studies  that examined the prevalence and costs of defensive medicine practices or  the potential impact of tort reform laws on mitigating defensive medicine  costs.
