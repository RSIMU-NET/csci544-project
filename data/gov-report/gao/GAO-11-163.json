Sustained U.S. involvement in these operations has placed stresses on the Department of Defense's (DOD) medical personnel. As the U.S. military role in Iraq and Afghanistan changes, the Army must adapt the number and mix of medical personnel it deploys. In response to Congress' continued interest in the services' medical personnel requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan, GAO evaluated the extent to which (1) DOD has assessed its need for medical personnel in theater to support ongoing operations, (2) the Army has adapted the composition and use of medical units to provide advanced medical care, and (3) the Army fills medical personnel gaps that arise in theater. To do so, GAO analyzed DOD policies and procedures on identifying personnel requirements, deploying medical personnel, and filling medical personnel gaps in Iraq and Afghanistan, and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Medical officials in theater continually assess the number and the types of military medical personnel they need to support contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and analyze the risks if gaps occur. Given congressional interest about deployed civilians, DOD reported to Congress in April 2010 that with each new mission, the need for new civilian skills has resulted in an increase in deployed civilians and that these civilians are not immune to the dangers associated with contingency operations. Although GAO did not learn of any DOD deployed civilians turned away for care in theater during this review, it is unclear the extent they can expect routine medical care in theater given that a DOD directive and theater guidance differ with regard to their eligibility for routine care. By clarifying these documents, DOD could reduce uncertainty about the level of routine care deployed DOD civilians can expect in theater and provide more informed insights into the military medical personnel requirements planning process. Army theater commanders have been reconfiguring or splitting medical units to cover more geographical areas in theater to better provide advanced emergency life-saving care quicker, but Army doctrine and the organizational design of these units, including needed staff, have not been fully updated to reflect these changes. Studies show that for those severely injured or wounded, 90 percent do not survive if advanced medical care is not provided within 60 minutes of injury. Officials in theater told GAO they are using specialized personnel documents to staff these medical units with more up-to- date personnel requirements to address gaps caused by splitting medical units, and that current doctrine and organizational design were not sufficient to address the capability needed for splitting medical units. According to an Army regulation, it maintains its lessons learned program to systematically update Army doctrine and enhance the Army's preparedness to conduct current and future operations. By updating Army doctrine and organizational documents for the design of medical units that could be used in other theaters, the Army could benefit from incorporating its lessons learned, where appropriate, and be better assured the current practice of splitting medical units to quickly provide advanced life-saving emergency medical care to those severely injured or wounded does not lead to unnecessary staffing challenges. Army commanders have used two approaches--cross-leveling and backfilling--to fill medical personnel gaps that arise in theater due to reasons such as illnesses, emergency leave, and resignations of medical personnel. When these gaps in needed medical personnel occur, the Army's 90-day rotation policy--while intended to ease the financial burden of deploying reserve medical personnel and help retain them--has presented some challenges in quickly filling these gaps in theater with reserve medical personnel when a medical provider is not able to deploy. However, Army data show the magnitude of these unfilled gaps or late arrivals for the reserve component medical providers ranged from about 3 percent to 7 percent from January 2008 to July 2010."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) DOD clarify the level of routine medical care that deployed DOD civilian employees can expect in theater and (2) the Army update its doctrine and the organizational design of split medical units.

Sustained U.S. involvement in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and elsewhere has placed stresses on the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) medical personnel, particularly for certain high-demand  specialists such as psychiatrists and physician assistants. DOD medical  personnel have dual responsibilities to provide medical care at health care  facilities in the United States and abroad to servicemembers, former  servicemembers, and other beneficiaries, and, when called upon, to  provide urgent, lifesaving medical care on the battlefield and medical  support to U.S. armed forces.", "Providing military medical care for ongoing operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan presents other challenges. For instance, as the number and  mix of medical personnel specialists decreases in Iraq, in line with the  theaterwide reduction of forces, the military must continue to provide  medical support while adapting to reduced numbers of medical personnel.  At the same time, medical units deployed to Afghanistan face logistical  challenges created by geography and the lack of physical infrastructure  such as roads and utilities that complicate their ability to provide  advanced medical care to warfighters.", "In our past reports, we have highlighted several issues concerning military  medical personnel requirements. For example, in September 2006, we  reported that some combat support and combat service support skills,  including medical, were in particularly high demand to meet requirements  for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That report also found that  medical and other support skills, which reside primarily in the Army\u2019s  reserve components, were in increasingly short supply due to restrictions  on the length and frequency of reserve deployments. In April 2009, we  noted that DOD faced challenges in accessing and retaining medical  officers, such as the limited supply and high demand for qualified medical  professionals; the lower pay generally offered to them by the military  compared to the private sector; the stress, length, and frequency of  deployments; and the length of required service commitments. In July  2010, we reported that the services\u2019 collaborative planning efforts  regarding requirements determination for medical personnel working in  fixed military treatment facilities have been limited. We also noted that  the services\u2019 requirements processes are not always validated and  verifiable, as DOD guidance requires.", "In response to the congressional committees\u2019 continued interest in the  medical and dental personnel requirements of the military services,  including their reserve components, needed to, among other things, meet  their medical missions in support of contingency operations and deliver  high-quality health care to eligible beneficiaries, we agreed to undertake  additional work on issues related to DOD\u2019s medical personnel. For this  report, we focused on military medical support for contingency operations  in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as such, we evaluated the extent to which   (1) DOD has assessed its need for military medical personnel to support  ongoing operations, (2) the Army has adapted the composition and use of  its medical units to provide advanced medical care, and (3) the Army fills  medical personnel gaps that arise in theater.", "For our first objective, we analyzed DOD\u2019s policies and processes that  govern the medical personnel requirements determination process and  compared DOD guidance and theater-level guidance regarding medical  care for deployed DOD civilians and noted how they differed. For our  second objective, we evaluated Army doctrine and the organization of  medical units and assessed the extent to which they capture current  practices in Iraq and Afghanistan regarding the use and composition of  these units. For our third objective, we reviewed the approaches used by  Army theater medical commanders to meet medical personnel  requirements when gaps in needed personnel coverage occurred in Iraq  and Afghanistan. We also analyzed Army guidance for deploying medical  personnel in its reserve components and assessed Army data to determine  the extent to which medical units of the Army reserve components had  their authorized numbers of medical personnel from January 2008 to   July 2010, given this is the time period in which the Army had data. We  assessed the reliability of the data by interviewing the agency official  responsible for collecting and summarizing the data and determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For all  three objectives, we augmented our document analysis by interviewing  DOD and service officials, including officials from United States Forces- Iraq and United States Forces-Afghanistan; U.S. Central Command; Joint  Forces Command; Joint Staff; Office of Secretary of Defense for Health  Affairs; Offices of the Surgeons General for the Army, the Navy, and the  Air Force; and U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters.

Care can be provided by the  wounded soldiers, medics or corpsmen, or battalion aid stations.", "Level 2 \u2013 Forward resuscitative care. This level provides advanced  emergency medical treatment as close to the point of injury as possible to  attain stabilization of the patient. In addition, it can provide postsurgical  inpatient services, such as critical care nursing and temporary holding.  Examples of level 2 units include forward surgical teams, shock trauma  platoons, area support medical companies, and combat stress control  units.", "Level 3 \u2013 Theater hospital care. This level provides the most advanced  medical care available in Iraq and Afghanistan. Level 3 facilities provide  significant preventative and curative health care. Examples include Army  combat support hospitals, Air Force theater hospitals, and Navy  expeditionary medical facilities.", "Level 4 \u2013 Overseas definitive care. This level provides the full range of  preventative, curative, acute, convalescent, restorative and rehabilitative  care, most typically outside of the operational area.

Examples include Walter Reed Army Medical Center in  Washington, D.C.; National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland;  and Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.", "Not all patients progress through all five levels of care, and patients being  evacuated may skip one or more levels of care as appropriate. In addition,  joint and service definitions for each level of care vary marginally due to  service-specific support requirements, but they essentially align with one  another.

At the conclusion of our audit, an Army official   agreed that if there is an inconsistency between departmental guidance  and theater guidance, it should be clarified.

In their assessment, theater  officials also analyze gaps in medical care given different potential  scenarios and the associated risks. This ongoing assessment takes place in  theater and allows theater officials to identify new medical personnel  requirements and regularly reevaluate existing medical personnel  requirements. Further, theater operational and medical officials also  consider operational limitations when developing their medical personnel  requirements, including the limit on the total number of forces in theater  and shortages of and high demand for certain medical personnel.", "In determining the number of military medical personnel and the medical  specialties needed, theater operational and medical officials told us that  they begin by evaluating various mission planning factors, such as the  number and dispersion of U.S. forces, the expected intensity of combat,  capabilities of the adversary to inflict harm, geography, and climate.  Officials said that this information allows them to determine the level and  structure of medical care they expect to need to support missions  throughout the theater of operations. For example, in planning for the  increase of U.S. forces in Afghanistan beginning in early 2010, officials  with the U.S. Central Command requested additional medical personnel to  provide medical care to the increased number of U.S. military personnel in  theater, including a theater hospital and a preventative medicine unit. In  addition, during the offensive in Bastion, Afghanistan, officials with the  Task Force 30th Medical Command told us that they relocated some mental  health providers in Afghanistan to Bastion for the duration of the  heightened operational tempo so this type of care could be better provided  in the area experiencing hostilities.", "To further assess the need for specific types of medical specialists in a  given unit and across the theater, medical officials analyze data from the  Joint Theater Trauma Registry, the Joint Medical Work Station, and  service and joint data on disease and non-battle injuries to determine  trends in medical workload. Officials use this information to increase or  decrease the number of medical personnel in line with demand for medical  services. For example, DOD medical officials conducted an analysis to  determine the need for cardiovascular specialists in Iraq and Afghanistan  based on, among other variables, the volume of cardiovascular-related  medical evacuations in theater. Officials also analyze gaps and risks in the  medical care structure under different possible scenarios. For example,  the Task Force 1st Medical Brigade in Iraq conducted an analysis that  identified possible requirements for additional medical personnel with  certain specialties, such as general surgeons, at locations in northern Iraq  given the possibility of adverse weather conditions that would prohibit  medical evacuation of patients to more advanced medical care facilities.  Further, when confronted with a need for additional medical personnel,  the theater commanding general can submit a request for forces through  DOD\u2019s Global Force Management process. For example, we learned of two  Army sustainment brigades\u2014the 82nd and the 43rd Regional Support  Commands\u2014that deployed to Afghanistan with their authorized medical  personnel but did not have enough medical personnel to provide full  support to their convoys and forward locations. In response, Task Force  62nd Medical Command in Afghanistan requested additional forces for  these two brigades. Officials told us that DOD met this requirement by  deploying 22 Air Force medics to Afghanistan.", "Additionally, medical officials in Iraq and Afghanistan told us that they  must consider two operational limitations which affect how many medical  personnel they formally request. First, the cap on the total number of U.S.  forces allowed in Iraq and Afghanistan requires theater commanders to  balance the number of medical personnel they request with many other  types of forces needed to conduct and support ongoing operations. For  instance, officials in Afghanistan told us that when they initiate requests  for additional personnel, the requesting unit is asked to offset the increase  in forces on a one-to-one basis within the unit. If they are unable to do so,  operational and medical officials determine if the request for additional  medical forces takes precedence over the need for other types of  personnel already in theater, and if so they decide which personnel will  redeploy out of theater to stay within the authorized force cap. Second,  shortages of and high demand for medical personnel in certain specialties  also plays a role in decisions about whether to request medical forces.   For example, officials in Iraq determined that 16 additional veterinary food  inspectors were needed for food safety inspections, but they did not  formally initiate that request due to the current shortage of these  specialists."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Level of Care That Deployed DOD Civilian Employees Can Expect in Theater is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD primarily provides both emergency life-saving medical care  as well as routine medical care to U.S. military personnel in Iraq and  Afghanistan, it is unclear what level of routine medical care deployed DOD  civilian employees can expect in theater. DOD relies on its own deployed  civilians to carry out or support a range of essential missions, including  logistics support, maintenance, intelligence collection, criminal  investigations, and weapon systems acquisition. About 2,600 DOD civilian  employees were deployed to Iraq, and about 2,000 DOD civilian employees  were deployed to Afghanistan according to DOD\u2019s April 2010 report to  Congress on medical care for injured or wounded deployed U.S. federal  civilians. In response to congressional interest, DOD reviewed the  department\u2019s existing policies for medical care for DOD deployed civilians  and federal civilian employees that might be injured or wounded in  support of contingency operations and reported to Congress on the results  in April 2010. DOD noted in its report that with each new mission, the  need for new civilian skills has resulted in an increase in the number of  deployed civilians and that these civilians are not immune to the dangers  associated with contingency operations, since they too incur injuries or  wounds in their efforts to support the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "Although DOD guidance clearly provides that deployed DOD civilians will  receive life-saving emergency care, it is unclear to what extent DOD  civilians can expect routine medical care in theater because a DOD  directive and theater guidance differ with regard to their eligibility for  routine medical care. Specifically, DOD Directive 1404.10 states that the  department\u2019s civilian employees who become ill, are injured, or are  wounded while deployed in support of U.S. military forces engaged in  hostilities are eligible to receive health care treatment and services at the  same level and scope provided to military personnel. However, theater  guidance for Iraq and Afghanistan, which provides detailed information  on medical care to deployed civilians, among others, states that DOD  civilians are eligible for emergency care but most routine care for them is  subject to availability. This differs from the DOD directive that states care  should be at the same level and scope provided to military personnel.", "In addition, we found that the theater guidance document for care in  Afghanistan provided additional guidance that is inconsistent with both  the DOD directive and with guidance provided elsewhere in the document  as to the level of care to be provided to DOD deployed civilians.  Specifically, one section of the guidance stated routine care for all  civilians was to be provided subject to availability while another section   of the same guidance stated routine care was to be provided for deployed  DOD civilians in accordance with a previous issuance of DOD Directive  1404.10. The previous version of DOD Directive 1404.10 indicated that  civilians designated as emergency essential employees would be eligible  for care at the same scope provided to military personnel, while the  current January 2009 DOD directive extends the provision of routine  medical care to a much wider group of DOD deployed civilians.", "Medical officials in Afghanistan told us that they provide routine medical  care to U.S. federal civilians on a space-available basis, and that they  would not turn away any person with injuries that presented a danger to  life, limb, or eyesight, regardless of the employment status of an  individual. This issue has received continuing congressional interest.   For example, in April 2008 the House Armed Services Committee  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations issued a report on  deploying federal civilians and addressed the medical care provided to  them when they are wounded, ill, or injured while in a war zone.  Furthermore, DOD\u2019s report to Congress on deployed DOD civilians stated  that the department believes it is imperative that each federal civilian  understands where, when, and how they can receive medical treatment in  theater. Although we did not learn of any deployed DOD civilians being  turned away from receiving routine care in theater during the time of our  review, officials in theater said it could be a concern if the number of DOD  civilians that deploy increases, and that theater medical officials would  assess the impact of any increase on the planning process for determining  medical personnel requirements. However, if theater officials concluded  that they needed more medical personnel due to increases in numbers of  DOD deployed civilians, we recognize that an increase in medical  resources would have to be balanced against other high-priority needed  resources due to the force cap limiting the overall numbers of military  personnel that can be in theater. For example, the former commander who  oversaw military medical units in Afghanistan noted to us that while there  is no medical-specific force cap, including a limit on the number of  medical personnel within the larger force cap, any additional military  personnel needed in theater must be balanced by the loss of other military  personnel in other areas, such as a transportation unit, and that the force  cap has played a role in their decisions in determining medical personnel  requirements. Additionally, the current commander who oversees military  medical units in Afghanistan stated that local base commanders can  request additional medical personnel if they believe that the number of  U.S. soldiers or civilians merits an increase. The official stated that an  increase of about 800 to 1500 civilians would have to occur before they  would consider revising military medical personnel requirements. At the  conclusion of our audit, an Army official agreed that if there is an  inconsistency between departmental guidance and theater guidance,   it should be examined. As long as theater guidance differs from the  requirements of departmental directives, uncertainty about deployed  civilians\u2019 eligibility for routine care in theater will remain and the military  medical personnel requirements planning process may not be fully  informed by department-level expectations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medical Units Are Being Reconfigured to Provide Advanced Emergency Care More Quickly and Over Broader Geographical Areas, but Army Doctrine Does Not Fully Reflect These Reconfigurations", "paragraphs": ["Theater commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan are providing quicker access  to advanced emergency medical care by placing more medical units in  more geographical areas to save lives. However, Army doctrine, which is  the starting point for defining and planning a unit\u2019s capabilities, has not  been updated fully to reflect these changes in theater. Also, the  organizational design of these medical units used in theater, which  indicates the number and mix of skilled medical personnel these units  should have, has not been updated to reflect current practice in theater.  Specifically, commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan have been splitting or  reconfiguring medical units typically designed to operate in one location  into multiple smaller units to cover a wider geographical area. For  example, as of December 2009 the Task Force 28th Combat Support  Hospital in Iraq\u2014a field hospital typically designed to be in one   location\u2014was split to be at three separate sites in Iraq\u2014Baghdad, Tallil,  and Al Kut\u2014to better cover this large operational area. Theater medical  commanders split these units because they found that the field hospital\u2019s  standard design configuration was no longer suitable for the model of care  that has evolved in Iraq, which requires access to more advanced medical  care\u2014particularly surgical care\u2014over large geographical distances to  better save lives.", "Splitting medical units, such as level 3 combat support hospitals and level  2 forward surgical teams, in order to locate them in more areas increases  the opportunities to provide advanced emergency care quicker and could  save more lives. According to documents from the 28th Combat Support  Hospital, the number of surgical sites has increased due to the emphasis  on providing troops access to surgical care within 60 minutes of being  injured. DOD has stated that by providing advanced life-saving emergency  medical care quicker, generally within 60 minutes of injury, survival rates  increase significantly. In fact, studies show that for those severely injured  or wounded, 90 percent do not survive if advanced medical care is not  provided within 60 minutes of injury, thus creating urgency for rapid  access to the wounded.", "Medical officials in Iraq acknowledged that Army doctrine and the  organizational design of medical units were top issues that needed to be  updated to better reflect the current practice of splitting medical units  such as combat support hospitals. For example, in a December 2009   Mid-Tour Report, the Task Force 1st Medical Brigade\u2014the medical unit  that provided oversight over medical units in Iraq before being replaced by  Task Force 807th Medical Brigade\u2014noted that the organization for combat  support hospitals, including the list of needed medical specialties, should  be redesigned to reflect the actual use of combat support hospitals across  multiple locations and that certain lessons learned could be considered in  the redesign. Specifically, Task Force 1st Medical Brigade reported that  splitting full-sized combat support hospitals into smaller parts can create  medical personnel gaps in certain specialties, including those related to  the operation of pharmacies, laboratories, and patient administration.   The medical brigade\u2019s report also went on to note that personnel with  these smaller combat support hospitals are spread so thinly that when  personnel take leave or are evacuated out of theater due to injury, the  medical brigade has to make difficult decisions on where to find needed  personnel to mitigate coverage gaps. Given these lessons learned, officials  with the Task Force 1st Medical Brigade told us that they were concerned  about outdated policies, guidance, doctrine, and field manuals related to  the determination of medical personnel requirements in theater and stated  specifically that the current design of combat support hospitals is not  flexible enough to accomplish what they are now being asked to do.   As such, they now have to continuously use what is referred to as  specialized personnel documents to manage staffing rather than staff as  indicated in established doctrine and the organization design of these  units. Specifically, officials with the Task Force 1st Medical Brigade noted  to us that staffing of medical units is now done in a \u201cvery non-doctrinal  fashion\u201d and that they had similar concerns about splitting area support  medical companies and using them in theater in a non-doctrinal fashion,  given these area support medical companies now function as two separate  level 2 troop medical clinics when they are staffed to function as one.  Finally, the Task Force 1st Medial Brigade report went on to recommend  that the organizational composition of combat support hospitals be  redesigned to include redundant capability to accommodate expected  attrition in staff.", "Additionally, officials with the U.S. Forces-Iraq Surgeon Office told us in   a separate interview that medical doctrine, specifically the organizational  design for both personnel and equipment, should be assessed and updated  given the current experience in Iraq. These officials said that the splitting  of combat support hospitals and forward surgical teams has gained  acceptance over time but should be examined given how  counterinsurgency doctrine is implemented in Iraq. These officials with  the Surgeon Office in Iraq also said that flexibility in the doctrine is  critical, but that doctrine needs to reflect the realities of operations on the  ground and the degree to which current practice of splitting medical units  has filtered into medical doctrine has been limited.", "Recognizing these lessons learned in an environment that is continuing to  evolve to provide advanced medical care to save more lives, officials with  the Army Medical Department Center and School who are responsible for  updating medical doctrine and the organizational design of medical units  recently updated the forward surgical team field manual, noting that  changes in the number and mix of specialists that make up a forward  surgical team might be necessary if such teams are to operate as smaller  stand-alone units. However, the updated manual did not specifically  suggest what those changes in the number and mix of medical specialists  that make up a forward surgical team should be if the team is providing  advanced emergency care as a stand-alone unit. We were told that Army  planners have adjusted medical personnel requirements for forward  surgical teams to account for changes in these smaller nonstandard  medical unit reconfigurations by increasing the number of personnel  assigned to those units, but the updated field manual still does not specify  what the number and mix of medical specialists should be. Furthermore,  by splitting or dividing the standard traditional design for combat support  hospitals, DOD has also had to adjust the number and mix of medical  personnel in those units as well. Instead of relying on the standard  traditional doctrine design for medical units in theater, Army medical  officials have been developing specialized personnel documents to staff  these medical units to identify the medical skill sets now needed to  operate split medical units across multiple locations for  counterinsurgency operations. Specifically, officials with the Task Force  1st Medical Brigade told us these specialized personnel documents allow  for more up-to-date establishment of personnel requirements to address  gaps caused by splitting medical units. However, the process is difficult  and it came about because current doctrine and organizational design  were not sufficient to address the capabilities needed for splitting medical  units such as combat support hospitals and area support medical  companies.", "Although the Army medical officials we spoke with said that they believe  splitting and reconfiguring units in theater is necessary and helps to  increase survival rates by providing advanced life-saving emergency  medical care generally within 60 minutes of injury, the Army has not fully  incorporated these current practices into Army doctrine and  organizational documents, which ordinarily determine the size,  composition, and use of these units. In response to a draft of this report,  DOD explained to us that Army leadership has recognized that split hybrid  operations and the dispersed environment in the theater of operations  have generated a requirement for additional medical structure. According  to an Army regulation, the Army maintains a lessons learned program to,  among other things, systematically update Army doctrine to enhance the  Army\u2019s preparedness to conduct current and future operations. By  updating Army doctrine and organizational documents for the design of  medical units that could be used in other theaters, the Army could benefit  from incorporating its lessons learned, where appropriate, and be better  assured the current practice of splitting medical units to quickly provide  advanced life-saving emergency medical care to those severely injured or  wounded does not lead to unnecessary staffing challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Theater Commanders Have Used Two Approaches for Filling Medical Personnel Gaps", "paragraphs": ["When medical personnel gaps unexpectedly arise in Iraq or Afghanistan,  Army commanders have used two approaches to fill those gaps, according  to medical officials in theater. Gaps in medical capabilities can occur  when medical providers do not deploy as expected for reasons such as  resignation, or a medical provider is determined to be medically  nondeployable. Medical personnel gaps can also occur when individual  medical personnel need to leave the unit for reasons such as an emergency  situation at home or if they become seriously sick or injured in theater.  According to medical officials in theater, when these gaps occur, Army  commanders have used two approaches to fill these gaps: backfilling and  cross-leveling.", "Backfilling involves the identification and deployment of medical  personnel into theater from the United States or elsewhere who were  not originally scheduled to deploy overseas at that time, according to  medical officials in theater. For example, a dentist assigned to a  brigade combat team in southern Iraq was evacuated out of theater for  medical reasons. Given the backlog of needed dental work,  commanders expressed concern about losing a dentist. In response,  Army Forces Command initiated an effort to identify another dentist  not in Iraq who was eligible to deploy to fill this need. DOD officials  told us that selecting and deploying an active component medical  provider to backfill a position typically takes about 45 days.", "Cross-leveling involves the temporary relocation of personnel from one  unit in theater to another, according to DOD officials. Medical officials  in theater told us that cross-leveling is often used as an interim  measure to minimize risk when a gap in medical personnel coverage  occurs. For example, an operating room nurse assigned to a forward  surgical team in Iraq had an unexpected medical situation and was  evacuated out of theater. It was critical that this personnel requirement  be filled in a timely manner, given that the forward surgical team was  staffed with only one operating room nurse. Theater officials requested  a replacement from U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army  Reserve Command, but the individual identified as a replacement could  not deploy for at least 30 days. Recognizing the high priority need for   a forward surgical team to have an operating room nurse, Task Force   1st Medical Brigade identified an operating room nurse that it could  borrow from another unit in theater until the replacement arrived.  After the replacement nurse arrived in theater, the operating room  nurse on loan returned to the unit the individual came from.", "Personnel gaps that occur in theater cannot always be prevented and  when gaps do occur, theater commanders assess the risk associated with  the gap and decide on an appropriate course of action, according to  officials with Task Force 1st Medical Brigade. Cross-leveling in particular  requires the assessment of risk associated with the personnel gap and the  gap that would be created by the relocation of a medical provider from  another unit. According to theater commanders we spoke with,   cross-leveling, while temporary, is not an ideal solution and can present  risk to medical operations in theater, especially when conducted on a  recurring basis. We recognize that risk cannot be eliminated; it can only be  managed. Army officials told us that they are willing to accept some risks  in order to mitigate other risks they believe are higher.", "According to medical officials, when medical personnel gaps in an Army  reserve component medical unit occur, it can be challenging to fill the gap  before the start of the next 90-day rotation, given it can take around   120 to 180 days to identify, notify, and then mobilize an Army reservist to  fill an unfilled requirement by which time the next expected 90-day  medical provider has already arrived. The Army\u2019s 90-day rotation policy\u2014 while intended to ease the financial burden of deploying reserve medical  personnel and help retain them\u2014has presented some challenges for the  Army in quickly filling these gaps when a medical provider is not able to  deploy. For example, the 9l5th Forward Surgical Team\u2014an Army reserve  medical unit\u2014was authorized to deploy to Iraq in September 2009 with  three general surgeons, according to theater medical officials. Instead, it  deployed with only one surgeon for the first 90-day rotation, despite  efforts to identify two other deployable general surgeons. The Army  Reserve identified a doctor to fill one of the two vacancies; however this  individual could not deploy due to an inability to be credentialed as a  general surgeon. The Army Reserve then identified another surgeon for  deployment, but this individual had educational requirements issues, and  yet a third identified surgeon resigned. By the time the Army Reserve was  able to identify a surgeon who could deploy, the 9l5th Forward Surgical  Team had been in Iraq for a month out of its first 90-day rotation. Further,  the Army was unable to identify the third authorized surgeon for the   9l5th Forward Surgical Team before the end of that 90-day rotation given  another identified surgeon scheduled for deployment resigned, and the  replacement surgeon turned out to be nondeployable for medical reasons.  In fact, the 9l5th Forward Surgical Team did not have one out of its  authorized three general surgeons for the first three 90-day rotations\u2014 approximately 270 days. Moreover, the 915th Forward Surgical Team was  expected to operate as two smaller units at two separate locations in  southern Iraq, but it was unable to provide surgical capabilities in both  locations as expected without three authorized general surgeons. As a  result of the personnel gaps, Task Force 1st Medical Brigade temporarily  relocated medical personnel already in theater from other medical units   to the 9l5th Forward Surgical Team so it could meet its mission.", "Although we found examples of the 915th Forward Surgical Team not  having all of its medical personnel before the end of each 90-day rotation,  Army data show the magnitude of these unfilled gaps or late arrivals for  the reserve components ranged from about 3 percent to 7 percent from  January 2008 to July 2010. Specifically, Army data showed that about   4 percent of mobilized Army reserve component 90-day medical rotators  (21 medical providers out of 594) did not deploy to theater or arrive in  theater on time for 2008. In 2009, that figure reached 7 percent (38 medical  providers out of 519) and through the first 6 months of 2010, this figure  was over 3 percent (8 medical providers out of 236). Unfilled reserve  component personnel requirements can have serious consequences  depending on the needed medical specialty. Therefore, medical  commanders in theater typically cross-level to fill short-term temporary  personnel gaps, although medical officials in Iraq we spoke with said  cross-leveling is a less than ideal approach to fill these medical personnel  gaps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has continued to assess its need for medical personnel in theater  based on the requirements of the mission and a variety of medical data   and has made adjustments to meet specific theater needs to achieve the  goal of providing advanced life-saving care quickly. DOD has noted that,  increasingly, deployed civilians also face dangerous circumstances in  ongoing contingency operations. While DOD has stated that deployed  civilians will receive emergency care whenever needed, the extent of  routine medical care available to DOD deployed civilians is unclear due to  inconsistent guidance. Inconsistent guidance could potentially impact the  medical personnel requirements planning process if medical officials in  theater are uncertain about deployed DOD civilian employees\u2019 access to  routine medical care. While we did not learn of any deployed DOD  civilians being turned away for medical care in theater during the time   of our audit, DOD could still benefit by assessing the implications the  inconsistencies in guidance could have if there were a sizeable increase in  the number of DOD deployed civilians in theater.", "Conducting counterinsurgency operations in often uncertain, dangerous  environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan, Army theater commanders  have reconfigured the composition of field hospitals and forward surgical  teams by breaking them down into smaller stand-alone units to better  position them to give the severely wounded or injured, such as the  casualties of blast-type injuries, the advanced emergency medical care  needed to save lives. By being in more geographical areas, these critical  life-saving medical units are better able to achieve their goal of providing  advanced emergency medical care within 60 minutes of injury to increase  survival rates. Acknowledging the current practice of splitting medical  units, the medical brigade that provided oversight over medical units in  Iraq reported that one of its top issues was advocating for updates to the  doctrine and organizational redesign of these split units that govern its use  and personnel allocation. By leveraging lessons learned collected from this  practice, especially the needed number and mix of medical personnel, the  Army could benefit from integrating these lessons systematically into  Army doctrine and the design of these medical units. Updating doctrine  and organizational design of these split medical units used in theater could  help to assure that these units will be resourced with the needed number  and mix of medical personnel to continue providing critical life-saving  capabilities for counterinsurgency operations in other theaters and in the  future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the extent to which deployed DOD civilian  employees have access to needed medical care, as appropriate, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Combatant  Commander of U.S. Central Command to clarify the level of care that  deployed DOD civilian employees can expect in theater, including their  eligibility for routine care.", "To enhance medical units\u2019 preparedness to conduct current and future  operations given the changing use of combat support hospitals and  forward surgical teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, we recommend that the  Secretary of the Army direct the Army Medical Department to update its  doctrine and the organization of medical units concerning their size,  composition, and use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments provided in response to a draft of this report, DOD  generally concurred with our findings and recommendations.

DOD partially agreed with our second recommendation that the Army  Medical Department update its doctrine and the organization of medical  units concerning their size, composition, and use. DOD noted that there is  an unquestionable need to formally update doctrinal publications. DOD  also noted that the Army is constantly reviewing and assessing medical  capability, the use of those capabilities and the organization of medical  units, and updating doctrine to evolving staffing requirements. As an  example, DOD mentioned in its official response that a recent review of  medical capability indicated the need for additional medical personnel,  and the Army responded with guidance to increase the number of enlisted  health care specialists assigned to Army Brigade Combat Teams. The  department also noted that the Army continues to capture lessons learned  and input from commanders to ensure use of medical personnel meets  requirements. We recognize that the Army continues to capture lessons  learned and input from the commanders, and we noted in our report that  the Army Medical Department Center and School has updated its forward  surgical team field manual although updates to this field manual did not  specifically note changes in the number and mix of medical specialists that  make up a forward surgical team if the team is providing advanced  emergency care as a stand-alone unit.

Generally,  the parties involved in this process have separate, sequential roles in the  process. Requests for forces are generated by combatant commanders and  submitted to the Joint Staff for validation, and then to the joint and  service force providers to identify potential sourcing solutions to fill  requirements before being transmitted to the Secretary of Defense for  approval. In sourcing requests through the emergent process,  requirements are prioritized according to a force allocation decision  model. While emergent requirements are considered within the model\u2019s  general framework, each request for forces is individually evaluated as it   is received, meaning that officials focus on whether or not forces are ready  and available to fill the request rather than trying to determine the relative  priority of the request, as is done at the Global Force Management Boards  for rotational requirements. As part of providing and evaluating potential  solutions for the request for forces, the services\u2019 force providers often  conduct risk assessments to provide information on the availability and  readiness of both active and reserve forces. These risk assessments  include violations of the services\u2019 rotation policies regarding the required  time at home for servicemembers and the impact to current missions and  operations, such as the staffing of U.S. military treatment facilities in the  case of medical personnel, if a service is selected to meet the requirement.
