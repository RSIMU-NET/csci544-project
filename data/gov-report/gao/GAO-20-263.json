WCF Division  officials told us they conduct a more detailed review of the data when they  find anomalies, such as unusually high volumes of transactions. WCF  Division officials told us that they will collaborate with the responsible  business line office to conduct a business process analysis, which is used  to identify actionable ways to address the cause of the high service  volume and costs in specific circumstances.

For example, more than 20 percent of customer calls to Treasury  ARC\u2019s financial management help desk were from customers requesting password resets, which can be manually resolved  without calling the help desk and incurring a transaction fee. In fiscal year 2019, the cost to HUD per financial management  help desk call was about $128. According to the WCF Division Director, the WCF Division presented its findings to OCFO  leadership and the WCF Committee, including five recommendations targeted at reducing system password reset call volume  and future costs to the department.", "Commercial purchase order transactions: Commercial purchase order accruals are more costly because they are manually  processed.

The OCFO official told us that OCFO  plans to implement one of the recommendations with a new process for recording those accruals in the first quarter of fiscal  year 2020 to reduce the volume of transactions. According to the WCF Division\u2019s analyses, the implementation of this  recommendation could achieve potential annual costs savings of nearly $600,000.   However, OCFO has not taken actions to address seven remaining recommendations, which the WCF Division found could  produce additional benefits, including potential cost savings of more than $400,000 annually. The OCFO official told us that  OCFO plans to examine HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2019 service usage to determine the effectiveness of the actions it has already taken  to reduce the help desk call and commercial purchase order transaction volume.", "The estimated help desk call volume and associated cost to HUD for a given year, as agreed upon in  HUD\u2019s agreement with Treasury ARC, is generally based on the average of the previous 2 years\u2019 call  volume. As such, changes in usage in 1 year will not necessarily result in lower service costs in the  next year, but HUD may realize cost savings over time if usage is consistently lower.", "While they have a process for identifying opportunities for efficiencies  through the business process analyses, WCF Division officials  acknowledged that they have not defined and documented the WCF  Division\u2019s own roles and responsibilities with regard to the analyses.

However, they told us that they are open to  defining these roles in the future.", "There are additional reasons why the WCF Division has not defined and  documented roles and responsibilities for these activities. For example,  Division officials told us that the Division faces organizational challenges  which may limit its own ability to monitor and implement actions. First, as  previously discussed, the business line offices are responsible for  managing and overseeing the service lines. According to WCF Division  officials, the business line offices are primarily responsible for identifying  opportunities to achieve efficiencies with service usage, such as through  conducting business process analyses. As such, WCF Division officials  told us that they can support those offices by monitoring their usage and  helping to identify actions to reduce high service volume and costs, but it  is ultimately the business line offices\u2019 responsibility to implement any  changes to their own processes to improve service usage.", "In addition, given its location within OCFO, Division officials stated that  the WCF Division has more leverage with OCFO to work with those  officials to identify business process improvements. WCF Division officials  told us that they have not collaborated with OCHCO or made  recommendations for actions OCHCO could take to promote efficient and  effective usage of the service lines it oversees. While the Division hopes  to work with OCHCO to perform the same types of analyses, the WCF  Division Director told us that making recommendations to OCHCO would  be viewed as outside of its area of authority.", "According to Division officials, it is the role of the WCF Committee to  provide oversight over the business line offices and ensure that such  actions are implemented.

As part of this, agencies use fact-based understandings of  how their activities contribute to accomplishing the mission and broader  results.", "The WCF Division Director told us they have considered metrics to  assess broader results of WCF Division activities such as efficiencies, but  noted that it is difficult to quantify cost savings attributable to the WCF.  This is due, in part, to the fact that HUD\u2019s service agreements are firm- fixed price contracts, meaning that a change in the volume of services  HUD consumes in a given year will not result in direct cost savings that  same year. However, HUD could assess the results of the WCF Division\u2019s  business process analyses, which identified measurable operational and  cost efficiencies that HUD could achieve through implementing the  division\u2019s recommendations.", "For example, as previously discussed, in its analysis of help desk calls,  the WCF Division identified potential efficiencies that it could track that  would contribute to cost savings over time. While some of the  recommendations may not directly result in cost savings, the Division  identified other efficiencies such as process improvements that could  improve the quality of services that it is capable of tracking. For example,  the WCF Division determined that changes to HUD\u2019s processes could  improve the accuracy of purchase order accrual estimates.", "Assessing the results of the WCF Division\u2019s business process analyses  would help HUD better understand how the Division\u2019s efforts contribute to  its goal of supporting the efficient delivery of goods and services.   Without doing so, HUD risks not fully realizing more than $1 million in  total potential annual savings identified by the WCF Division\u2019s analyses  and freeing up resources that could be realigned for other departmental  priorities. In addition to tracking progress towards its own goal, assessing  these results would allow HUD to demonstrate how the WCF Division  contributes to a 2018 cross-agency priority goal of improving the use,  quality, and availability of administrative shared services, as well as the  department\u2019s related strategic objective to organize and deliver services  more efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WCF Handbook Includes Current and Complete Information on Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["In response to our review, HUD updated the WCF Handbook\u2014the  primary reference guide for customers and stakeholders on WCF  operations\u2014to include more current and complete information on WCF  policies and procedures.

Findings based on  these questions can provide managers with  important information about financial  challenges and opportunities which may exist;  in turn, this information may help guide more  effective account and program management.", "In fiscal year 2017, the size of the WCF\u2019s unexpended balance increased  by 60 percent from $10 million to $16 million, and it was relatively stable  from fiscal years 2017 to 2018, as shown in table 4.", "While the WCF Division does not actually provide the shared services  that it finances, nor manage dispute resolution between customers and  service providers, it does communicate with customers on fund-related  issues\u2014such as shared service billing and usage reports. Key operating  principles for effective management of working capital funds state that to  be flexible to customer input and needs, agencies should communicate  with customers regularly and in a timely manner, and develop a process  to assess whether customer demands are met.", "The WCF Division communicates and interacts directly with customers  through a variety of channels. For example, WCF Division officials told us  that they: organize quarterly WCF Committee meetings, hold meetings to  provide information and answer questions about interpreting usage  reports, and use an email inbox for communication between Division staff  and customers. The WCF Division will also contact customers directly  when issues, such as anomalies in shared service usage, are identified.

HUD could maximize the potential of these opportunities by  ensuring that it has a solid framework in place for managing the WCF  before it expands to include additional shared services.", "During the course of our review, HUD took important steps to ensure that  the WCF Handbook\u2014the primary reference guide for WCF operations\u2014 includes up-to-date and complete information on WCF policies and  procedures. Providing access to current and complete information on the  management of the WCF promotes an understanding of who should be  held accountable, and helps ensure that funds are effectively managed.", "HUD also took steps to fully document its processes to effectively  manage the operating reserves. This will be particularly important as HUD  continues to consider expanding the services provided through the WCF.  By documenting its existing operating reserve policies, HUD is better  positioned to address potential risk and to identify opportunities to  achieve budgetary savings or redirect resources to other priorities.", "However, there are additional opportunities for improvement. Defining  roles and responsibilities promotes a clear understanding of who will be  held accountable for specific tasks or duties. Most of HUD\u2019s WCF roles  and responsibilities are defined in guidance. However, while the WCF  Division performs important business process analyses that identity  opportunities to improve the efficiency of services, consistent with the  goals of the WCF, HUD has not defined roles and responsibilities for the  business process analyses, including who is responsible for identifying,  monitoring, and implementing actions to achieve the efficiencies. This  makes it difficult to hold offices accountable. By clearly defining the  responsibilities of the WCF Division, business line offices, and other  stakeholders, such as the WCF Committee, HUD could better ensure the  business process improvements are being implemented fully and  consistently across the department.", "Moreover, assessing the results of the WCF Division\u2019s business process  analyses would help HUD better understand how the Division\u2019s efforts  contribute to its goal of supporting the efficient delivery of goods and  services. This would better position HUD to achieve the more than $1  million in potential annual savings identified by the WCF Division\u2019s  analyses.", "Finally, opportunities for customers to provide input about services in a  timely manner enables agencies to regularly assess whether customer  needs are being met. WCF customers have several ways that they can  communicate day-to-day concerns about shared services to the business  line offices. However, they raised larger concerns during our focus  groups, particularly about the quality of the externally provided human  resource related services that deserve attention. Periodic assessments of  WCF business lines would provide a more comprehensive understanding  of customers\u2019 overall satisfaction and would help HUD identify potential  areas for improvement with the services for which they pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making a total of three recommendations to HUD.", "The Secretary of HUD should define and document roles and  responsibilities for identifying opportunities to promote more efficient  shared service usage through business process analyses, including  defining roles for monitoring and implementing actions recommended  because of these analyses.
