As a result, the U.S. Coast Guard, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has responsibilities in the Arctic, which are expected to increase. This testimony provides an update of: (1) the extent to which the Coast Guard has taken actions to identify requirements for future Arctic operations; (2) issues related to the U.S. icebreaking fleet; and (3) the extent to which the Coast Guard is coordinating with stakeholders on Arctic issues. This statement is based on GAO-10-870 , issued in September 2010, and includes selected updates. For the selected updates, GAO analyzed Coast Guard, Department of Defense (DOD,) and other related documents on Arctic operations and capabilities. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard and DOD officials about efforts to identify Arctic requirements and coordinate with stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has taken a variety of actions--from routine operations to a major analysis of mission needs in the polar regions--to identify its Arctic requirements. The routine operations have helped the Coast Guard to collect useful information on the capability of its existing assets to operate in cold climates and strategies for overcoming logistical challenges presented by long-distance responses to incidents, among other things. Other operational actions intended to help identify Arctic requirements include the establishment of temporary, seasonal operating locations in the Arctic and seasonal biweekly Arctic overflights, which have helped the Coast Guard to identify performance requirements and test personnel and equipment capabilities in the Arctic. The Coast Guard's primary analytical effort to identify Arctic requirements is the High Latitude Study, a multivolume analysis that is intended to, in part, identify the Coast Guard's current Arctic capability gaps and assess the degree to which these gaps will impact future missions. This study also identifies potential solutions to these gaps and compares six different options--identified as Arctic force mixes--to a baseline representing the Coast Guard's current Arctic assets. However, given current budget uncertainty and the Coast Guard's recent acquisition priorities, it may be a significant challenge for the agency to acquire the assets that the High Latitude Study recommends. The most significant issue facing the Coast Guard's icebreaker fleet is the growing obsolescence of these vessels and the resulting capability gap caused by their increasingly limited operations. In 2010, Coast Guard officials reported challenges fulfilling the agency's statutory icebreaking mission. Since then, at least three reports--by the DHS Inspector General and Coast Guard contractors--have further identified the Coast Guard's challenges to meeting its current and future icebreaking mission requirements in the Arctic with its existing polar icebreaker fleet. Prior GAO work and these reports also identify budgetary challenges the agency faces in acquiring new icebreakers. Given these issues and the current budgetary climate, it is unlikely that the Coast Guard will be able to fund the acquisition of new icebreakers through its own budget, or through alternative financing options. Thus, it is unlikely that the Coast Guard will be able to expand the U.S. icebreaker fleet to meet its statutory requirements, and it may be a significant challenge for it to just maintain its existing level of icebreaking capabilities due to its aging fleet. In 2010, GAO reported the Coast Guard coordinates with various stakeholders on Arctic operations and policy, including foreign, state, and local governments, Alaskan Native governments and interest groups, and the private sector. GAO also reported that the Coast Guard coordinates with federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and DOD. More recently, the Coast Guard has partnered with DOD through the Capabilities Assessment Working Group--an interagency coordination group established in May 2011--to identify shared Arctic capability gaps as well as opportunities and approaches to overcome them, to include making recommendations for near-term investments. The establishment of this group helps to ensure collaboration between the Coast Guard and DOD addresses near-term capabilities in support of current planning and operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement.

Given that it  takes 8-10 years to build an icebreaker, and the Coast Guard has not yet  begun the formal acquisition process, the Coast Guard has already  accepted some level of risk that its statutory mission requirements related  to icebreakers will continue to go unmet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations on Alternative Financing Options", "paragraphs": ["The three reports discussed earlier in this statement all identify funding as  a central issue in addressing the existing and anticipated challenges  related to icebreakers. In addition to the Coast Guard budget analysis  included in the Recapitalization report, all three reports reviewed  alternative financing options, including the potential for leasing  icebreakers, or funding icebreakers through the National Science  Foundation (NSF) or the Department of Defense (DOD). Although DOD  has used leases and charters in the past when procurement funding  levels were insufficient to address mission requirements and capabilities,  both the Recapitalization report and the High Latitude Study determined  that the lack of existing domestic commercial vessels capable of meeting  the Coast Guard\u2019s mission requirements reduces the availability of  leasing options for the Coast Guard. Additionally, an initial cost-benefit  analysis of one type of available leasing option included in the  Recapitalization report and the High Latitude Study suggests that it may  ultimately be more costly to the Coast Guard over the 30-year icebreaker  lifespan. Another alternative option addressed by the Recapitalization  report would be to fund new icebreakers through the NSF. However, the  analysis of this option concluded that funding a new icebreaker through  the existing NSF budget would have significant adverse impacts on NSF  operations and that the capability needed for Coast Guard requirements  would exceed that needed by the NSF."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard: Action Needed As Approved Deepwater Program Remains  Unachievable, GAO-11-743, Washington, D.C.: July 28, 2011.", "Coast Guard: Efforts to Identify Arctic Requirements Are Ongoing, but  More Communication about Agency Planning Efforts Would Be  Beneficial, GAO-10-870, Washington, D.C.: September 15, 2010.", "Coast Guard: Observations on the Requested Fiscal Year 2011 Budget,  Past Performance, and Current Challenges, GAO-10-411T, Washington,  D.C.: February 25, 2010.", "Coast Guard: Observations on the Fiscal Year 2010 Budget and Related  Performance and Management Challenges, GAO-09-810T, Washington,  D.C.: July 7, 2009.", "Homeland Security: Enhanced National Guard Readiness for Civil  Support Missions May Depend on DOD\u2019s Implementation of the 2008  National Defense Authorization Act, GAO-08-311, Washington, D.C.: April  16, 2008.", "Coast Guard: Observations on the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget, Recent  Performance, and Related Challenges, GAO-08-494T, Washington, D.C.:  March 6, 2008.", "Results-Oriented Government: Practices That Can Help Enhance and  Sustain Collaboration among Federal Agencies, GAO-06-15.
