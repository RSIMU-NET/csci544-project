Unemployment Insurance wage records--the primary data source for tracking WIA performance--provide reliable outcome information over time. But they have shortcomings, such as not including some categories of workers, and considerable time lags before data are available. Many states rely on alternative data sources to fill gaps in the wage records. However, the time between when a participant receives services and when their outcomes are reported to Labor can range from about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years or longer. In addition, states' annual reports reflect only a small portion of job seekers who receive WIA services because of restrictions in the law and policies of Labor. With assistance from states, many local areas collect interim outcome information from former participants or employers and use other interim indicators to track WIA performance levels long before wage record data are available. However, states and local areas would like more help from Labor in disseminating best practices on interim performance measures. In addition, these efforts tell them little about the performance of their overall one-stop systems. Many states and local areas rely on other indicators--job seeker measures, employer measures, program partnership measures, and family and community indicators to assess their one-stops. Labor has taken steps to improve WIA's performance system and assess onestops, but could do more. Although Labor is studying adjustment methods that could better take into account local differences when negotiating performance levels, it has not committed to using such a method nationally. Labor also has efforts to improve the quality of WIA's performance data and is developing a set of common measures for one-stop partner programs. Yet as part of the common measures, Labor plans to restrict the use of alternative data. Labor has also delayed plans to conduct an impact evaluation and will not meet its statutory requirement to do so by 2005."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the nation faces rising budget deficits and greater competition for  federal resources to address 21st century challenges, it is becoming  increasingly important for federal programs to demonstrate that they are  meeting their long-range goals.

From federal long- range goals to local program policies, it is critical to demonstrate results at  all levels with accurate outcome data, timely program management  information, and impact studies to assess effectiveness.

Further,  researchers have found that wage record data are more objective and cost- effective than traditional survey information. For example, one state  estimated that the cost of doing participant surveys, as was done under  JTPA, was approximately $13.25 per participant compared with the cost of  automated record matching to UI wage records, which costs less than $.05  per participant. UI wage records make it easier to track longer-term  measures, such as those that assess earnings change, earnings  replacement, and employment retention 6 months after participants leave  the program.

For example, the wage report  for the last calendar quarter of the year (ending on December 31) is due to  the state on January 31. After the state receives the wage report, the data  must be processed. Many employers report the data electronically, but  some employers\uf8e7especially small businesses\uf8e7are allowed to submit data  in paper format, which then must be converted to electronic media. After  data entry, information must be checked for errors and corrected. All  these steps take time, which can delay the availability of the wage record  data for reporting on outcomes for several months. According to our  survey, 28 states estimated they get information on job placement within 4  months after participants exit the program, and 44 states have this  information within 6 months.

To compensate for time  lags, Labor devised a reporting structure that reaches back to the prior  year to provide a complete year\u2019s worth of outcome data on WIA  participants for the annual reports. For example, for the employment- based measures, participants who are reported on in the program year  2002 annual report, provided to Labor in December 2003, left WIA in the  four quarters between October 2001 and September 2002 and may have  received services much earlier. The amount of time between when  participants receive services and when their outcomes are reported to  Labor varies, but it is about 1\u00bd years at a minimum. A hypothetical  example will illustrate this point by showing two participants that would  be included in the program year 2002 report. Sue registered in April 2001,  participated in the program for at least 6 months, and left between  October and December 2001, taking about 32 months from the time of  registration until her outcomes were reported.

For example, one local  official told us that knowing the number of participants who complete  training helps him predict the number of participants who will find a job.  Overall, nearly half of local areas reported that this type of interim  information greatly helped them meet or exceed their performance levels.  Despite the progress states and local areas have made in developing and  using interim outcome information, nearly all states and local areas  reported they would like more help from Labor in collecting and  disseminating promising practices on interim indicators to assess WIA  performance.", "Because meeting WIA performance levels may affect future funding, most  local areas hold service providers accountable and actively monitor their  WIA performance levels. Through our survey, we found that over 80  percent of local areas hold their service providers accountable by  incorporating negotiated performance levels in their contracts. In addition,  nearly 80 percent of local areas establish goals for the number of  participants who are registered in or exited from WIA. A lesser number of  local areas\uf8e724 percent\uf8e7establish pay for performance contracts, and 18  percent provide financial incentives to their service providers. (See table  5.) Officials from one local area that we visited told us they provide  monetary bonuses to providers that exceed their WIA goals and withhold  20 percent of their payments for those providers that do not reach their  WIA goals. In addition, over 80 percent of local areas nationwide reported  that having staff devoted to monitoring and managing WIA performance  greatly helps them achieve or exceed their levels.", "Once final WIA performance information is available, local areas use this  information to assess program services over time and to guide future  program development. Most often local areas reported they use WIA  performance information to modify their programs. We found that about  two-thirds of local areas use performance information to a great extent to  help them identify areas for program improvement and adopt new  program approaches. Over half of local areas use their WIA performance  information to analyze trends over time and prepare strategic plans.

In addition, Labor  does not require that states and local areas measure the overall  performance of the one-stop system. Nonetheless, most states and local  areas have developed ways to assess the performance of their one-stops,  using four basic types of indicators\uf8e7job seeker measures, employer  measures, program partnership measures, and family and community  indicators. (See fig. 6.)", "Even without a federal requirement to do so, according to our survey,  almost 90 percent of local areas gather information on one-stop job  seekers, even if they are not registered and participating in any particular  federal program. Most often local areas reported that they require the one- stop centers to track and report the number of job seekers who visit the  one-stop in a single time period, usually through a paper and pencil or  computer log. We also found that 58 percent of the local areas are  collecting information on job seekers that repeatedly visit one-stop  centers, sometimes through electronic means. About 20 percent of all local  areas reported using electronic swipe cards to track job seekers in their  one-stop centers. These swipe cards, similar to membership or grocery  store discount cards, are issued to each job seeker using the one-stop and  contain unique identifying information that can be read each time the job  seeker accesses services. For example, according to local officials in  Philadelphia, they issue swipe cards to job seekers and scan these cards to  record both the services received\uf8e7such as using computers in the  resource room, attending orientation workshops, or talking with the case  managers\uf8e7and the date and time the services were provided. Using data  from this system, one-stop managers can assess traffic flow and schedule  staff accordingly, and may eventually be able to link participants and  services to outcomes achieved. Officials also told us they are using  demographic information from an analysis of swipe card data to target  marketing efforts and to develop services more strategically.", "In addition to counting the number of job seekers who visit the one-stop  center, we found that local areas are tracking information on how many  program referrals they receive, how satisfied they are with services, and  what types of outcomes they achieve. Over half of local areas reported  that they survey job seekers who visit the one-stop to gauge their  satisfaction with services. For example, a one-stop center in Utah that we  visited not only uses a one-stop satisfaction survey, but officials also  periodically contact one-stop customers to ask how they liked the  services. According to our survey, some of the local areas said that having  job seeker satisfaction information was one of the best ways to assess the  one-stop system. Many local areas collect more in-depth information on all  one-stop job seekers\uf8e7over one-third collect demographic characteristics,  and over one-fourth monitor outcomes, such as whether job seekers got a  job and at what wages. (See fig. 7.)", "Many local areas also track information on employers\u2019 use of one-stops.  About 70 percent of local areas nationwide reported that they require one- stop centers to track some type of employer measure, such as the number  of employers that use one-stop services, how many hire one-stop  customers, and the type of services that employers use. To gauge  employer involvement, local areas most often require the one-stops to  count and report the number of employers that use one-stop services. Over  40 percent of local areas require one-stops to track the number of  employers that repeatedly use one-stop services. For example, a one-stop  center in Utah we visited tracks employers that repeatedly use one-stop  services and those that have not used services in a while. It uses this  information to reach out to employers who have not returned for services,  encouraging them to use one-stop services again. To understand how  employers view the one-stop services they received, 60 percent of local  areas reported they collect information on employer satisfaction. A  smaller number\uf8e7about 20 percent of local areas\uf8e7track information on  market penetration, such as the number of employers in the labor market  that could potentially use one-stop services. For example, Philadelphia  officials told us they measure market penetration by comparing the  number of employers that use the one-stop center with the number of  employers in the community as a whole.  (See fig. 8.)", "Most of the programs that provide services through the one-stop system  have their own performance measures, but as we have reported in the  past, these measures cannot be readily summed to obtain an overall  measure of one-stop performance. However, one-third of the local areas  told us that they combine in one report some of the key federal measures  for the various one-stop programs\uf8e7including wages at employment or  other earnings indicators\uf8e7and use this report to assess the one-stop  system as a whole. For example, Florida officials produce a report\uf8e7called  the Red and Green report\uf8e7that assembles for each local area outcomes  on 22 measures from different one-stop programs, such as WIA, Wagner- Peyser, and TANF. Weaker program outcomes are identified in red and  stronger outcomes are identified in green. They use this report to assess  performance, diagnose weak spots, and predict long-term outcomes across  one-stop partners.", "More often local areas have gone a step further and have identified  outcomes they consider to be key, developing common definitions for  these measures to be used across programs. Just over half of the local  areas reported in our survey that they track cross-cutting employment  measures, such as job placement, and a little less than half said they track  wages at placement and employment retention across programs. For  example, Utah developed a set of outcome, process, efficiency, and  activity measures to gauge the performance of all of their one-stops and to  ensure alignment with agency goals and objectives. These measures  include entered employment, earnings increase, and employment retention  across Wagner Peyser, WIA, TANF, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and  Food Stamp Employment and Training programs.", "In addition to tracking outcomes for the various one-stop partners, some  local areas assess their one-stop systems by measuring the level of  coordination among one-stop partners, as well as the range and quality of  services they provide. Nearly 40 percent of local areas we surveyed said  that they use indicators, such as increased coordination among partners  and number of referrals partners made, to assess how well the overall one- stop system is operating. For example, one local area reported it is  developing a one-stop report card that will track the flow of customers  through the system and monitor each program\u2019s contribution to the  services provided, including the results of program referrals. They will use  this report card to target areas that need attention. To ensure the one-stop  system is providing quality services, some local areas we visited also  conduct mystery shopper reviews wherein individuals posing as  employers or job seekers evaluate the quality of the services they receive.  Michigan conducts such mystery shopper visits of all their one-stops over  the course of a year to assess the quality of customer services, including  how courteous, professional, and knowledgeable one-stop staff are.

Some local areas focus on indicators of family well- being, such as family self-sufficiency\uf8e7or the ability of families to  financially support themselves\uf8e7to assess whether their one-stop systems  are meeting family needs. One rural one-stop in Michigan even uses some  indicators that are not related to income.

For example, some local officials said that their  negotiated performance levels on the earnings change and earnings  replacement measures were based on a stronger economy and did not  reflect recent increases in the unemployment rate. Nationwide, 22 states  reported that they are at risk of not meeting at least 80 percent of their  negotiated performance levels on one or more of the WIA measures for  program year 2002.

Under JTPA, Labor allowed states  flexibility to develop their own adjustment procedures, but it established  standard parameters to govern the adjustment methods used by states.  These parameters addressed the procedures for adjusting performance  levels, the quality of data, and factors that could be used for adjustments.  For example, the procedures for adjusting performance levels were  required to be objective and equitable across all local areas. In addition,  Labor developed optional adjustment models that could be used by states  because it recognized that not all states and local areas have the expertise  and resources necessary to develop adjustment procedures.

This will allow Labor to sum outcomes across all  its programs to provide a more uniform picture of outcomes achieved.  According to a department official, Labor worked with other federal  agencies to get agreement on common data sources and common  language, where possible. For example, Labor is working on developing a  process, using WRIS, that would allow other federal programs to use UI  wage records to track outcomes. As part of the common measures, Labor  plans to require one-stops to track all participants who walk through the  door of a one-stop center and receive any one-stop service, regardless of  which program provides the service.

This type of impact study is important  because outcome measures alone cannot show whether an outcome is a  direct result of program participation or whether it is a result of other  influences, such as the state of the local economy. Labor officials said they  did not initiate impact studies of WIA within the first few years after WIA  passed to allow states and local areas time to implement the considerable  changes that were required under WIA. According to officials, Labor had  planned to initiate an impact evaluation of the WIA adult and dislocated  worker programs in 2004, but this plan is currently on hold because Labor  is anticipating changes to these programs as a result of reauthorization.

Making this shift has taken time and some trial  and error as state and local policy makers and one-stop service providers  learned what type of service structure met local needs. Since  implementation, states and local areas have made great progress in  retooling their systems and in gathering all the data needed to report on  their performance to Labor. But, only recently are we getting a nationwide  glimpse of outcomes achieved under WIA.", "The requirement to use UI wage data is a step in the right direction by  providing a reasonably consistent look at national program results over  time. Historically, there have been data quality issues with outcome data  collected directly from participants, as was done prior to WIA. The UI  wage data provide a level of credibility that other data sources do not  have. States have made progress in accessing data from other states. But  in order to meet their performance levels, some states must continue to  rely on other data sources to fill gaps. Out of concern for data  comparability, Labor is proposing to limit the use of data from other  sources. This decision, if applied to the WIA programs, will hinder the  ability of some states to demonstrate that they have met their expected  performance levels and may cause one-stops to focus their efforts on only  those occupations covered by the UI wage records. This policy also seems  overly restrictive, given that Labor is implementing data validation  procedures that could be used to ensure the accuracy and validity of  supplemental data. Even with the capability to use supplemental data,  some states and local areas have failed to demonstrate that they met their  negotiated performance levels for 2 years in a row and have suffered  financial sanctions\u2014often citing local economic conditions as the cause.  The development of a method to systematically adjust for economic and  demographic factors outside the control of the local area in setting  expected performance levels could help mitigate these concerns.", "While the use of UI wage records has improved the quality of the data that  are used to track outcomes under WIA, this information alone does little  for real-time program management. We found that state and local officials  have made significant strides in collecting their own data to assess  whether they are likely to meet their federally required performance  levels, manage their programs on a real-time basis, and track a broader  one-stop population than just registered WIA participants. In some ways,  the WIA performance measures based on the UI wage records and the  interim data collected at the state and local level provide a useful system  to cross check these data. However, not all states and local areas have  determined what interim information is necessary, nor have they had the  benefit of learning from their peers. Without some additional information  or the sharing of promising practices, these states and local areas will be  at a disadvantage in monitoring their progress and, perhaps, in meeting  their minimum performance levels. Further, Labor has also failed to meet  WIA\u2019s requirement to conduct a systematic evaluation of WIA. Plans to do  an evaluation have been delayed until reauthorization is complete, even  though the proposed bills would retain most of the WIA service delivery  and governance structure. Delays in committing to an evaluation now may  be costly because policy makers will not be able to benefit from an  understanding of WIA\u2019s effectiveness.", "Without clear guidance from Labor, states and local areas continue to  struggle with determining who should be tracked in the WIA performance  measures. At the same time, even if states and localities had a common  understanding of whom to track and were consistently reporting on the  same categories of customers, they would only be reporting on a small  portion of overall one-stop customers. While a requirement to track all job  seekers who visit the one-stops may appear to be a major change, we  found that over half the local areas already collect information on job  seekers that repeatedly use one-stops, suggesting that some local areas are  already equipped to uniquely identify and track each job seeker. It may  take time and resources for local areas to fully develop the capability to  collect data on each job seeker, but this may be the best way to start  gauging the value of one-stops overall.

For example,  difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources of  information that are available to respondents, or how the data are entered  into a database can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.  We took steps in the development of the questionnaires, the data  collection, and data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For  example, as already noted, we pretested the questionnaires to ensure that  questions were clear and understandable. In that these were Web-based  surveys whereby respondents entered their responses directly into our  database, there was little possibility of data entry error. In addition, we  verified that the computer programs used to analyze the data were written  correctly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Site Visits", "paragraphs": ["We visited three states\u2014Florida, Michigan, and Utah\u2014and traveled to at  least two local areas or one-stop centers in each of these states.
