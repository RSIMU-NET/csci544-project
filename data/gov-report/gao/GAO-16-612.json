This pressure, in turn, threatens its committed November 2018 launch readiness goal. The program has made progress in resolving some technical issues\u2014for example, a major alignment problem with the welding tool for the core stage (SLS's structural backbone and fuel tank) was corrected. Nonetheless, SLS development faces known risks moving forward. While such risks are not unusual for large-scale programs, the program's approach to managing them may increase pressure on the limited reserves. For example, the SLS program has not positioned itself well to provide accurate assessments of core stage progress\u2014including forecasting impending schedule delays, cost overruns, and anticipated costs at completion\u2014because at the time of our review it did not anticipate having the baseline to support full reporting on the core stage contract until summer 2016\u2014some 4.5 years after NASA awarded the contract. Further, unforeseen technical challenges are likely to arise once the program reaches its next phase, final integration for SLS and integration of SLS with its related Orion and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) human spaceflight programs. Any such unexpected challenges are likely to place further pressure on SLS cost and schedule reserves. The figure below shows key events in SLS and EGS launch readiness schedules.", "The EGS program is making progress in modifying selected facilities and equipment to support SLS and Orion, but is encountering technical challenges that require time and money to address. Like SLS, the program has reduced cost and schedule reserves, which threatens its committed November 2018 launch readiness goal. Modifications to two main components\u2014the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the SLS is assembled, and the Mobile Launcher, the vehicle used to bring SLS to the launch pad\u2014have already cost more and taken longer than expected as has development of EGS software. In June 2016, after all the systems necessary to support the first flight test are expected to have a stable design, NASA plans to start an integrated design review to demonstrate that the integrated systems will perform as expected. NASA guidance indicates that this type of review should also evaluate whether mission requirements are being met with acceptable risk within cost and schedule constraints. NASA officials stated that this review will have limited discussion of cost and schedule. Proceeding ahead without reassessing resources, however, could result in the EGS or SLS program exhausting limited resources to maintain pace toward an optimistic November 2018 launch readiness date."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NASA should reevaluate cost and schedule reserves as part of its integrated design review for the first flight test in order to maximize all remaining cost and schedule reserves.

The Exploration Ground  Systems (EGS) program is developing systems and infrastructure to  support assembly, test, and launch of SLS and Orion. The three  programs together are estimated to cost almost $23 billion to demonstrate  initial capabilities that encompass the first planned SLS flight, the ground  systems for that effort, and the first two Orion flights.

For the past 25 years, GAO has designated NASA Acquisition  Management as a high-risk area due to the agency\u2019s struggles with poor  cost estimation, weak oversight, and risk underestimation. GAO\u2019s work  has shown that NASA projects, while producing ground-breaking  research and advancing our understanding of the universe, tend to cost  more and take longer to develop than planned and are often approved  without evidence of a sound business case. In 2014, we found that the  agency continues to make progress toward reducing risk on many of its  major projects, but translating such progress to larger, more complex  projects such as SLS and EGS will be especially important in an era of  constrained budgets and competing priorities. The House Committee on  Appropriations report accompanying H.R. 2578 includes a provision for  GAO to review acquisition progress of NASA\u2019s human exploration  programs including Orion, SLS, and EGS. Specifically, for this review, we  examined the extent to which (1) the SLS program has made progress  meeting cost and schedule commitments; and (2) the EGS program has  made progress in completing modifications to key components and  ground support equipment at Kennedy Space Center. We plan to report  separately in July 2016 on the Orion program. In addition, a bill on the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act for 2016  and 2017, which has not yet been enacted, included language related to  GAO reporting on the extent to which ground systems acquired in support  of SLS are focused directly on that program.

We reviewed  top program and element-level risks as identified by NASA; analyzed the  results of the SLS July 2015 critical design review to determine what  efforts present the highest risk to program cost and schedule; and  analyzed monthly earned value management reports to identify the  largest impacts on cost and schedule. In addition, we assessed SLS  design maturity against established knowledge-based best practice  standards. We compared the status of flight software development efforts  and progress against NASA\u2019s planned release schedule and reviewed the  metrics NASA is using to assess software development status. To assess  the progress of modifications to key components of the EGS program, we  identified the Vehicle Assembly Building, Mobile Launcher, and software  as key EGS components for our review because they are among the top  program risks or the most expensive projects within EGS. To evaluate the  progress made in preparing these components and software to support  the EM-1 test flight, we reviewed program plans and compared them to  program status to assess whether EGS components and software were  progressing as expected, critical design review documents to determine  design maturity, quarterly program status reviews to identify risks, budget  information to assess development costs, and contractor progress reports  to identify any issues contractors faced that could impact cost and  schedule. We also evaluated the program\u2019s integrated master schedule  against the GAO\u2019s best acquisition practices for scheduling in order to  assess the validity of the EGS program\u2019s critical path.

To fulfill this direction, NASA formally established  the SLS program in 2011.

The technical risk is inherent for a variety of  reasons, including the environment in which launch vehicles operate,  complexity of technologies and designs, and limited room for error in the  fabrication and integration process. Managing the development process is  complex for reasons that go well beyond technology and design. For  instance, at the strategic level, because launch vehicle programs can  span many years and be very costly, programs can face difficulties  securing and sustaining funding commitments and support. At the  program level, if the lines of communication between engineers,  managers, and senior leaders are not clear, risks that pose significant  threats could go unrecognized and unmitigated. If there are pressures to  deliver a capability within a short period of time, programs may be  incentivized to overlap development and production activities or delete  tests, which could result in late discovery of significant technical problems  that require more money and ultimately much more time to address. For  these reasons, it is imperative that launch vehicle development efforts  adopt disciplined practices and lessons learned from past programs.", "Best practices for acquisition programs indicate that establishing  baselines that match cost and schedule resources to requirements and  rationally balancing cost, schedule, and performance are key steps in  establishing a successful acquisition program. Our work has also shown  that validating this match before committing resources to development  helps to mitigate the risks inherent in complex acquisition programs such  as SLS and EGS. We have reported that within NASA\u2019s acquisition life  cycle, resources should be matched to requirements at key decision point  (KDP)-C, the review that commits the program to formal cost and  schedule baselines and marks the transition from the formulation phase  into the implementation phase. Best practices for acquisition programs  also indicate that about midway through development, the product\u2019s  design should be stable and demonstrate that it is capable of meeting  performance requirements. The critical design review is the vehicle for  making this determination.

The confidence level is a probabilistic  analysis that provides assurance to stakeholders that programs will meet  cost and schedule targets.", "In addition to the committed cost and launch readiness dates, both  programs are working towards internal goals of earlier launch readiness  dates and lower costs. NASA considers the time between the programs\u2019  internal goals and their committed launch readiness dates as funded  schedule reserve, which is extra time, with the money to pay for it, in the  program\u2019s overall schedule in the event that there are delays or  unforeseen problems. In July 2015, we found that the SLS program\u2019s  internal goal for launch readiness for EM-1 had slipped from December  2017 to July 2018. This reduced the program\u2019s schedule reserve from  eleven months to four months.

In November 2015, prime contractor officials for the core  stage stated that they had implemented all corrective actions  necessary to repair a subcontractor\u2019s improper installation of the  welding tool used to manufacture the 212-foot-tall stage. These  actions were necessary because, as we reported in July 2015, NASA  officials told us that they would have prevented production of the core  stage. As we reported in March 2016, identifying and implementing  the corrective actions was the major contributor to a decrease in the  program\u2019s schedule reserves from 11 months to 4 months. In  addition to resolving the tooling\u2019s misalignment, the SLS program is  making progress with fabricating test articles for core stage  component testing, constructing new test stands where those  components will be subjected to structural testing, and modifying an  existing test stand to support hot-fire testing of the assembled core  stage. SLS program officials stated that they have also made  progress fabricating the EM-1 flight engine section.", "RS-25 engines. In 2015, the program successfully tested RS-25  developmental engines and in March 2016 performed hot-fire testing  of a flight engine. According to NASA officials, these tests  demonstrated the engine could be operated under the conditions it will  encounter when integrated into SLS. The program also began  production of the new engine controller, which directs the RS-25  engines during flight. The contractor, however, is forecasting a  potential cost overrun of $113 million on the engine contract, largely  due to overruns stemming from developing the controller. According  to NASA officials, however, the potential overrun has not affected the  overall program cost or schedule. The factors that contributed to the  overrun include higher than expected parts costs, resolving anomalies  discovered in developmental test, and increasing staffing levels at the  subcontractor to meet schedule demands. NASA officials indicated  that the controller design has been tested in development and the  controller\u2019s qualification testing is front-loaded to drive out problems  early in the test sequence; however, the new controller will not  complete all testing before engine deliveries begin. According to  NASA, if that testing uncovers the need for modifications to the  controller, engines already delivered may have to be brought back  from the flight line so that modifications can be implemented.", "Solid Rocket Boosters. The program completed the first qualification  test of a fully assembled booster in March 2015. Prior X-ray  examination of a booster segment had revealed the presence of  unexpected unbonds between the solid rocket propellant, the  propellant liner, and the new asbestos-free insulation of the solid  rocket boosters that could have potentially caused an explosion.  Resolving the unbond issue contributed to a delay of 20 months in  full-scale qualification testing and, according to NASA officials, the  contractor\u2019s forecast of a potential $129 million cost variance on the  contract did not affect the overall program cost or schedule. The  program is planning to complete a second qualification test of a fully  assembled booster sometime between May and July 2016, which  NASA officials anticipate will further confirm resolution of the unbond  issue.", "ICPS. In October 2015, the SLS program completed work on the test  version of the ICPS. Additionally, in December 2015 the SLS program  began construction of the ICPS liquid oxygen tank, which will provide  liquid oxygen to help power the ICPS.", "In addition, the program as a whole met best acquisition practices design  goals by releasing approximately 92 percent of design drawings for the  program-level Critical Design Review (CDR) in July 2015. Because the  CDR is the time in a project\u2019s life cycle when the integrity of a project\u2019s  design and its ability to meet mission requirements are assessed, it is  important that a project\u2019s design is stable enough to warrant continuation  with design and fabrication, which is evidenced by release of 90 percent  of design drawings at CDR. A stable design allows projects to \u201cfreeze\u201d the  design and minimize changes prior to beginning the fabrication of  hardware.

Further, the  SLS Standing Review Board\u2014an independent NASA team responsible  for reviewing SLS at each major program milestone\u2014found in a 2015  report that it was unlikely the core stage would be able to support the SLS  program\u2019s committed date for launch readiness.

Green run test  activities are currently scheduled to begin in October 2017.", "Boeing and SLS program officials stated that they are working to  establish additional margin within the core stage schedule, but whether  the core stage stays on schedule is largely dependent on the success of  the green run test. Boeing officials told us that they originally had margin  in their schedule for a second green run test if needed, but that it was  removed due to the tight schedule. NASA officials acknowledged that this  schedule existed; however, they also stated that the contingency test was  considered \u201cunauthorized work\u201d for the contractor and the program  baseline only calls for one test. Further, NASA officials stated that if the  test is not successful, then a re-test may have to occur. Additionally they  stated that under current plans, any time required to conduct a re-test  would have to come from program schedule margin or reserve. As a  result, if the program uncovers unexpected performance issues during  green run testing, maintaining the core stage schedule\u2014and thus the  program schedule\u2014may prove difficult.", "The SLS program has also not positioned itself well to provide accurate  assessments of progress with the core stage because it has never had a  performance measurement baseline for the core stage that is necessary  to support full earned value management reporting. Earned value, or the  planned cost of completed work and work in progress, can provide  accurate assessments of project progress, produce early warning signs of  impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and provide unbiased  estimates of anticipated costs at completion. The use of earned value  management, which integrates the project scope of work with cost,  schedule, and performance elements for optimum project planning and  control, is advocated by both GAO\u2019s best practices for cost estimating  and NASA\u2019s own guidance. According to a SLS program official, when  the program and contractor conducted its integrated baseline review\u2014a  joint assessment of the performance measurement baseline by the  government and contractor\u2014the program realized the contractor\u2019s plans  assumed synergies between the core stage and exploration upper stage  efforts that would produce cost savings for the contractor but NASA did  not have the funding to begin this work under the same time frames  identified by the contractor. A SLS program official told us that NASA  asked Boeing to start replanning activities with a proposal that removed  the exploration upper stage development from this contract action. In May  2016, NASA and Boeing signed the contract replan\u2014with a cost increase  of approximately $1 billion, from about $4.2 billion to about $5.2 billion.  However, according to program officials it will probably be summer 2016  before the program receives contractor earned value management data  derived from the new performance measurement baseline\u2014some 4.5  years after contract award. Without this information, the program has  been in a poor position to understand the extent to which technical  challenges with the core stage are having schedule implications or the  extent to which they may require reaching into the program\u2019s cost  reserves. The latter is of concern because as we found in July 2015,  NASA maintains low cost reserves for this program\u2014about $50 million  per year\u2014because program officials stated it has been necessary to  sustain a flat funding profile for SLS as compared to other programs.  Further, at SLS\u2019s KDP-C, NASA approved the program to proceed with  cost reserves of less than 2 percent leading to launch readiness, even  though requirements for Marshall Space Flight Center\u2014the NASA center  with responsibility for the SLS program\u2014indicate that standard cost  reserves for launch vehicle programs should be 20 percent at KDP-C.", "In addition to cost and schedule pressures stemming from the core stage,  development of the flight software\u2014the software that controls the first  phase of SLS flight from liftoff through booster separation and up to main  engine cut off\u2014may require more time than the SLS program anticipates  because the program made a decision to defer its most rigorous testing  until software development nears completion. SLS software developers  have been testing flight software at the end of each of the first five  primary SLS software releases, with the scope of testing in each release  isolated to the set of requirements for that respective release. They plan  to perform the most rigorous testing of the software when the  development reaches the release that will be used for flight qualification  testing, beginning in March 2016, which will include testing against the  most comprehensive set of requirements at that point. The deferral of the  most rigorous testing until the flight qualification release, however, means  that the program\u2019s understanding of the defects to this point may not be  as complete as it believes. This may, in turn, delay completion of software  development while the program takes the time necessary to resolve  defects. As we found in a September 2015 report assessing a Veterans  Benefits Administration software-based processing system, successful  system testing includes appropriately identifying and handling defects that  are discovered during testing. In addition, we found that outstanding  defects can delay the release of functionality to end users, denying them  the benefit of features. The program has allotted one future contingency  release at the end of the software effort for defect repairs, but delaying  the discovery of defects increases the risk that potential problems will  remain undiscovered until the point when few cost or schedule reserves  are available to correct deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systems Integration and Testing for EM-1 May Add Even More Pressure to the Already Reduced Cost and Schedule Reserves", "paragraphs": ["Even if the development phase does not consume any additional cost and  schedule reserves, the SLS program\u2019s EM-1 integration and test phase  may require those resources. Our prior work has shown that this period  often reveals unforeseen challenges leading to cost growth and schedule  delays. Likewise, although superseded through revision, NASA program  management guidance from 2010 states that integration and testing are  among the periods of peak spending, when schedule delays are most  costly, and that programs should maintain sufficient reserves to address  issues encountered during that time, and unknown risks can be managed  only by maintaining sufficient reserves. Compounding this already risky  time period is that the threat to SLS program reserves is two-fold because  SLS EM-1 launch readiness involves in essence two integration efforts.  The first integration effort is to assemble SLS as a launch vehicle and the  second is a cross-program integration effort, which means integrating  SLS, Orion, and EGS to achieve launch readiness in 2018.", "Integrated launch readiness for EM-1 is dependent on the success of the  individual SLS, Orion, and EGS integration efforts. If delays materialize  during individual systems integration and testing, for example, there could  be a cascading effect of cross-program problems. Booster component  shelf life provides a good illustration of this point. According to program  officials, there is a limit on the amount of time the SLS boosters may  remain in a stacked configuration that, if exceeded, would necessitate  destacking and replacement of limited-life items. Program officials told us  that NASA will review these limited-life items prior to stacking the  integrated vehicle, but if launch is delayed longer than limited-life time  frames allow, NASA would have to disassemble SLS from Orion back in  the Vehicle Assembly Building. Such an effort could have broad cost and  schedule impacts across the three programs.", "NASA\u2019s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, which  oversees development of the SLS, EGS, and Orion programs, plans to  conduct a \u201cbuild-to-synchronization\u201d review in summer 2016 to  demonstrate that the integrated launch vehicle, crew vehicle, and ground  systems will perform as expected to meet EM-1 objectives. Human  Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate officials told us that there  is no existing NASA guidance to direct what the build-to-synchronization  review should entail, but that they are tailoring requirements, with agency  leadership concurrence, from NASA program management guidance for  critical design review. According to these officials, the review will serve  essentially as an EM-1 integration critical design review for the programs.  According to NASA program management requirements, a critical design  review for a NASA program would not only evaluate the integrated  design, but also evaluate whether it meets mission requirements with  appropriate margins and acceptable risk within cost and schedule  constraints. As of March 2016, officials leading the planning efforts for  the build-to-synchronization review told us that they were currently  working on developing the terms of reference\u2014which include review  objectives and success criteria\u2014but that they anticipate only limited  discussion of cost and schedule because the review will focus first and  foremost on the hardware and software design maturity of the three  programs. Understanding the technical scope required for EM-1  integrated readiness, however, goes hand-in-hand with knowledge about  how much money and time the individual programs will require to achieve  that readiness. By foregoing a re-evaluation of cost and schedule  reserves at the time it assesses technical scope for EM-1, especially in  light of known pressures on the SLS program\u2019s reserves, NASA risks  missing an opportunity to reevaluate whether sufficient resources are  available to respond to unforeseen challenges during the integration and  testing phase.", "Beyond EM-1, the SLS program continues to face technical as well as  cost and schedule risks. For example, for Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2),  the program will be transitioning from the ICPS in-space propulsion  element to an exploration upper stage providing both ascent performance  and in-space capability. NASA had intended to use the ICPS for EM-2,  which is planned to launch a crewed Orion vehicle beyond the moon to  further test performance. However, the ICPS is not certified to support  crewed flight and NASA estimated it would have to spend at least $150  million on that effort to fly a crewed mission. The Explanatory Statement  to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, while not law, prohibited  the use of NASA funds to human-rate the ICPS. In addition, as part of the  fiscal year 2016 NASA Exploration appropriation, Congress provided that  no less than $85 million of the appropriations should be used for the  development of a new exploration upper stage necessary to build the  Block IB vehicle for deployment on EM-2. NASA officials told us that the  agency intends to have the exploration upper stage complete for EM-2.

EGS officials stated  that the age of the building adds even more challenges, such as dealing  with outdated building drawings and uncertain field conditions. The most  significant of the Vehicle Assembly Building projects is the fabrication and  installation of 10 new platforms which will allow access to the integrated  SLS and Orion vehicles during final assembly.

During testing, NASA observed that the test platform could not  roll out properly and the program was forced to modify the design of the  platforms midway through construction. Resolution of these design issues  involved modifying key mechanical components and installing shims to  properly align the platform during rollout. Program officials said that this  issue has been addressed and is being implemented on all nine  subsequent platforms. NASA is prepared to install additional shimming  during platform installation if necessary. NASA\u2019s interim assessment of  the design contractor for the platforms highlighted numerous quality  issues during design; however, NASA officials ultimately found the design  product at an acceptable level of quality with cost and schedule  requirements having been met.", "Additionally, in December 2015, the first platform was installed in the  Vehicle Assembly Building, but was removed shortly thereafter because  of an installation issue. According to agency officials, the platform \u201cflexed\u201d  slightly when it was lifted via crane for installation due to the weight of the  platform in relation to the lifting points. This flexing kept the platform from  fitting as designed on the bracket that allows the platforms to be moved to  different elevations. The program has designed and fabricated an  installation tool to prevent the platform from flexing when it is lifted for  installation. EGS officials estimate that, if platform design challenges  continue, they could delay the completion of the Vehicle Assembly  Building by up to 3 months, which would affect the EGS program\u2019s  schedule overall. For example, construction on the building\u2019s platforms is  slated to end immediately before the Mobile Launcher is moved into the  Vehicle Assembly Building; officials said there is no margin for additional  delays on the building if it is to be ready for the Mobile Launcher in time.

According to EGS officials, the Mobile Launcher is  the most complex EGS component because it contains more than 900  pieces of ground support equipment needed to support SLS and Orion.  Ground support equipment includes subsystems for propellant and gases,  electronic control systems, communication systems, and access  platforms.

EGS is developing these two software  systems concurrently\u2014SCCS is to operate and monitor ground  equipment needed to launch and communicate with the integrated SLS  and Orion vehicles, and GFAS is to interface with flight systems and  ground crews. EGS software was immature at the program\u2019s Critical  Design Review, and EGS\u2019s Standing Review Board considers the  program\u2019s software development effort the highest risk area. The  Standing Review Board found in February 2016 that the SCCS and GFAS  developments are currently underperforming, are understaffed, and are  waiting on requirements definition from the two flight element programs.  SCCS and GFAS\u2019s completion are dependent on the SLS and Orion also  finishing work on schedule; however, because SCCS and GFAS are  among the last EGS activities scheduled to finish prior to integrated  operations, delays in their completion could force a delay in the program\u2019s  committed November 2018 launch readiness date.", "SCCS Architecture: SCCS development is behind its planned software  release schedule. Program officials attributed the delays, in part, to  requirements maturing late from SLS and Orion. For example, according  to EGS officials, there were initially supposed to be two content drops,  wherein additional functionality is added, for the last two versions of  SCCS. However, as of the program\u2019s critical design review in late 2015,  the two drops had evolved into six content drops. Program officials stated  that the evolution from two drops to six enables content to be released in  an as-needed phased approach to meet stakeholders\u2019 needs and utilize  resources in a more efficient manner. In March 2016, the NASA Office of  the Inspector General reported that SCCS is more than a year behind  schedule and significantly over cost, and that, because of cost and timing  pressures, several planned software capabilities have been deferred,  including the ability to automatically detect the root cause of specific  equipment and system failures. The Office of Inspector General  concluded that these issues largely result from unanticipated complexity  in the way NASA has approached SCCS\u2019s development. Likewise,  program officials told us that developers initially expected ground  systems, Orion, and SLS to require a total of 300,000 compact unique  identifiers, or information fields. However, these officials said that  because EGS is developing software as Orion and SLS are developed,  complete information on how many information fields were necessary for  each program was unavailable at the beginning of the development effort.  SCCS officials have identified a risk that there may be a need for more  than 300,000 total information fields, which could degrade the software  system\u2019s performance and result in cost and schedule overruns.", "As the program\u2019s Standing Review Board concluded, much of EGS\u2019s  software development work is heavily dependent on the final  requirements of the SLS and Orion programs, both of which are still in  development. Program officials indicated that, as all three programs have  developed and EGS has received more information about the  requirements of SLS, Orion, and ground systems, SCCS\u2019s complexity has  increased. To address the added complexity, the EGS program increased  its workforce, but the overall schedule is challenged by hiring difficulties in  a highly competitive environment.

GFAS officials told us that they were optimistic in their  planning regarding the availability of requirements from SLS and Orion to  support software development. For example, EGS officials said that they  expected more mature information about operational requirements to  come out of the Orion and SLS CDRs than what they received. In  September 2015, after EGS officials did not receive early information as  they had anticipated, the program conducted a schedule replan and said  they planned to hire more staff to reduce the risk to the program.

Program budget  documents indicate that the program expects its cost reserve posture to  improve to 13 percent and 9 percent in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and to  level out at around 5 percent in subsequent years. Kennedy Space  Center, which manages the EGS program, does not have guidance for  cost reserves. However, other NASA centers, such as the Goddard  Space Flight Center\u2014the NASA center with responsibility for managing  other complex NASA programs such as the James Webb Space  Telescope\u2014have requirements for the level of both cost and schedule  reserves that projects must have in place at KDP-C. At KDP-C,  Goddard flight projects are required to have cost reserves of 25 percent  or more through operational readiness. At EGS\u2019s KDP-C, however, the  program had cost reserves of only 4 percent leading to launch readiness.", "According to EGS\u2019s Standing Review Board in 2016, the remaining cost  risks to EGS are greater than the program\u2019s current reserve balance. Our  analysis of the maximum potential impact of Mobile Launcher and Vehicle  Assembly Building cost risks on EGS cost reserves support this  assessment. For example, based on the program\u2019s February 2016 risk  assessment, the EGS program could see maximum cost increases of $10  million for the Mobile Launcher and $11 million for the Vehicle Assembly  Building, which is almost double the program\u2019s fiscal year 2016 reserve.  Although these cost increases may not occur in only one fiscal year and  could be less than the maximum value, they could still impact the  program if the planned reserves are either not available as expected or  are not sufficient to cover needs.", "The EGS program is also operating with reduced schedule reserves to  address future construction and software issues. At the time NASA  established EGS\u2019s agency baseline commitment, the program had 5  months of funded schedule reserve between its internal planning date  (June 2018) and its committed launch readiness date (November 2018).  The program is now internally planning to a launch readiness date of  September 2018, which reduces the program\u2019s schedule reserve to 2  months. However, the EGS program must be ready well in advance of  this launch readiness date in order to integrate SLS and Orion at the  Kennedy Space Center and the program plans to be ready to begin  integrated operations with SLS in January 2018. EGS has 3 months of  margin before the start of integrated operations, and 1 additional month of  margin before its internal goal for launch. See figure 8 for a timeline of  EGS\u2019s lifecycle relative to SLS for EM-1.", "Moving forward, relying on the critical path to determine available  reserves may prove problematic because the program\u2019s scheduling  practices are fairly limited. The EGS program identifies its critical path as  including the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Mobile Launcher in  program quarterly management reports, but we were not able to replicate  this critical path. Our analysis of the EGS critical path identified  inconsistencies between the critical path identified by the software used  to create and maintain the program\u2019s integrated master schedule and the  critical path called out in the program\u2019s quarterly management reports.  Our best practices for scheduling indicate that a program\u2019s integrated  master schedule should identify the program\u2019s critical path rather than  critical activities being selectively chosen based on what management  has determined to be important. Establishing a valid critical path is  necessary for examining the effects of any activities slipping along this  path. Based on our limited review, the critical path in the program\u2019s  integrated master schedule does not match the critical path in the  program\u2019s quarterly management reports. EGS program management  acknowledged that the two paths did not match, and indicated that they  intentionally do not rely solely on the scheduling software\u2019s generated  critical path because it includes non-EGS development activities, such as  SLS and Orion flight hardware deliveries. We plan to further research the  inconsistencies we identified as part of planned future work on NASA\u2019s  human exploration systems.", "Integration of EGS with the SLS and Orion programs will be reviewed by  the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate at the build- to-synchronization review in summer 2016.

Further, threats to the  margin and schedule reserve for EGS can occur from delays within the  program or delays within the Orion and SLS programs.

In other cases, NASA\u2019s  approach to dealing with the known risks is exacerbating the challenges.  For example, in some cases the SLS program has not positioned itself  well to accurately forecast and proactively manage potential schedule  delays and cost overruns, which in turn, may ultimately lead to cost and  schedule growth that could stretch the program beyond its committed  baseline. An opportunity is nearing in NASA\u2019s upcoming build-to- synchronization process to not only determine whether the integrated  launch vehicle, crew vehicle, and ground systems will perform as  expected to meet EM-1 objectives, but to also revisit whether cost and  schedule reserves are sufficient. Given the mission of the EM-1 test flight,  NASA does not have to meet a specific schedule window for its launch  date as it often does with planetary missions. As a result, NASA is in the  position of being able to make an informed decision about what is a  realistic launch readiness date.
