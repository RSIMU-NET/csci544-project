Private lenders seemed reluctant to provide capital financing at reasonable terms. The purpose of the program is to \u201cassist the provision of urgently needed hospitals for the care and treatment of persons who are acutely ill . . ..\u201d Consequently, Section 242 authorized HUD to provide insurance for hospital mortgages secured from lenders to finance the construction and renovation of hospitals.", "Many hospitals need to borrow money from lenders to finance construction and renovation projects. Lenders often raise capital by selling bonds to investors and use the hospitals\u2019 mortgage payments to pay bondholders. Mortgage insurance, like private bond insurance, guarantees that bondholders will be paid if the hospital stops making payments on its loan. According to the Health Care Financing Study Group, about 60 percent of hospitals that seek financing require insurance to enhance their credit because they cannot get a loan on their own financial strength. Eighty-three percent of these hospitals can get private bond insurance but about 17 percent cannot because private insurers consider them too risky. Some hospitals that cannot get private mortgage insurance apply to FHA\u2019s hospital insurance program.", "FHA\u2019s Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program staff and HHS\u2019 Division of Facilities Loans staff jointly manage the hospital program. The Congress gave HUD statutory responsibility for the program. The House Committee on Banking and Currency, in recommending that HUD be given this responsibility, cited FHA\u2019s more than 35 years of experience with promoting housing construction through its housing insurance programs. The Committee was concerned, however, that HUD\u2019s staff did not have specialized knowledge of health care needed to administer this program. As a result, the Committee recommended and the Congress enacted the requirement that a state agency must certify that a hospital is needed before it can participate in the program. Also, the Committee expected HUD to draw upon HHS\u2019 hospital expertise to devise standards for insuring hospitals\u2019 mortgages. Through a memorandum of agreement, HUD formally delegated authority to HHS to review and approve proposals for hospitals\u2019 mortgage insurance. HUD retained authority to make the final insurance commitment and endorse the mortgage note.", "The Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program requires hospitals to have the state certify the need for the proposed projects and then meet underwriting criteria before insurance applications can be approved. Since 1988, hospitals have obtained FHA insurance approval to construct acute care facilities, ambulatory care centers, and operating rooms and to renovate maternity and emergency departments and surgical suites. In addition, hospitals have obtained approval to purchase equipment, install new computer and fire alarm systems, and build parking facilities.", "The use of hospital inpatient services, however, has declined over time.

FHA recovered about $64 million of claim payments from mortgage payments and the sale of the mortgages or properties. As of September 30, 1994, 19 hospitals had defaulted; FHA disposed of 10 and retained loan management responsibility for the remaining 9 hospitals.

Except for Medicare, New York utilizes an all-payer fixed rate system to reimburse hospitals. The state controls all third-party payers\u2019 rates of payments by setting a fixed payment for each hospital based on patient diagnoses. The rate-setting system is a regulatory method of budgeting for hospitals. The goals of the rate-setting system are cost containment and access to hospital care. However, New York state officials said that this system constrains hospitals\u2019 profitability, which weakens their creditworthiness. According to a Moody\u2019s Investors Service report, New York hospitals\u2019 credit ratings are the weakest in the nation.", "In other states, hospitals\u2019 credit ratings are generally stronger, which enables many of them to access capital in the private market. These hospitals primarily rely on bond financing backed by their revenues and projected ability to make loan payments or by commercial bond insurance instead of FHA\u2019s Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program. In contrast, private insurers are reluctant to back bond sales to finance some New York hospital projects because the hospitals are considered too risky."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concentration of Insured Projects in New York Poses Program Risks", "paragraphs": ["The lack of portfolio geographic diversification and the large individual unpaid loan balances in New York pose a risk to the program. The concentration of the portfolio in New York makes the program susceptible to New York policies and other factors specific to the state. The strength of a portfolio lies in its diversity because portfolio diversification decreases the risk from losses. In addition, a single default of a large loan could lead to insurance claims that could significantly burden the program. A 1992 HUD report stated that the concentration of FHA-insured projects in a single state and large loan amounts are major controllable risks to the program that should be avoided or minimized.", "FHA does not limit the number of projects in a particular state nor does it cap individual loan amounts it insures as a means of controlling risks to the program. The legislation authorizes the Secretary of HUD to set the terms and conditions under which HUD will insure projects, but the law does not specifically authorize FHA to limit the number of projects accepted into the program from a geographic area or to limit the loan amounts it insures. In fact, in 1974, the Congress removed existing caps on loan amounts.", "FHA officials stated that they are taking action to diversify the portfolio by marketing the program to attract hospitals from other states. For example, FHA officials reported working with mortgage bankers to increase program awareness to hospitals outside New York. They reported that, as of August 1995, they had received four applications from hospitals in Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico. By expanding the portfolio, FHA also increases the program\u2019s total outstanding mortgage amount. Officials involved in the financing of hospital projects told us that hospitals in other states may not be interested in the FHA program for several reasons, including the program\u2019s high premiums, lengthy application process, and a lack of program awareness.", "For some future hospital projects, FHA is considering ways to reduce the risk of financial losses. For example, FHA is considering a proposal to establish risk-sharing arrangements with the public and private sector. According to FHA officials, the risk-sharing partner would assume underwriting responsibilities, have an equity position in the hospital, and share in any losses that result from defaults. In an October 1993 report, we noted that HUD terminated FHA\u2019s multifamily housing coinsurance program in January 1990. The program enabled FHA to share the risk of insuring a multifamily mortgage with participating lenders.

Recent changes in New York\u2019s Medicaid policy would reduce hospitals\u2019 patient revenues and could increase program hospitals\u2019 risk of default. The New York state fiscal year 1996 budget contains health care cost-cutting measures that are estimated to reduce state Medicaid hospital spending by $138 million, resulting in an estimated total hospital revenue loss of $553 million. State analyses of the reduction in Medicaid spending for individual hospitals estimate that FHA-insured hospitals will lose $170 million in Medicaid revenue. Also, individual program hospitals may lose between 0.31 percent and 4.25 percent of total revenues.", "Some New York hospitals\u2019 already marginal operating margins may deteriorate further as a result of the loss in Medicaid revenue. Our analysis of 1994 Health Care Financing Administration data for 52 program hospitals in New York indicates that 49 had negative operating margins. The average operating margin for the 52 hospitals was \u20135.6 percent. Our analysis shows that, on average, operating margins for the 52 hospitals would deteriorate by 26 percent in 1 year because of the state\u2019s reduction in Medicaid spending. Thus, the ability of some of these hospitals to absorb the cuts and possible future state Medicaid spending reductions without defaulting on their FHA-insured loans is questionable.", "In the past, state policy changes have precipitated hospital defaults. For example, three hospital defaults in Illinois resulted in a $27 million loss to the program. According to a 1992 HUD report, two of these defaults were caused, in part, by the state setting a Medicaid reimbursement rate that was too low to cover the hospital\u2019s cost of treating Medicaid patients or the state delaying Medicaid reimbursement to hospitals.", "The extent to which New York hospitals are able to reduce expenses will affect their ability to withstand revenue losses. According to FHA, HHS, and New York health care officials, hospitals are expected to reduce expenses and implement revenue enhancers to mitigate Medicaid revenue losses and remain viable. Hospitals with large Medicaid caseloads are particularly vulnerable to reductions in Medicaid spending. Our analysis of 1994 data from 52 New York program hospitals shows that for about one-third of the hospitals, their Medicaid inpatient days were greater than 25 percent. Plans developed by New York program hospitals to respond to the state\u2019s Medicaid cuts include cost-containment measures, such as reducing staff, salaries, and benefits and revenue enhancement measures, such as decreasing the length of stay and increasing admissions. Hospital and hospital organization officials reported that some hospitals had already begun taking cost-cutting measures before the budget decision was made. In reaction to the cuts, FHA required New York hospitals awaiting application approval to submit sensitivity analyses on the impact of the cuts. In addition, HHS required New York program hospitals to submit an action plan for responding to the cuts. After evaluating the hospitals\u2019 responses, FHA and HHS increased their monitoring efforts for those hospitals identified as most vulnerable to the cuts.", "In addition to changes in state policies, future changes in federal health care policies can also restrict hospitals\u2019 revenues. For example, the Fiscal Year 1996 Congressional Budget Resolution proposes cumulative Medicare reductions of $270 billion, from current law projections, over the next 7 years. In addition, the Budget Resolution proposes reducing Medicaid outlays by about $180 billion.

One major shift in the way health care is delivered is the change from a focus on hospital inpatient care to outpatient care. From 1983 through 1993, there were 5.4 million or 15 percent fewer community hospital admissions nationwide. Over the same period, the average length of stay for patients admitted to hospitals declined from 7.6 to 7.0 days. American Hospital Association (AHA) data show for the same 10-year period that hospital occupancy rates declined by 10 percent and 522 community hospitals closed\u2014a decline of 9 percent. In contrast, more dramatic than the decline in inpatient hospital use was the increase in hospital outpatient visits. Community outpatient visits increased about 75 percent over the 10-year period. This change in outpatient volume reflects an overall restructuring of the health care delivery system.", "Some of the factors driving the trends in health care include advances in technology that allow more care to be delivered in outpatient settings; changes in reimbursement incentives, such as the introduction of diagnostic related groups under the prospective payment system in the early 1980s; and the growth of enrollment in managed care health plans. As these trends continue, the need for hospital acute care beds will continue to decline. Health care association representatives cite managed care as a significant trend facing some hospitals. Because of the increased enrollment in managed care plans, hospitals that cannot become a part of a managed care network or compete in this environment stand to suffer financially from a loss of market share.", "Understanding the overall impact of these health care trends on the future need of the program would require further analysis which was beyond the scope of this review. Any such analysis should have to consider, at a minimum, (1) the characteristics of program hospitals compared with nonprogram hospitals accessing capital, (2) the ability of program hospitals to obtain financing on the private market without FHA mortgage insurance, (3) the costs and benefits of the program including the public good that the program serves, and (4) the program\u2019s underwriting criteria and premium structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managed Care Penetration in New York Could Affect Viability of Program Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["The growth of managed care in New York can negatively affect some FHA-insured hospitals\u2019 financial condition and, as a result, increase the risk of financial loss to the insurance program.

Managed care emphasizes health care cost control, which includes avoiding unnecessary admissions and lengthy stays.", "Managed care also focuses on cost and utilization control measures. However, few New York hospitals have experienced managed care pricing and utilization controls. New York hospitals may be at a disadvantage in a managed care market because they generally have high lengths of stay. In addition, according to a Moody\u2019s Investors Service report, \u201cin a managed care market where the key variable is cost, the generally high-cost urban teaching facilities which are disproportionately located in New York, will definitely be at a disadvantage.\u201d", "In addition, these hospitals have large teaching and research costs and significant fixed costs tied to their large physical plants and debt loads. The potential effect on teaching hospitals can be important to the program because, according to FHA data, the program insures 44 teaching hospitals of which 34, or 77 percent, are in New York.", "Hospitals that reduce costs and develop cooperative relationships with other health care providers may be able to mitigate the negative financial impact of managed care. Some program hospitals in New York and other states are affiliating and forming networks with other health care providers to reduce costs and increase service area. For example, one hospital reduced costs by establishing an affiliate in which financial and support services were consolidated and shared within its provider network. In addition, several hospitals reported affiliating with community hospitals and physician groups, as well as developing satellite clinics to broaden their patient base.", "An HHS official stated that, in reviewing hospitals\u2019 applications, HHS considers whether the hospitals are preparing for managed care and addressing other health care trends. In addition, according to an HHS official, HHS examines affiliate contracts and insures that the contracts are not a drain on the hospitals\u2019 finances.

The assumptions that FHA used to estimate key variables such as default probabilities and the actual loss rates were not directly linked to or justified by a detailed documented analysis of loss exposure in the hospital mortgage insurance portfolio. In an October 1994 report we discuss this principle as it applies to depositary institutions. Further, FHA\u2019s methodology did not incorporate some health care market trends that are likely to impact the future financial performance of program hospitals. The net effect of the methodological flaws on the reserve estimate is unclear because FHA\u2019s default assumptions and their exclusion of market trends could overstate or understate the loan loss reserve estimate.", "In estimating loan loss reserves, FHA\u2014which is subject to the Government Corporation Control Act\u2014is required to follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for financial statement reporting purposes. However, in our October 1994 report, we stated that this authoritative accounting guidance, established for private sector institutions, does not provide sufficiently detailed direction for establishing loan loss reserves. As a result, our evaluation of the methodology used by FHA is based on this general GAAP principle for loss recognition and our experience in applying other principles in other situations involving the estimation of loan loss reserves."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assumptions Not Based on Detailed Analysis of Loss Exposure in the Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s assumptions regarding default probabilities and loss rates were not supported by analysis of the loss exposure of each individual insured loan or other evidence that justified the estimates used. Specifically, FHA computed the probability of each program hospital appearing on HHS\u2019 Credit Watch List and then used these probabilities as proxies to measure the default probability of each hospital in the portfolio. The probability of a hospital being on the Credit Watch List, however, is not a valid proxy for estimating the default probabilities for the entire portfolio because a hospital appearing on this list is a more common occurrence than a hospital defaulting. HHS\u2019 data show that from 1984 to 1994 there were on average 167 hospitals in FHA\u2019s portfolio. During this period, 16 hospitals (or 9.6 percent) defaulted on their loans and there were 82 hospitals on the Credit Watch List (49 percent). HHS data indicate that the majority of the default probabilities that FHA used to calculate the loan loss reserve were higher than the actual default rate of hospitals in the program. FHA\u2019s approach for measuring default probabilities resulted in estimates of program hospitals\u2019 default probabilities that ranged from about 3 to 80 percent with the majority of the default probabilities in the 10 to 40 percent range. However, FHA\u2019s approach may have underreserved for loans that have high default probabilities because FHA did not consider the full unpaid principle balance when applying the loss percentages.Moreover, FHA\u2019s use of the Credit Watch List overstates the hospitals\u2019 default probabilities for loans less likely to default. FHA officials reported that they preferred to use the Credit Watch List as an indicator of the probability of default because, in their view, the Credit Watch List provides a prospective approach to estimating defaults.", "Regarding the loss rates, FHA applied percentages that were in some instances arbitrarily set and not linked to documented evidence of the individual insured loan\u2019s likely losses. For example, FHA assigned the historical average loss rate of 70 percent to the hospitals it predicted were most likely to default on their mortgages (that is, hospitals with estimated default probabilities of 50 percent or more) and graduated downward the loss rate for hospitals that had estimated default probabilities lower than 50 percent. The 70-percent loss rate was based on losses HUD experienced from the sale at foreclosure or property disposition of eight of the nine hospital mortgages taken into inventory and sold since 1974. However, a better method for estimating the loan loss reserve would be to do a comprehensive analysis of the individual loss exposure for defaults considered probable\u2014hospital loans with 50 percent or higher default probabilities. This entails not only reviewing the financial condition of the hospital, which FHA did, but considering other factors such as the likelihood of foreclosure versus FHA continuing to carry the loan. Further, FHA had no justifiable basis for the loss rate percentages applied to the hospitals that had default probabilities lower than 50 percent. FHA\u2019s rationale was that in the future it could recover more from disposing of hospitals with default probabilities below 50 percent because these hospitals are considered to be stronger financially, based on the hospitals\u2019 financial condition in 1994. FHA arbitrarily assumed that these hospitals would default later and have a higher value at the time of sale because they would have a broader patient base and higher net patient revenue. We question the validity of these assumptions because FHA provided no analysis to support the loss rates applied to hospitals with a lower than 50 percent probability of default. Because FHA had no basis for the loss rate percentages used for these categories of loans, it may be misstating the loan loss reserve estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Care Market Trends That Might Affect the Future Viability of the Program Were Not Included in the Analysis", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s loan loss reserve methodology did not incorporate newly developed events, such as health care market trends, that can affect the future financial condition of program hospitals.

The continued buildup in New York may further exacerbate this risk. Further, trends in health care and changes in state and federal health care policies that reduce hospitals\u2019 revenues will impact program hospitals.", "FHA officials are aware of the risks of concentration and health care changes associated with the current portfolio. Portfolio concentration is a controllable program risk for the future. But the law that authorizes the Secretary of HUD to set the terms and conditions under which HUD will insure projects does not specifically authorize FHA to use as options for diversifying the portfolio, limiting the number of projects accepted into the program from a geographic area, or limiting the amounts it insures. Health care trends and changes in health care policies are risks beyond FHA\u2019s control. Hospitals currently in the FHA program must make adjustments to respond to these changes or they could suffer significant financial losses. To reduce the potential financial losses associated with future insured mortgages, FHA is considering risk sharing with the public and private sectors. However, the risk to the current portfolio remains.", "Flaws in FHA\u2019s methodology for estimating loan losses limit the reliability of FHA\u2019s loan loss reserve estimate. The implications of health care trends for program hospitals were not factored into FHA\u2019s methodology for estimating potential loan losses.

Thus, FHA\u2019s historical analysis was not statistically significant and was based on information that was not adjusted for current real estate market trends. We believe that FHA\u2019s use of this historical analysis to determine loss reserves for loans where default is considered more likely than not (that is, hospital loans with 50-percent or higher default probabilities) may overstate or understate the reserves on these loans. We believe that individual loan analysis of mortgages in the current portfolio provides for a more accurate means to measure loss exposure on loans where default is considered more likely than not.", "Although as a matter of generally accepted practice, using historical data may under some circumstances be appropriate for groups of loans with a lower than 50-percent default probability, FHA arbitrarily adjusted a questionable 70-percent loss rate downward for such loans and provided no supporting analysis to justify the resultant loss rates.

Our report cites the statements of HUD officials that the program supports and is consistent with the Department\u2019s mission.

Despite these reasons and recent actions taken in efforts to address these risks, the program\u2019s concentration and the large individual unpaid loan balances in New York continue to pose program risks. Specifically, the concentration of the portfolio in New York makes the program susceptible to New York policies and other factors specific to the state.

According to HUD comments, these actions include increasing program awareness and developing new products to meet market demands. Although we recommended that HUD pursue risk-sharing arrangements and suggested that the Congress consider exploring with HUD options for reducing program risks; for example, by limiting the program\u2019s risk exposure in a particular state and capping mortgage insurance amounts, we do not endorse expanding FHA\u2019s Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program. By expanding the program, FHA increases the program\u2019s total outstanding mortgage amount.
