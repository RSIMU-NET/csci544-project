IRS uses its computer systems to, among other things, process tax returns, maintain taxpayer data, calculate interest and penalties, and generate refunds. IRS operates facilities throughout the United States that process tax returns and other information supplied by taxpayers. The data are then electronically transmitted to master files of taxpayer information that are maintained and updated. Because of IRS\u2019 heavy reliance on its facilities, effective security controls are critical to IRS\u2019 ability to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive taxpayer data, safeguard assets, and ensure the reliability of financial management information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Computer Security Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Federal law, Department of the Treasury directives, and IRS\u2019 own internal policies and procedures require the implementation of sound security practices and standards. The Computer Security Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act require, among other things, the establishment of standards and guidelines for ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems. Similarly, IRS\u2019 tax information security guidelines require that all computer and communications systems that process, store, or transmit taxpayer data adequately protect these data, and the Internal Revenue Code prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of federal returns and return information outside IRS. To adequately comply with these guidelines, IRS must ensure that (1) access to computer data, systems, and facilities is properly restricted and monitored, (2) changes to computer systems software are properly authorized and tested, (3) backup and recovery plans are prepared, tested, and maintained to ensure continuity of operations in the case of a disaster, and (4) data communications are adequately protected from unauthorized intrusion and interception.", "The need for strong and effective computer security over taxpayer information is clear. IRS computer systems contain sensitive taxpayer information such as name, address, social security number, and details on each taxpayer\u2019s financial holdings. As we previously reported, these and similar types of information have been used to commit financial crimes and identity fraud nationwide. Commonly reported financial crimes include using someone\u2019s personal information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or take over and deplete existing financial accounts. Taxpayers can suffer injury to their reputations when credit is fraudulently established and debts incurred in their names. Bad credit could in turn lead to difficulties in obtaining loans or jobs and require a lengthy and expensive process to clear one\u2019s personal records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Work on IRS Computer Security", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 5 years, we have reviewed the effectiveness of IRS security and general controls as part of our annual audit of IRS\u2019 financial statements. During this period, we testified and reported numerous times on the ineffectiveness of these controls in safeguarding IRS computer systems and facilities. In April 1997, we reported on serious weaknesses at five IRS facilities that we visited. These weaknesses were in eight functional areas, which are (1) physical security, (2) logical security,(3) data communications management, (4) risk analysis, (5) quality assurance, (6) internal audit and security, (7) security awareness, and (8) contingency planning. We also noted that IRS\u2019 ability to monitor and detect the unauthorized access and perusal of electronic taxpayer records by IRS employees, also known as browsing, was limited. We reported that until these weaknesses are corrected, IRS runs the risk of its tax processing operations being disrupted and taxpayer data being improperly used, modified, or destroyed. Because of the seriousness of the weaknesses, we recommended, among other things, that IRS (1) reevaluate its current approach to computer security and report its plans for improving computer security to the Congress and (2) prepare and submit a plan to the Congress for correcting all the weaknesses identified at the five facilities and for identifying and correcting security weaknesses at the other IRS facilities.", "In 1997, the Congress passed the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Actwhich amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make unlawful unauthorized access and inspection of taxpayer records a crime and to establish penalties for unlawful access and inspection of taxpayer records."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of our review were to determine and summarize the status of the computer-related general control weaknesses identified at the five IRS facilities discussed in our April 1997 report and to assess the effectiveness of computer controls at a sixth facility.", "To determine the effectiveness of IRS\u2019 corrective actions taken to resolve these weaknesses, we interviewed agency officials responsible for correcting them, reviewed these officials\u2019 action plans and status reports, and conducted on-site evaluations to verify the effectiveness of corrective actions taken. Our on-site evaluations of IRS computer-related general controls were conducted in conjunction with our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 custodial financial statements and with the assistance of the independent public accounting firm which also participated in the review supporting our April 1997 report. Our evaluations included the review of related IRS policies and procedures; on-site tests and observations of computer-related controls; and discussions with IRS headquarters and facility personnel, security representatives, and other pertinent officials at the locations visited. Our evaluation did not include external penetration testing of IRS computer facilities.", "We performed evaluations at six IRS facilities\u2014the five facilities visited during our previous review and one additional facility.

As shown in figure 1, each of these activities is linked in a cycle to help ensure that business risks are continually monitored, policies and procedures are regularly updated, and controls are in effect.", "The risk management cycle begins with an assessment of risks and a determination of needs. This assessment includes identifying cost-effective policies and related controls. The policies and controls, as well as the risks that prompted their adoption, must be communicated to those responsible for complying with them and implemented. Finally, and perhaps most important, there must be procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of policies and related controls and reporting the resulting conclusions to those who can take appropriate corrective action. In addition, our study found that a strong central security management focal point can help ensure that the major elements of the risk management cycle are carried out and can serve as a communications link among organizational units.", "Since our April 1997 report, IRS has taken several actions consistent with the risk management cycle described above to improve its servicewide computer security management program. For example, IRS created the Office of Systems Standards and Evaluation as the central focal point for computer security within IRS, published revised computer security policies and procedures, promoted security awareness, and is evaluating controls at many of its facilities. However, several actions have not yet been completed or performed. For example, IRS has not fully (1) assessed risks for all of its facilities, networks, major systems, and data, (2) evaluated controls over key computing resources, and (3) implemented actions to eliminate or mitigate all of the weaknesses identified during computer control evaluations. IRS is planning or taking actions to implement these elements as part of its new strategy for its servicewide computer security management program.

Serious weaknesses still persist at all five of the facilities included in our April 1997 report and at a sixth facility reviewed in conjunction with this audit. Our current review identified weaknesses that remain uncorrected at the five facilities visited during our prior audit and additional weaknesses we identified at those locations and at a sixth facility included in this review. The weaknesses primarily pertained to the following six functional areas: physical security, logical security, data communications, risk analysis, quality assurance, and contingency planning.

We found continuing and new physical security weaknesses at the facilities visited. The following are examples of weaknesses that have not yet been corrected.", "Access to sensitive computing areas, such as computer rooms, data communications areas, and tape libraries was not adequately controlled.

Logical security control measures include the use of safeguards incorporated in computer hardware, system and application software, communication hardware and software, and related devices. These safeguards include user identification codes, passwords, access control lists, and security software programs. Logical controls restrict the access of legitimate users to the specific systems, programs, and files they need to conduct their work and prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to computing resources. Controls over access to and modification of system software are essential to protect the overall integrity and reliability of information systems.", "We identified weaknesses relating to logical security controls at the six sites reviewed. Examples of uncorrected vulnerabilities include the following.", "Computer support personnel whose job responsibilities did not require it were given the ability to change, alter, or delete taxpayer data and associated programs.", "Access to system software was not limited to individuals with a need to know.

Individuals without a need to know had access to key system logs that provided the capability to perform unauthorized system activities and then alter the audit trail to avoid detection.", "Tapes and disks containing taxpayer data were not overwritten prior to reuse, thus potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and computer programs.", "Security software was not configured to provide optimum security over tape media.", "In addition, IRS\u2019 ability to detect and monitor unauthorized access by employees remains limited. The information system, Electronic Audit Research Log, developed by IRS to monitor and detect browsing can not detect all instances of browsing or unauthorized access to taxpayer records because it only monitors employees using the Integrated Data Retrieval System, the primary computer system IRS employees use to access and adjust taxpayer accounts. The Electronic Audit Research Log does not monitor the activities of IRS employees using other systems, such as the Distributed Input System and Totally Integrated Examination System, which are also used to create, access, or modify taxpayer data. In addition, the Electronic Audit Research Log does not adequately distinguish potential unauthorized accesses to taxpayer data from legitimate activity. As a result, the effort to investigate potential unauthorized accesses is time-consuming and difficult. IRS is developing a new system, the Audit Trail Lead Analysis System, which is intended to improve its capability to distinguish between unauthorized accesses and legitimate activity. If properly implemented, this system would improve IRS\u2019 capability to detect unauthorized accesses to taxpayer data. However, the Audit Trail Lead Analysis System is not scheduled to be implemented until January 1999 and will only monitor the activities of IRS employees using the Integrated Data Retrieval System and not other systems used to create, access, or modify taxpayer data.", "As a result of these logical security weaknesses, taxpayer and other sensitive data and programs were placed at unnecessary risk of unauthorized modification, loss, and disclosure without detection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Communications", "paragraphs": ["Data communications management is the function of monitoring and controlling communications networks to ensure that they operate as intended and securely transmit timely, accurate, and reliable data.
