When acting as fiduciaries, they must act prudently and solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The Department of Labor (Labor) is responsible for protecting private pension plan participants and beneficiaries by enforcing ERISA. GAO examined: (1) common 401(k) plan features, which typically have important fiduciary implications, and factors affecting these decisions; (2) challenges sponsors face in fulfilling their fiduciary obligations when overseeing plan operations; and (3) actions Labor takes to ensure that sponsors fulfill their fiduciary obligations, and the progress Labor has made on its regulatory initiatives. To address these objectives, GAO administered a survey asking sponsors how they select plan features and oversee operations, reviewed industry research, conducted interviews, and reviewed related documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Plan sponsors commonly select certain noninvestment and investment features, and their decisions about which investment features to select generally have important fiduciary implications. According to industry research, most 401(k) plans offer a number of common features, such as employer contributions and loans for employees. Some of these decisions seldom involve fiduciary obligations set by ERISA because they are mainly business decisions related to establishing the plan. However, a sponsor's decisions about investment features, like the menu of investment options, entail important fiduciary obligations under ERISA. ERISA and its regulations stipulate certain requirements for these investment decisions, like offering diversified funds and prudently selecting and monitoring investment options. Various other factors also affect a sponsor's menu decisions, including the size of the plan and the role of external advisers and other providers. Plan sponsors face challenges in fulfilling their obligations when fiduciary roles are not clearly defined or when sponsors lack important information about arrangements between service providers. Fiduciary roles that are not clearly defined can lead to gaps in plan oversight. For example, several industry professionals noted situations when sponsors assumed they had delegated fiduciary investment advice for the selection and monitoring of investment funds to a service provider, but the service provider did not acknowledge that fiduciary role. Sponsors also have fiduciary obligations when selecting and monitoring one or more service providers. To fulfill these obligations, Labor's guidance indicates that sponsors should obtain information about service providers' compensation arrangements and potential conflicts of interest that could affect the service provider's performance. Labor and various industry practitioners have proposed new ways to improve fiduciary oversight that may address some of the challenges of unclear fiduciary roles and providers' arrangements. Labor takes various actions to monitor sponsors' fiduciary oversight of 401(k) plans and has made some progress on its regulatory initiatives. Labor's actions include investigating reports of questionable 401(k) plan practices, collecting information from plan sponsors, and conducting outreach to educate plan sponsors about their responsibilities. Labor is also proceeding with several initiatives to improve disclosures to participants, plan sponsors, government agencies and the public. For example, Labor recently published a proposed rule on the information that service providers must disclose to plan sponsors but is trying to resolve several questions before issuing a final rule. In addition, certain matters that GAO has asked Congress to consider would help Labor in its efforts to improve sponsors' fiduciary oversight. We previously suggested that Congress amend ERISA to (1) explicitly require 401(k) service providers to disclose to plan sponsors the compensation they receive from other service providers and (2) give Labor authority to recover plan losses against certain types of service providers even if they are not currently considered fiduciaries under ERISA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two decades, American workers have become increasingly  reliant on 401(k) plans for their retirement security. These employer- sponsored pension plans typically allow workers to divert a portion of  their pretax income, often with employer contributions, into an investment  account that can grow tax free until withdrawn in retirement. According to  the Department of Labor (Labor), in 2005, there were about 436,000 401(k)  plans that held about $2.4 trillion in assets for the retirement savings of  more than 54 million plan participants\u2014more than any other type of  employer-sponsored pension plan in the United States. To administer  these plans, the sponsor\u2014typically the employer offering the 401(k)  plan\u2014selects plan features and other characteristics, including the types  of investment options offered to participants, and monitors the  performance of one or more service providers, such as investment  advisers and record keepers. The Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974 (ERISA) imposes significant fiduciary obligations on plan  sponsors and other plan fiduciaries, requiring them to act prudently and in  the interests of the plan\u2019s participants and beneficiaries. Labor is  responsible for ensuring that plan sponsors and other plan fiduciaries  fulfill these obligations.", "In two recent reports, we asked Congress to consider amending ERISA to  expand Labor\u2019s statutory authority over plan service providers and help  ensure that sponsors are properly overseeing plan services. While  Congress continues to consider new legislation, Labor has also tried to  address some of these underlying issues through regulatory initiatives. As  Congress considers changes to the law that governs how these plans are  designed, managed, and overseen, GAO was asked to identify the  following:    common 401(k) plan features, those that typically have important  fiduciary implications, and what factors affect these decisions;    challenges sponsors face in fulfilling their fiduciary obligations when  overseeing plan operations; and    actions Labor takes to ensure that sponsors fulfill their fiduciary  obligations, and the progress Labor has made on its regulatory initiatives.", "To determine common plan features and which decisions typically have  fiduciary implications and related factors, and the challenges sponsors  face in fulfilling their fiduciary obligations, we collected and analyzed the  results of published industry research. We also collected information on  sponsor practices from a range of plan sponsors, service providers,  industry associations, and other industry professionals\u2014including  fiduciary advisers\u2014through interviews and reviews of documents, such as  materials on fiduciary obligations given by service providers to sponsors.

Because of  the methodological limitations of this survey, information from this survey  is anecdotal and represents only the views of the 448 survey respondents.  To determine the actions that Labor takes to ensure that sponsors fulfill  their fiduciary obligations, we interviewed Labor officials and reviewed  Labor\u2019s legal and regulatory authority and its procedures for assuring that  plans are meeting the overall requirements.

The Internal Revenue Code sets forth parallel prohibited transaction  provisions with respect to \u201cdisqualified persons,\u201d such as service  providers, and provides a parallel conditional exemption for the provision  of services.  The exemption requires that: (1) the contract or arrangement  must be reasonable, (2) the services must be necessary to operate the  plan, and (3) the compensation can not exceed what is reasonable for the  services provided.

While Benefits Advisors do not  have investigative authority and cannot make formal demands on  employers or plan sponsors, they are authorized to request that the  employer, plan sponsor, or other appropriate third-party official provide  documents or information related to a participant\u2019s complaint on an  individual or plan-wide basis. EBSA\u2019s Benefits Advisors may also attempt  to resolve the complaints and correct any violations on a plan-wide basis  through informal dispute resolution. If the complaint involves unremitted  or untimely employee contributions, Benefits Advisors can request  information from the plan sponsor and, after review, advise the plan on  the amount of contributions due. In fiscal year 2007, $5.8 million in  pension benefits were restored to plans by Benefits Advisors as a result of  this procedure.", "EBSA also has regional initiatives focused on fiduciary oversight.

For 401(k) plans,  participant contributions are required to be vested immediately, but  employer contributions may be vested over time according to plan terms.  As with employee eligibility, the law sets the maximum amounts of time  before an employee is vested, but sponsors can decide on less restrictive  vesting provisions. For example, in industry research GAO reviewed,  about 40 percent of respondents have immediate vesting in employer  matching contributions.", "When making decisions about some noninvestment plan features,  sponsors act as settlors rather than fiduciaries. According to our survey,  186 of 441 sponsors said the sponsor\u2019s committee was the primary  decision maker for various noninvestment, settlor decisions, while 205  sponsors said that company management was. Sponsors make many  settlor function decisions, such as those related to establishing, amending,  or terminating a plan. They are considered business decisions and include  the decision to offer a particular type of plan, the levels of benefits to  provide, and the termination of the plan.

As a result, when plan sponsors acting as a fiduciary for  investment functions make such decisions, they must offer prudent,  diversified choices for participants to fulfill the duties of acting prudently  and diversifying plan investments. Several pension professionals told us, in  fact, that the main plan feature with important fiduciary implications is the  investment menu. When developing that menu, sponsors must act for the  sole benefit of participants and beneficiaries, rather than that of their own  or another party. According to our survey, 349 of 440 responding sponsors  said that the sponsor committee or management was the primary decision  maker for selecting the menu of investment options.

Table 1 shows funds  available for participant contributions, according to research from one  industry group. These funds involve different categories of investments.", "ERISA\u2019s fiduciary obligations require that fees paid by the plan are  reasonable and that services provided to the plan are necessary. Thus,  sponsors must consider the fees and other characteristics of the funds,  including potential returns and risk. For example, index funds are  passively managed funds with lower management fees than actively  managed funds, for which the investment provider pursues particular  investments in an attempt to obtain higher than average returns. Similarly,  sponsors must prudently select the service providers to the plan, such as  the providers of record keeping services and service providers that make  investment options available to the plan. In our survey, the primary  decision maker for selecting service providers for investment options was  the sponsor committee for 283 of 445 respondents and sponsor  management for 108 respondents. For selecting providers of record  keeping, the primary decision maker was the sponsor committee for 256 of  445 respondents and sponsor management for 135 respondents. As with  selecting funds, fees are one of many issues\u2014such as providers\u2019  qualifications and quality of services\u2014to consider when selecting  providers.", "ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duties also apply to a sponsor including a default option  for participants not making an investment choice. These duties include  prudently selecting and monitoring the option based on an objective,  thorough, and analytical process that involves careful consideration of the  quality of competing providers and investment products, as appropriate. A  recent Labor regulation provides certain fiduciary relief when participants\u2019  contributions are invested in qualified default investment alternatives that  include lifecycle funds, balanced funds, or managed accounts. Labor  decided on these alternatives, which combine stocks and fixed income  securities like bonds, based on considerations that included diversification  and adequacy of savings for retirement. Thus, if participants do not  provide instructions on how to invest their contributions, sponsors may  place contributions into a default investment. For example, participants  may not provide investment instructions when automatically enrolled in a  plan by their sponsor.", "Once the investment menu is selected, sponsors must monitor the fund  options as part of their fiduciary obligations. Several pension professionals  noted that monitoring funds may involve quantitative criteria that include  investment returns as compared to benchmarks, risk, and fees, along with  qualitative criteria such as the stability of the provider. In our survey, 362  of 448 sponsors said they benchmark the investment performance of the  401(k) plan. Of those who do benchmarking, 297 respondents said they  benchmark each option to the performance of a peer group as one way of  monitoring performance. As part of this monitoring of fund options,  efforts of sponsors may include reviewing reports about the performance  of the funds, holding meetings, placing poorly performing funds on a  watch list, ultimately removing funds or replacing them with better  options, and documenting their decisions. Some pension professionals  told us that investment monitoring efforts generally were of good quality  overall but that certain fund characteristics, such as risk, or particular plan  sizes, such as some small plans, were not always monitored adequately.", "Some pension professionals are concerned that sponsors may rely on the  investment provider or record keeper to monitor the funds. For example,  one fiduciary adviser noted that research by an industry group showed  that the provider may conduct investment monitoring for as many as 38  percent of respondents. According to this fiduciary adviser, if a sponsor  relies on the provider for fund monitoring and lacks an independent  adviser, an objective analysis of the funds may not occur, which could  result in a prohibited transaction under certain circumstances. According  to our survey, the entity primarily responsible for monitoring the  performance of the plan investments as compared to investment goals or  policy was frequently the plan sponsor committee (214 of 443  respondents) or an external investment/financial adviser (107  respondents).", "Sponsors may also set investment goals and policies for the 401(k) plan.  Before selecting funds for the menu, sponsors may set investment goals  and policies that affect which particular categories of funds it can include  in the menu. Many pension professionals noted that such planning by the  sponsor should take into account the needs of its workforce, such as its  age profile or level of knowledge about investments. This planning may  be documented in a written investment policy statement (IPS), which 339  of 440 sponsors responding to our survey have. An IPS is a document that  can guide future decisions by documenting the intended goals and  performance of the plan, as well as the guidelines for selecting,  monitoring, and altering investments. According to our survey, 208 of 339  respondents said the sponsor\u2019s committee was the primary decision maker  for establishing a written IPS. Despite the advantages of an IPS, the policy  statement may present difficulties for certain sponsors, such as greater  risks of fiduciary breaches and potential liability if the sponsor does not  follow it. Regardless of a plan\u2019s goals and policies, Labor\u2019s regulation on  investment duties specifies factors for sponsors to consider for prudent  investment decisions, including diversification, liquidity, return, and risk in  relation to the overall portfolio.", "The asset size of the plan may affect the investment menu, as sponsors of  larger plans generally have greater internal expertise and/or capacity for  committees to aid in overseeing the plan, as well as more leverage to  negotiate the menu and fees. Of 447 sponsors answering this question in  our survey, 396 had one or more plan committees with typically three to  seven members, while research by an industry group found 72 percent had  committees. For plans with $200 million or more in assets, 60 of 90  sponsors reported that they have exactly one committee, and 29 reported  having more than one committee. However, for some employers,  particularly smaller businesses, the owner of the company acts as the  fiduciary to decide about the plan investments and providers but may have  less time, knowledge, and resources to make those decisions. In addition,  larger plans typically have more leverage as they negotiate with providers  about fund options and the fees to operate the plan. Several professionals  stated that large and sometimes medium-sized sponsors have greater  ability to prescribe the investment menu than small sponsors who are  more likely to face restricted choices with requirements to include the  investment provider\u2019s own funds. For example, one adviser noted that  plans with over $100 million in assets can generally offer the funds they  want in the menu. Plans with more assets are also better positioned to  negotiate lower fees, given the competition among providers to manage  sponsors\u2019 pension assets.", "Furthermore, advisers assisting sponsors may affect decisions about the  investment menu. While ERISA allows the hiring of external advisers and  other providers, they must be prudently selected and monitored for the  quality of their services and conflicts of interest, among other things. Of  445 sponsors responding to this survey question, 308 said they use a third- party investment adviser. According to Labor\u2019s guidance, a plan fiduciary  should hire and monitor external experts if the sponsor lacks the expertise  internally. Several types of advisers are available to assist the sponsor,  such as registered investment advisers, consultants, and insurance or  securities brokers. However, advisers differ in a number of ways, including  by the services they provide, the extent to which they are willing to serve  as a fiduciary, how they are compensated, and whether they are affiliated  with a larger company like an insurance company or a broker-dealer. As a  result, some of these advisers may have incentives not to act solely in the  interest of participants, which may shape the investment menu. In our  survey, for 170 of 438 sponsors, a sponsor committee monitors plan  investment decisions for such potential conflicts of interest, while an  external investment/financial adviser does so for 94 of the sponsors.", "As with advisers, other service providers\u2014such as the investment provider  or the record keeper\u2014may shape the menu of investments in different  ways. For example, sponsors or providers can limit the menu largely or  entirely to the provider\u2019s own proprietary funds, which tend to have  greater profit margins or may not always perform as well as funds offered  by other investment providers. Also, a number of pension professionals  indicated that sponsors may defer to the provider about the menu, and  thus about fund performance and fees. However, according to our survey,  most sponsors said that the sponsor\u2019s committee was the primary decision  maker for the investment goals, menu, and any investment policy  statement, with relatively few saying the primary decision maker was the  401(k) provider."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Plan Sponsors Can Face Challenges in Fulfilling Their Fiduciary Obligations When Business Arrangements Are Unclear or Undisclosed", "paragraphs": ["Plan sponsors face challenges in fulfilling their obligations when fiduciary  roles are not clearly defined or when sponsors lack important information  about arrangements between service providers.

For example, sponsors  may use an officer or company manager, one or more internal committees,  or an outside professional\u2014sometimes called a third-party service  provider\u2014as a fiduciary to manage some or all of a plan\u2019s day-to-day  operations.

To comply with ERISA, the plan sponsor must have  sufficient information to make informed decisions about the services,  costs and the qualifications of the service providers, and the quality of the  services being provided. The sponsor must ensure that expenses paid out  of plan assets, including fees paid to service providers, are and continue to  be reasonable in light of the level and quality of services provided. The  sponsor must also determine whether there are conflicts of interest related  to service provider compensation. Conflicts of interest can occur, for  example, when a service provider steers a plan sponsor toward offering  investment options that benefit the service provider but may not be in the  best interest of the plan participants.", "Rather than prescribing the specific actions that a sponsor needs to take  when selecting and monitoring one or multiple service providers, ERISA  requires that a prudent process be followed to ensure that the sponsor\u2019s  fiduciary obligations are met. According to Labor, prudence requires  expertise in a variety of areas, such as investments. Lacking that expertise,  a fiduciary will want to hire someone with that professional knowledge to  carry out the investment and other functions. Prudence focuses on the  process for making fiduciary decisions. For instance, in hiring a plan  service provider, a fiduciary may decide to survey a number of potential  providers, asking for the same information and providing the same  requirements. By so doing, a fiduciary can make a meaningful comparison  and selection. According to Labor, however, many of the specific actions  that sponsors may take to meet these duties can vary. Labor recommends  that sponsors establish and follow a formal review process at reasonable  intervals.", "Sponsors may assume that they have delegated all their fiduciary duties to  an outside professional hired to run the plan, but the sponsor always  retains some fiduciary obligation. While plan sponsors may hire various  advisers and consultants to provide advice on the selection and  monitoring of investment funds, fiduciary duties may be distributed  differently depending on the service arrangement. For example, an  investment adviser who recommends investment funds to a plan sponsor  for a fee, may be a fiduciary under ERISA. In contrast, if the sponsor is  selecting funds from a broker and the broker provides no investment  advice, the fiduciary obligations may lie entirely with the sponsor under  ERISA, as shown in figure 3.", "Sharing or delegating fiduciary duties among service providers can  contribute to indistinct fiduciary roles if their respective roles are not well  defined. Some sponsors may be more concerned with hiring a provider to  perform a particular service than about determining whether or not the  provider will be acting as a plan fiduciary. For example, several industry  professionals noted situations when sponsors assumed they had delegated  fiduciary investment advice for the selection and monitoring of investment  funds to a service provider, but the service provider did not acknowledge  that fiduciary role. Several pension practitioners observed that most  sponsors, especially sponsors of small plans, have very little fiduciary  knowledge. For example, one attorney with an employee benefits firm  stated that while sponsors may know they are fiduciaries, without  understanding the concept and extra duties of being responsible for plan  assets, they primarily see their function as hiring service providers who  they may view as the \u201creal\u201d fiduciaries. A number of practitioners have  stated that some service providers understand fiduciary roles better than  plan sponsors do but may wish to avoid the liability associated with  certain fiduciary duties, even though their actions may define them as  fiduciaries under the law. This can lead some sponsors to assume that they  have delegated certain fiduciary duties to a service provider, although the  provider may not acknowledge any fiduciary role. When the service  provider is not a fiduciary, it is not bound by the fiduciary duties to act  prudently and solely in the plan\u2019s best interest. For example, according to  several practitioners, Registered Investment Advisers (RIA) are generally  fiduciaries, while some other advisers describe themselves as consultants  in an attempt to avoid fiduciary responsibility.", "Because ERISA generally does not require that additional fiduciaries be  named, determinations may not be made unless a lawsuit is filed claiming  that the plan has been harmed. Misunderstanding can also occur because  many large providers offer a range of services that a sponsor can choose  from, including some that involve fiduciary duties and others that may not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sponsors Cannot Fulfill Their Fiduciary Obligations without Disclosures about Compensation Arrangements and Potential Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["Labor\u2019s guidance indicates that to fulfill their fiduciary obligations  sponsors should obtain certain information about service providers\u2019  compensation arrangements and potential conflicts of interest. However,  some sponsors do not understand their service providers\u2019 revenue sharing  arrangements or may be unaware of potential conflicts of interest.  Research by one industry group found that about 60 percent of responding  sponsors said that providers fully disclosed revenue sharing. According to  pension practitioners, sponsors of large plans, helped by advisers or  consultants, may have a better understanding of revenue sharing and are  negotiating lower fees than in the past, but sponsors of medium-sized  plans generally do not understand how undisclosed compensation flows  between service providers behind the scenes, even if they understand  mutual fund expense ratios.", "Significant differences in ways that advisers and other providers are  compensated may have important implications for the sponsor\u2019s oversight,  including identifying potential conflicts of interest. According to an RIA  that we spoke with, if the adviser is an RIA hired by a plan sponsor on a  fee-for-service basis, his allegiance may be different than an adviser who is  a broker and receives a commission based on the value of the investment  product that is selected. Furthermore, other experts noted that a sponsor  may opt for what appears to be a \u201cfree\u201d 401(k) plan (with no record  keeping fees for the employer) without understanding that the providers\u2019  compensation may be passed on to participants by embedding fees in the  plan\u2019s investment options. \u201cHidden\u201d fees may also mask the existence of a  conflict of interest. Hidden fees are usually related to business  arrangements where one service provider to a 401(k) plan pays a third- party provider for services, such as record keeping, but does not disclose  this compensation to the plan sponsor. Without disclosing these  arrangements, service providers may be steering plan sponsors toward  investment products or services that may not be in the best interest of  participants. Research by one industry group showed that 36 percent of  responding sponsors either did not know the fees being charged to  participants or thought no fees were charged at all. An RIA told us that if a  \u201cfree\u201d 401(k) plan has been selected by the sponsor, it is unlikely that the  sponsor used an RIA to examine the underlying fee structure. In a  situation like this, one practitioner said that it is more likely that the  human resources department, rather than the finance department, selected  the free plan option. In addition to failing to understand the fee structure,  some less knowledgeable staff may act out of loyalty to their employer  without fully understanding ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duty to act in the best  interests of the plan. Consequently, they may select an arrangement that  reduces the employer\u2019s fees at the expense of the higher embedded fees  paid by participants, which may involve a fiduciary breach under certain  circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Ways to Improve Fiduciary Oversight Have Been Proposed", "paragraphs": ["Labor officials and various industry practitioners have proposed new ways to  improve fiduciary oversight.

In  December 2007, Labor proposed a regulation that would require, among other  things, a service provider of an employee benefit plan, including 401(k) plans,  to state whether it will provide services to the plan as a fiduciary. Labor  believes that plan fiduciaries, including sponsors and service providers, would  benefit from regulatory guidance in this area. According to Labor, the  increased complexity of administering services and benefits for these plans  has made it more difficult for plan sponsors to understand compensation  arrangements between service providers. The proposed regulation would  amend the current regulations under ERISA to clarify the meaning of a  reasonable contract or arrangement between sponsors (or other fiduciaries)  and service providers to include the disclosure of information concerning all  compensation to be received by the service providers and any conflicts of  interest that may have adverse effects on the cost and quality of plan services.
