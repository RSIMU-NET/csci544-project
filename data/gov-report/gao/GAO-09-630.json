In December 2007, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidance aimed at improving the use of award fee contracts. GAO was asked to (1) identify agencies' actions to revise or develop award fee policies and guidance to reflect OMB guidance, (2) assess the consistency of current practices with the new guidance, and (3) determine the extent agencies are collecting, analyzing, and sharing information on award fees. GAO reviewed the Departments of defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)--agencies that constituted over 95 percent of the dollars spent on award fee contracts in fiscal year 2008."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2008, agencies have spent over $300 billion on contracts that include monetary incentives, or award fees, for performance that is evaluated against subjective criteria. OMB's guidance on using award fees includes principles such as limiting the opportunities for earning unearned fees in subsequent periods, linking award fees to acquisition outcomes, designing evaluation criteria to motivate excellent performance, and not paying for performance that is unsatisfactory. These principles are largely reflected in DOD's and NASA's updated guidance on the use of award fees. For example, DOD now prohibits payment of award fees for unsatisfactory performance, and NASA requires a documented cost-benefit analysis to support the use of an award fee contract. However, DOE, DHS, and HHS vary in the extent to which their agency-wide guidance reflects the OMB guidance. These departments generally rely on operational divisions to develop award fee guidance; however, many acquisition professionals at these agencies were unaware of the contents of the OMB guidance. Current practices for using award fee contracts at agencies GAO reviewed often are inconsistent with the new guidance. However, where the revised policies have been applied, the results have been hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings and better use of government funds. For example, by limiting second chances at unearned fees in eight programs, GAO estimates that DOD will save over $450 million through fiscal year 2010. These practices, however, are not being implemented across DOD. NASA programs now document cost benefit analyses to justify using award fee contracts. Without clear guidance, agencies within DOE, HHS, and DHS have developed various approaches to using award fees. For example, while DOE's median award fee paid indicates satisfaction with the results of its contracts, its Office of Science uses a scoring system that could allow for payment of up to 84 percent of an award for performance that does not meet expectations. Most of the agencies we reviewed continue to allow contractors second chances at unearned fees. For example, at DHS, a contractor was able to earn 100 percent of its unearned fee in a subsequent period. Agencies do not always use criteria that are based on measuring results. For example, one HHS contract for a call center included criteria that focused more on efforts, such as maintaining proper staffing levels during hours of operation, rather than on measuring results. Only DOD collects data on the use of award fees. However, the data are largely used to respond to legislative requirements for award fee information. Agencies generally do not have methods to evaluate the effectiveness of award fees. While individual programs and some offices have taken steps to evaluate award fee criteria, officials stated that identifying metrics to compare performance across programs would be difficult. Further, while GAO found effective practices within some agencies, the lack of a governmentwide or, with the exception of DOD, agencywide forum to share information allows these to remain isolated examples of potential best practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To encourage innovative, efficient, and effective performance, federal  agencies give contractors the opportunity to earn monetary incentives  known as award fees. Award fees are an amount of money added to a  contract, which a contractor may earn in whole or in part by meeting or  exceeding subjective criteria stated in an award fee plan typically related  to areas within quality, technical ingenuity, cost-effective management,  program management, and other unquantifiable areas. From fiscal year  2004 to fiscal year 2008, the government has spent over $300 billion on  contracts that have included award fees representing 14 percent of total  procurement dollars. In fiscal year 2008, five agencies accounted for over  95 percent of the dollars spent on these contracts. Previously, we had  identified billions of dollars in fees at the Department of Defense (DOD)  that were paid regardless of acquisition outcomes and contractor  performance. At the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) we found that the agency did not consistently implement existing  guidance on award fees. Further, these agencies had not compiled data,  conducted analyses, or developed performance measures to evaluate their  effectiveness in using award fees. In response to those reports, both  agencies initiated policy changes that support increased accountability  and effectiveness in the use of award fees and Congress required further  guidance from DOD. In December 2007, the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued guidance to  chief acquisition officers and procurement executives across the  government that echoed several of the recommendations in our reports  and emphasized positive practices to be implemented by all agencies in  using award fees.", "You expressed interest in whether the new emphasis on award fees has  improved DOD\u2019s and NASA\u2019s use of these fees and whether other agencies  were implementing OMB\u2019s guidance. Specifically, you requested that we  (1) identify the actions agencies have taken to revise or develop policies  and guidance to reflect OMB guidance on using award fees, (2) determine  whether current practices for using award fee contracts are consistent  with the new guidance, and (3) determine the extent that agencies are  collecting and analyzing information on award fees to evaluate their use  and sharing that information within their agencies.", "To identify the actions agencies have taken to revise or develop policies or  guidance on the use of award fees, we assessed procurement policies at  DOD, NASA, and the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human  Services (HHS), and Homeland Security (DHS) and interviewed  procurement officials at each agency to discuss planned and implemented  policy changes. To determine whether current practices for using award  fee contracts are consistent with OMB guidance, we reviewed data from  645 evaluation periods in 100 contracts at the five agencies. For DOD and  NASA, our scope included contracts examined in prior GAO work and the  10 additional DOD contracts over $10 million awarded after policies were  changed that had held at least one award fee period. Where applicable, we  identified the programmatic and monetary effect of implementing policy  changes. For DOE, HHS, and DHS, we selected all award fee contracts  with over $50 million obligated against them from fiscal year 2004 through  fiscal year 2008 as identified in the Federal Procurement Data System  (FPDS). We collected data on the amount of award fee available compared  to the amount awarded as well as the criteria used to evaluate contractor  performance. We reviewed contract documents including award fee plans  to determine the extent to which the contracts reflected positive award fee  practices identified in our prior work and OMB guidance.

For example, both DOE\u2019s supplemental  acquisition policy and the implementing guidance establish CPAF  contracts as generally the appropriate type of contract for management  and operations. The OMB guidance states that in using an award fee  contract, contracting officers should conduct and document risk benefit analyses that support use of the contract type. As part of this  analysis, they are to conduct a risk assessment and ensure that incentive  strategies are consistent with the level of risk assumed by the contractor  and motivate the contractor by balancing awards with negative  consequences.

Three of the 5 agencies have established policies that either prohibit or  limit the use of rollover. However, before changes in policies and guidance  that established these limits, the use of rollover was prevalent in DOD  contracts. In 2005, we reported that for DOD award-fee contracts active  for fiscal years 1999 through 2003, an estimated $669 million was rolled  over across all evaluation periods. In almost all of the 50 DOD contracts  we reviewed, rollover is now the exception and not the rule. While in 2005,  we identified that 52 percent of all DOD programs rolled over fee, only 4  percent of the programs in our sample continue this practice. We reviewed  active contracts from our 2005 sample and found that the limitation on the  use of rollover will save DOD more than an estimated $450 million on 8  programs from April 2006 through October 2010.", "In some cases, entire DOD contracting commands have strictly limited the  use of rollover. One Air Force contracting officer told us that even if he  wanted to roll over a portion of the unearned fee, the fee determining  official (FDO) would not allow it.

In our  review of an Air Force contract for a satellite program, we found that  despite receiving 0 percent of the award fee for unsatisfactory  performance, a contractor sent the program a written request to include  the $10 million in unearned fee in the next period. The program denied this  request and has not allowed any rollover. The program ceased rolling over  unearned fees to subsequent award fee periods to conform to the new  policy and will save an estimated $20 million.", "While our analysis of DOD contracts has demonstrated the savings that  can be achieved by not rolling over unearned fee, we found contracts at  DOD, DOE, HHS, and DHS that continue to allow contractors second  chances at unearned fees. DOD award fee letters issued as recently as  January 2009 indicate that rollover is still being used. For example, in the  most recent evaluation of a DOD contract for mobile radios, the program  continued to recommend that funds be rolled over to subsequent periods  after over $2 million in rollover fees had already been earned by the  contractor. Several contracts we reviewed at other agencies allowed for  100 percent of the unearned fee to be earned in later periods. For example,  in a DHS Transportation Security Administration contract for personnel  services we found that a contractor that scored above average and  received 86 percent of the fee in a particular period was allowed a second  chance at 100 percent of the remaining fee in the next period. Additionally,  an HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services award fee plan that  was used on several contracts we reviewed stated that the unearned fee is  placed in a separate award fee pool to be used at the discretion of the  FDO.

OMB\u2019s guidance states that  incentive fee contracts, which include award fee contracts, should be used  to achieve specific performance objectives established prior to contract  award, such as delivering products and services on time, within cost goals,  and with promised performance outcomes. OMB\u2019s guidance also states  that awards must be tied to demonstrated results, as opposed to effort, in  meeting or exceeding specified performance standards.", "Contracting officers and program managers across all five agencies we  reviewed stated that a successful award fee contract should maintain a  portion of fee based on a subjective evaluation of how the contractor  identified and responded to issues and challenges and how it mitigated  risks, but could benefit from objective targets that equate to a specific  amount of fee. In August 2008, NASA\u2019s Deputy Director noted that  requirements that do not support desired outcomes should not be included  in contracts and that award fees should generally only be used in complex  contracts.  NASA now requires that award fee contracts are accompanied  by a documented cost-benefit analysis, although the requirement is too  new to judge its effect. Some contracts we reviewed ensure that award fee  evaluations are accurately measuring contractor performance by  incorporating objective criteria to serve as inputs for the evaluation. Other  contracts combined the subjective criteria of an award fee contract with  the objective targets of an incentive fee contract to ensure that specific  metrics are evaluated on their actual outcomes. These subjective criteria  are often described as program management, cost management, or  communication and allow for a broader evaluation of contractor  performance. Officials that supported the use of subjective criteria noted  that they must be accompanied by definitions and measurements of their  own. The combination of objective and subjective measurements  describes a multiple incentive contract that incorporates elements of both  award and incentive fee contracts. While officials at several agencies told  us that this is the preferred structure for incentivizing contractor  performance and the FAR states that it is allowed, there is no guidance on  how to balance or combine these contract types.", "OMB\u2019s guidance states that award fees must be tied to demonstrated  results, as opposed to effort, in meeting or exceeding specified  performance standards. Agencies varied in the extent to which criteria  used in contracts allowed them to evaluate results. For example, several  DOD contracts we reviewed have included more clearly defined criteria,  including the Joint Strike Fighter program that has, according to program  officials, created formulas that measure software performance, warfighter  capability, and cost control. The criteria, based on metrics, constitute  about 30 percent of the total award fee pool. In comparing periods before  and after the application of these criteria, the contractor has consistently  scored lower in the performance areas than in previous periods where less  defined criteria were applied. Because the program has been able to more  accurately assess contractor performance, the program has saved almost  $29 million in less than 2 years of the policy change.", "Similarly, our review of a contract for a missile defense system found that  greater adherence to cost and schedule criteria prevented the program  from paying $39 million for events that did not take place within specified  time frames. In addition to the Joint Strike Fighter, other DOD programs  that were active before the guidance was issued and not required to follow  it have incorporated it voluntarily with program and contracting officials  recognizing the benefits of applying the new practices. In some cases they  were able to do this through unilateral changes to the award fee plan. In  others, changes required negotiations with the contractor. However, in  other contracts we reviewed we found criteria being used to evaluate  contractor performance that had little to do with acquisition outcomes.  For example, an HHS contract for call center services awarded fees based  on 19 performance categories which included results based criteria, such  as response times, but also included criteria based more on efforts, such  as requiring the contractor to ensure that staffing levels were  appropriate for forecasted volumes during hours of operation, rather  than measuring results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluation Factors Are Not Consistently Designed to Motivate Excellent Contractor Performance", "paragraphs": ["The amount of fee established for satisfactory performance or meeting  contract requirements generally awards the contractor for providing the  minimum effort acceptable to the government. In our review of contracts,  we found that programs used a broad range in setting the amount of fee  available for satisfactory performance, but many set it at a level that left  little fee to motivate excellent contractor performance. For example,  DOE\u2019s Office of Science uses a model that sets the amount of fee able to  be earned for meeting expectations at 91 percent, thus leaving 9 percent to  motivate performance that exceeds expectations. In contrast, in an HHS  contract for management, operations, professional, technical and support  services for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases animal  care facilities, the contractor earns 35 percent of the award fee for  satisfactory performance, leaving 65 percent of the fee to motivate  excellent performance. In an effort to truly concentrate the award fee on  excellent performance, one contract we reviewed for Medicare services  provides no award fee for satisfactory performance.", "NASA\u2019s guidance establishes satisfactory at a level that leaves 30 percent  to motivate above satisfactory performance. DOD\u2019s guidance states that  satisfactory performance should earn no more than 50 percent of the  available award fee. This allows the program to incentivize above  satisfactory performance with the remaining 50 percent of the award fee.  However, not all DOD programs have followed its guidance. For example,  a Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contract signed in December 2007,  awards the contractor up to 84 percent of the award fee pool for  satisfactory performance, which the agency defines as meeting most of the  requirements of the contract. This leaves only 16 percent of the award fee  pool to motivate performance that fully meets contract requirements or is  considered above satisfactory.", "While the scale on which the contractors are evaluated is important in  determining how much fee is reserved for motivating excellent  performance, the judgment of the evaluators and their interpretation of the  scale also have an effect. Contracting officers we spoke with varied in  their interpretation of how to use the evaluation scale. While DOD has  provided guidance on defining adjectival ratings for contractor  performance, some programs continue to define meeting contract  requirements as excellent performance. For example, on an Air Force  program contracting for support services for staff stationed overseas, a  contracting official stated that the contractor \u201chas to do a pretty bad job to  receive a rating of \u201cgood\u201d,\u201d a rating that pays in excess of 85 percent of the  award fee. The median award fee for this particular Air Force program is  100 percent over the course of 8 award fee periods over 2 contracts. These  evaluations provide little motivation for improved performance despite fee  determination letters that consistently noted that the contractor had room  to improve.", "The data we collected on over 645 award fee periods in 100 contracts  provided a wide range of evaluation scores, including 6 periods in which  the contractor earned no fee. However, our analysis of data collected from  DOE and HHS, which included all contracts over $50 million that were  identified as award fee contracts from fiscal year 2004 through 2008,  showed that the median award fee paid at these agencies was over 90  percent of available award fees as shown in table 4. Contractors were  routinely rated at a level that reflected excellent performance. DOD\u2019s own  analysis of its use of award fees in 2007 also showed that it pays a median  of 93 percent of available award fees. While our review of NASA contracts  was limited to three active contracts that were reviewed in our previous  work, they too had a median of 90 percent of available fees paid. The  median award fee paid at DHS, also shown in table 4, was 83 percent of  available fees, indicating that its contractors are typically rated lower than  those at the other agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs Allow for Payment of Award Fees for Performance That Is Judged to be Unsatisfactory or Does Not Meet Contract Requirements", "paragraphs": ["DOD, NASA, and OMB have promulgated guidance that no award fee  should be paid for performance that does not meet contract requirements  or is judged to be unsatisfactory. However, while the median award fee  scores indicate satisfaction with the results of the contracts, programs  across the agencies we reviewed continue to use evaluation tools that  could allow for contractors to earn award fees without performing at a  level that is acceptable to the government under the terms of the contract.  For example, an HHS contract for maintaining a Medicare claims  processing system rates contractor performance on a point scale, from 0  to 100, where the contractor can receive up to 49 percent of the fee for  unsatisfactory performance, 50 to 69 percent for marginal performance,  and 70 to 79 percent for satisfactory performance (defined as meeting  contract requirements). Therefore, the contractor could receive up to 79  percent of the award fee for satisfactory performance, or $1.8 million over  the course of the contract. Another contract for operations and technical  support at the National Cancer Institute uses a scale that awards up to 59  percent of the award fee for performance that is described as failing to  meet customer requirements. The same scale provides up to 79 percent of  the award fee, while still not requiring the contractor to fully meet  customer requirements.", "In the contracts we reviewed, DOE\u2019s median award fee paid was 91  percent, indicating satisfaction with the results of the contracts. However,  divisions use different approaches in evaluating contractor performance.  While the evaluation tool used by NNSA does not allow for payment of  award fees for unsatisfactory performance, the evaluation method used by  the Office of Science allows a contractor to earn up to 84 percent of the  award fee for performance that is defined as not meeting expectations.", "Contracting officers we spoke with defined meeting expectations  differently with some stating that a contractor who performed  satisfactorily would meet expectations and others requiring exceptional  performance to meet their expectations. In 2007, the Office of Science  eliminated use of adjectival distinctions such as \u201csatisfactory\u201d and  \u201cexcellent\u201d in favor of letter grades and a numerical score system to  communicate performance levels and determine award fee amounts.  Current Office of Science guidance tasks each site office, with assistance  from headquarters, with determining the requirements and milestones for  each performance measure and target. While the office has favored the  new system, it has not provided instructions on defining satisfactory  performance or equating letter grades to adjectival language used in the  OMB guidance. Further, current award fee plans for some programs using  the Office of Science lab appraisal process allow for award fee to be  earned at the C level, which guidance defines as performance in which \u201ca  number of expectations ... are not met and/or a number of other  deficiencies are identified\u201d with potentially negative impacts to the lab and  mission. As much as 38 percent of fee can be earned for objectives that fall  in this category, according to Office of Science guidance, establishing a  system that rewards below standard performance.", "While having an evaluation tool in place to prevent award fees from being  paid for unsatisfactory performance is important, it is equally important to  adhere to the tool that is used. In a Customs and Border Protection  contract for maintenance of aircraft, the contractor switched to a more  costly method of hazardous waste disposal to reduce its own perceived  risks without communicating with the government. The evaluation  described the lack of communication as questionable use of taxpayer  funds for parochial interests without the coordination and consultation of  government representatives. The evaluation noted that the contractor\u2019s  approach was egregious and gave the contractor the minimum score of 70,  stating that eliminating the fee entirely for poor communication would  ignore its performance in other areas. However, in two subsequent periods  when the contractor did not respond to identified areas for improvement,  the program determined the contractor\u2019s performance to be marginal,  resulting in no award fee being paid for those periods."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Are Not Collecting, Analyzing, and Sharing Information on Award Fees to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Their Use.", "paragraphs": ["DOD is currently the only agency required to collect data, evaluate the  effectiveness of award fees, and share proven strategies in using this  contract type.

When asked how they would  respond to a requirement to evaluate the effectiveness of an award fee,  officials stated that they would have difficulty developing performance  measures that would be comparable across programs. Additionally,  officials at NASA noted that while cost and schedule are relatively easy to  measure, the government may not fully realize the effectiveness of  performance until the end of a program.

In 2006, legislation required  DOD to develop guidance on the use of award fees that included ensuring  that the department collects relevant data on award and incentive fees  paid to contractors and that it has mechanisms in place to evaluate such  data on a regular basis. In response to the new DOD guidance, data were  collected on 576 contract actions placed under 350 contracts for which fee  or incentive determinations were made during calendar year 2007. This  included $2.3 billion in award and incentive fees available during the  period.

However, DOD was not able to establish metrics to evaluate  the effectiveness of award fees in terms of performance. DOD pointed out  that the data collected on objective efficiencies do not reflect any  consideration of the circumstances that affected performance, a critical  element in determining award fees. DOD, which compared fees earned to  cost and schedule measurements, stated in its analysis that the metrics  used to evaluate the effectiveness of the incentives included 137 actions  that measured cost and schedule efficiencies.  While this was 24 percent of  the actions it reviewed, it represented 67 percent of the award fees paid.   DOD officials noted that the data indicated that lower fees were earned  when cost or schedule efficiencies were less than 90 percent.", "While no agency has developed a tool to track and evaluate the use of  award fees, some programs we reviewed have done so individually. Citing  that automation can increase the effectiveness, efficiency, transparency,  and integrity of the award fee process, one MDA program has developed  an automated award fee tool that allows government employees to  evaluate, comment on, and offer feedback on all performance criteria. The  tool also captures performance inputs and descriptions of performance  standards and allows administrators to analyze user ratings to normalize  and remove rating bias. While the tool is still in the stages of final testing,  MDA program officials stated that the tool has provided this particular  MDA program with immediate and effective results in managing the award  fee process. However, this automated system has not been implemented  across the agency and not all MDA program officials believe that it is  beneficial. Similarly, the National Cancer Institute uses a Web-based  interface that collects performance information provided by the  contractor\u2019s customers to facilitate performance assessments.

Participation on the working group was at the agency  headquarters level and involved officials from each of the agencies we  reviewed. The interagency working group initiated a separate working  group to review and amend the FAR.

Contracting officials noted that the specific nature of their missions makes  it difficult to adopt the practices of other agencies.", "In some cases, contracting officials are taking steps to provide oversight  for a number of contracts to achieve consistency and identify unsuccessful  practices. For example, at MDA, NNSA, and one Air Force command, the  determination of award fees is performed by a senior executive who  compares the results of several contracts to ensure that a uniform  evaluation process and common criteria are used when possible. Similarly,  according to DOE procurement officials, at the Office of Environmental  Management award fee plans are circulated among contracting officers  and program managers who review them for criteria that have been  successful or problematic in past contracts and at the Office of Science,  award fee plans are reviewed and approved annually by headquarters.

Additionally, the amount of fee  earned should be commensurate with contractor performance based on  evaluation factors designed to motivate excellent performance. Further,  no fee should be paid for performance that is judged to be unsatisfactory  or does not meet contract requirements. DOD, through revised guidance,  has realized benefits from applying these practices in some of its  contracts, including some that, because they were active prior to its  issuance, are not required to follow the guidance. While these principles  have been stated in OMB\u2019s guidance, they have not been established fully  in guidance at all five agencies we reviewed, notably DOE, DHS, and HHS.  Guidance, while an important first step, will not achieve the desired effect  of motivating excellent contractor performance unless it is consistently  implemented.
