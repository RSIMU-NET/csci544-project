While CMS adopted the broad criteria from the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) for ADI accreditation, it relied on the three accrediting organizations it selected to establish their own standards for quality and safety. To establish a framework for assessing the ADI standards currently in use, GAO developed a list of nine standards based on recommendations from 11 organizations with imaging expertise from which GAO obtained information. Two of the three accrediting organizations that CMS selected use all nine standards, while the third organization uses six of the nine standards. For example, while two of the organizations evaluate suppliers' patient images, the third said that it instead assesses suppliers' compliance with other standards necessary to maintain image quality, such as those related to inspection and testing of imaging equipment. As a result of these significant differences among the accrediting organizations, which arise from the lack of minimum national standards, important aspects of imaging, such as qualifications of technologists and medical directors and the quality of clinical images, are difficult for CMS to monitor and assess. Nine of the 11 organizations with imaging expertise and representatives from all three accrediting organizations recommended that CMS adopt minimum national standards. CMS drafted standards in 2010, but did not publish them because the agency was focused on other priorities.", "CMS's current oversight for the accreditation requirement is limited, as the agency focused its initial oversight efforts on ensuring that claims were paid only to accredited suppliers. Although CMS is responsible for evaluating the performance of accrediting organizations, the agency has not developed an oversight framework that would enable it to monitor and measure performance. CMS has not established specific performance expectations or developed plans for the validation audits of accredited suppliers as described in its regulations. Our previous work has shown that such independent evaluations are one of the most effective techniques CMS has to collect information about whether serious deficiencies are being identified. In addition, CMS's guidance to accrediting organizations on mid-cycle audits and serious care problems is limited. For example, CMS requires accrediting organizations to conduct mid-cycle audits to help ensure accredited suppliers maintain compliance for the 3-year accreditation cycle, but did not specify minimum expectations for this task, such as the minimum number or percentage of audits required or the types of supplier activities that should be assessed. In addition, two of the three accrediting organizations reported that CMS's guidance on identifying and reporting deficiencies that pose immediate jeopardy to Medicare beneficiaries or suppliers' staff was unclear. A CMS official stated that the accreditation requirement had been in operation for less than 1 year at the time of GAO's review, and reported that responsibility for oversight of the accreditation requirement was in the process of being transferred to another group within the agency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that ADI suppliers provide safe and high-quality imaging to Medicare beneficiaries, GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS determine the content of and publish minimum national standards for the accreditation of ADI suppliers; develop an oversight framework for evaluating accrediting organization performance; and develop more specific requirements for accrediting organization audits and clarify guidance on immediate-jeopardy deficiencies.

To address concerns regarding the quality of  imaging services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, the Medicare  Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommended that the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the  Medicare program, establish standards for imaging suppliers and select  accrediting organizations to verify compliance with those standards. The  Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA)  required that beginning January 1, 2012, suppliers of the technical  component of ADI services be accredited by a designated accrediting  organization in order to receive Medicare payment for these services.

To establish a framework for  assessing the standards currently in use, we also obtained information on  recommended standards for ADI suppliers from 11 organizations with  imaging expertise. These included either organizations that represent  individuals that order, perform, or interpret images such as national  medical specialty societies or other organizations that focus on the quality  or safety of ADI services. We identified these 11 organizations through a  review of relevant industry and scholarly articles, government reports, and  congressional hearings. To identify recommended standards, we used a  structured questionnaire to ask these 11 organizations about the specific  types of standards they would expect for the accreditation of ADI  suppliers. On the basis of our review of their responses, we derived a list  of specific standards or practices supported by at least 5 of the 11  organizations\u2014which we refer to as recommended standards\u2014that could  be used by accrediting organizations to evaluate ADI suppliers. We then  determined whether each of the three CMS-designated accrediting  organizations used the recommended standards in its accreditation  process.

CT is an imaging  modality that uses ionizing radiation and computers to produce cross- sectional images of internal organs and body structures. MRI is an  imaging modality that uses powerful magnets, radio waves, and  computers to create cross-sectional images of internal body tissues. NM  is the use of radioactive materials in conjunction with an imaging modality  to produce images that show both structure and function within the body.  During an NM service, such as a PET scan, a patient is administered a  small amount of radioactive substance, called a radiopharmaceutical or  radiotracer, which is subsequently tracked by a radiation detector outside  the body to render time-lapse images of the radioactive material as it  moves through the body.", "Imaging equipment that uses ionizing radiation\u2014such as CT and NM\u2014 poses greater potential short- and long-term health risks to patients than  other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound. This is because ionizing  radiation has enough energy to potentially damage DNA and thus  increase a person\u2019s lifetime risk of developing cancer. In addition,  exposure to very high doses of this radiation can cause short-term  injuries, such as burns or hair loss. Each of the modalities using ionizing  radiation uses different amounts of such radiation. For example,  conventional X-ray imaging, in which X-rays are projected through a  patient\u2019s body to produce two-dimensional pictures of organs and tissue,  uses relatively low amounts of radiation in order to render a diagnostic- quality radiographic image. Because CT and NM services can involve  repeated or extended exposure to ionizing radiation, they are associated  with the administration of higher radiation doses than conventional X-ray  imaging systems. In its 2010 initiative to reduce unnecessary radiation,  FDA reported that the effective dose from a CT is roughly equivalent to  100 to 800 chest X-rays, whereas a NM service is equivalent to 10 to  2,050 chest X-rays.higher-resolution images, FDA advises that an optimal radiation dose is  one that is as low as reasonably achievable while maintaining sufficient  image quality to meet the clinical need. Although MRIs do not use ionizing  radiation, they pose other potential dangers; for example, magnetic fields  from the MRI unit can result in a \u201cprojectile effect,\u201d in which magnetic  material, such as the metal in oxygen cylinders or wheelchairs, can be  pulled suddenly and\u2014often violently\u2014toward the imaging equipment at  times while a patient lies in the center of the magnet and while medical  personnel are attending to the patient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MIPPA Requirements", "paragraphs": ["MIPPA requires the establishment of procedures to ensure that  accrediting organizations include standards specific to each imaging  modality for ADI suppliers in the following five areas: (1) qualifications of  medical personnel who are not physicians and who furnish the technical  component of ADI services; (2) qualifications and responsibilities of  medical directors and supervising physicians; (3) procedures to ensure  that equipment used in furnishing the technical component of ADI  services meets performance specifications; (4) procedures to ensure the  safety of beneficiaries and staff; and (5) establishment and maintenance  of a quality-assurance and quality-control program that ensures the  reliability, clarity, and accuracy of the technical quality of diagnostic  images produced by suppliers.", "MIPPA accreditation applies only to suppliers paid under the Medicare  physician fee schedule that provide the technical component of ADI  services.

As a result, TJC stated that the report excluded other factors that affect  quality oversight and improvement, and indicated that we lacked data to  analyze the effectiveness of the different approaches used by each of the  three organizations. Our purpose was not to compare the effectiveness of  the three ADI accreditation programs, but rather to assess the ADI  standards currently in use and determine whether CMS has adequate  assurance that all accredited suppliers meet a minimum level of quality  and safety. Further, we did not intend to conduct a comprehensive  evaluation of TJC\u2019s overall accreditation program, which considers  aspects of quality and safety that go beyond criteria outlined in MIPPA for  imaging accreditation, such as examining whether a supplier creates and  maintains a culture of safety and quality throughout the organization.  Rather, because our study is focused on imaging in particular, we  determined whether the three CMS-selected accrediting organizations  use standards specific to imaging that were recommended by  organizations with expertise in this area.", "TJC also questioned our threshold for presenting standards that were  recommended by 5 of 11 of the organizations, indicating that this  represented agreement from less than 50 percent of the organizations.  Because the 11 organizations have expertise in different areas of  imaging, not all organizations commented on all sections of the  questionnaire we sent to them. For example, the American Board of  Orthopaedic Surgery recommended standards related to the  qualifications of medical directors, but not procedures to ensure that  equipment meets performance specifications. As a result, it would not be  reasonable or appropriate to expect consensus for all recommended  standards, as some standards were outside of an organization\u2019s area of  expertise. We indicate in the report that the standards the 11  organizations identified do not represent the full range of possible  standards for the accreditation of ADI suppliers, but rather provide a  framework for comparing the standards used by the accrediting  organizations selected by CMS. HHS has indicated that it plans to  facilitate discussions with stakeholders and national experts to gather  feedback on national standards for accreditation of ADI suppliers.", "Finally, TJC stated that the report places inordinate value on image  accuracy and professional credentials. We discuss those aspects of  imaging in the report because they were among the nine standards that  were identified by at least 5 of the 11 organizations with imaging  expertise. For example, 8 of the 11 organizations believe that examining  clinical images is an important aspect of accreditation for ADI services,  and it is unclear how problems with image quality can be detected without  reviewing images. Similarly, TJC stated that we provided no data to show  that phantom testing results in better image quality in practice. Phantom  image testing was recommended by 5 of the 11 organizations with  imaging expertise, and has been required by FDA for over a decade to  test imaging conducted by mammogram facilities under MQSA. Further,  phantom images provide a standardized format against which imaging  performance of various suppliers can be evaluated; this is important given  that factors outside of a supplier\u2019s control, such as a patient\u2019s weight or  particular health conditions, can affect a supplier\u2019s ability to produce high- quality images.", "While our report assessed the standards currently in use for ADI  accreditation, it is ultimately CMS\u2019s responsibility to determine the content  of minimum national standards for ADI accreditation. This could include,  for example, determining whether clinical image review and phantom  testing should be required for ADI accreditation, a decision that could be  informed by its planned discussions with stakeholders and national  experts. We stand by our report and findings, and believe that by  adopting our recommendations for minimum national standards, as HHS  has stated it intends to do, CMS will significantly enhance its ability to  ensure both imaging quality and patient safety.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services and relevant congressional committees.
