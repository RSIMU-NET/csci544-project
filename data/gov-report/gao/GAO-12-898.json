SMS implementation is required for FAA and several of its business lines and the agency is taking steps to require industry implementation.", "As requested, this report addresses (1) the status of FAA's implementation of SMS, (2) the extent to which FAA's SMS efforts have been consistent with key practices for successful planning and implementation of a new program, and (3) challenges FAA faces in implementing SMS. To address these issues, GAO reviewed FAA SMS documents, compared FAA efforts to key practices, and interviewed agency and industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its business lines and offices are in different stages of their implementation of Safety Management Systems (SMS). FAA finalized its agency-wide implementation plan in April 2012, and the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) has completed its SMS implementation, but other FAA SMS efforts are in the early stages. FAA business lines, such as the Aviation Safety Organization (AVS) and the Office of Airports (ARP), have SMS guidance and plans largely in place and have begun to integrate related practices into their operations, but many implementation tasks remain incomplete, and officials and experts project that full SMS implementation could take many years.", "There are a number of key practices that can help agencies plan for and efficiently implement new projects, including large scale transformations such as FAA's SMS implementation, and FAA has many in place. For example, FAA has support from top leadership and a clear project mission. However, FAA has only partially addressed other key practices such as developing a project plan to track SMS implementation, and FAA has not addressed performance-related practices such as establishing SMS performance measures or links between employees' performance standards and SMS.", "Several challenges remain that may affect FAA's ability to effectively implement SMS. FAA is taking steps to address some challenges and stakeholder concerns, but challenges related to data sharing and data quality; capacity to conduct SMS-based analyses and oversight; and standardization of policies and procedures could negatively affect FAA's efforts to implement SMS in a timely and efficient manner. Further, FAA officials stated that SMS implementation will require some skills that agency employees do not have, but FAA has not yet assessed the skills of its workforce to identify specific gaps in employee expertise. In addition, while existing federal law protects any data collected for SMS, any data airports collect could be subject to state-specific Freedom of Information Act laws, a gap that could create a disincentive for airports to fully participate in SMS implementation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FAA develop systems to: track SMS implementation, evaluate employee performance as it relates to SMS, and assess whether SMS meets its goals and objectives; conduct a workforce analysis for SMS; and consider strategies to address airports' data concerns.

This  record reflects the efforts of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  airlines, airports, manufacturers, the National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB), and others to continually improve aviation safety. However, with  air travel projected to increase over the next 20 years, efforts to ensure  the continued safety of aviation are increasingly important. FAA is  attempting to further enhance aviation safety, in part, by shifting to a data- driven, risk-based safety oversight approach. This approach is becoming  the standard throughout the global aviation industry and is recognized by  aviation leaders such as the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO), the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), and others  as the next step in the evolution of safety.", "FAA is overseeing implementation of this new approach\u2014called a safety  management system (SMS) approach\u2014both within FAA and throughout  the U.S. aviation industry and is coordinating these efforts with the  international aviation community. Safety management systems represent  a proactive approach to safety and are intended to continually monitor all  aspects of aviation operations and collect appropriate data to identify  emerging safety problems before they result in death, injury, or significant  property damage. Under SMS, FAA will use the aviation safety data it  collects to identify conditions that could lead to aviation accidents or  incidents and to address such conditions through changes in the FAA\u2019s  organization, processes, management, and culture. SMS adoption and  implementation is one of the biggest cultural and procedural  transformations in FAA history and will likely involve years of continuous  effort on the part of agency and industry officials.", "You asked us to assess FAA\u2019s implementation of SMS. To do so, we  addressed the following questions:   (1)  What is the status of FAA\u2019s implementation of SMS?   (2)  To what extent have FAA\u2019s SMS efforts been consistent with key  practices for successful planning and implementation of a new  program?   (3)  What challenges does FAA face in implementing SMS?", "To determine the status of FAA\u2019s implementation of SMS, we reviewed  FAA\u2019s SMS orders and pilot project guidance, implementation plans, and  Notices of Proposed Rulemaking for Part 121 air carriers and Part 139  airports. We interviewed FAA SMS program managers across FAA  business lines and offices. We also reviewed international and FAA  guidance and SMS and NTSB recommendations to FAA related to SMS.  To assess the extent to which FAA\u2019s efforts have been consistent with  key practices, we reviewed our reports and other literature on successful  project planning and implementation, particularly for large-scale  transformative projects, and identified key practices applicable to FAA\u2019s  SMS implementation. We then assessed FAA\u2019s actions against the key  practices by examining such documents as FAA\u2019s guidance and  implementation plans, and interviewing FAA officials. We determined  whether each key practice was addressed, partially addressed, or not  addressed by using criteria developed from prior GAO reports. For  example, we considered a practice partially addressed if FAA had  partially implemented, taken steps toward, or started but not completed  implementing it (see app. I for a discussion of our assessment). To  identify challenges FAA faces in implementing SMS, we reviewed our  prior work on long-standing FAA challenges, such as those related to  training and data, and interviewed aviation industry experts and FAA  officials. We also reviewed our prior work on performance measurement  and workforce analysis, and NTSB recommendations related to SMS. To  obtain industry views on challenges, we interviewed representatives from  airports and air carriers selected for size and geographic dispersion. We  also interviewed representatives of aviation industry associations and  reviewed written comments submitted by aviation stakeholders on two  FAA-issued Notices of Proposed Rulemaking that would require SMS for  some airports and air carriers. See appendix I for a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2011 to  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SMS provides a top-down approach to managing safety risk, which FAA  expects will improve aviation safety. SMS is not an additional safety  program that is distinct from existing activities that accomplish an entity\u2019s  safety mission, but rather, a process for safety management that  incorporates systematic procedures, practices, and policies. According to  FAA, the overarching goal of SMS is to improve safety by helping ensure  that the outcomes of any management or system activity incorporate  informed, risk-based decision making. We reported in 2010 that FAA  officials believe that successfully implementing SMS is critical to meeting  the challenges of a rapidly changing and expanding aviation system. To  achieve a higher level of safety in an already very safe system, FAA  requires a more forward-thinking approach, which SMS provides, by  addressing cultural and organizational problems that lead to safety  hazards, identifying system-wide trends in aviation safety, and managing  emerging hazards before they result in incidents or accidents.", "SMS implementation should bring about a fundamental shift in aviation  safety oversight. For decades, the aviation industry and federal  regulators, including FAA, have used data reactively to identify the  causes of aviation accidents and incidents and take actions to prevent  their recurrence. While FAA plans to continue to use data to analyze past  safety events, it is also working to use data proactively to search for risks.  FAA\u2019s shift to the proactive approach of SMS is important because, as  accidents have become increasingly rare, less information is available for  reactive analyses of their causes. As a result, information that can be  used to help identify accident and incident precursors has become more  critical for accident prevention. Thus, the open sharing of safety  information among aviation stakeholders and how FAA\u2019s policies and  procedures govern the reporting of safety information are essential to the  success of SMS.", "SMS consists of four key components: (1) safety policy, (2) safety risk  management, (3) safety assurance, and (4) safety promotion (see fig.1).  Together, these four components are intended to provide a systematic  approach to achieving acceptable levels of risk. FAA provides to its  personnel detailed guidance on the principles underpinning these  components and the application of these components to aviation  oversight in its official orders and other internal FAA guidance. To the  industry, FAA provides this SMS guidance via advisory circulars and a  dedicated page for the SMS program office on the FAA website.", "FAA is undertaking the transition to SMS in coordination with the  international aviation community, working with ICAO to adopt applicable  global standards for safety management. ICAO requires SMS for the  management of safety risk in air operations, maintenance organizations,  air traffic services, and airports as well as certain flight-training operations  and for organizations that design or manufacture aircraft. Further, ICAO  has published safety management requirements for its member countries  that mandate that civil aviation authorities\u2014such as FAA\u2014establish  SMS. ICAO first mandated SMS worldwide for air traffic service  providers, such as air carriers and certified aerodromes, in 2001. ICAO  later specified that member states should mandate SMS implementation  for  airports, air carriers, and others by 2009. FAA began SMS  implementation in 2005, but FAA officials informed ICAO that the agency  and industry would not be able to meet the 2009 deadline. ICAO is  allowing FAA to take additional time in its efforts to implement SMS, with  the understanding that implementation is under way and that FAA is in  the midst of a rulemaking to require SMS for commercial air carriers.  ICAO officials stated that the United States is one of the leading  implementers of SMS worldwide and acknowledged that SMS  implementation in the U.S. aviation system may be more complicated  than in other countries because of the size and complexity of the U.S.  aviation industry. ICAO has not specified a date by which FAA is  expected to comply with the requirements to implement SMS in the  aviation system. There have also been actions within the United States to  encourage implementation of SMS. For instance, in 2007, NTSB  recommended that FAA require all commercial air carriers to establish an  SMS and, in 2011, added SMS for all modes of transportation to the  NTSB\u2019s Most Wanted List, identifying SMS as one of the most critical  changes needed to reduce the number of accidents and save lives.", "Partially in response to the ICAO requirement, FAA added goals related  to SMS implementation to its 2009-2013 Flight Plan. a requirement to implement SMS in three of FAA\u2019s business lines\u2014the  Air Traffic Organization (ATO), the Aviation Safety Organization (AVS),  and the Office of Airports (ARP)\u2014and a goal to implement SMS policy in  all appropriate FAA organizations, which include the Office of Commercial  Space Transportation (AST) and the Office of NextGen (ANG). FAA is in  the process of implementing SMS within these business lines and offices  as well as in industry through rulemakings to require airports and  commercial air carriers to implement SMS. FAA designated AVS as the  lead for SMS implementation in September 2008. Within AVS, the Office  of Accident Investigation and Prevention\u2019s (AVP) Safety Management and  Research Planning Division coordinates and manages SMS  implementation and operation across the agency, and so AVP serves as  the official SMS lead for the agency.", "Federal Aviation Administration, 2009-2013 Flight Plan is the agency\u2019s strategic plan.", "Administrators, their deputies, and other high-level FAA officials from  each business line or office (see fig. 2). Within some of the business  lines, there are offices devoted to specific aviation oversight functions that  are responsible for overseeing detailed implementation of SMS for those  functions. For example, the Flight Standards Service (AFS), a division of  AVS that provides safety oversight of commercial air carriers and others,  is taking steps to require SMS implementation by commercial air carriers  and is also working to integrate SMS into its internal activities. In addition,  the Aircraft Certification Service (AIR), a division of AVS that provides  safety oversight to aviation design and manufacturing firms, is leading  agency efforts to encourage SMS implementation for that industry sector,  while ARP is leading agency efforts to require SMS implementation for  certificated airports.", "SMS implementation will require changes to many of FAA\u2019s operations.  As the agency and industry implement SMS, shifts will be necessary in  both the skills of FAA and industry staff and the tools that the agency  uses to monitor safety. FAA\u2019s integration of SMS into its business  practices will also affect how the agency provides air navigation services  and oversees the aviation industry. Historically, FAA oversight of airlines,  airports, and other regulated entities has involved oversight of such things  as operations and maintenance. FAA will continue this oversight, but will  also apply SMS principles to its processes for oversight. The agency will  provide oversight of the safety management systems of service providers  such as air carriers and airports to help ensure that they are managing  safety within their operations through SMS. For example, AFS currently  provides oversight of the operations, maintenance, and safety data of  commercial air carriers and others. Once SMS is fully implemented, AFS  will continue to provide this oversight and will also conduct oversight of  the safety management systems that commercial air carriers and others  put in place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA and Its Business Lines Are at Different Stages of SMS Implementation", "paragraphs": ["ATO completed its implementation of SMS, but FAA and several of its  other business lines and offices are in the early stages of implementation.

These activities will lead to outcomes including:  revising and standardizing safety policies and safety risk  management methodologies across FAA to ensure SMS  principles are consistently addressed;   improving organizational processes so that FAA business lines and  offices can share safety data and information more easily; and coordinating communications to ensure a common understanding  of SMS across the agency.", "FAA began its agency-wide SMS implementation efforts in 2008, and in  September of that year issued a policy for implementation of a common  SMS within FAA. Among other things, the policy sets forth management  principles to guide all of FAA in safety management and safety oversight  activities and requires AVS, ARP, and ATO to develop and execute  business line-specific plans for SMS implementation. In late 2008, FAA  formed the agency-wide FAA SMS Committee to coordinate  implementation efforts across FAA business lines and offices. Overall, the  agency has taken a bottom-up approach to implementation, with some  individual business lines and offices beginning implementation prior to  agency-wide efforts. FAA has also taken steps to ensure that its plans for  SMS implementation and policies align with international and  government-wide requirements and technical guidance on SMS  implementation, including ICAO\u2019s Standards and Recommended  Practices, the ICAO Safety Management Manual, and the JPDO SMS  Standards. For instance, officials stated that they consulted international  and government-wide guidance on SMS implementation when drafting  agency implementation plans. (See fig. 3 for more information on  alignment of FAA requirements with international and government-wide  requirements and guidance on SMS.)", "Although FAA has made progress, completion of SMS implementation  across FAA is likely to take many years. FAA\u2019s agency-wide SMS  implementation plan includes tasks with estimated completion dates  through 2015, and some implementation tasks may take even longer to  complete. For instance, a project plan that AVS officials developed to  track status of AVS SMS implementation tasks contained in its  implementation plan includes task completion dates through 2016.  According to FAA, the overall SMS implementation effort is an  evolutionary process that will not have a specific completion date. The  current implementation time frame is consistent with experts\u2019 estimates of  how long it may take to implement SMS and with other large-scale  organizational transformations.

(See fig. 4 for more information on the status  of key SMS implementation efforts across FAA.)", "AVS began its SMS implementation efforts in August 2006 and finalized  its SMS implementation plan in January 2012, which was then  incorporated into FAA\u2019s overall plan for SMS implementation. Since 2006,  AVS and its seven services and offices have issued orders and other  guidance on SMS implementation; developed SMS training courses;  conducted voluntary pilot projects and rulemaking efforts on SMS  implementation for industry; and worked to begin integrating elements of  SMS into their operations. For example, AIR officials, who provide  oversight of aviation design and manufacturing firms, have developed a  central database that provides standard criteria for analyzing service data  in a risk-based manner. This should allow AIR inspectors and engineers  to rate the risk of potential safety issues and prioritize oversight to high  risk issues.", "Some services and offices within AVS are in the midst of efforts to require  SMS for industry and are also operating voluntary pilot programs to  promote SMS implementation within industry. A final rule to require SMS  for commercial air carriers is expected to be issued in September 2012.  In 2007, AFS launched a pilot program to encourage voluntary  implementation of SMS by industry.", "According to FAA officials, as part of its rulemaking efforts for commercial  air carriers, FAA and AVS are developing a new part in the Code of  Federal Regulations (CFR)\u2014Part 5\u2014that will describe SMS  implementation requirements for Part 121 certificate holders. In the future,  FAA may conduct rulemakings to require additional sectors of the aviation  industry to meet Part 5 requirements (see fig. 5). AVS officials stated that  efforts to establish SMS requirements more broadly across the aviation  industry will likely take many years.", "Though FAA has not yet required SMS for air carriers or other parts of  industry, FAA has acted to encourage SMS implementation by industry  through voluntary pilot projects, and some aviation stakeholders have  chosen to implement SMS in advance of any federal requirement. Some  sectors of the aviation industry are farther along in their implementation of  SMS than others. For instance, FAA officials stated that a large majority  of commercial air carriers are in the process of implementing SMS. As  of June 2012, over 90 percent of commercial air carriers operating under  Part 121 were participating in the AFS pilot program, which provides air  carriers with direct implementation support from FAA officials under a  more relaxed implementation time frame than is anticipated under an  eventual implementation regulation. Of these air carriers, three have  reached the final stage of SMS implementation. However, most small air  carriers have not yet begun implementing SMS. In contrast to AFS, AIR is  at an earlier stage in its efforts to require SMS for the approximately  3,000 design and manufacturing firms it oversees. AIR began a voluntary  pilot project for SMS implementation by design and manufacturing firms in  2011 and has 11 pilot project participants. AIR officials stated that they  are in the process of launching a second aviation rulemaking committee  to continue to explore options to require SMS for design and  manufacturing firms. Officials also noted that AFS and AIR are working  together to share lessons learned and assist one another in their  implementation efforts.", "ARP is in the early stages of working to integrate SMS principles into its  oversight of airports, and recently took steps to reduce the scope of that  oversight. ARP initially planned to apply SMS-based oversight to all  certificated airports. Officials stated that ARP is currently limiting its SMS- based oversight to large hub airports because of budget constraints and  will reassess its capacity to expand oversight to smaller airports in 2013.  ARP began its SMS implementation in 2010 and issued an internal order  to provide a basis for the integration of SMS into its operations later that  year. The office finalized its SMS implementation plan in September 2011  and has begun to make changes to its oversight. For instance, In June  2011, ARP began to apply SMS-based oversight to construction projects  at the 29 large hub airports in the United States. Under this new  oversight framework, ARP staff assess proposed airport construction  projects using risk-based SMS principles, and airports need to  incorporate strategies to mitigate identified risks into their construction  plans prior to receiving ARP\u2019s approval for the project. Like AVS, ARP is  also in the midst of a rulemaking to require SMS for all certificated  airports and has completed three voluntary SMS pilot projects for airports  from 2008 to 2011. Thirty-one airports participated in at least one of  ARP\u2019s SMS pilot projects. ARP is using information gathered through the  pilot projects to inform a planned advisory circular that will provide  additional guidance to airports on SMS implementation. The pilot projects  also allowed airports to share their SMS implementation practices with  other airports. The final rule to require SMS for Part 139 certificated  airports is expected to be issued in April 2013 and, if implemented as  proposed, would require over 500 airports to implement SMS.", "Other FAA business lines are in varying stages of implementation. AST is  not currently required to implement SMS; however, AST is taking initial  steps toward integrating SMS into an existing set of safety management  processes. ANG is farther along in its implementation of SMS because of  its previous status as a part of ATO. basing its implementation of SMS on policies and processes established  during ATO\u2019s implementation of SMS. The officials stated that since ANG  will provide the systems and components that will be used by ATO to  manage air traffic, it made sense for ANG to develop its SMS based on  policies, processes, and systems established by ATO.

In accordance with our key practices, the SMS Executive  Council has the authority to make resource allocation decisions, but  also confers decision-making authority where appropriate to the FAA  SMS Committee.", "For instance, FAA officials told us that the SMS Executive Council  retains the authority to make final decisions about changes to FAA\u2019s  implementation plan that affect policies or procedures for multiple  business lines; the FAA SMS Committee has the authority to make  decisions that relate to daily concerns that fall within the purview of its  members. For example, committee members settled a disagreement  between ATO and airport officials over whether an airport should  conduct certain components of a safety risk management panel. At  the time, FAA had not yet issued its safety risk management policy  clarifying terms and requirements, so the airport and ATO each had  its own distinct safety risk management definitions and processes.  Working with ARP and ATO officials, committee members identified a  compromise in which ATO protocols were followed, but any  disagreements on terms or procedures were documented. ARP  officials told us that FAA\u2019s safety risk management policy, issued in  April 2012, should help prevent this type of disagreement from  occurring.", "Clear project mission: FAA\u2019s internal order requiring SMS  implementation for ARP, ATO, and AVS clearly describes that FAA\u2019s  mission is to improve aviation safety and that implementing SMS and  its components supports that mission. Each business line also has its  own internal order requiring SMS implementation that mirrors this  mission and goals.", "Implementation team: AVP\u2019s safety management division and the  FAA SMS Committee, function jointly as FAA\u2019s dedicated SMS  implementation team. The team\u2019s structure and actions align with our  criteria for a strong and stable team because it is composed of  senior-level program managers from each business line, all of whom  had received SMS training according to FAA officials. Despite some  recent departures, its membership has been largely stable.", "Leading practices: FAA shares information across business lines to  identify lessons learned related to SMS implementation. For example,  ATO assembled lessons learned from its SMS implementation into a  presentation for the other business lines, and included tips such as  encouraging others to implement a training program and monitor  mitigations. According to FAA\u2019s implementation plan, the agency  plans to systematize the sharing of lessons learned by creating a  central repository to collect and communicate safety lessons learned  among its business lines and offices by September 30, 2013.", "Troubleshooting: FAA has processes in place to manage SMS  implementation across FAA, including troubleshooting unexpected  problems. For example, the FAA SMS Committee meets monthly and  manages agency-wide SMS implementation and any challenges that  arise, and regularly briefs the SMS Executive Council, a briefing that  includes a discussion of any issues or unexpected problems that  could not be resolved at the committee level. For instance, when the  Air Traffic Manager at an airport disagreed with airport officials  regarding how to handle a potential safety issue with planes that were  taking off on runways that were temporarily closed, the FAA SMS  Committee elevated the issue to the SMS Executive Council, which  resolved it. As we have previously reported, instituting practices like  these can help an agency become more results-oriented, customer- focused, and collaborative.", "Although FAA is still in the process of finalizing new requirements for  airports and air carriers to implement SMS, it has already taken some  steps to institute key practices for those efforts. For example, FAA  officials stated that the agency has taken steps to identify leading  practices during pilot projects by soliciting information from participating  airports and air carriers, and FAA officials told us they plan to incorporate  these lessons learned into rulemaking and guidance. ARP officials  reported that they encouraged pilot project participants to share lessons  learned directly with one another through studies and roundtable  discussions, and incorporated some of the lessons learned into FAA  advisory circulars. FAA has also made efforts to troubleshoot and  manage unexpected problems with pilot participants through meetings,  calls, and conferences with airport and air carrier officials to understand  their experiences. For example, AFS officials reported that they helped  officials from air carriers to understand when certain safety risk  management documentation and processes are necessary, and how they  could be adapted for a variety of changes made to carrier operations,  including smaller day-to-day changes. However, despite this assistance,  officials from some airports that participated in pilot projects reported that  they could have benefited from additional assistance from ARP, such as  clarification on the safety risk management component of SMS.

Also,  AVS has a detailed project plan for its own SMS implementation and  elements of agency-wide implementation for which AVP, as the  agency SMS lead, has responsibility. Officials stated that they have  plans to develop a system to monitor and track the progress of  activities needed to implement SMS, but FAA does not currently have  a system for tracking agency-wide SMS implementation, a key  practice particularly important during the initial planning phase of  project implementation.

FAA involved its business line  program managers and some of the managers\u2019 staff by assigning  them responsibility for the day-to-day tasks related to implementing  SMS across the agency. FAA has involved other employees by  soliciting questions and comments on SMS in town hall meetings and  the online DOT site called \u201cIdeaHub,\u201d and by offering SMS training  through each business line. ATO, ARP, and AVS all offer introductory  SMS courses for their staff as well as additional related courses, such  as an SMS course specifically for managers and ATO\u2019s safety risk   management course.", "FAA has been working to implement SMS for the last 4 years, but the  agency does not have a communications plan or strategy for ensuring  that the SMS messages communicated to staff are consistent across the  agency. Instead, FAA relies on a more informal communications structure  in which each program manager staffed to the implementation team  communicates relevant information back to their respective business line.  The implementation team does not communicate any information directly  to employees, which could hinder the team\u2019s ability to ensure consistency  in its message across FAA. ATO officials reported experiencing this  challenge at the beginning of ATO\u2019s SMS implementation, when a lack of  clear requirements for communicating SMS information resulted in  variation in staff\u2019s understanding of guidance. We have previously  reported that a communication plan or strategy can ensure consistency of  message, provide information to meet the specific needs of employees,  encourage two-way communication, and build trust. FAA plans to begin  working on a communications plan in September 2012, and is scheduled  to issue the plan at the end of February 2013. FAA officials also said they  are in the process of developing an internal SMS website for employees  to share information and ideas, which could enhance SMS  communications. However, until the communications plan is developed  and implemented, FAA\u2019s employees may not receive timely or consistent  information on SMS or be as invested in its implementation as they might  otherwise be.", "FAA\u2019s approach to overseeing industry SMS implementation allowed for  additional two-way communication. For example, FAA solicited views on  SMS implementation from airport and air carrier officials through voluntary  pilot projects described previously, and learned more about industry  perspectives through the formal rulemaking process\u2014whereby an agency  issues a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and is required to notify the  public and give them an opportunity to submit comments.", "Providing technology and expertise: FAA has provided some SMS  training and tools to its employees; however, it has not yet provided  other tools important for SMS implementation. FAA officials reported  that each business line has provided SMS training to staff. In addition,  FAA recently developed a standardized Safety Risk Management  (SRM) policy, which will assist employees across FAA by  standardizing SRM terminology and clarifying confusion on the  conduct of SRM across the agency. FAA plans to create a simple  version of an agency-wide hazard-tracking system in the next 3 to 6  months, but does not have plans to create a more complex system  until August 2015, according to FAA\u2019s SMS implementation plan. The  simple version will draw from hazard-tracking systems already in  place in some business lines, and summarize information from them  to highlight broader hazards such as those that would affect multiple  business lines. For instance, FAA officials stated that if ATO wanted  to make a change to its operations at a particular airport, then ATO  would be responsible for identifying associated hazards, risks, and  risk mitigations and would also be responsible for assuming  responsibility for the risk. However, if ATO determined that the airport  was better equipped to mitigate the identified risks, then the airport  and ARP would become more involved in designing risk mitigations  and overseeing their implementation. FAA\u2019s efforts to provide tools to  help in SMS implementation are affected by differences in how data  are collected and assessed across the agency. For example, these  differences have held back agency efforts to model how changes to  the national airspace system, such as increases to air travel, can  affect safety. We have previously reported on and made  recommendations related to FAA\u2019s data challenges, and also  discuss them later in this report. These data challenges mean that  FAA is not always able to perform comparisons across databases, a  challenge that that limits the usefulness of the data in identifying  possibly dangerous hazards. Identifying, monitoring, and mitigating  hazards is a key tenet of SMS, and without the proper technologies  and tools, FAA may not be able to do this as effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Yet to Integrate SMS into Employee Performance Plans and Establish Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s efforts do not align with two key practices for implementing a new  program.", "Integrating SMS into employee performance plans: FAA does not  consistently evaluate employees\u2019 performance on SMS-related tasks.  We have previously reported that effective performance management  systems create a clear linkage between individual performance and  organizational success, and include aligning individual performance  expectations with organizational goals. FAA\u2019s organizational mission  and goal, and that of SMS, is to improve safety, yet FAA officials told  us that the agency does not require employee performance plans to  include SMS-related tasks. Although officials reported that some  employees\u2019 performance plans explicitly include SMS items, such as  providing SMS training or developing SMS policy, it is left to the  discretion of each business line whether SMS items are included. FAA  officials told us that SMS principles and methodologies will be  included in the performance plans of employees involved in writing  SMS policy and revising SMS processes, and will be incorporated into  the tasks of others once SMS implementation reaches those  individuals. However, currently, none of the business lines require  this. As such, FAA does not have a system for assessing the extent to  which staff are effectively supporting SMS, and FAA may not be able  to determine if staff are completing tasks and responsibilities  necessary for the successful implementation of SMS.", "Measuring performance: FAA does not have performance measures  in place to assess whether the SMS goals of improving safety are  being achieved. FAA has broader safety-related performance  measures, such as tracking rates of runway incursions and losses of  separation, but SMS-related performance measures could address  intermediate safety issues, such as precursors to incursions or  incidents. Such measures could help FAA track progress toward its  broader safety measures. FAA officials told us that AVS is a  member of the Safety Management International Collaboration Group,  a group formed in 2009 to address safety management-related topics,  including performance measures. Most recently, FAA formed an  agency-wide working group to study performance metrics for SMS  implementation, and FAA\u2019s implementation plan states that such  metrics will be finalized in October 2014. However, FAA officials we  spoke with acknowledged that they are at the very beginning phase of  this process and, although already in the process of implementing  SMS, have not yet identified metrics to measure safety results under  an SMS system. We have previously reported that performance  information is critical for achieving results and maximizing the return  on federal funds.

SMS requires changes in many of FAA\u2019s operations: from the  way the agency tracks hazards to the way it oversees industry. SMS will  also require a transformation of FAA\u2019s and the aviation industry\u2019s safety  culture to one in which information and safety data are shared openly,  and errors are addressed through whatever action is necessary to  prevent them from happening in the future. FAA is making efforts to move  toward this new approach to safety, for instance by using data-sharing  systems that are protected from public disclosure to encourage voluntary  reporting of safety issues and enable more robust analysis of safety data  among FAA and air carriers. Moreover, as previously stated, each of  FAA\u2019s business lines has its own role in implementing SMS that must be  coordinated across the agency. This is particularly challenging because  the business lines are at different stages of implementation and,  according to FAA officials, have historically operated independently.", "The scope and complexity of SMS implementation may also be a  challenge for the aviation industry, and some stakeholders expressed  concerns both in interviews and in official comments on FAA\u2019s Notices of  Proposed Rulemaking that eventual FAA requirements to implement SMS  need to allow for variation in airport and air carrier operations. For  example, officials from some smaller airlines and airports noted that SMS  implementation could require additional resources, such as staff and  software, which may not be readily available. In addition, officials from  some airports and air carriers were concerned that FAA\u2019s final  requirements would be too prescriptive to allow entities to implement an  SMS program that best fit their organizational type, management  practices, and resources. Most stakeholders and experts we interviewed  stated that FAA could design SMS requirements for airports and airlines  that are scalable and flexible to accommodate this variation, which would  address these concerns. For instance, airport officials from smaller  airports told us that staff size limits their ability to assign a dedicated SMS  employee or safety director, while some officials at larger airports said  they were able to hire a SMS safety director or already had an  established safety director in place. Also, FAA\u2019s SMS implementation pilot  project for airports found that 35 percent of participants planned to hire  additional staff to support SMS and 15 percent were not sure.

For instance, FAA officials noted that  SMS implementation will require some engineers and other technical  employees to understand certain terminologies and have certain  knowledge, skills, and abilities, such as an enhanced ability to perform  complex modeling and analysis of aviation safety data to identify potential  safety hazards. AVS officials stated that to implement SMS, additional  employees with skills in analyzing data for hazards and associated risks  would be needed, along with additional training for existing staff.

These differences, in turn, prevent the  agency from performing simple comparisons across databases and have  delayed advances in using data analysis to proactively identify potential  safety hazards. FAA officials stated that the agency has recently taken  steps to make its databases interoperable, and also recently issued a  standardized policy for the safety risk management component of SMS.  Both of these steps may enhance FAA\u2019s hazard-tracking and analysis  capabilities. The agency is also working with ICAO to address issues  related to standardization, such as adopting a collaborative approach to  increase the sharing of safety information internationally.", "Industry officials are also concerned that FAA inspectors and certificate  management offices may have different interpretations of SMS and  other regulations.

Industry stakeholders we interviewed  expressed concerns that a similar result could occur once final rules are  issued requiring airports and air carriers to implement SMS, and could  lead to airports or air carriers of similar size being held to different  standards of SMS implementation. FAA officials acknowledged that this is  a challenge for the agency and noted that the agency plans to provide  additional training to inspectors related to oversight of SMS. Additionally,  based on our 2010 recommendation, recent legislation directs FAA to  establish an advisory body of government and industry representatives to  address the issue of inconsistent interpretation of regulations.", "FAA\u2019s organizational structure for SMS implementation may pose  challenges to standardization as well.

This could slow  decision-making, particularly around issues that require business lines to  come to a single decision, such as how to standardize policies.  Nevertheless, FAA officials acknowledged that having to collaborate to  implement an agency-wide SMS has improved communication among the  business lines.
