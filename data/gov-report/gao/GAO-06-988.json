The three agencies where the United States is underrepresented are the International Atomic Energy Agency; UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization; and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. U.S. citizens are equitably represented at the UN Secretariat, though close to the lower end of its target range. The UN Development Program has not established a target for U.S. representation, although U.S. citizens fill about 11 percent of its professional positions. Given projected staff levels, retirements, and separations, IAEA, UNESCO, and UNHCR would need to increase hiring of Americans to meet their minimum targets for U.S. representation in 2010. While the five UN agencies face some common barriers to recruiting and retaining professional staff, including Americans, they also face their own distinct challenges. Most of these barriers and challenges are outside of the U.S. government's control. The common barriers include nontransparent human resource practices, limited external hiring, lengthy hiring processes, comparatively low or unclear compensation, required mobility, and limited U.S. government support. UN agencies also face distinct challenges. For example, at the Secretariat, candidates serving in professional UN positions funded by their governments are more likely to be hired than those who take the entry-level exam; however, the United States has not funded such positions. Also, IAEA has difficulty recruiting U.S. employees because the number of U.S. nuclear specialists is decreasing. Since 2001, State has increased its efforts to achieve equitable U.S. representation at UN agencies, and additional options exist. State has targeted efforts to recruit U.S. candidates for senior and policymaking UN positions, and although it is difficult to link State's efforts to UN hiring decisions, U.S. representation in these positions has improved or displayed no trend in the five UN agencies. U.S. representation in entry-level positions, however, has declined or did not reflect a trend in four of the five UN agencies despite State's increased efforts. Additional steps include maintaining a roster of qualified U.S. candidates, expanding marketing and outreach activities, increasing UN employment information on U.S. agency Web sites, and assessing the costs and benefits of sponsoring entry-level employees at UN agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Congress continues to be concerned about the  The U.S. Congress continues to be concerned about the  underrepresentation of American professionals employed by some United  underrepresentation of American professionals employed by some United  Nations (UN) organizations and that insufficient progress has been made  Nations (UN) organizations and that insufficient progress has been made  to improve U.S. representation.

We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  review. We also met with human resources officials from these five  organizations to discuss various aspects of the data. We selected these  agencies because they represent a range of UN agencies with different  funding mechanisms and methods for calculating geographic  representation.

Instead, these  organizations set aside positions that are subject to geographic  representation from among the professional and senior positions  performing core agency functions, funded from regular budget resources.  Positions that are exempted from being counted geographically include  linguist and peacekeeping positions, and those funded by extra-budgetary  resources. In addition, UN agencies employ staff in short-term positions  that also are not geographically counted. Nongeographic staff members  include employees tied to specific projects (L-staff), employees in  assignments of limited duration (ALD) contracted for 4 years or less,  temporary employees contracted for less than 1 year, and gratis personnel,  such as JPOs, who are funded by member states.

The Secretariat and UNESCO have established formulas to determine  member states\u2019 targets for equitable representation, which consider three  factors: membership status, financial contribution, and population size.  IAEA informally calculates a member state to be underrepresented if its  geographic representation is less than half of its percent contribution to  the budget.  Using this method, we calculated a U.S. target. UNHCR has  not established a quantitative formula or positions subject to geographic  representation, but has agreed to an informal target for equitable U.S.  representation.

In doing so, State cooperates with at least 17 federal  agencies that have interests in specific UN organizations. A 1970 executive  order assigns the Secretary of State responsibility for leading and  coordinating the federal government\u2019s efforts to increase and improve U.S.  participation in international organizations through transfers and details  for federal employees. The order further calls for each agency in the  executive branch to cooperate \u201cto the maximum extent feasible\u201d to  promote details and transfers through measures such as (1) notifying well- qualified agency employees of vacancies in international organizations and  (2) providing international organizations with detailed assessments of the  qualifications of employees being considered for specific positions.

In addition, the UN  agencies lacked long-range workforce planning strategies to improve the  geographic distribution imbalance. We also reported that State\u2019s efforts to  improve U.S. representation in the UN system did not reflect its high  priority status, particularly relative to other member countries. We  recommended that the Secretary of State (1) develop a comprehensive  strategy that specifies performance goals and time frames for achieving  equitable representation of Americans in the UN System and include  efforts to foster interagency coordination, (2) work with human resources  directors of UN organizations to develop plans and strategies for achieving  equitable geographic representation within specified time frames, and (3)  provide copies of State\u2019s annual report to Congress on UN progress to the  heads of UN organizations for appropriate attention and action. State has  subsequently implemented these recommendations, including adding a  performance indicator on the UN\u2019s employment of Americans to its  performance and accountability documents. We also recommended that  State develop guidelines defining its goal of obtaining an equitable share of  senior-level and policy-making positions for U.S. citizens and that it use  these guidelines to assess whether the United States is equitably  represented in high-level positions in UN organizations.

The most notable difference is at  the IAEA, where the percentage of U.S. citizens employed in  nongeographic positions is considerably higher than the percentage  employed in geographic positions due to the high percentage of  temporary, JPO, and consultant and contractor positions held by  Americans.

Barriers common to most UN agencies we reviewed include  nontransparent human resource practices, a limited number of positions  open to external candidates, lengthy hiring processes, comparatively low  or unclear compensation, required mobility and rotation, and limited U.S.  government support. These barriers combine with distinct agency-specific  factors to impede recruitment and retention. For example, candidates  serving in professional UN positions funded by their member governments  are more likely to be hired by the Secretariat than those who take the  Secretariat\u2019s entry-level exam; however, the United States has not funded   such positions at the Secretariat. IAEA has difficulty attracting U.S.  employees because the pool of American nuclear specialists is decreasing.  At UNESCO, U.S. representation is below the negotiated target, in part,  because the United States was not a member for 19 years.

For example, some UN managers  circumvent the competitive hiring process by employing individuals on  short-term contracts\u2014positions that are not vetted through the regular,  competitive process\u2014for long-term needs. In addition, some Americans at  each of the agencies, except IAEA, said that \u201ccronyism\u201d exists and that  certain individuals only hire their fellow nationals. Others said that the  perception of U.S. overrepresentation hinders managers from hiring or  promoting U.S. citizens regardless of their skills. In response, UN human  resource officials expressed concern about U.S. employees\u2019 perception of  \u201ccronyism\u201d and lack of transparent practices. UN human resource officials  said that hiring processes include rigorous reviews involving the personnel  division; managers; and appointment, promotion and review boards.  However, the UN Secretary-General also acknowledged in a report to the  General Assembly that management systems, including human resources,  lacked transparency.", "Limited External Opportunities: Recruiting U.S. candidates is difficult  because agencies offer a limited number of posts to external candidates.  Each of the organizations we reviewed, except IAEA, advertises  professional, or P-level, vacancies to current employees before advertising  them externally in order to provide career paths for their staff and to  motivate staff. Furthermore, the definition of external candidates used at  the Secretariat, IAEA, UNESCO, and UNHCR is quite broad and may  include current staff with temporary appointments, JPOs, former staff, or  staff in other agencies in the UN Common System. In reviewing hiring  data, we found that three of the five agencies\u2014UNESCO, UNHCR and  UNDP\u2014filled 50 percent or more of new appointments by promotions or  other internal candidates rather than by hiring external candidates. (See  fig. 1. For definitions of promotion, internal hire, and external hire, see  app. IV.)", "IAEA fills a large percentage of its positions with external candidates  because, in addition to not giving internal candidates hiring preference,  the agency employs the majority of its staff members for 7 years or less.  Although the data indicate that the Secretariat hires a significant  percentage of external candidates, the Secretariat\u2019s definition of \u201cexternal  candidates,\u201d as describe above, includes staff on temporary contracts and  individuals who have previous experience working at the agency.", "Lengthy Hiring Process: For positions that are advertised externally, the  agencies\u2019 lengthy hiring processes can deter candidates from accepting UN  employment. For example, a report from the Secretary General states  that the average hiring process is too slow, taking 174 days from the time a  vacancy announcement is issued to the time a candidate is selected,  causing some qualified applicants to accept jobs elsewhere. One American  at UNESCO noted that his hiring process took about 9 months, while  another said it took about 1 year. At UNHCR, even its \u201cfast-track\u201d system  used to staff emergency situations takes five months, on average. Many  Americans that we interviewed concurred with the report\u2019s sentiment,  saying that it is difficult to plan a job move when there is a long delay  between submitting an application and receiving an offer. In March 2006,  the Secretary General proposed cutting the average recruitment time in  half.", "Comparatively Low or Unclear Compensation: Comparatively low  salaries and benefits that were not clearly explained were among the most  frequently mentioned deterrents to UN employment for Americans.  American employees we interviewed noted that UN salaries, particularly  for senior and technical posts, are not comparable with U.S. government  and private sector employment. The International Civil Service  Commission also reported that remuneration across the UN common  system is not competitive in the international labor market. When  candidates consider current UN salaries in tandem with UN employee  benefits, such as possible reimbursement for U.S. taxes and school tuition  allowances through college, UN compensation may be more attractive.  However, U.S. citizens employed at IAEA and UNESCO said that their  agency did not clearly explain the benefits, or explained them only after  the candidate accepted a position. Incomplete or late information hampers  a candidate\u2019s ability to decide in a timely manner whether a UN position is  in his or her best interest.", "In addition, difficulty securing spousal employment can decrease family  income and may also affect American recruitment since many U.S. families  have two wage earners. At many overseas UN duty stations, work permits  can be difficult to obtain, the local economy may offer few employment  opportunities, and knowledge of the local language may be required. In  addition, Americans with whom we spoke said that an unemployed spouse  might not be happy as such, and might prefer to return to the United States  where he or she can continue a career. U.S. employees at IAEA (located in  Vienna) noted that difficulty in securing spousal employment is a  significant problem for recruiting and retaining U.S. professionals at their  agency.", "Required Mobility or Rotation: UNHCR and UNDP require their staff to  change posts at least every 3 to 6 years with the expectation that staff  serve the larger portion of their career in the field; the UN Secretariat and  UNESCO are implementing similar policies. While IAEA does not require  its employees to change posts, it generally only hires employees for 7  years or less. Such policies dissuade some Americans from accepting or  staying in a UN position because of the disruptions to personal or family  life such frequent moves can cause.", "Limited U.S. Government Support: At four of the five agencies we  reviewed, all except IAEA, a number of American employees said that they  did not receive U.S. government support during their efforts to obtain a  UN job or to be promoted at the job they held. The U.S. government  currently supports candidates applying for director-level, or higher, posts,  and puts less emphasis on supporting candidates seeking lower-level  professional posts. State said that only on an exceptional basis is  assistance given in support of promotions because the U.S.\u2019s general  policy is not to intervene in internal UN matters, such as promotions. State  said the UN\u2019s \u201ccode of conduct\u201d makes it clear that it is improper for  international civil servants to lobby or seek support from governments to  obtain advancement for themselves and that governments should not  accede to such requests nor intervene in such matters.

UNHCR\u2019s mission to safeguard the  rights and well-being of refugees necessitates work in hardship and high- risk locations. As such, UNHCR has twice as many hardship duty stations  as any other UN agency. At least one-third of its international professional  staff works in posts where, in some cases, their family may not be allowed  to accompany them. To alleviate the burden of serving in hardship posts,  the majority of international professionals are expected to rotate between  different categories of duty stations. However, a UN Joint Inspection Unit  report found that the staffing system may not always allow staff to rotate  out of the more difficult locations. For example, employees who serve in  hardship locations, especially in Africa, are less likely to rotate to  headquarters and other nonhardship locations than other staff. Aside from  possibly having to serve in hardship locations, moving frequently creates  an unstable environment for staff and their families. UNHCR officials  acknowledged that the organization faces a challenge in balancing its  staff\u2019s personal and career goals with UNHCR\u2019s operational requirements.

As of July 2006, UNHCR had 135  such staff. However, human resource officials said that some individuals  have remained in between assignments for an extended period of time\u2014 some as long as 2 years. Because all staff-in-between-assignments have  indefinite, rather than fixed-term, contracts, management has difficulty  terminating those that refuse assignments or who lack needed skills, and  the agency gives these staff placement preference over hiring external  candidates. The priority given to placing staff-in-between-assignments  limits the type of open external recruitment needed to ensure that UNHCR  maintains an optimally skilled, dynamic, competitive, and gender-balanced  workforce. In November 2003, to ensure that UNHCR adequately meets its  workforce requirements, management created a policy to terminate the  indefinite appointments of staff members who remained without a post for  a protracted period. UNHCR human resource officials said that new rules  entering into force in September 2006 are intended to reduce the  protracted period from 12-18 months to 6 months.

Technically, the IAEA is an independent international organization that  has a relationship agreement with the UN.  For the purposes of this report,  we refer to the IAEA as a UN agency or organization. We selected these  agencies based on a range of factors such as: funding mechanisms  (including agencies funded through assessed contributions as well as  those funded primarily through voluntary contributions); methods for  calculating geographic representation status (including agencies using  formal geographic distribution formulas and those without formal targets  for U.S. representation); agency size; agency location (including U.S.- based and overseas-based organizations); and agencies with varying levels  of U.S. employment.

Data generally refer to end of the  calendar year, except for the Secretariat, which is for the year ending June  30. We had extensive communications with staff from each organization\u2019s  personnel and budget departments to clarify details regarding the data.

We calculated the  geographic target for the Secretariat and UNESCO as a percentage range,  in which the minimum and maximum number of national staff, as provided  by the agency, is divided by the actual (full-time equivalent) geographic  staff in the agency. The two agencies\u2014the Secretariat and UNESCO\u2014that  set geographic targets consider three key factors to varying degrees in  establishing the targets: membership status, financial contribution, and  population size. The Secretariat and UNESCO both use formulas for  calculating geographic targets that take into account all three factors. For  the Secretariat, the factors are 55 percent for contribution, 40 percent for  membership, and 5 percent for population. UNESCO\u2019s formula consists of  a membership factor of 65 percent, a contribution factor of 30 percent, and  a population factor of 5 percent. IAEA informally calculates a member  state to be underrepresented if its geographic representation is less than  half of its percent contribution to the budget.  Using this method, we  calculated a U.S. target.", "The remaining two agencies\u2014UNHCR and UNDP\u2014have not adopted  formal geographic representation targets. However, UNHCR has  established an informal target with the United States. To determine U.S.  representation at UNHCR in comparison to this target, we calculated the  percentage of regular professional positions (100-series contracts) filled by  U.S citizens. Similarly, at UNDP, we calculated U.S. representation as a  percentage of regular professional positions (100 and 200-series contracts)  filled by U.S. citizens.", "For all five UN organizations, we also calculated U.S. citizen  representation at each grade\u2014policy-making and senior level (such as  USG/ASG, D1/D2), mid-level (P4/P5), and entry level (P1-P3)\u2014as well as  for all grades combined. U.S. grade level employment representation is  calculated by dividing the number of U.S. staff at that grade level by the  organization\u2019s total employment for the corresponding grade level. We  also calculated U.S. citizen representation in nongeographic positions (for  the Secretariat, IAEA, and UNESCO), and in the nonregular professional  positions (UNHCR and UNDP) as a percentage of nongeographic (or  nonregular) employment, respectively in these positions.", "To determine whether there was a trend in U.S. representation between  2001 and 2005, we determined whether or not the slope of the best fitting  line through these points would have a computed confidence level of 90  percent or more. If there is a trend, the sign of the slope (i.e., the  coefficient) determines whether the trend is increasing or decreasing. A  designation of no trend means that the confidence level does not reach 90  percent; however, the percentage representation of U.S. citizens may have  fluctuated during the period. We cannot say these trends are statistically  significant because of the small number of observations, the fact that these  numbers are the actual population and not a sample, and because these  numbers are not independent over time. Thus the 90 percent computation  is not an objective criterion indicating statistical significance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculating Hiring Projections", "paragraphs": ["Our methodology assumed a gradual approach to the target. We calculated  the minimum average number of U.S. citizens that each agency would  need to hire each year between 2006 and 2010 to reach their respective  percentage targets in 2010. The 2005 U.S. staff percentage representation  was the starting point and an annual percentage increment (or decrement)  was added to reach the minimum target in 2010. We then projected the  required number of U.S. staff for each year as that year\u2019s percentage target  multiplied by the projected size of the total staff for that year. The  estimated number of U.S. staff in the agency in each year, before  additional hiring of Americans, was based on the prior year\u2019s employment,  less the projected retirements and separations for that year. If the  projected number of Americans required to meet that year\u2019s target is  greater than the estimated number of Americans in the agency, based on  the prior year\u2019s employment and given departures in that year, then the  number of Americans the agency has to hire is positive; otherwise, it is  zero. Summing each year\u2019s number of Americans required to be hired to  achieve each year\u2019s target, and then dividing by 5, yielded the minimum  average number of U.S. citizens that the agency would have to hire to  achieve the 2010 target.", "We made three assumptions to calculate the hiring projections. First, for  the Secretariat, IAEA, and UNESCO, we based our 2006 to 2010 staff  projections on the recent growth rate (2001 through 2005) of each agency\u2019s  staff. We calculated the future staff growth rate based on an ordinary least  squares growth rate of staff during 2001 through 2005. UNHCR provided us  with an official agency projected growth rate of zero percent, and UNDP  provided a 6 percent growth rate that we used in our analysis. Second, we  projected staff separations for 2006 through 2010 based on an average of  the separation data that the agencies provided for 2001 through 2005.  Third, we projected U.S. staff separations for 2006 through 2010 based on  the average of U.S. staff separations to total staff separations during 2001  through 2005. We did not project future retirements because each agency  provided their official retirement projections for total staff and for  Americans. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses by varying the  staff growth and separation rates.

As in any exercise of this type,  the categories developed can vary when produced by different analysts. To  address this issue, two independent GAO analysts reviewed and verified  categorization of comments for each agency and suggested new  categories. We then rectified differences. We then compiled a summary of  factors across the five agencies and ranked them by the frequency they  were mentioned. Another independent GAO analyst then reviewed and  verified the summary compiled of all agency comments.
