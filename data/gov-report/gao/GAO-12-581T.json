For example, a large percentage of the current fleet is  equipped to fly more precise performance-based navigation  procedures. Although FAA has begun implementing new flight  procedures to allow for more precise navigation under NextGen,  aircraft operators have raised concerns that, to date, FAA has not  produced procedures that are most effective in delivering such  benefits as reduced flight time, congestion, and fuel consumption. The  NextGen Advisory Committee has made recommendations to help  FAA identify and prioritize improvements that could provide more  immediate benefits, including recommending that FAA focus NextGen  capabilities at metroplexes that have the greatest impact on aviation  system performance.

Reaching that  critical mass is a significant challenge because the first aircraft  operators to purchase and install NextGen-capable technologies will  not obtain a return on their investment until many other operators do.  FAA estimates that the avionics needed on aircraft to realize  significant NextGen capabilities will cost private operators about $5  billion to $7 billion through 2018.
