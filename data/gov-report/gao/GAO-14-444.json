For fiscal year 2012, USPS estimated average annual costs of about $380 per delivery point for door delivery, compared with about $240 for delivery to the curb, and about $170 for delivery to a central location. USPS also estimated potential ongoing savings of over $2 billion annually from mandating conversion of about one-third of door deliveries to other modes. However, USPS's estimates of these specific costs and savings have limitations, in part because they rely on data from a 1994 USPS study. In lieu of current data, USPS adjusted the 1994 data according to increases in the Consumer Price Index\u2014an adjustment that may not have been the same as changes in USPS delivery costs, which are affected by factors such as increases in postal wage rates, postal benefit costs, and gasoline prices.

Through the voluntary conversion process, customers on a route may choose to maintain door delivery, reducing the number of conversions and lowering potential savings. Large-scale mandatory conversions have the potential to achieve large savings. However, USPS is reluctant to mandate conversions.

Both wall  mounted and cluster box units can be installed to service both  residential and business delivery. Cluster boxes are generally  pedestal-mounted units located outdoors with individually locked mail  receptacles for each delivery point. Cluster boxes and apartment  house mailboxes have become more secure over time, as USPS  developed and implemented regulations for higher security standards  for manufacturers.

Conversion of  delivery points from door to curbline and centralized delivery would  reduce the time required to organize and deliver the mail. Motorized  routes with centralized and curbline delivery require less of a carrier\u2019s  time than walking from door to door. Reducing carrier workload through  mandatory conversions could enable USPS to reorganize delivery into  smaller numbers of routes, with each route including a larger number of  delivery points. The resulting decrease in the number of routes could help  reduce the number of carriers needed to fulfill delivery needs. USPS has  historically reduced its workforce through attrition and has no-layoff  provisions in its collective bargaining agreements with its four major  postal unions. In this regard, large numbers of career carriers are  expected to retire in the coming years. In addition to realigning delivery  routes, our prior work has found that USPS can use established work  methods for accomplishing delivery to a given geographic area with fewer  carriers. reducing overtime as well as the number of hours worked by carriers with  flexible schedules.

See GAO-09-696.", "According to USPS officials, conversions from door delivery would also  decrease the time and costs associated with organizing mail for delivery.

USPS field officials  told us that strip malls and high-rise office buildings receiving door  delivery are good candidates for conversion because these delivery  routes are labor intensive and the facilities could have suitable space to  install a centralized mail receptacle.

Some stakeholders also noted mail security issues, such  as the potential for increases in theft of mail from people picking up their  mail or break-ins to centralized mail receptacles. Others indicated that  there are opportunities to increase mail security by converting the mode  of delivery from unlocked mailboxes, like those affixed near doors or  many curbline mail boxes, to CBUs with locked receptacles for mail and  parcels.

Field officials we spoke with in Washington, D.C., and Los  Angeles, California, noted this concern. For example, a field official in  Washington, D.C. noted that with extensive street parking and limited  common space, it can be very difficult to find a suitable location for CBU  units. A USPS official noted that if public space was not available for a  CBU on a delivery route, gaining access rights to install one requires  working with local governments and can be cumbersome.

We believe that accurate data are needed for Congress, USPS, and other  stakeholders to understand the cost-saving potential for delivery mode  conversions as compared with other savings options to improve USPS\u2019s  financial viability. This is particularly relevant because pending postal  reform legislation would mandate the conversion of some delivery points  from costly door delivery to other modes. USPS\u2019s estimates of the cost of  a new delivery study using ongoing operational data at $75,000 to  $100,000, or a more extensive study at $250,000 to $750,000 do not  seem cost prohibitive given USPS\u2019s annual expenses of about $72 billion.

We  obtained USPS documentation on the assumptions and methodology  used in developing these cost data. This documentation included a USPS  report of the 1994 USPS study that measured the costs of each mode of  delivery and the USPS methodology for increasing these costs by  inflation to estimate delivery mode costs from fiscal years 1995 through  2012. We requested that USPS officials generate estimates, similar to  those they created for Congress and USPS internal use, of the potential  savings from increasing its reliance on less costly modes of delivery. We  reviewed documentation of the assumptions, methodology, calculations,  and underlying data for these estimates. We had extensive discussions  with USPS officials regarding delivery mode cost and savings data, and  obtained detailed written responses to follow-up questions regarding their  reliability. We identified concerns with the quality of available USPS  delivery mode cost and savings data. We interviewed USPS officials  about the methodology used to develop the estimates and determined  that these were the only data available and found the data to have  limitations for estimating delivery costs and potential savings, which we  discuss in the report. Further, we reviewed whether there were any  opportunities to improve the quality of these data.

We also obtained written responses from USPS officials and  interviewed them on policies, regulations, and procedures that govern  decisions when adding new delivery points and converting existing  delivery points to a different mode of delivery. These interviews included  USPS headquarters officials in the Washington, D.C., area and USPS  field officials in Washington, D.C.; Chicago, IL; Seattle, WA; Los Angeles,  CA; and Dallas and Coppell, TX. We selected these field locations to  reflect different population densities and climates, near GAO  headquarters and field offices, and geographically dispersed in five of the  seven USPS areas.use of less costly delivery modes, we obtained USPS data on  conversions of delivery points to less costly modes of delivery for fiscal  year 2013 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, the only periods for  which national data were available. We also obtained and reviewed  USPS data on the number of delivery points for each mode of delivery for  fiscal years 2008 through 2013. We obtained written responses regarding  the reliability of these data, analyzed their consistency with other USPS  data, and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report. To identify any impediments to delivery mode conversions,  we obtained written USPS responses, including some made in recent  public proceedings, and interviewed USPS headquarters and field  officials.
