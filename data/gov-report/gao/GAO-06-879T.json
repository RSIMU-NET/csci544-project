The limited data available suggest that state survey agency inspections do not identify all serious deficiencies. In addition, the lack of a straightforward method to link similar requirements across survey organizations makes it virtually impossible to assess lab quality in a standardized manner. Furthermore, CMS does not effectively use available data, such as the proportion of labs with serious deficiencies or proficiency testing results, to monitor lab quality. Proficiency testing is an objective measurement of a lab's ability to consistently produce accurate test results. GAO's analysis of proficiency testing data suggests that lab quality may not have improved at hospital labs in recent years. Oversight of clinical lab quality is not adequate to ensure that labs are meeting CLIA requirements. Weaknesses in five areas mask real and potential quality problems at labs. First, the balance struck between the CLIA program's educational and regulatory goals is sometimes inappropriately skewed toward education, which may result in understatement of survey findings. For example, even though the initial test failure rates were high, CMS instructed state survey agencies not to cite deficiencies during the first two years of required Pap smear proficiency testing to allow labs and their staff to become familiar with the program. Second, the manner in which one accrediting organization structures its survey teams raised concerns about appropriate levels of training and the appearance of a conflict of interest that could undermine the integrity of the survey process. Third, concerns about anonymity and lab workers' lack of familiarity with how to file a complaint suggests that some quality problems are not being reported.

Clinical lab tests  are one of the most frequently billed Medicare procedures and, according  to the American Clinical Laboratory Association, affect an estimated   70 percent of medical decisions. Ensuring accurate and reliable lab test  results is critical because erroneous results may lead to improper  treatment, unnecessary mental and physical anguish for patients, and  higher health care costs. Concerns about the quality of lab testing resulted  in enactment of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988  (CLIA). In recent years, despite CLIA, lab quality problems in several  states have raised questions about the adequacy of lab oversight.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for  overseeing compliance with clinical lab testing requirements. As of  December 2005, there were approximately 193,000 labs nationwide  ranging from very small physician office labs that conduct fewer than  2,000 tests annually, to hospital labs that conduct millions of tests each  year. Most clinical labs regulated under CLIA must obtain a certificate  from CMS, but only about 19 percent\u2014those that conduct moderate- to  high-complexity tests\u2014undergo biennial inspections, which are also  referred to as surveys. During the surveys, inspectors assess lab  compliance with mandated personnel and testing standards. In addition,  surveyed labs must participate in proficiency testing, a program that  requires them to test samples with unknown characteristics that are then  graded by an external party. Labs with serious deficiencies may be  sanctioned. Labs may choose to be surveyed by (1) their state survey  agency, under contract with CMS; (2) their state CLIA-exempt program for  labs in New York and Washington; or (3) one of six private accrediting  organizations. State survey agency inspections use CLIA requirements that  are intended to help ensure valid and reliable lab tests; the two state CLIA- exempt programs and six accrediting organizations survey labs using their  own requirements that CMS has determined to be at least equivalent to  CLIA\u2019s. Each survey organization is also responsible for investigating  complaints about lab quality.", "My remarks today will focus on (1) the quality of lab testing and (2) the  effectiveness of CMS and survey organization oversight of the CLIA  program. My testimony summarizes the findings of a report we released  today that examines these issues in more detail and includes numerous  recommendations to the CMS Administrator for improving the quality of  laboratory testing through closer oversight of clinical labs and the  administration of CLIA standards.", "To determine what is known about the quality of lab testing, we analyzed  data on serious deficiencies identified during surveys by state survey  agencies using CMS\u2019s On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting system  (OSCAR). We requested comparable data on serious deficiencies from  state CLIA-exempt programs and the three largest accrediting  organizations\u2014the College of American Pathologists (CAP), COLA, and  the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations  (JCAHO)\u2014which together survey about 97 percent of accredited labs. We  also analyzed proficiency testing data\u2014another indicator of a lab\u2019s ability  to produce accurate test results. To evaluate the effectiveness of CLIA  program oversight, we reviewed the processes used to ensure the quality  of clinical lab testing and analyzed available data related to these issues.  Based on our review and discussions with CMS and survey organization  officials, we focused on several key issues: (1) the balance struck between  the regulatory and educational goals of lab surveys, (2) the implications of  CAP\u2019s use of volunteer surveyors from neighboring labs to conduct  inspections, (3) how survey organizations facilitate the filing of  complaints, (4) the use of sanctions to encourage compliance, (5) CMS\u2019s  process for determining that the standards used by state CLIA-exempt  programs and accrediting organizations are at least equivalent to those of  CLIA, and (6) the results of validation reviews that are intended to assess  the adequacy of inspections by survey organizations. In addition, we  interviewed officials from CMS, three CMS regional offices, 10 state  survey agencies, the New York and Washington CLIA-exempt programs,  and the three largest accrediting organizations. We conducted our work  from January 2005 through May 2006 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, insufficient data exist to identify the extent of serious quality  problems at labs. When CMS implemented revised CLIA survey  requirements in 2004, it modified historical state survey agency findings  stored in its OSCAR database and, as a result, data prior to 2004 no longer  reflect key survey requirements in effect at the time of those surveys. The  limited data available suggest that state survey agency inspections do not  identify all serious deficiencies. In addition, the lack of a straightforward  method to link similar requirements across survey organizations makes it  virtually impossible to assess lab quality in a standardized manner, such as  identifying the proportion of labs with condition-level deficiencies, which  indicate serious or systemic quality problems. Furthermore, CMS does not  effectively use available data\u2014such as the proportion of labs with serious  deficiencies or proficiency testing results\u2014to monitor lab quality.  Proficiency testing is the one available data source that can be used to  uniformly compare lab quality across survey organizations. Although CMS  noted that proficiency testing trend data show a decrease in failures for  labs as a whole, we found that the data suggest that quality may not have  improved at hospital labs in recent years. Despite the importance of, and  the statutory requirement for, quarterly proficiency testing, CMS requires  proficiency testing for almost all laboratory tests only three times a year.", "Regarding oversight of clinical lab quality, we found that it is inadequate to  ensure that labs are meeting CLIA requirements. Weaknesses in six areas  mask real and potential quality problems at labs. First, the balance struck  between the CLIA program\u2019s educational and regulatory goals is  sometimes inappropriately skewed toward education, which may result in  understatement of survey findings. In one instance, CMS instructed state  survey agencies not to cite deficiencies for Pap smear proficiency test  results during the first two years of required testing, to allow labs and their  staff to become familiar with the program. Second, the way one  accrediting organization structures its volunteer survey teams raised  concerns about appropriate levels of training and the appearance of a  conflict of interest. Third, although few labs were the subject of a  complaint each year from 2002 through 2004\u2014significantly less than one  complaint per lab per year\u2014concerns about anonymity and lab workers\u2019  lack of familiarity with how to file a complaint suggest that some quality  problems may not be reported.

Fifth, CMS is not meeting its requirement to determine in a  timely manner the continued equivalency of accrediting organization and  exempt-state inspection requirements and processes. For example, New  York\u2019s and COLA\u2019s reviews were about 4 years and 3 years past due,  respectively, as of December 2005. Moreover, CMS allows the  implementation of changes to accrediting organization and exempt-state  program inspection requirements between periodic equivalency  determinations before it reviews the proposed changes. CMS attributed  these delays to having insufficient staff. Finally, validation reviews\u2014one  of CMS\u2019s most important oversight tools\u2014do not provide an independent  assessment of the extent to which surveys identify all serious deficiencies  because many are performed simultaneously with such surveys.", "Accordingly, in the report we released today, we made specific  recommendations to the CMS Administrator to standardize survey findings  across survey organizations in order to make meaningful comparisons;  strengthen survey, complaint, and enforcement processes; and improve  oversight of the CLIA program. In its comments on a draft of our report,  CMS endorsed our overall conclusion that quality assurance for the  nation\u2019s clinical labs should be strengthened and said that it would take  action in response to 11 of our 13 recommendations. CMS provided an  alternative assessment of lab quality, and disagreed with our  recommendations concerning the frequency of proficiency testing and the  extent of simultaneous accrediting organization validation reviews. CMS  also expressed concern about identifying and sanctioning labs with repeat  condition level deficiencies.

Standard-level  deficiencies denote problems that generally are not serious, while  condition-level deficiencies are cited when the problems are serious or  systemic in nature. When deficiencies are found during surveys or  complaint investigations, labs are required to submit a plan of correction,  detailing how and when they will address the deficiencies. Additionally,  CMS can impose principal or alternative sanctions, or both. Principal  sanctions include revocation of a CLIA certificate, cancellation of the right  to receive Medicare payments, or limits on testing. Alternative sanctions,  authorized by Congress to give CMS more flexibility to achieve lab  compliance, are less severe and include civil money penalties or on-site  monitoring. For condition-level deficiencies that do not involve an  imminent and serious threat to patient health and a significant hazard to  public health, labs have an opportunity to correct the deficiencies, which  we refer to as a grace period, before the sanctions are imposed.

In 2004,  the percentage of labs that were reported to have condition-level  deficiencies varied considerably by state, ranging from none in 6 states to  about 25 percent of labs in South Carolina. Based on interviews with CMS  and 10 state survey agencies, it appears that at least some of this  variability is due to differences in states\u2019 approaches to conducting their  surveys as opposed to true differences in lab quality. For example, CMS  told us that, because there is not a prescriptive checklist to guide the  survey process, the reliance on state surveyor judgment results in  variations in the citing of deficiencies.

As a result, data on  the quality of lab testing and trends in quality over time may be misleading.  CMS also appears to be inappropriately stressing education over  regulation. For instance, in its 2005 implementation of proficiency testing  for lab technicians who interpret Pap smears, a test for cervical cancer,  CMS instructed state surveyors to refrain from citing deficiencies at labs  whose staff fail the tests in 2005 or 2006. According to CMS, this  educational focus allows labs and their staff to become familiar with the  proficiency testing program; however, it is important to note that there  was about a 13-year time lag between the 1992 regulations that  implemented CLIA and the 2005 implementation of Pap smear proficiency  testing. In addition, CMS noted that it was concerned about some of the  high initial Pap smear proficiency testing failure rates. An inappropriate  balance between the educational and regulatory roles is also evident in  some accrediting organization practices.

Moreover, CMS did not  sanction 3 labs that COLA concluded had cheated on proficiency testing  by referring the samples to another lab to be tested. By statute, the  intentional referral of samples to another lab for proficiency testing is a  serious deficiency that should result in automatic revocation of a lab\u2019s  CLIA certificate for at least 1 year. Based on our interviews, we found  that the 3 labs were allowed to continue testing because they had initiated  corrective actions; in effect, these labs were given an opportunity to  correct a deficiency that appears to have required a loss of their CLIA  certificate for at least 1 year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Is Late in Ensuring CLIA Equivalency of Exempt States\u2019 and Accrediting Organizations\u2019 Inspection Requirements and Processes", "paragraphs": ["We found that CMS has been late in determining that exempt states\u2019 and  accrediting organizations\u2019 inspection requirements and processes are at  least equivalent to CLIA\u2019s. Because CMS has not completed its equivalency  reviews within required time frames, accrediting organizations and exempt  state programs have continued to operate without proper approval.  Equivalency reviews for CAP, COLA, JCAHO, and Washington due to be  completed between November 1, 1997, and April 30, 2001, were an average  of about 40 months late. In August 1995, CMS determined that New York\u2019s  next equivalency review should be completed by June 30, 2001, but was  over 4 years past due as of December 2005. Similarly, COLA\u2019s equivalency  review was about 3 years past due. Furthermore, although federal  regulations require CMS to review equivalency when an accrediting  organization or exempt-state program adopts new requirements, CMS has  not reviewed changes in the inspection requirements prior to use by these  entities. As a result, such survey organizations may introduce changes  that are inconsistent with CLIA requirements. For example, JCAHO made  a significant change to its inspection requirements in January 2004; CMS  did not begin an in-depth review of JCAHO\u2019s revised requirements until  early 2005\u2014over a year after they were implemented by JCAHO.", "According to CMS, its review has identified several critical areas where  JCAHO standards are less stringent than those of CLIA. JCAHO  acknowledged the need to make some adjustments to its revised  requirements.", "CMS officials attributed delays in making equivalency determinations and  reviewing interim changes to having too few staff. The CLIA program,  located in CMS\u2019s Center for Medicaid and State Operations (CMSO),  currently has approximately 21 full-time-equivalent positions compared to  a peak of 29 such positions several years ago. As required by statute, the  CLIA program is funded by lab fees and since its inception the program\u2019s  fees have exceeded expenses. As of September 30, 2005, the CLIA program  had a carryover balance of about $70 million\u2014far more than required to  hire an additional six to seven staff members. However, CMS officials told  us that because the CLIA program staff are part of CMSO, they are subject  to the personnel limits established for CMSO, regardless of whether or not  the program has sufficient funds to hire more staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Validation Reviews Skip Some State Survey Agencies and Many Lack Independence", "paragraphs": ["CMS validation reviews that are intended to evaluate lab surveys  conducted by both states and accrediting organizations do not provide  CMS with an independent assessment of the extent to which surveys  identify all serious\u2014that is, condition-level or condition-level equivalent\u2014 deficiencies. CMS requires its regional offices to conduct validation  reviews of 1 percent of labs inspected by state survey agencies in a year.  However, CMS does not specifically require that validations occur in each  state. As a result, from 1999 through 2003, there were 11 states in which no  validation reviews were conducted in multiple years. Without validating at  least some surveys in each state, CMS is unable to determine if the states  are appropriately identifying deficiencies.", "Many validation reviews occur at the same time a survey organization  conducts its inspection and, in our view, the collaboration among the two  teams during these simultaneous surveys prevents an independent  evaluation. Seventy-five percent of validations of state lab surveys were  conducted simultaneously from fiscal years 1999 through 2003. According  to CMS officials, the large proportion of simultaneous validation reviews  provides an opportunity for federal surveyors to share information with  state surveyors, monitor their conformance with CLIA inspection  requirements, and identify training and technical assistance needs.  However, we found that such reviews do not provide an accurate  assessment of state surveyors\u2019 ability to identify condition-level  deficiencies. Of the 13 validation reviews that identified missed condition- level deficiencies, only 1 was a simultaneous review. Regarding validation  reviews of accrediting organization\u2019s survey of labs, CMS officials were  unable to tell us how many of the roughly 275 validation reviews  conducted each year from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2003 were  simultaneous. However, JCAHO estimated that 33 percent of its  validation reviews were conducted simultaneously. CMS officials told us  that the agency\u2019s intent in instituting simultaneous reviews was for state  and accrediting organization surveyors to share best practices, to promote  understanding of each other\u2019s programs, and to foster accrediting  organization improvement. In contrast, most of the state survey agency  officials we interviewed told us that simultaneous validation reviews do  not provide a realistic evaluation of the adequacy of accrediting  organizations\u2019 inspection processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Clinical labs play a pivotal role in the nation\u2019s health care system by  diagnosing many diseases, including potentially life-threatening diseases,  so that individuals receive appropriate medical care. Given this important  role, lab tests must be accurate and reliable. Our work demonstrated that  the oversight of clinical labs needs to be strengthened in several areas.  Without standardized survey findings across all survey organizations, CMS  cannot tell whether the quality of lab testing has improved or worsened  over time or whether deficiencies are being appropriately identified. Using  data to analyze activities across survey organizations can be a powerful  tool in improving CMS oversight of the CLIA program, yet CMS has not  taken the lead in ensuring the availability and use of data from survey  organizations to help it monitor their performance. Furthermore, the  agency is not requiring that labs participate in proficiency testing on a  quarterly basis, as required by CLIA. More broadly, CMS and survey  organization oversight of the lab survey process is not adequate to enforce  CLIA requirements. Educating labs to ensure high-quality testing should  complement but not replace the enforcement of CLIA inspection  requirements. Labs with the same serious deficiencies on consecutive  surveys often escape sanctions, even though Congress authorized  alternative sanctions to give CMS more flexibility to achieve lab  compliance. Without the threat of real consequences, labs may not be  sufficiently motivated to comply with CLIA inspection requirements. By  allowing validation reviews to occur simultaneously with surveys and  permitting some states to go without validation reviews over a period of  several years, CMS is not making full use of this oversight tool. Moreover,  independent validation reviews of accrediting organization surveys are  critical because CMS has not conducted equivalency reviews within the  time frames it established. The recommendations we have made would  help CMS to consistently identify and address lab quality problems.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks.
