The objectives of the program are to expand affordable housing opportunities, help revitalize neighborhoods, and reduce HUD's property inventory in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner. Although the Inspector General recommended that the agency suspend the program and evaluate its viability, HUD did neither. GAO was asked to assess (1) the costs of the program to HUD, (2) the benefits of the program to homebuyers, and (3) HUD's efforts to monitor participating nonprofits and enforce program requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Discount Sales Program poses significant costs to HUD, is of questionable benefit to homebuyers, and has serious monitoring and compliance problems. GAO estimates that the program cost HUD between $18.8 and $23.9 million in calendar year 2002. Between $15.1 and $20.2 million was a reduction in net revenue resulting from HUD's selling approximately 1,200 properties through the program instead of through its regular sales process. Personnel expenses for administering the program accounted for the remaining $3.7 million. GAO's analysis of 238 properties sold under the program in 2002 suggests that most of the homebuyers did not benefit financially. Assuming that nonprofits and homebuyers would incur the same rehabilitation costs, GAO estimates that 76 percent of the homebuyers would have spent less purchasing the properties through HUD's regular process and paying for the rehabilitation work themselves. And while the program can help homebuyers access a range of homeownership services, these services are also available from other sources. GAO did not evaluate the extent to which the program generated other benefits, such as neighborhood revitalization. While uncovering numerous program violations, HUD's monitoring efforts have faced challenges. For example, HUD monitors nonprofits through desk reviews of the annual reports it requires nonprofits to submit each February. However, as of July 2003, HUD's four homeownership centers, which administer the program, had not received reports for more than half of the properties the agency estimates were purchased and resold under the program in 2002. Even with this problem, the desk reviews found that 28 of the 44 nonprofits that submitted reports violated resale limits, earning an estimated total of $704,720 in excess profits. HUD requires that nonprofits use their excess profits to pay down the mortgages of the homebuyers they overcharged, but the agency's ability to enforce this requirement is extremely limited. As of July 2003, nonprofits had made only $62,000 in payments on mortgages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  acquires tens of thousands of single-family properties through foreclosures  when homeowners default on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing  Administration (FHA).

Under the Discount Sales  Program, HUD sells properties at 10, 15, or 30 percent discounts to  nonprofit organizations and government entities (nonprofits) that then  rehabilitate (rehab) the homes as necessary and resell them to low- and  moderate-income homebuyers. However, a November 2001 report by  HUD\u2019s Inspector General concluded that low- and moderate-income  homebuyers did not benefit significantly from the program; that many  participating nonprofits were actually profit-motivated entities; and that  HUD lacked effective approval, monitoring, and enforcement procedures.

Under the program, approved  nonprofit organizations receive a discount when purchasing HUD-owned  single-family properties and are required to rehabilitate and resell them to  low- or moderate-income homebuyers. As of August 2003, 423 nonprofits  were approved to participate in the program, down from more than 2,000  nonprofits 3 years earlier. HUD attributed the reduction to changes in the  program, such as stricter approval standards and increased reporting  requirements, and to the agency\u2019s efforts to remove nonprofits that violate  program rules.", "HUD acquires properties through foreclosures of homes with FHA-insured  mortgages. FHA provides federally backed mortgage insurance primarily to  low-income and first-time homebuyers who might otherwise have difficulty  obtaining a mortgage. In calendar year 2002, HUD acquired more than  67,000 properties through foreclosures and sold approximately 65,000  properties from its inventory. At the end of calendar year 2002, HUD had an  inventory of 32,018 single-family properties.", "HUD sells the properties in its inventory in as-is condition through a  number of different programs. Table 1 shows the primary programs HUD  uses to sell properties and the number of properties sold under each during  calendar year 2002. Most HUD-owned properties are eligible for price  reductions under the Discount Sales Program. The program accounted for  approximately 2 percent of HUD\u2019s overall property sales in calendar year  2002.", "HUD offers discounts of 10, 15, and 30 percent to nonprofit organizations.  The size of the discount depends on several factors: whether a property in  as-is condition is eligible for FHA insurance, whether it is located in a  revitalization area, and whether it is sold individually or in a package of  five or more homes. HUD inspects and appraises all foreclosed properties  to determine whether they are again eligible for FHA mortgage insurance.  FHA will insure mortgages only on properties that meet HUD\u2019s minimum  property standards and local building codes or that need less than $5,000 in  repairs in order to meet these standards. Properties needing more than  $5,000 in repairs are considered uninsurable. For purposes of the Discount  Sales Program, HUD then differentiates properties by location. All  insurable properties receive a 10 or 15 percent discount whether or not  they are located in a revitalization zone. The 15 percent discount is only  applied if the property is part of a group of five or more properties  purchased in a single transaction. Uninsurable properties lying outside  revitalization areas also receive these discounts, but those located within  revitalization areas are eligible for the steepest discount\u201430 percent.", "Under the Discount Sales Program, HUD has two methods of selling  properties to nonprofits: competitive bidding and noncompetitive sales.  Both methods allow discounts for nonprofits. Under the competitive  process, HUD establishes a list price for the properties but will accept bids  that are lower. HUD posts the properties, with their list prices, on the  Internet in its general listings and accepts bids from prospective owner- occupants and nonprofits, but not investors, for a priority period of 10 to 30  days, depending on the geographic area. HUD awards the property to the  owner-occupant or nonprofit with the highest bid. If the highest bidder is a  nonprofit, HUD grants a 10 or 15 percent discount off the bid price when it  closes on the home. For properties that fail to sell during this priority  period, HUD then accepts bids from the general public, including investors.", "The noncompetitive sales method applies only to uninsurable properties.  HUD lists these properties separately from its general listings and makes  them available to nonprofits through a HUD contractor\u2019s Web site.  Nonprofits have a priority period of 5 days to express interest in the  properties at HUD\u2019s list price. If more than one nonprofit expresses interest  in a property, HUD selects the buyer by lottery. As with competitive sales,  the discount is applied at closing. Properties that are not sold  noncompetitively are placed in HUD\u2019s general listings and made available  for sale on a competitive basis.", "Nonprofits that purchase properties under the Discount Sales Program are  responsible for rehabilitating them as needed to meet HUD\u2019s minimum  property standards and local building codes. Nonprofits are required to  limit their resale price to no more than 110 percent of their \u201cnet  development cost,\u201d or the sum of their allowable costs for acquiring,  rehabilitating, and reselling the properties. Nonprofits must also sell the  homes to buyers whose incomes do not exceed 115 percent of their area\u2019s  median income, adjusted for family size.", "HUD\u2019s four HOCs administer the Discount Sales Program and oversee the  participating nonprofits. The HOCs process nonprofits\u2019 applications to  participate in the program and monitor nonprofits for compliance once  they begin purchasing, rehabilitating, and reselling homes. To help monitor  the program, HUD requires nonprofits to submit annual reports to the  appropriate HOC by February 1 of each year. The reports must provide  information on properties the nonprofits have bought, rehabilitated, and  resold, including repair costs, prices to homebuyers, and homebuyers\u2019  incomes. HOC staff also conduct on-site visits to nonprofits and properties  to review files and inspect repairs, among other things. When a nonprofit  fails to follow the program\u2019s requirements, HOCs may remove the nonprofit  from the program.", "In recent years, HUD has changed some of its program requirements to  increase its oversight of nonprofits. For example, in 2000 HUD issued  guidance establishing uniform standards for nonprofits applying to  participate in the program. The guidance outlines specific information  nonprofits must submit in applying for the program, mandates that  nonprofits recertify with HUD every 2 years, and requires that nonprofits  answer detailed questions about their ability to carry out affordable  housing programs.", "To address concerns raised in the HUD Inspector General\u2019s 2001 report on  the program, HUD issued additional guidance in December 2001 designed  to strengthen the program\u2019s reporting and accountability requirements.  Until this guidance was issued, nonprofits needed to meet HUD\u2019s annual  reporting and net development cost requirements only for properties  purchased at a 30 percent discount. The guidance expanded annual  reporting and resale price requirements to all properties, regardless of  discount level, and clarified HUD\u2019s net development cost calculation by  providing a detailed list of allowable and unallowable costs.", "Also in response to the Inspector General\u2019s report, HUD issued guidance in  January 2002 designed to tighten eligibility requirements for nonprofits.  Among other things, the guidance described circumstances that could  create a conflict of interest between nonprofits and their business partners.  In addition, it required that nonprofits be incorporated as 501(c)(3)  organizations for at least 2 years and have a minimum of 2 consecutive  years of affordable housing experience within the last 5 years. Finally, to  accommodate HUD\u2019s on-site reviews, the guidance required nonprofits to  maintain property records in a specified format.", "HUD did not implement all of the Inspector General\u2019s recommendations.

For example, on a regular sale,  HUD pays the homebuyer\u2019s closing and financing costs and the sales  commission of the successful selling broker, within certain guidelines.  HUD does not pay either of these costs for properties sold through the  Discount Sales Program. HUD does not require a selling broker for the  properties nonprofits purchase through the program; consequently, there is  generally no selling broker\u2019s commission for these transactions. HUD  incurs other types of costs for all properties whether or not they are part of  the program. These costs include (1) the fees and reimbursable expenses it  pays to management and marketing contractors responsible for inspecting,  appraising, securing, maintaining, and selling HUD-owned properties; (2)  sales incentives in the form of cash allowances that HUD periodically  offers to homebuyers\u2014including nonprofits\u2014that close relatively quickly  on executed sales contracts; (3) the listing broker\u2019s fee; and (4) the  property taxes for the period when HUD owned the home.", "To determine the impact of the Discount Sales Program on HUD\u2019s net  revenues (i.e., the selling price minus holding and selling costs) we  compared the estimated net revenues HUD received for the discounted  properties with the estimated net revenues HUD would have received if it  had sold the properties through its regular sales process. Using data from  HUD\u2019s SAMS and the U.S. Census Bureau, we made this determination for 1,194 properties that HUD sold through the program in calendar year  2002. We used a statistical model that included data for these properties  and approximately 4,000 properties HUD sold through its regular process  during the same year. We found that by selling the 1,194 properties  through the Discount Sales Program instead of its regular sales process,  HUD reduced the net revenue it received in calendar year 2002.  Specifically, we estimate that the total reduction in HUD\u2019s net revenue was  between $15.1 and $20.2 million, an average of between $12,672 and  $16,945 per property.

In contrast, the properties sold with 30  percent discounts represented less than one-third of the total properties  sold but more than 40 percent of the overall reduction in net revenue.  Finally, the properties with 15 percent discounts accounted for about 9  percent of the total properties and between 7 and 10 percent of the overall  reduction in HUD\u2019s net revenue.", "According to HUD officials, the agency\u2019s database somewhat overstates the  number of properties sold with a 10 percent discount (the most common  type) and somewhat understates the number sold with a 15 percent  discount (the least common type). The officials said this overstatement  occurs because HUD does not always update its database to reflect the fact  that a property, indicated in the database as being sold with a 10 percent  discount, may actually have been sold at a 15 percent discount if it was part  of a group of five or more properties bought in a single transaction. As a  result, our analysis may overestimate the reduction in net revenue for  properties discounted by 10 percent and underestimate it for those  discounted by 15 percent.", "As shown in table 3, the overall and average reductions in net revenues also  varied by HOC. A major reason for this variance was differences among the  centers in the proportion of their properties sold with 30 percent discounts.  Because 30 percent discount properties cost HUD more in net revenue than  properties at the other discount levels, the HOC with the highest  proportion of 30 percent properties\u2014Santa Ana\u2014had the greatest  reduction in net revenue. The HOC with the lowest proportion\u2014Denver\u2014 had the smallest reduction in net revenue.", "HUD officials told us they were aware that the program reduced the  agency\u2019s net revenue from property sales.

According to HUD, in administering the Discount Sales Program, HOC staff  perform tasks that are not part of HUD\u2019s regular home-selling process. For  example, for the Discount Sales Program, center staff approve and recertify  participating nonprofit organizations and monitor the nonprofits\u2019  compliance with program requirements\u2014tasks they do not perform for the  regular sales process.

For example, HUD allows nonprofits to resell discounted properties for up  to 110 percent of the \u201cnet development cost,\u201d or the cost of buying the  property plus allowable rehab, holding, and selling costs. The 10 percent  markup helps nonprofits to cover the overhead expenses they incur by  participating in the program. However, taking a 10 percent markup on a  property purchased at a 10 or 15 percent discount effectively cancels out all  or most of the discount.

However, the effectiveness of desk reviews as a monitoring  tool has been limited because many nonprofits have not submitted annual  reports on time, and others have provided incomplete information.  Specifically, as of July 2003\u2014more than 5 months after the annual reports  were due\u2014HUD lacked reports from nonprofits accounting for more than  half of the 626 properties it estimates were bought, rehabbed, and resold in  calendar year 2002. The HOCs had reports for properties resold to  homebuyers from only 44 of the 166 nonprofits that purchased discounted  properties in calendar year 2002. Other nonprofits submitted reports that  lacked all of the data the HOCs needed to assess the participants\u2019  compliance with program requirements. For example, as of April 2003,  more than half of the annual reports received at the Denver HOC did not  contain the information necessary to determine the nonprofits\u2019 net  development costs for the properties. As a result, staff could not determine  whether the nonprofits had sold their properties at prices that were within  program limits. Similarly, more than one-third of the reports received by  the Atlanta HOC as of July 2003 did not contain the required certification of  the homebuyers\u2019 income levels. Without this information, the HOC had no  assurance that the properties were sold to homebuyers with low and  moderate incomes, as required.", "According to HOC officials, efforts to collect missing data and resolve  other reporting issues can take months. For example, staff at the Atlanta  HOC told us that they spent large amounts of time calling and writing  nonprofits to gather the information missing from the annual reports.  Although three of the HOCs\u2014Atlanta, Denver, and Santa Ana---had  originally planned to complete their desk reviews by the end of April 2003,  these reviews were still under way in mid-July 2003.

For example, all four HOCs sent reminder letters to  nonprofits several weeks before the annual reports were due. In addition,  HOC officials told us they provided either one-on-one or group training to  nonprofits on submitting annual reports and meeting other program  requirements. HOC officials speculated that a major reason for the  reporting problems was that many nonprofits lacked adequate  administrative capacity. However, they also said that carrying out in-depth  assessments of administrative capacity as part of the initial approval  process would require a costly on-site evaluation of every applicant.", "In October 2003, HOC officials told us that as a result of their follow-up  efforts, they had made significant progress in obtaining annual reports  from nonprofits that had not reported earlier in the year. However, during  the long time it takes the HOCs to obtain and review annual reports,  nonprofits may continue to purchase more homes and violate program  rules.

The Santa Ana HOC, which  sold properties to 52 nonprofits in calendar year 2002, did not perform any  on-site reviews.  Santa Ana HOC officials told us that the center\u2019s large  geographic jurisdiction made it impractical for them to travel to nonprofits\u2019  offices. To compensate for the lack of on-site reviews, the Santa Ana center  uses an in-depth version of the desk review, requiring nonprofits to submit  large amounts of supporting documentation, including invoices, with their  annual reports.

These violations occurred on about 124 (47 percent) of the 265  properties covered by the annual reports and resulted in homebuyers being  overcharged an estimated total of $704,720. The amount of the estimated  overcharges varied significantly from property to property, ranging from  under $10 to more than $40,000. For example, one nonprofit closed on a  discounted home in New York for $117,600 in October 2002 and spent  about $41,000 to rehab the property. The nonprofit subsequently resold the  property for $234,000, or $43,333 more than the program allowed.  Assuming the homebuyer had secured a 30-year loan at 6 percent interest  (the prevailing rate at the time the homebuyer made the purchase), the  overcharge increased the homebuyer\u2019s annual mortgage payments by more  than $3,100.", "The HOCs\u2019 desk reviews also identified three cases in which nonprofits  violated program requirements by reselling discounted properties to  homebuyers whose incomes exceeded 115 percent of the area median  income.

Among these violations were a lack of auditable records,  unallowable rehabilitation costs, and conflicts of interest between  nonprofits and their rehabilitation contractors. For example, one review  disclosed that the nonprofit had made bulk purchases of the materials it  needed to rehabilitate discounted properties but, contrary to program  requirements, did not maintain records showing the costs of these  purchases or the materials that were used for each home. As a result, the  reviewers could not verify the net development cost for any of these  properties. In another on-site review, the Atlanta staff found that the  nonprofit was not in control of the day-to-day operations of its discount  property purchases.

In recent years, the HOCs frequently used  removal to hold nonprofits in the Discount Sales Program responsible for a  variety of compliance problems. In calendar year 2002, for example, the  Santa Ana HOC removed 31 nonprofits from the program, mostly for failure  to submit annual reports, conflicts of interest, selling homes for more than  program limits or to families that were not low- or moderate-income, and  lack of administrative or financial capacity.

HOC  staff must carefully document their justification for the action and must  follow due process procedures that can be lengthy, particularly if a  nonprofit appeals the removal decision. HOC officials said that once they  decide to remove a nonprofit, they often restrict the number of properties it  may purchase in an effort to reduce the potential for further  noncompliance during the due process period. Second, once a nonprofit is  removed, it has little incentive to report to HUD on the discounted  properties it resold or to surrender any of the excess profits it may have  earned.

However, Philadelphia HOC officials and attorneys from HUD\u2019s  Office of General Counsel also told us that the agency\u2019s authority to enforce  the requirement was not specified in regulation and was therefore in  question. Furthermore, the attorneys said that as a practical matter the  requirement would be difficult to enforce, as HUD would have to refer  nonprofits that refused to comply to the Department of Justice for legal  action. The officials said they doubted whether Justice would accept these  cases because the amounts of money involved are generally relatively  small\u2014often less than $10,000\u2014and it would be cost-prohibitive for  Justice\u2019s attorneys to pursue them. HUD officials added that obtaining  enough documentation to build a convincing legal case was difficult,  because many nonprofits do not keep proper financial records that  adequately document the amount of excess profits earned.", "As a result of these problems, the HOCs had limited success getting  nonprofits to use excess profits to pay down homebuyers\u2019 mortgages.  According to HOC officials, the nonprofits that have paid down mortgages  did so voluntarily because they wanted to stay in the program.

Our analysis suggests that the  program is of questionable benefit to most homebuyers. In addition, the  HOCs\u2019 monitoring and enforcement efforts do not adequately ensure that  nonprofits are complying with requirements designed to protect  homebuyers\u2019 financial interests. And despite the program\u2019s significant cost,  HUD has not determined whether the program is meeting its objectives of  expanding affordable housing opportunities, helping to revitalize  neighborhoods, and reducing HUD\u2019s property inventory in a timely,  efficient, and cost-effective manner.", "Measures to address the cost, benefit, and compliance issues raised in this  report are likely to be expensive or have adverse effects. For example, to  reduce the cost of the program, HUD could reduce the size of its discounts,  dedicate fewer staff resources to the program, or both. However, these  actions would likely reduce the program\u2019s financial benefit to homebuyers  and weaken HUD\u2019s ability to oversee participating nonprofits. Conversely,  to increase financial benefits to homebuyers, HUD could increase the size  of its discounts, but doing so would effectively raise the cost of the  program.", "Taken together, the program\u2019s problems and the lack of clear solutions  raise serious questions about whether HUD should continue to operate it.  We recognize that contemplating the termination of the program involves  trade-offs. In the absence of the program, it is possible that some  individuals and families would have difficulty purchasing suitable homes  and that neighborhood conditions would suffer if HUD-owned properties  were not rehabilitated or sold as quickly.

In a  letter from the Assistant Secretary for Housing (see app. I), HUD agreed  with our recommendations to further assess the program and said it would  proceed accordingly. Also, HUD disagreed with some aspects of our  methodology and said that our analysis overstated the program\u2019s costs and  understated its benefits. Lastly, HUD said that the report should  acknowledge the significance of the multiple public policy objectives the  program serves. However, HUD did not respond to our third  recommendation concerning the possible termination of the program if,  after further evaluation, HUD determines that the program\u2019s current costs  plus the resources needed to improve it exceed its benefits.", "More specifically, HUD stated that any conclusions about program costs  should be based on actual program performance rather than on  \u201chypothetical extrapolations.\u201d  We designed our analysis to estimate the  effect of the Discount Sales Program while holding constant the effect of  other factors, such as neighborhood and property characteristics, that  might also influence the ratio of the net revenue HUD receives from selling  a property to the property\u2019s appraised value. To implement this approach,  we developed a statistical model using data from actual HUD property  sales and compared (1) the net revenue our model estimated HUD would  have received for each discounted property had the property been sold  through the regular process with (2) the net revenue our model estimated  HUD would have received by selling the property through the Discount  Sales Program. Each estimated value contained an error term that captured  the effects of omitted variables unavailable for the modeling process. As  appendix II of our draft report explained, comparing two estimated values  removed the influence of the omitted variables from our comparison,  leaving the effect of the program on HUD\u2019s net revenue. HUD said that its  own preliminary comparison of net revenues from program and  nonprogram property sales had shown that the loss in net revenue from the  program was substantially less than our estimate indicated, and that our  report significantly overstated the program\u2019s cost. Because HUD did not  provide us details of its analysis, we cannot determine why HUD\u2019s results  differed from ours. We continue to believe that isolating the effect of the  program from other influences, rather than making comparisons that do  not control for these factors, is the most appropriate way to estimate the  impact of the Discount Sales Program on HUD\u2019s net revenue.", "HUD also said that our conclusion that most homebuyers did not benefit  financially from the program rested on the assumption that individual  homebuyers would have access to rehab financing on terms as favorable as  nonprofits and would have the skills to oversee the construction. HUD  disagreed with this assumption and said it believes that nonprofits have  both the ability to obtain financing that is unavailable to average  homebuyers and the capacity to oversee the rehab work at a cost that \u201cmay  be less than that\u201d charged by profit-motivated firms. As a result, HUD said  that our report significantly understated the program\u2019s benefit to  homebuyers. Our draft report recognized the possibility that individual  homebuyers might not be able to rehab a home as cheaply as a nonprofit.  For this reason, we estimated the program\u2019s financial benefits under two  scenarios. The first assumed equal rehab costs for nonprofits and  homebuyers; the second assumed that homebuyers would pay 25 percent  more than a nonprofit for the same rehab work. Under both scenarios, our  estimates indicated that most homebuyers did not benefit financially from  the program. Our draft report also recognized that obtaining financing for  rehab work and overseeing this work are obstacles for some homebuyers,  and that these and other factors that are difficult to quantify may make the  program either more or less beneficial from a homebuyer\u2019s perspective.  However, it is important to note that homebuyers financing properties  purchased through the Discount Sales Program in effect pay financing  costs for the rehab work because the cost of this work is included in the  nonprofit\u2019s selling price (i.e., the homebuyer\u2019s purchase price) and  therefore is reflected in the homebuyer\u2019s mortgage costs. Furthermore,  because more than half of the properties we reviewed received less than  $15,000 in rehab work\u2014including some that received none at all\u2014it is  unlikely that the oversight costs for these projects would be very  substantial.", "Finally, HUD said that the Discount Sales Program serves several public  policy purposes and was neither conceived as nor intended to be only a  source of revenue for FHA. HUD stated that the program contributes in a  \u201cdirect and positive manner\u201d to the promotion of homeownership and the  revitalization of neighborhoods and that our report should acknowledge  the significance of these objectives. Our draft report did not indicate that  the program was intended to be solely a source of revenue. In addition, our  draft report recognized that the goals of the program include the expansion  of affordable housing opportunities and neighborhood revitalization and  included statements from HUD and nonprofit officials about how the  program may help to improve neighborhood conditions. Furthermore,  HUD\u2019s comments do not recognize the potential of the agency\u2019s regular  sales process to help achieve the same goals. Nevertheless, we added  language to the final report to reflect HUD\u2019s views about the program\u2019s  potential benefits.

To determine the effect of the program  on HUD\u2019s net revenue, we performed a statistical analysis of data from  HUD\u2019s Single-Family Acquired Asset Management (SAMS) and the U.S.  Census Bureau. This analysis allowed us to estimate how much less net  revenue HUD received by selling properties through the program instead of  its regular sales process, while controlling for other factors. Appendix II  provides detailed information on our statistical model. Because HUD does  not keep records that would identify the costs to administer the program,  we asked HUD to estimate them. HUD developed its estimate by querying  HOC and Office of Housing officials about the number of staff years they  allotted to the program in calendar year 2002. HUD used this information  and salary and benefit data to derive an approximate personnel cost for the  program.

To determine the extent to which homebuyers benefited financially from  the program, we performed a statistical analysis using data from HUD\u2019s  SAMS, the Bureau of the Census, and the four HOCs. Our analysis was  limited to 238 discounted properties that HUD sold between February 1  and December 31, 2002, that nonprofits resold to homebuyers that same  year. These were the only properties for which the HOCs had the rehab and  resale data necessary for our analysis. This analysis allowed us to compare  what homebuyers actually paid for the discounted homes to our estimate of  what they would have spent had they purchased the homes under HUD\u2019s  regular sales process and paid for the rehab work themselves. Our analysis  assumed that in the absence of the Discount Sales Program, a homebuyer  would be able to purchase the same home and rehabilitate it to the same  extent as the nonprofit. We also assumed that a homebuyer would inhabit  the home during the rehabilitation and, therefore, would not incur housing  expenses for two residences during that period. We performed the analysis  twice using different assumptions about rehab costs each time. The first  time we assumed that a homebuyer would incur the same rehab costs as a  nonprofit; the second time we assumed that homebuyers would incur 25  percent higher rehab costs than a nonprofit. Appendix II provides detailed  information on our statistical model. In assessing the program\u2019s financial  benefits, we also reviewed HUD\u2019s rules and instructions for both the  Discount Sales Program and the agency\u2019s regular sales process and  interviewed officials from HUD\u2019s Office of Housing. To determine the types  of services and assistance provided by participating nonprofits, we visited  6 nonprofits that were actively involved in the program and interviewed  officials from these organizations. During our visits to the four HOCs, we  reviewed the affordable housing plans for a judgmental sample of 17  nonprofits and interviewed the nonprofit coordinator at each HOC.

We analyzed SAMS data, nonprofits\u2019 annual  reports, and desk reviews to determine the extent to which (1) nonprofits  submitted required monitoring information through their annual reports  and (2) the HOCs\u2019 monitoring efforts identified noncompliance with  requirements governing the resale price of discounted properties and the  income level of the homebuyers. From the desk review information, which  was current as of July 2003, we also determined the estimated excess  profits earned by the nonprofit organizations that submitted annual  reports. For each HOC, we used SAMS data and on-site review logs to  determine how many of the nonprofits that purchased discounted  properties were subject to an on-site visit. We also examined the results of  these reviews and discussed them with cognizant HOC officials to  determine how they were conducted and the types of problems they  uncovered.

In addition, 3,776 observations were lost  during the merger of the Census data because of the inability to identify the  census tract in which they were located. As a result, these observations  were not included in our analysis. In order to make the properties more  comparable, we also restricted the set of properties to only those  properties in census tracts in which at least one discount sale was made.  Finally, we excluded some observations with extreme values for the  dependent variable in our first model, which resulted in 5,189 observations  being used in the regression analysis.", "Specification of the Models We developed two econometric models possessing the same set of  explanatory variables. We used the first model to estimate the cost of the  Discount Sales Program to HUD. In this model, the dependent variable is  HUD\u2019s net revenue from the sale of a property divided by the property\u2019s  appraised value. Net revenue equals HUD\u2019s selling price minus property  taxes paid by HUD, management and marketing contractor costs, financing  and closing costs (including discounts) paid by HUD, the listing broker fee,  and the cost of any HUD sales incentives. We used the second model to  estimate the benefits of the program to homebuyers. In this model, the  dependent variable is simply HUD\u2019s selling price for a property divided by  its appraised value. The explanatory variables used in both models are of  four types:  dummy variables identifying the homeownership center (HOC)  that administered the sale; dummy variables describing a combination of  HOC and discount level, for those properties sold through the Discount  Sales Program; characteristics of the property; and characteristics of the  neighborhood. We chose the final specification of the models to obtain a  good fit while avoiding problems with multicollinearity.", "We chose the property and neighborhood characteristics based on a review  of the specifications employed in hedonic housing models. Such models  treat the housing market as an integrated series of submarkets for various  housing characteristics such as house size and neighborhood quality. A set  of housing and neighborhood characteristics can serve to describe a  product like housing because individual housing units can be differentiated  from one another in many ways.", "Selling price is the amount paid to HUD by either the nonprofit or the  private individual purchasing the property. Property taxes are the annual  property tax multiplied by the number of days the property was owned by  HUD divided by 365. Management and marketing contractor costs  encompass all fees and reimbursable costs HUD pays to these contractors.  Financing and closing costs paid by HUD include any discount granted to a  nonprofit organization. The selling fee is the commission that HUD paid to  the selling broker. This fee is generally zero for properties sold to  nonprofits. All HUD properties are placed with a listing broker, so this  generates a listing broker fee. Incentives are cash back allowances that  HUD periodically pays to homebuyers who close on an executed sales  contract relatively quickly\u2014for example, within 30 to 60 days. Appraised  value is the amount at which the property was appraised before the sale.", "The explanatory variables belong to one of four groups of variables:  those  identifying the HOC that administered the sale; those describing a  combination of HOC and discount level, for those properties sold through  the Discount Sales Program; those describing characteristics of the house;  and those describing characteristics of the neighborhood. This  specification allows the net revenue as a fraction of the appraised value for  properties sold through the regular program to vary by HOC, and it allows  the effect of the Discount Sales Program on HUD\u2019s net revenue to vary by  HOC and by discount level. We defined a set of HOC dummy variables that  take on a value of 1 for all sales (discounted and not discounted)  administered by that HOC, with Atlanta as the omitted category, and 0  otherwise. We then defined a set of dummy variables that represented  combinations of HOC and discount program level. For example, there is a  dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 for all sales with a 10 percent  discount made by the Atlanta HOC and 0 otherwise, etc. In this way, the  coefficient on that variable represents the difference in the fraction of the  appraised value obtained on property sales with a 10 percent discount and  made by the Atlanta HOC, compared with the fraction obtained by the  Atlanta HOC on sales made through the regular program. Similarly, the  coefficient on the dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 for all sales  with a discount level of 30 percent made by the Santa Ana HOC represents  the difference in the fraction of the appraised value obtained on property  sales made at a 30 percent discount and made by the Santa Ana HOC,  compared with the fraction obtained by the Santa Ana HOC on sales made  through the regular program.", "There are three variables that provide characteristics for each property.  These variables measure the property\u2019s number of bedrooms, bathrooms,  and stories. Although the likely association between those variables and  HUD\u2019s net revenue from a property sale relative to the property\u2019s appraised  value is not clear-cut, we anticipated that there may be a positive  association for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. HUD\u2019s costs  associated with property management and sale include a fixed cost  component not related to property value as well as a component that varies  with selling price. Accordingly, if properties with more bedrooms and  bathrooms tend to be valued more, increasing both their selling prices and  appraised values, then HUD\u2019s net revenue relative to the appraised value  will be higher for higher-valued properties because HUD\u2019s fixed costs will  be lower relative to the appraised value. Because the relationship between  number of stories and market value is less clear, we had no clear  expectation for the sign of the coefficient for that variable. Because any  effect of these variables on market value is likely to similarly affect both  selling price and appraised value, for the equation with selling price divided  by appraised value as the dependent variable we had no clear expectation  of the signs of the coefficients of these variables. However, we included  them to keep our equations consistent and because these variables may  exhibit statistically significant effects if HUD is able to obtain more  accurate appraisals for certain types of properties.", "Finally, there are four variables for neighborhood characteristics:  the  percent of the population in the census tract living within an urbanized  area, median household income in 1999, median real estate taxes, and  whether the property is located in a revitalization area. As for the property  characteristics, we anticipated that to the extent that these neighborhood  characteristics are associated with higher (lower) property values, they  would be positively (negatively) associated with HUD\u2019s net revenue from a  property sale relative to that property\u2019s appraised value because for higher-  (lower-) valued properties HUD\u2019s fixed costs will be lower (higher) relative  to appraised values. Accordingly, we anticipated positive coefficients in the  equation for which the dependent variable is HUD\u2019s net revenue relative to  appraised value for the percentage of the population living within an  urbanized area, median income, and median real estate because all of these  variables are likely to be positively associated with property value. In  contrast, we anticipated a negative coefficient for location in a  revitalization area because that variable may indicate lower property  values that would raise the ratio of HUD\u2019s fixed costs to a property\u2019s  appraised value and because HUD may also incur additional costs to  maintain properties in those areas. Again, similar to the property  characteristics, we had no clear expectations for the signs of the  neighborhood characteristics in the equation in which the dependent  variable is HUD\u2019s selling price relative to the appraised value because any  effect of these variables on property value is likely to similarly affect selling  price and appraised value. But, for the reasons cited above, we included  them in the equation.", "Table 7 presents the variable names and descriptions, along with mean  values of the explanatory variables. In a previous version of the model that  we estimated using a data set representing all usable observations of HUD  property sales, rather than the data set containing only sales made in  census tracts in which discount sales were made, we included as variables  the year in which the structure was built and the average age of homes in  the census tract. These variables were significant at that time, but they  became insignificant in the final model when we limited our data set, so we  dropped them from the analysis. Although the rate of change in house  prices is another variable that may have some predictive value, we did not  include it in our models because information on the rate of house price  change was not available at the census tract level. Also, according to HUD  officials, the average time between the appraisal and the sale of a property  is about 3 months, so in most cases we did not anticipate that there would  be much price appreciation or depreciation resulting from market  conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimation Results", "paragraphs": ["We estimated the two models using ordinary least squares due to its ease of  calculation and interpretation. Table 8 presents the estimated coefficients,  their standard errors, and the summary statistics.", "In general, both models were consistent with our expectations. In the  model for net revenue relative to appraised value, the coefficients on the  Discount Sales Program category showed the expected pattern. That is, for  each HOC, coefficients became more negative at higher discount levels.", "In both models the coefficients for the characteristics for the property  possessed the same sign. In general, a higher fraction of the appraised  value was obtained from larger homes, as measured by more bedrooms and  bathrooms, as well as homes with fewer floors. The fraction of the  appraised value obtained by HUD tended to be higher for properties  located in more urban areas and where median real estate taxes were  higher. In the model for selling price relative to appraised value, the  coefficient for median household income was negative and statistically  significant at less than the 0.01 percent level. However, in the model for net  revenue relative to appraised value, the coefficient on this variable was  statistically insignificant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Costs", "paragraphs": ["We used the estimated coefficients for the Discount Sales Program  variables from the model for net revenue relative to appraised value to  estimate the cost of the program to HUD. We made this estimate by  comparing the (1) net revenue that our model predicted HUD would have  received for each discounted property had it been sold through the regular  sales process with (2) net revenue our model predicted HUD would have  received by selling it through the Discount Sales Program. Even though we  knew the actual amount HUD received by selling the property through the  Discount Sales Program, we compared two estimated values in order to be  consistent. Each estimated value contained an error term that captured the  effects of omitted variables unavailable for the modeling process. By  comparing two estimated values, we removed the influence of the omitted  variables from our comparison, leaving the effect of the Discounted Sales  Program.", "This analysis was conducted using 1,194 discounted properties that were  sold during calendar year 2002. The values of the Discount Sales Program  dummy variables reflect the estimate of the difference in the fraction of  appraised value obtained by HUD for each combination of discount level  and HOC. That is, for a given property\u2019s program characteristics\u2014discount  level and HOC\u2014these estimates represent the difference in value HUD  obtains compared to the case in which that property had been sold through  the regular program. Because we included HOC dummies to capture  otherwise unmeasured factors that might vary by region, the program  characteristic dummy variables describe incremental revenue differences  associated with each discount level as compared to the level of  nondiscount sales in each HOC. For example, if a property was sold by the  Philadelphia HOC at a 15 percent discount, the estimated difference in the  net revenue value would be about \u201313 percent of appraised value. The  relevant coefficient in table 8 is \u20130.1267. Similarly, if a property was sold by  the Santa Ana HOC at a 15 percent discount, the estimated difference in the  net revenue value would be about 20 percent of appraised value. The  relevant coefficient in table 8 is \u20130.1959.", "We also estimated a range of costs using confidence intervals around the  estimates for the sales category dummy variables. We did this by  multiplying each coefficient estimate by 1.645 times its associated standard  error. We then added and subtracted this amount from the coefficient  estimate to create a 90 percent confidence interval around each estimate.  We then recalculated program costs assuming that the estimates associated  with the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval reflected the  difference between the value HUD obtains through the Discount Sales  Program as compared to the value obtained through the regular sales  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits to Homebuyers", "paragraphs": ["In the model for selling price relative to appraised value, the benefit to the  homebuyer of purchasing a property from a nonprofit organization was  taken to be the estimated price a homeowner would have paid to buy the  house through HUD\u2019s regular sales process, minus the estimated financing  and closing costs that HUD would have paid in that situation, plus the  rehabilitation costs, minus the actual sales price paid to the nonprofit. This  analysis was conducted using 238 observations for discounted properties  purchased by nonprofits between February 1 and December 31, 2002, and  resold to homebuyers that same year. These were the only properties for  which data on the nonprofits\u2019 rehabilitation costs and the selling price to  the final homeowners were available. We performed the analysis twice  using different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assumed that the  rehabilitation costs incurred by a homebuyer operating outside of the  Discount Sales Program would be the same as the rehabilitation costs  actually incurred by the nonprofit. In the second scenario, we assumed that  a homebuyer\u2019s rehabilitation costs would be 25 percent higher than those  incurred by the nonprofit. Under both scenarios, we assumed that the  financing and closing costs HUD would pay for under its regular sales  process were equal to 3 percent of the estimated selling price.", "Because these properties were originally bought from HUD by a nonprofit  organization, we needed to estimate the prices homebuyers would have  paid to purchase the properties directly from HUD through the regular  sales process to calculate the difference in price paid by homeowners  purchasing a property after it had been rehabilitated under the Discount  Sales Program.
