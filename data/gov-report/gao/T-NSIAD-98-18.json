To date, no one has undertaken such a comprehensive review of 150 account activities. This examination appears to be warranted in light of the dramatically changed world environment and new budget realities and increased demand for accountability for results. GAO\u2019s 1996 symposium involving leading academics and practitioners in the area of international affairs evidenced the broad and significant changes that are taking place in the world in terms of governance, finance, economics, and political-military affairs.

Foreign military financing programsconsumed the largest portion of this component\u2014about 50 percent\u2014followed by about 37 percent for economic support provided primarily to Israel and Egypt (Economic Support Fund); about 9 percent for multilateral peacekeeping operations; and about 3 percent for programs to provide training and equipment to foreign governments to combat crime, illegal narcotics, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation (see fig. 3).", "Funding for the security and peacekeeping component of the international affairs budget has declined in real terms an average of about 6 percent during fiscal years 1992-97. The funding level for fiscal year 1997 of $6.3 billion is almost 30 percent lower than in fiscal year 1992 (see fig. 4), with the most significant reductions occurring in the Economic Support Fund. This fund has been cut by over 33 percent, while foreign military financing programs have shrunk by about 26 percent. Funding levels for assistance to Israel and Egypt, the largest recipients, have remained relatively constant during this period. The executive branch has proposed a further real decrease of about 1 percent in funding for this component in fiscal year 1998.", "Trends in funding for this category have reflected shifting U.S. priorities to some extent, but a large core of this component serves fundamental security interests that have not changed significantly in many years.", "Are there opportunities to reduce security-related costs?", "As of fiscal year 1997, support for long-standing commitments to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East through financial assistance to Israel and Egypt represents 85 percent of the security-related costs. This includes Economic Support Fund grants and foreign military financing. The Economic Support Fund was established to allow the United States to promote economic and political stability in areas where the United States has special security interests. It has been justified to the Congress on the basis of its role in (1) strengthening the security of friendly and allied countries and (2) benefiting the U.S. economy because funds are generally spent on U.S. goods, services, and training. Since 1992, the Economic Support Fund has been reduced by about one-third, with aid to countries outside of the Middle East absorbing nearly all of these cuts. Decreases in foreign military financing to specific countries outside the Middle East have resulted from the end of the Cold War and the decline in regional conflicts, primarily in Central America. Currently, the vast majority of foreign military financing is devoted to Israel and Egypt, with most of the remainder supporting partners in Central and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union, Greece, and Turkey. Further cuts in these security-related components of the budget would appear to be difficult without a major change to the U.S. policies supporting the Middle East peace process and European security.", "Are there opportunities to reduce peacekeeping costs?", "The United States currently contributes 25 percent of the costs of U.N. peacekeeping operations and also supports, on a voluntary basis, peacekeeping activities by other multinational organizations in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle East.", "Considerable attention has been focused on the cost and effectiveness of high-profile U.N. peacekeeping operations such as those in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Less attention has been devoted to the costs and effectiveness of long-standing but less visible U.N. peace missions, such as those in India/Pakistan, Cyprus, and Angola. These eight long-standing missions cost the United States about $148 million annually, have been in existence from 6 to nearly 50 years, and so far have cost over $6 billion. They have evolved into open-ended commitments; diplomatic efforts to resolve the underlying conflicts have stalled in nearly all of the operations, and the situations have proven intractable. We recently recommended that the Secretary of State develop plans and strategies to bring these missions to closure. I want to emphasize that we do not mean these missions should be ended immediately, but rather that concrete actions to address the underlying conflicts should be developed. Success along these lines could have budgetary implications, given the cost of these operations.", "Funding in the 150 account by no means represents the sum total of U.S. contributions to peacekeeping activities or U.S. support for international security interests. From fiscal year 1992 to 1995, U.S. government agencies spent over $6.6 billion to support U.N. peace operations in Haiti, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Somalia; this figure includes $3.4 billion in incremental costs incurred by the Department of Defense and funded outside of the 150 account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bilateral Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal year 1992 and 1997, about 30 percent of the international affairs budget was spent on bilateral assistance programs. During this period about 37 percent supported traditional development programs administered primarily by USAID; about 21 percent funded food aid programs; about 18 percent was allocated for aid to Eastern Europe and the NIS; about 15 percent went for humanitarian aid, such as disaster relief; and about 9 percent funded USAID\u2019s administrative costs (see fig. 5).", "Funding for the bilateral assistance component has declined in real terms an average of 6 percent per year during fiscal years 1992-97 (see fig. 6). It peaked in fiscal year 1993, but by fiscal year 1997 had returned to about $5.2 billion\u2014a level 17 percent lower than in fiscal year 1992. The President has requested an increase of about 5 percent in funding for this component for fiscal year 1998.", "One of the more significant developments in the U.S. foreign aid program is the participation of new recipients\u2014the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Aid to these countries accounts for  18 percent of all assistance since 1992 and is consuming a greater share of a decreasing aid pie\u2014from 8 percent of bilateral assistance in 1992 to  20 percent in 1997. Aid for these countries includes grants for training and technical assistance to facilitate development of democratic institutions and market economies. Assistance to Bosnia is now the single largest program of U.S. aid in this region\u2014about $240 million in fiscal year 1997.", "Also of note is the amount of aid that has gone to alleviate problems associated with localized conflicts\u2014\u201chot spots\u201d such as Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti. Since 1993, more than $1 billion has been spent on these three conflicts, including funds for humanitarian assistance and food aid. Typically, USAID has had to meet part of these requirements by shifting funds from other ongoing bilateral assistance programs.", "The one-third of bilateral assistance that supports sustainable development efforts includes programs in health and population growth, economic growth and agricultural development, democracy, education and training, and the environment. As I said earlier, a large percentage of sustainable development funding is directed by the Congress or the President for specific purposes, such as child survival and population programs. In 1997, about 70 percent of sustainable development assistance was earmarked or directed in this way, up from about 60 percent in 1995.", "The central issues surrounding bilateral assistance are, first, whether economic development assistance either has had or can have a positive impact on development and, second, how efficiently and effectively can aid be delivered.", "How relevant are our foreign aid programs in the current environment?", "Despite USAID\u2019s attempt to better target its assistance, fundamental questions remain about the effectiveness and relevance of U.S. development assistance for purposes other than humanitarian relief. Critics of foreign aid point to the end of Cold War imperatives, the absence of conclusive evidence that aid makes a difference to countries\u2019 economic progress, the shift to a new development model that relies more on the private sector, and the rapid growth in the flow of private capital to the developing world as reasons to end traditional foreign aid. Proponents stress the large number of outstanding needs and the value of assistance to achieve certain foreign policy objectives; they generally call for reform and revitalization\u2014not elimination.", "Our work on USAID\u2019s Housing Guaranty Program highlights the complexities in assisting development by using foreign aid. This program, in place for over 30 years, has guaranteed about $5 billion in loans to developing countries with the goal of stimulating increased private sector investment in housing for the poor. The program\u2019s original premise, however, did not adequately take into account the real world limitations to achieving this objective. In fact, it was not clear at the time of our work that USAID was even pursuing the original goal anymore, but rather had established new ones throughout the years in the face of a lack of demonstrated progress in meeting program goals. Based on GAO\u2019s work, the Congress has dramatically reduced funding for this program.", "A consensus is emerging, however, regarding what seems to work and what does not. Recent examinations by respected institutions have concluded that the impact of economic assistance is modest and possible only in countries with good fiscal, monetary, and trade policies and effective governing institutions.", "Have clear priorities been established for foreign assistance programs?", "In its 1997 strategic plan, developed in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act, USAID appears to have established as a priority the importance of influencing domestic policy in the recipient countries. Many of the strategies it has described for achieving its major development goals involve persuading recipient countries to reform their economic, judicial, health care, and education policies and regulations.", "While USAID has attempted to incorporate consideration of whether a recipient country has changed its policy environment into the process of deciding how much further aid to give to that country, the quality of a country\u2019s reform efforts is not yet a guiding factor in this process. Our analysis of USAID resource allocations for fiscal year 1996 does not show any significant difference between the proportion of aid allocated between the top performing countries in policy reform and the poorer performing countries. USAID acknowledges that political and foreign policy considerations continue to strongly influence USAID\u2019s budgeting process. Allocating foreign aid based only on policy performance would limit flexibility and would require consensus\u2014which would be very difficult to achieve\u2014that aid is only for the purposes of economic development and not for achieving other foreign policy objectives.", "The next critical question that needs to be asked in this regard is whether USAID can continue to operate and be effective in a large number of countries, given the diminishing amount of foreign aid funds available. Despite having closed missions in 24 countries since 1993, USAID still has programs in over 80 countries. Many of these countries have relatively small programs. For example, in fiscal year 1996, 10 countries received over 50 percent of all sustainable development assistance allocated to specific countries, with the remainder spread among 42 countries. In about half of these 42 countries, the United States is a relatively minor donor, not even among the top three bilateral aid donors. USAID has made some efforts to \u201cgraduate\u201d its more successful aid recipients. Indeed, it has discontinued programs in some countries, such as Chile and Thailand, whose level of development no longer justifies foreign aid. However, USAID has not established formal criteria for determining which countries should continue to receive development assistance.", "Can we deliver foreign assistance at lower cost?", "Despite the domestic skepticism attached to U.S. foreign aid in general, there still remains broad support for some specific programs\u2014child survival and population programs are only two examples. For those programs that the U.S. government continues to support\u2014and that meet the tests of relevance and priority\u2014the next two questions should be (1) how can they be delivered most efficiently and (2) what level of accountability are we going to insist upon?", "Four years of reform under the leadership of the USAID Administrator have resulted in a smaller, more streamlined aid bureaucracy that has achieved some operational efficiencies. USAID reengineering efforts have included reorganizing missions and eliminating unnecessary administrative requirements. USAID has also sought to focus its activities on a more manageable set of strategic objectives. This process has been further refined in USAID\u2019s strategic plan.", "Nevertheless, some continue to question the USAID structure in light of the declining levels of U.S. aid and have suggested that other ways of delivering bilateral assistance should be considered. The ratio of USAID\u2019s operating expenses\u2014about $500 million\u2014to the costs of the programs it administers\u2014about $4.9 billion\u2014has been steadily increasing, with more USAID dollars going to manage a smaller aid program. One of the many options that have been discussed is the re-creation of USAID as a foundation\u2014providing aid through nongovernmental organizations and without the hands-on implementation responsibilities and attendant infrastructure it now has. Of course it is not clear what implications the planned consolidation of some USAID and State Department administrative functions will have on USAID\u2019s operating expenses. The trade-off of this approach, of course, is the risk of misuse of U.S. aid dollars and a loss of accountability for program results, as well as perhaps more limited opportunities to use U.S. assistance to support new or emerging foreign policy objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Affairs Management", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, about 14 percent of the international affairs budget has been spent to fund activities related to the management of foreign affairs. Nearly all of this funding goes to support State Department operations (see fig. 7), including its headquarters, passport offices and other domestic offices across the United States, over 250 embassies and consulates overseas, and salaries for roughly 23,000 direct-hire employees worldwide. The remainder\u2014about 3 percent\u2014supports the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and a variety of commissions and funds.", "Funding appropriated to State for foreign affairs management has declined in real terms by an average of 4 percent per year during fiscal  years 1992-97 (see fig. 8). The fiscal year 1997 funding level of $2.8 billion was about 15 percent lower than in fiscal year 1992. This decline has been ameliorated somewhat by visa fees that State has been allowed to retain since fiscal year 1995 to offset the cost of its operations\u2014averaging about $140 million per year. The administration has requested a 4.9 percent real increase in appropriations for foreign affairs management in 1998. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, State\u2019s work load will increase starting in April 1998. State will assume responsibility for adjudicating all applications for border crossing cards for Mexican nonresident aliens entering the United States, a responsibility it had previously shared with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. State estimates that it will need about 70 additional employees to handle the increased workload.", "Over the last several years, State has closed 30 overseas posts, reduced the general work force by about 2,200 positions, lowered overseas allowances, and cut operating budgets. A recent joint Brookings Institution/Council on Foreign Relations study concluded that State\u2019s ability to function effectively has been eroded, citing the existence of shabby, unsafe, and ill-equipped posts; obsolete information technology; and uneven staffing.", "At the same time, GAO and others have raised concerns about the relevance and priority of some of State\u2019s activities and the efficiency with which it operates. Although the State Department has reduced staff and implemented some cost reduction measures, it has not undertaken a fundamental rethinking of its foreign affairs and diplomatic structure or significantly changed its business practices. This would involve reassessing the rationale for the current overseas structure and staffing, reviewing both the approach and the level of State\u2019s involvement in some functions and activities, and adopting better business practices.", "Thus, some tough questions need to be asked:", "Does the United States need and can it afford all overseas posts as currently staffed and structured?", "Given the cost of our overseas infrastructure, the Congress and the President need to make sure that State\u2019s post and staff structure is consistent with current U.S. foreign policy needs and that it makes the best use of U.S. resources and staff. About $2 billion, or over 80 percent, of the amount spent on the administration of foreign affairs is tied to the operation of overseas posts. The current structure is based on State\u2019s policy of universality\u2014a diplomatic presence in almost every country of the world, even those that by State\u2019s own admission are not critical to U.S. interests. The costs of a U.S. overseas presence vary widely. For example, in 1995 the post in Western Samoa cost $2.5 million to operate and the U.S. mission in Germany cost over $90 million.", "Changing U.S. interests\u2014and the mutable nature of the world problems the U.S. government faces\u2014mean that we need to scrutinize U.S. presence and staffing on a mission-by-mission basis. Closing posts would meet opposition from various interests groups, and the savings from the closure of small individual posts would not be substantial. Greater regionalization of the U.S. diplomatic presence by having one ambassador accredited to serve in multiple countries is an option that could be explored to increase efficiency and lower costs. Taking advantage of modern telecommunications technology may make it feasible for State to consolidate a limited number of overseas posts. For example, the U.S. embassy in Bridgetown, Barbados, has full diplomatic responsibilities for  7 countries and partial diplomatic responsibility for 14 others in the eastern Caribbean; likewise, British ambassadors are accredited to 3 to 4 countries each in Africa. These could serve as models for a U.S. diplomatic reorganization in other regions beyond the Caribbean. We calculated that if State closed 20 small embassies and employed the above approach, State could reduce its costs by up to $40 million annually, after closing costs were paid and U.S. direct-hire positions were eliminated.", "Can the State Department operate more efficiently?", "The State Department is entering the 21st century with outdated and costly-to-maintain communications systems and weak and outdated management processes. State has not made the necessary investments to modernize its information technology and is only now beginning a serious attempt to improve its capabilities in this area. The success of those efforts is critical to achieving long-term savings in information management costs and to streamlining its business practices.", "Our work has shown that State\u2019s business processes could be made more cost-effective. Just this month we reported that the introduction of prevailing best management practices from the private sector into State\u2019s staff relocation process could save millions.", "We have previously identified weaknesses in State\u2019s management of its overseas real estate portfolio and recommended a panel to review properties. At the Congress\u2019 direction, State has established such a panel, including real estate experts from outside the Department. The panel has begun its work, recommending properties for sale as well as those where local conditions preclude a sale at fair price to the U.S. government. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that State could generate $150 million over the next 5 years by selling 100 properties that it has identified for potential sale. According to State, last fiscal year the Department executed final sales of over $60 million worth of properties and reinvested those proceeds in needed facilities, which will also reduce future rental costs.", "Is State efficiently structured, and are all of State\u2019s functions and activities needed?", "Our work suggests that the answer to the first part of this question is \u201cno,\u201d and the answer to the second is \u201cnot clear.\u201d State maintains a headquarters with 6 geographic and 15 functional bureaus, including a bureau for international organizations. Some programs and administrative functions overlap between geographic and functional bureaus. For example, although State has a functional bureau with responsibility for political-military issues, it also has 24 political-military positions in other bureaus, including each geographic bureau. In a way, the geographic bureaus operate as six micro-State Departments. Add to this mix the work and policy interests of the bureau dedicated to working with international organizations, and you have a complicated structure in which to develop policy.", "In addition to overlap within its own structure, State has bureaus, offices, and activities that mirror those of many other parts of the federal government, including agencies with primary responsibility for trade, agriculture, labor, and environmental issues. While State has a critical role in advancing U.S. interests in these increasingly international issues, it is not clear if the current approach and level of staffing to support its involvement are necessary.", "As an illustration, although the Department of Labor is the lead U.S. representative in multilateral forums on labor issues, several State bureaus address these issues. To support work on labor issues, the State Department has 45 labor attach\u00e9s overseas that gather detailed information on workers\u2019 rights outside the United States and prepare congressionally required reports. Work we completed in 1996 suggests that the 45 attach\u00e9 positions and their corresponding headquarters complement may not be necessary because, according to several officials at overseas posts, labor issues could be adequately covered by the State Department\u2019s political and/or economic officers as they are in countries without attach\u00e9s. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that eliminating these positions through attrition over 5 years would produce savings of $30 million. State has proposed abolishing or lowering the rank of some labor attach\u00e9 positions in the past but has encountered resistance from the Department of Labor and organized labor.", "There seems to be room to rethink State\u2019s involvement in such functions or at least its approach. The process specified in the Government Performance and Results Act is a good vehicle to address this issue by encouraging government agencies to improve coordination of cross-cutting functions. However, we have examined the State Department\u2019s strategic plan and noted, among other concerns, that State does not clearly indicate how it plans to provide leadership and coordinate the programs of other agencies. In some cases, changing State\u2019s involvement may require congressional approval or interagency agreement.", "The problems with State\u2019s organizational structure are widely recognized within the Department, and the Secretary of State has expressed her commitment to crafting a Department that functions better, faster, and more flexibly as she consolidates State, USIA, and ACDA. To accomplish this, the Secretary has established 15 employee task forces to examine all aspects of State\u2019s operations with the goal of reducing potential overlap and improving the agency\u2019s decision-making process. According to a member of State\u2019s Reorganization Secretariat, the objective of the consolidation is to let the State Department spend less time negotiating with itself and more time engaged with foreign governments.", "How well is the consolidation of foreign affairs agencies being managed?", "The April 1997 decision to consolidate the State Department, the USIA, and the ACDA and to integrate certain administrative functions of State and USAID presents a major management challenge, but it also creates an opportunity to achieve cost savings. Among the more straightforward tasks will be consolidating the organizations\u2019 similar administrative functions, such as travel and payroll. However, the consolidation also offers State a major opportunity to address potential overlaps and duplication not only in the areas of public diplomacy and arms control but also in all of the Department\u2019s activities and functions. Creativity will be needed to find a way of incorporating these functions into State\u2019s organization without taking the traditional approach of establishing positions for public diplomacy and arms control positions within both the functional and regional bureaus. If managed carefully and creatively, the consolidation should produce efficiencies and cost reductions over the long term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Diplomacy", "paragraphs": ["Let me turn now to the public diplomacy category\u2014essentially the programs and activities of the USIA\u2014which represents about 6 percent of the funding for international affairs programs. USIA salaries and expenses account for the bulk of public diplomacy funding; in fiscal years 1992-97, 40 percent was allocated for USIA personnel and operations at over 200 overseas locations and headquarters; about 38 percent for international broadcasting operations including the Voice of America; and about 22 percent for exchange programs such as Fulbright scholarships (see  fig. 9).", "Funding for public diplomacy has declined in real terms an average of about 6 percent annually during fiscal years 1992-97 (see fig. 10). Funding peaked in fiscal year 1994 due primarily to increased funding for educational and cultural exchange programs for the NIS and has declined since. The fiscal year 1997 funding level of $1.1 billion was 25 percent lower than it was in fiscal year 1992. The largest decrease, between fiscal year 1995 and 1996, resulted from reductions in funding for exchanges, salaries, and expenses and the consolidation of international broadcasting activities. The executive branch has proposed a further 3.5 percent real decrease in funding for public diplomacy for fiscal year 1998. Over the years, the USIA\u2019s programs have shifted in emphasis from one part of the world to another in response to foreign policy initiatives and direction from the executive branch as well as to congressional mandates.", "Even before the announcement of its consolidation with the State Department, the USIA had cut staff, consolidated all nonmilitary international broadcasting, and developed a strategy to downsize its operations and reduce costs. However, difficult questions about the continuing relevance of some public diplomacy programs remain. Many USIA programs and the agency\u2019s overseas structure and infrastructure were established after World War II as the United States sought to counter the Soviet bloc and encourage the development of democracy. Legislative requirements have earmarked much of the USIA\u2019s budget for specific exchanges, broadcasting programs, and grantees. More radical changes in USIA activities and programs would be needed to generate significant additional cost reductions and would require the Congress to revisit some of these legislative requirements. They would also require the USIA and the State Department to change their traditional operating philosophy that the USIA should be located wherever the State Department has a presence.", "Regarding public diplomacy funding, the key questions are whether we can continue to fund all USIA facilities abroad and whether we can achieve greater efficiencies in USIA broadcasting.", "Do we need and can we afford all USIA facilities overseas?", "The USIA spends about 30 percent of its budget on salaries, infrastructure, and operating expenses for overseas installations\u2014many in flourishing democracies. For example, the USIA spent $9 million in 1995 for operations in Germany, including six outreach centers. The 77 staff at these centers, called \u201cAmerica Houses,\u201d provide information on U.S. policy and business and study opportunities and host cultural events. Much of the information the USIA provides is also generated by the private sector, is available electronically, and could be distributed by a private entity.", "The USIA\u2019s efforts to reform and relocate outreach centers (of which it operates about 70) have reduced costs in some cases. The USIA estimated that the 1995 decision to close an America House in Germany in favor of a local government and business-supported German/American Cultural Center saved about a million dollars per year. Also, in Singapore, the USIA terminated a $455,000 yearly lease for a cultural center and moved into embassy facilities. While the USIA should continue to explore such opportunities, eliminating posts altogether in up to 67 countries that by USIA\u2019s own criteria are relatively less important to U.S. interests would achieve more significant cost savings. The traditional belief that the USIA should be located where the State Department has a presence has made this difficult.", "Are all exchange programs essential, and are they targeted to meet U.S. objectives?", "The USIA manages a variety of exchange programs to foster mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. In 1950, shortly after the U.S. government began funding scholarships, it was the primary source of funding for 7.7 percent of foreign students in the United States. In 1994, only 1.2 percent, or about 5,400, of the 453,000 foreign students attending U.S. high schools, colleges, and universities received U.S. government funding as their primary source of support. During this period other federal agencies, as well as state and local governments and the private sector, have increased their roles in funding exchanges. The USIA currently accounts for only one-fourth of the funding for U.S. government exchange programs.", "In 1996, the USIA acknowledged that non-USIA exchange opportunities were plentiful in some regions such as Western Europe and that therefore it was shifting exchange resources to regions that are not as fully represented by other U.S. government agencies or the private sector. Since the end of the Cold War, the Congress has appropriated funds to establish new exchange programs, particularly in countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.", "Other agencies, including the Departments of Education and Defense, also engage in exchanges and other educational efforts with funding outside the 150 account. For example, the Department of Education funds a program to help improve civics and economics education in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I would like to note that the House of Representatives\u2019 foreign affairs reform bill calls for the establishment of a working group to improve the coordination and effectiveness of U.S. government-supported exchanges.", "Are there opportunities to achieve further efficiencies in international broadcasting?", "In the U.S. International Broadcasting Act of 1994, the Congress reaffirmed the importance of continued U.S. broadcasts to further U.S. interests. However, the Congress has reduced funding for most nonmilitary international broadcasting activities and mandated their consolidation. In 1996, the United States broadcasted over 1,600 hours of radio programming in 53 languages and over 400 hours of television in several languages worldwide each week to support U.S. foreign policy objectives. Only modest economies are possible by eliminating overlap and lessening duplication among broadcasters. Achieving significant cost savings would require a major reduction in the number of language services and broadcast hours. However, past experience has shown that eliminating even one language is a difficult process, due to the interest of the Congress, the National Security Council, and others and could impinge on the USIA\u2019s readiness in a crisis situation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multilateral Assistance", "paragraphs": ["U.S. contributions to a variety of international organizations and programs consumed about 14 percent of the international affairs budget from fiscal year 1992 to 1997.

The two largest recipients are India and China, which together received almost 30 percent of these loan funds\u2014or $2.4 billion each\u2014in fiscal years 1994-96. As China continues to develop, IDA lending to that country is being phased out and is slated to end in 1999.", "Funding for multilateral assistance has declined in real terms an average of about 6 percent per year during fiscal years 1992-97, as shown in figure 12. Funding peaked in fiscal year 1995, with larger than average contributions to the World Bank. Since then, contributions to the World Bank and other international financial institutions and the United Nations have declined to almost $2.2 billion in fiscal year 1997\u2014a level about  27 percent lower than in fiscal year 1992. For fiscal year 1998, the executive branch has requested a real increase of 32.5 percent for multilateral assistance, largely to return annual funding of multilateral organizations to traditional levels.", "Concerning multilateral assistance, the key questions are whether such assistance continues to serve U.S. interests and can be delivered more efficiently.", "Are all of the multilateral organizations that we participate in still relevant?", "Reviewing multilateral assistance involves taking a hard look at the continuing relevance of many international organizations and the extent to which they serve U.S. interests. The State Department believes that ongoing U.S. membership in these organizations is important to the United States because their activities contribute in varied ways to U.S. security, prosperity, health, and safety. Our review of the operations of several of these organizations indicates that their policies and agendas are consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives and provide significant benefits in such areas as development, global health, and scientific research.", "The U.S. government participates in dozens of other international organizations established to serve specialized but limited functions, such as the World Road Association and the International Copper Study Group. The United States provided about $11 million in 1995 to organizations that the State Department viewed as making only limited contributions to U.S. interests. In recent years, the United States has withdrawn from two such organizations. State\u2019s attempt to withdraw from at least one other organization, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, met with congressional opposition. A State official told us that other attempts would likely meet the same type of resistance.", "Support for the World Bank has been the subject of periodic controversy in the United States. The purpose of the World Bank is to promote economic growth and the development of market economies by providing finance on reasonable terms to countries that have difficulty obtaining capital. Critics of the Bank often cite the end of the Cold War, the recent rapid increase in private investment in developing countries, and weaknesses in project effectiveness and management reforms. In September 1996, we reported that participation in the World Bank furthered U.S. interests because it generally leverages other donors\u2019 funds for programs and geographical areas that the U.S. government wants to support.", "Can the efficiency and effectiveness of these organizations be improved?", "The State Department acknowledges that some U.N. organizations are not operating efficiently and effectively and that some of them have functions that overlap. However, the organizations have begun to address weaknesses in the management and administration of their operations and programs that have been the subject of frequent criticism by the Congress and others. The United States and other member states are continuing to call for reforms in the belief that greater efficiency in these agencies could reduce their cost. With U.S. encouragement and assistance, the United Nations has embarked on a program of reform. Reforms could reduce costs; however, their fate is uncertain, and they cannot be expected to be completed anytime soon.", "Regarding the World Bank, U.S. interests could be better served by the World Bank if it could improve its record of effectiveness. Reforms have been implemented and show some early signs of progress, but in some areas major impediments still remain and improvements do not seem to have taken hold. Through its leadership, the United States is positioned to ensure that Bank reforms continue to progress and to have a positive impact on development effectiveness. To this end, we recommended that the Secretary of the Treasury monitor and periodically report to the Congress measurable indicators of progress, such as the extent to which the Bank allocates financing to those countries that make Bank-advocated market and policy reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade and Investment", "paragraphs": ["International trade and investment funding represented about 4 percent of the international affairs budget in fiscal years 1992-97. Trade and investment funding supported primarily the Eximbank, the Trade and Development Agency, and the International Trade Commission. (See  fig. 13). Figure 13 excludes OPIC because it returned net revenue to the U.S. Treasury during this period. Related\u2014and large\u2014expenditures for trade and investment activities and programs outside the 150 account include the activities of the Commerce Department\u2019s International Trade Administration, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the various agricultural trade promotion and credit guaranty programs, and the programs of the Small Business Administration.", "The largest increase in international trade and investment funding, between fiscal year 1993 and 1994, was due primarily to higher funding for programs in the NIS. Funding has continuously declined since reaching its highest level in 1994, with the fiscal year 1998 request representing a decrease of almost 20 percent in real terms over the preceding year. (See fig. 14.)", "Eximbank and OPIC programs have become increasingly controversial in recent years, generating questions about whether they continue to be relevant and whether government costs and taxpayer risk can be reduced. Both organizations provide loans, guarantees, and insurance to support U.S. exports or market-oriented private investment. In some risky markets where the Eximbank operates, some borrowers miss payments or default on entire loans; such losses must be covered by the Eximbank, resulting in subsidy costs to the federal government.", "Are the programs of the Eximbank and OPIC relevant in today\u2019s environment?", "OPIC was created in 1969 to help mobilize U.S. capital and skills for the economic and social advancement of developing countries\u2014a major U.S. foreign policy objective. The Eximbank\u2019s creation was spurred by the economic conditions of the 1930s, when exports were viewed as a stimulus to economic activity and employment. The Congress continues to debate the relevance of export promotion and investment programs, most recently as it considered whether to reauthorize the Eximbank and OPIC. The debate has centered on the need for government support and the organizations\u2019 costs and benefits. Critics question whether the U.S. government should provide direct assistance to private exporters and investors. They charge that expenditures to subsidize the transactions of the Eximbank and OPIC amount to \u201ccorporate welfare.\u201d In the case of the Eximbank, critics claim that a substantial portion of its subsidy expenditures and financing commitments is used to support the operations of large exporting multinational firms that are experienced exporters and have their own resources to export their products. Moreover, the economic benefits of the programs are uncertain. Some economists argue that the market is a much more efficient allocator of resources than the government and that these programs cannot produce a substantial change in employment levels. The nearly fivefold increase in private investment flows to the developing world since 1990 may also raise questions concerning the continued need for the Eximbank and OPIC, given the private sector\u2019s growing willingness to support trade and investment transactions in some emerging markets.", "Conversely, proponents of continued U.S. government support argue that there is still a niche for the Eximbank and OPIC. Risky markets still exist where the private sector is reluctant to operate or invest without public financing. Concerning the Eximbank, our recent work indicated that although definitive evidence about the economic impact of U.S. government trade programs is lacking, perhaps the most compelling argument in defense of the Eximbank is its role in helping to \u201clevel the international playing field\u201d for U.S. exporters. All major industrialized countries operate similar programs and thus are primarily countered through U.S. programs. Our recent work on OPIC suggests that, despite increasing private capital flows to the developing world, there are still markets where U.S. private firms are unwilling to participate without some form of public support, be it from OPIC, the Eximbank, foreign governments, or multilateral organizations.", "Turning to OPIC, historically its combined finance and insurance programs have been self-sustaining. OPIC\u2019s net income from transactions with the private sector amounted to about $43 million in fiscal year 1996. During fiscal year 1996, approximately 18 percent of OPIC\u2019s financing commitments supported small businesses and cooperatives; the remaining 82 percent supported large businesses. The U.S. foreign policy objective of promoting private investment in developing countries encourages OPIC to underwrite risks that the private sector may not assume without public support. OPIC, the State Department, and other U.S. government officials consider OPIC to be a major tool for pursuing U.S. foreign policy goals, such as assisting Russia in its transition toward achieving a free market economy.", "Are there opportunities to support U.S. exports and investments while reducing costs and risks?", "If legislation is enacted reauthorizing Eximbank and OPIC, the question becomes whether there are opportunities to reduce the costs of their programs. The Eximbank and OPIC could undertake actions such as better leveraging resources, decreasing portfolio risk, and lowering costs by raising their fees, changing their portfolio mix, or changing the structure of their transactions. For example, work we completed in 1996 identified two options that would allow the Eximbank to reduce subsidies while remaining competitive with foreign export credit agencies: (1) raising fees for services and (2) reducing the risks of its programs; that is, limiting program availability in certain high-risk markets. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that increasing fees could save the Eximbank up to $450 million over 5 years, and reducing program risks could save up to $1.2 billion over 5 years. Some progress has been made: the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with U.S. leadership, has now set a minimum fee for services effective in April 1999. This should provide the Eximbank with the opportunity to further reduce the costs of its operations.", "Our recent work suggests that OPIC could further reduce the risk in its portfolio, given the private sector\u2019s willingness to have greater involvement in some emerging markets. For instance, OPIC could lower the risks associated with its portfolio through increased use of reinsurance and coinsurance and by decreasing project coverage or terms. However, if OPIC is to continue pursuing its mission of promoting investment in risky markets, its portfolio will always be considered more risky than the portfolios of private sector insurers.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks.
