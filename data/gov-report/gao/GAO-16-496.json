GAO analyzed FCC's cable price data from 2010 to 2014 and the U.S. Copyright Office's royalty data from 2014, the most recently available; reviewed relevant laws and reports; and interviewed 42 industry stakeholders, selected for their role in the video marketplace and expertise on the issue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A phaseout of the statutory licenses for broadcast programming may be feasible for most participants in the video marketplace, although there may be statutory implications for the \u201ccarriage requirements\u201d governing which local broadcast television stations are carried by cable and satellite operators. These licenses allow cable and satellite operators to carry copyrighted content, such as television shows and movies, embedded in local broadcast stations' signals to their subscribers' television sets without negotiating with individual copyright owners. At the same time, these cable and satellite operators also engage in market-based negotiations to make some or all of this content available in other contexts, such as online. Of the 42 selected stakeholders GAO interviewed, 21 either use the statutory licenses or have their content provided through the statutory licenses. 20 of these 21 stakeholders\u2014including content producers, broadcast networks, and cable and satellite operators\u2014also engage in market-based negotiations to license broadcast content for video-on-demand or online viewing. Therefore, for stakeholders representing these business interests, a market-based approach to licensing secondary transmission rights may be feasible. However, some participants in the video marketplace\u2014most notably, public television and small cable operators\u2014may face logistical challenges and financial constraints in the event of a phaseout of the statutory licenses.", "Phasing out the statutory licenses could have implications for the \u201cmust-carry\u201d and \u201ccarry-one, carry-all requirements,\u201d which require cable and satellite operators, respectively, to carry the signals of local broadcast television stations upon request. As GAO has previously reported, the must-carry requirement could become impractical if Congress phased out the statutory license that applies to cable operators, as these operators could find themselves in the paradoxical position of being required to transmit the copyrighted content on a local broadcast television station's signal for which they may not have the legal right to air. In addition, according to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Copyright Office, the carry-one, carry-all requirement would no longer apply to satellite operators if the applicable statutory license were phased out because the requirement is premised on the use of the license.", "The 42 selected stakeholders GAO interviewed varied in their support for a phaseout of the statutory licenses and many stakeholders were uncertain about the potential effects on the marketplace and consumers. For example:", "15 supported a full or partial phaseout; 13 did not have a position; and 14 did not support a phaseout, because most believe the current system works,", "About half were uncertain how a phaseout would affect the video marketplace.

However, almost 84 percent of U.S. households\u2019  receive local broadcast television stations through a paid subscription to a  cable or satellite operator, such as Comcast, Verizon Fios, or DISH  Network. When a local broadcast television station airs its programming  over-the-air, this is referred to as the primary transmission of its  programming. When a cable or satellite operator provides its subscribers  with access to a local broadcast television station\u2019s programming through  its infrastructure, it is providing a secondary transmission of the station\u2019s  signal. Because programming contained on a local broadcast television  station\u2019s signal is typically protected by copyright, a license is required to  secure the public performance rights for the secondary transmission of  these works. Under existing law, three statutory licenses enable cable  and satellite operators to retransmit copyrighted material without seeking  permission from copyright owners (such as Sony Pictures Entertainment  or the National Football League) of this programming, allowing these  operators to offer secondary transmissions of radio and television  broadcast programming. To take advantage of the statutory licenses,  cable and satellite operators must comply with the terms of the statutory  licenses, including depositing with the U.S. Copyright Office a  government-set royalty, which is later distributed to copyright owners.  Using these licenses, cable and satellite operators transmit a variety of  copyright-protected works, including network and syndicated  programming, movies, sports programming, local news broadcasts,  public television, religious material, and music of all types. For 2014, the  U.S. Copyright Office collected about $320 million in copyright royalty  fees from cable and satellite operators under the statutory licenses.", "The cable industry was still developing when, in 1976, Congress  amended U.S. copyright law, and with the enactment of the Section 111  statutory license, granted cable operators the ability to retransmit  broadcast programs to their subscribers without obtaining the permission  of the copyright owners of the programs being retransmitted. At the  time, the statutory license was seen as a cost-effective way to reduce the  transaction costs of licensing all the rights necessary to retransmit  broadcast programs. Likewise, as the satellite television industry  expanded, Congress established additional statutory licenses (Section  119 in 1988 and Section 122 in 1999) to provide a cost-effective  mechanism for satellite operators to retransmit out-of-local market  (\u201cdistant-into-local\u201d) and local market (\u201clocal-into-local\u201d) broadcast station  signals without obtaining the permission of the embedded programming\u2019s  copyright owners. However, changes in the video marketplace have led  some industry stakeholders to question the premise that high transaction  costs make a market-based approach to licensing these rights  infeasible. Congress, in the Satellite Television Extension and Localism  Reauthorization Act of 2014, included a provision for us to study and  evaluate possible effects of phasing out statutory licensing of secondary  transmission of television broadcast programming. This report  addresses the following questions:  1.  What is known about the potential feasibility of a phaseout of the  statutory licenses?  2.  What are selected stakeholders\u2019 views on the implications of a  phaseout of the statutory licenses?", "To address these questions, we reviewed relevant statutes and  regulations; reports on related subjects by the U.S. Copyright Office,  Congressional Research Service, and GAO; and related documentation  on how the statutory licenses work.

Our data  analysis provided context on how the video marketplace operates, such  as the number of local broadcast stations carried by cable operators, and  the potential impacts on consumers in the event of a phaseout. We  assessed the reliability of the data used in this report by reviewing  existing information about the data and the systems that produced them.  For FCC and U.S. Copyright Office data, we also interviewed officials  from FCC and the U.S. Copyright Office about measures taken to ensure  the reliability of the data. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We reviewed FCC, U.S. Copyright Office,  Congressional Research Service, GAO, and industry reports on changes  in the video marketplace to understand the factors influencing changes in  the consumption and distribution of video content. Finally, we interviewed  42 selected stakeholders\u2014including experts, industry associations, and  industry participants (broadcast networks and station owners, cable and  satellite operators, online video distributors, and content  producers/copyright owners)\u2014to understand how the video marketplace  has changed in the last 5 years, the potential feasibility of a phaseout of  the statutory licenses, and potential implications of a phaseout for the  requirements governing the carriage of local broadcast television stations  (\u201ccarriage requirements\u201d) and consumer access to programming and  prices paid for cable and satellite services. We selected these  stakeholders to include those with expertise on this topic as well as those  representing a range of key roles in the video marketplace.

The  section 119 and 122 licenses were extended to satellite operators to  reduce transaction costs and provide the same general efficiencies  offered to cable operators under the Section 111 license. Transaction  costs are a concern because each television program may contain  material from multiple copyright owners.

Online video distributors (e.g., Sony Playstation  Vue or CBS All Access) must license the online rights for all the content  on the local broadcast television station\u2019s signal\u2014including the broadcast  network\u2019s content (e.g., primetime dramas and comedies) and the local  broadcast television station\u2019s content (e.g., local news programs). The  method by which these online rights are licensed varies by broadcast  network and by online video distributor; however, the content they must  license\u2014without the benefit of the statutory licenses\u2014is similar to the  content covered by the statutory licenses. Therefore, it seems feasible  that just as broadcast content is licensed for online viewing using market- based negotiations; it can also be licensed for viewing through cable and  satellite operators using market-based negotiation and without the  statutory licenses.", "Moreover, over the past 25 years, FCC and the U.S. Copyright Office  have reported that the transaction costs that statutory licenses were  created to address may have become more manageable and that  licensing secondary transmission rights in the absence of the statutory  licenses could be feasible. Specifically, in its 1989 statutory licensing  study, FCC reported that in the absence of the section 111 license,  television stations would be able to acquire cable retransmission rights to  \u201cpackages\u201d of the programming they broadcast. Cable operators could  then negotiate with a single entity\u2014the broadcast station\u2014for carriage  rights to each package (e.g., sublicensing). Thus, cable and satellite  operators would not have to license the rights to transmit each program  with each copyright owner, minimizing the number of negotiations and  subsequently the transaction costs. FCC reported that the existence of  cable networks provided \u201cconvincing\u201d evidence that the transaction costs  associated with full copyright liability are manageable and concluded that  the \u201cnetworking mechanism\u201d appeared well-suited to the acquisition of  cable retransmission rights for broadcast signals as well. Moreover, the  U.S. Copyright Office reported in 2008 and 2011 that sublicensing is a  reasonable alternative to statutory licenses. Cable and satellite  operators could negotiate for the secondary retransmission rights for  broadcast content at the same time and potentially with the same entities  they negotiate retransmission consent for the entire broadcast signal.", "Although feasible for most, some video marketplace participants may face  negative effects and may have difficulty licensing secondary transmission  rights to ensure distribution of their video content in the event of a  phaseout. Specifically:", "Small Cable Operators: Based on our analysis of stakeholder  interviews and the U.S. Copyright Office\u2019s 2011 report, cable  operators with small customer bases may face financial and logistical  challenges in the event of a phaseout of the Section 111 license. As  the U.S. Copyright Office has reported, small cable operators are  particularly vulnerable to increases in the costs of doing business.  Similarly, some stakeholders told us they believe that small cable  operators do not have the financial and legal resources to adapt to a  change in the statutory licenses. These stakeholders were concerned  that any increase in transaction costs (due to additional negotiations)  or an increase in the actual cost of content may make it difficult for  small cable operators to stay in business.", "Public Television: Public television, in particular, may be negatively  affected by a phaseout of the statutory licenses. Public television  stations and program suppliers, such as the Public Broadcasting  Service (PBS), tend to license a smaller bundle of rights at a  relatively low cost. In addition, producers of public television content  rely on the distribution of statutory license copyright royalty fees to  supplement the payments received from public television. According  to public television stakeholders, given the terms by which content is  currently licensed for public television, neither direct licensing or  sublicenses\u2014marketplace alternatives to the statutory licenses\u2014 would work. These licensing mechanisms would likely result in cable  and satellite operators or public television stations and program  suppliers facing significant transaction costs to obtain the necessary  secondary transmission rights. As we, along with the U.S. Copyright  Office reported in 2011, there are also concerns that some local  public television stations may not have the financial resources to deal  with the transaction costs associated with obtaining these rights for all  of their content."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Phaseout of the Statutory Licenses Could Impact Some Carriage Requirements", "paragraphs": ["A phaseout of the statutory licenses could have implications for the must- carry and carry-one, carry-all requirements, as currently implemented.", "Must-carry: As we have previously reported, if Congress phases out  the Section 111 statutory license, cable operators may have difficulty  complying with the must-carry requirement. Eliminating this statutory  license would remove the current mechanism used by cable operators  to license broadcast programming and, unless the must-carry  provision was at least revised, would leave cable operators in a  seemingly paradoxical situation. Cable operators would be required to  transmit without modification local broadcast station signals containing  copyrighted content for which they might not be able to license the  needed public performance rights, or only be able to do so at a  potentially significant burden and cost.", "Carry-one, carry-all: If Congress phases out the Section 122 statutory  license, according to FCC and the U.S. Copyright Office, the carry- one, carry-all provision would no longer apply to satellite operators.  According to the U.S. Copyright Office, a repeal of the Section 122  license would render carry-one, carry-all effectively \u201cnull and void,\u201d  which could have a detrimental effect on television stations that do not  or cannot elect retransmission consent due to a poor bargaining  position. Local broadcast television stations that currently gain  carriage by satellite operators through the carry-one, carry-all  provision, may no longer be carried in the event of a phaseout of the  Section 122 license. In this scenario, cable operators would have a  mandatory obligation to carry any local broadcast television station  that requested carriage, while satellite operators would face no such  obligation.", "As we have reported in the past, a phaseout of the statutory licenses  would not necessarily require modification to the other carriage  requirements, specifically retransmission consent and the broadcast  exclusivity rules, as discussed below.", "Retransmission consent: Commercial local broadcast television  stations can pursue this option, discussed earlier, when they do not  invoke must-carry or carry-one, carry-all. A phaseout of the statutory  licenses would not necessarily change how cable and satellite  operators negotiate for the rights to transmit commercial local  broadcast stations\u2019 signals. However, without the statutory licenses,  cable and satellite operators would be required to obtain the rights to  retransmit the content embedded on a broadcast station\u2019s signal\u2014 the potential mechanisms for obtaining these rights (direct licensing,  sublicensing, and collective licensing) are discussed further below.", "Broadcast exclusivity rules: These include the network non-duplication  and syndicated exclusivity rules that, as mentioned earlier, were  designed to protect local broadcast stations from competition with  local broadcast stations imported by cable or satellite carriers from  outside the local market being served. A phaseout of the statutory  licenses would not, on its face, require a change to the exclusivity  rules. We previously reported that eliminating the exclusivity rules  may have varying effects, but these would depend on other federal  actions and industry response."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Vary in Their Support for a Potential Phaseout and Are Uncertain about its Potential Effects on the Video Marketplace and Consumers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholder Positions on a Phaseout of the Statutory Licenses Vary", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholder support for a phaseout of the statutory licenses varied. Of the  42 selected stakeholders we interviewed, all of whom provided a  response to our questions asking their position on a phaseout, 15  supported either a full or partial phaseout of the statutory licenses, and in  some cases cited contingent factors:", "Six of the 42 stakeholders supported a full phaseout of all three  statutory licenses. Reasons given for supporting a full phaseout  included that direct negotiations and sublicensing to license the rights  to distribute broadcast content on online and on-demand platforms  are already taking place in the video marketplace. In addition, cable  networks aggregate all rights needed for cable and satellite operators  to transmit their content to viewers. According to some of these  stakeholders, they see no reason the same system could not be  employed to address the retransmission of broadcast content by cable  and satellite operators.", "Five of the 42 stakeholders said their support of a full phaseout was  contingent on other factors, such as the phaseout or reform of some  or all of the carriage requirements. Four of these would support a  phaseout of the licenses but only if all carriage requirements were  eliminated. One stakeholder overall supported a phaseout of the  statutory licenses, but thought the licenses could be retained to help  smaller copyright holders. One reason given for wanting either the  elimination or amendment of the carriage requirements at the same  time as a phaseout was concern that if the requirements remain in  effect they could undermine any benefits of a system without the  statutory licenses. For example, if a sublicensing system was the  primary replacement for the current statutory licenses and cable and  satellite operators paid for the right to license the underlying  broadcast content rights in addition to current fees for retransmission  consent; there were concerns that programming costs would increase  significantly.", "Four of the 42 stakeholders said they supported a partial phaseout of  the statutory licenses, and all four specified that the licenses related to  distant signal transmission\u2014section 119 and the relevant portions of  section 111\u2014as those that should be phased out. These  stakeholders said the statutory licenses were functioning as intended,  however, they thought the distant signal portions of the licenses had a  negative impact on the marketplace.", "In contrast, 14 of the 42 selected stakeholders said they did not support a  phaseout. Five of the 14 specified that they did not support a phaseout  of the statutory licenses for stations that elect must-carry or carry-one,  carry-all, but did not take a position on what should happen to the  statutory licenses for commercial local broadcast television stations that  participate in retransmission consent negotiations. This position is in part  due to the issues discussed above, such as financial concerns if  noncommercial participants had to license a larger bundle of rights  through market-based negotiations. Half of these stakeholders (7 of 14  stakeholders) said that the current system is operating as intended.  These stakeholders were concerned that changes to the system might  unfairly benefit one industry segment over another as well as possibly  have unintended consequences that could damage the video  marketplace. For example, stakeholders had concerns that sublicensing  or direct licensing could add transaction costs and reduce efficiencies  gained though the statutory license system, and hurt the video  marketplace.", "Thirteen of the 42 selected stakeholders told us they had no position on a  possible phaseout. One of these stakeholders told us he or she did not  have a position on a phaseout because this stakeholder has other higher  priority regulatory and legislative concerns requiring their attention.  Additionally, the five stakeholders representing OVDs are not a part of the  statutory licensing system so this issue was not relevant to their role in  the video marketplace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Stakeholders Were Uncertain about Potential Impacts of a Phaseout on the Video Marketplace", "paragraphs": ["Selected stakeholder views on how a phaseout might affect the video  marketplace were varied and appeared to be influenced by uncertainty  related to the carriage requirements, marketplace alternatives, and  competition. Given this uncertainty, generally only about half or fewer of  the 42 selected stakeholders interviewed had a position on these issues.", "Carriage Requirements: Of the 42 selected stakeholders we interviewed,  on any given requirement, only about half (a range of 19-22  stakeholders) had a position on what should happen with the carriage  requirements if the statutory licenses were phased out. Those without a  position who offered a reason, cited not wanting to speculate on the  issue, in some cases due to uncertainty about what, if any, federal actions  would be taken and what the impacts of those actions on the video  marketplace may be. As discussed above, if the statutory licenses are  fully or partially phased out, it may be necessary to adjust the must-carry  requirement. For example, several stakeholders representing cable  operators told us that the must-carry requirement would put cable  operators in a difficult position if the statutory licenses were phased out.  Specifically, must-carry would require carriage of a station, but cable  operators would have no guarantee that the rights for the content on a  station\u2019s signal were licensed for secondary transmission. Similarly, public  television stakeholders told us that without the statutory licenses, the  party responsible for obtaining the secondary transmission rights\u2014either  public television stations or program suppliers\u2014would face difficulties due  to high transaction costs. Some selected stakeholders also raised  concerns about how, if the licenses were phased out, retransmission  consent negotiations for the commercial local broadcast television station  signal would co-exist with market-based negotiations to license the rights  for the broadcast station\u2019s content.", "Marketplace Alternatives: Similarly, of the 30 selected stakeholders  asked, about half (16 out of 30) had no position on which marketplace  alternative could replace the current statutory licensing system. Among  these stakeholders, some cited uncertainty about if or when a phaseout  would occur, as well as not wanting to comment because they do not  support a phaseout. The U.S. Copyright Office outlined in 2011 three  possible marketplace alternatives\u2014sublicensing, direct licensing, or  collective licensing\u2014that could replace the current system of statutory  licenses. Additionally, the office outlined three approaches\u2014statutory  sunset, distant signal first, and station-by-station\u2014for conducting a  phaseout. The marketplace alternative used to license the secondary  transmission rights for broadcast content after a phaseout would affect  video marketplace negotiations and associated transaction costs. Of the  30 selected stakeholders we asked, about half had a position on a  preferred marketplace alternative or how a phaseout of statutory licenses  should be conducted. Some stakeholders (5) noted that sublicensing,  collective licensing, and direct licensing already occur in the current video  marketplace to license video content on cable channels and on most  distribution platforms (e.g., over-the-air transmission, online, and on- demand). As discussed above, with market-based negotiations already  occurring, a phaseout of the licenses may be feasible. However, the  approach used to conduct a phaseout and the timeliness of  implementation, could also impact the marketplace. Of the stakeholders  with a position, 9 out of 10 said a statutory sunset option may be the best  option as it would allow the video marketplace participants time to  renegotiate any existing contracts for broadcast programming and signal  carriage contracts. For example, one broadcast network noted that  contracts related to broadcasting of live events, such as professional  sports, often cover a multi-year period, and a statutory sunset might help  avoid a disruption in carriage.", "Competition: Of the 30 selected stakeholders asked, about half (16) had a  position on the potential effects of a phaseout on competition in the video  marketplace. Of those, only one thought there would be no impact on  competition. Five of these stakeholders found it difficult to comment on  how competition would change. This was in part due to not knowing how,  if at all carriage requirements might change and the marketplace  alternatives that might take the place of the statutory licenses. Of the 10  that indicated a possible effect on competition, 5 stakeholders cited a  potential increase in competition in the marketplace as a possible result of  phasing out the statutory licenses. According to one selected stakeholder,  an increase in competition could mean a decrease in programming costs,  as new market entrants might spur the creation of more original content.  However another stakeholder said that an increase in competition as  more participants enter the marketplace could result in higher  programming costs. Essentially, more entities would be competing over  the same content."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Were Uncertain about the Potential Effects of a Phaseout of the Statutory Licenses on Consumers", "paragraphs": ["Given the uncertainty about the implications of a phaseout on the carriage  requirements and the video marketplace discussed above, most  stakeholders did not have a position regarding the effect of a phaseout on  consumer access to programming and prices paid for cable and satellite  television.

Consumers might see their access to local broadcast television  stations disrupted due to disagreements over the price and terms to  retransmit broadcast station\u2019s content, and it is unclear what impact a  phaseout might have on the nature and availability of this content.", "Blackouts: Programming disruptions, often termed blackouts, occur when  a cable or satellite operator and a local broadcast television station owner  are unable to reach agreement on the carriage of the station\u2019s signal,  usually during retransmission consent negotiations. This disagreement  results in a broadcast station\u2019s signal not being retransmitted to viewers  via the cable or satellite operator, disrupting their access to the content on  a local broadcast television station\u2019s signal. Blackouts have increased in  recent years, as shown in figure 4.", "Of the 37 selected stakeholders asked, 17 provided responses to our  questions about blackouts. These stakeholders were unsure if blackouts  in a post-phaseout marketplace would change because of uncertainty  around the status of the carriage requirements or other marketplace  changes. Six out of 17 stakeholders thought blackouts would definitely  increase in the event of a phaseout of the statutory licenses. These  stakeholders said this would occur because of the potential for additional  negotiations, both in number and the number of parties involved, which  could create more opportunity for holdouts and lack of agreement. The  remaining 11 stakeholders were split between either no change (6) or  those (5) who thought the impacts on blackouts would vary depending on  the marketplace alternative selected and the video marketplace response  to it, and therefore was difficult to predict. None of the selected  stakeholders thought blackouts would decrease if the statutory licenses  were phased out.", "Programming Diversity: Of the 42 selected stakeholders interviewed, 17  commented on how the diversity of programming, such as the nature and  availability of content, might be affected if the statutory licenses were  phased out. One of these stakeholders thought there could be an  increase in the diversity of programming, as the phaseout of the licenses  could spur the development of new content into the marketplace. Three  selected stakeholders thought there would be no change to the  availability and diversity of programming. Another five stakeholders were  unsure of what impact might occur because there were unknown factors  related to a phaseout that could affect either the availability or diversity of  programming. For example, depending on the marketplace alternative  selected to replace the statutory licenses, or if any changes were made to  the relevant carriage requirements discussed above, diversity of  programming could be affected or stay the same.", "Seven of the 17 responding stakeholders thought the availability and  diversity of content would decrease. Of those that provided additional  explanation on their position (6), concerns about less diverse content  being available stemmed, in part, from uncertainty over how potential  changes to carriage requirements may affect niche programming. For  example, if a system has greater transaction costs, availability of  programming could decrease. Representatives from one selected  industry stakeholder organization said that smaller content producers with  less popular programming would have limited leverage in a direct  licensing system, in part due to increased transaction costs. Additionally,  as discussed above, if in addition to the statutory licenses being phased  out, the must-carry requirements were also eliminated, public television  and other stations that currently elect must carry could have difficulty  licensing the secondary transmission rights and thus might have to alter  or diminish their programming.", "In our interviews with satellite operators, some cable operators, and  public television stakeholders, these stakeholders also raised concerns  that consumers might face decreased access to programs in the event of  a phaseout of the distant signal licenses (portions of Section 111 license  and the Section 119 license), although it is not clear the extent of the  effect on consumers due to changes in the marketplace.", "Satellite operators and one cable operator raised the concern that  without the distant signal licenses, no marketplace alternative for  distant signals would develop. One satellite provider we spoke with  said that without the distant signal licenses, no marketplace  alternative to provide distant signals may emerge as commercial  broadcast networks do not have any financial incentive to allow their  affiliates\u2019 signals to be transmitted outside of the intended local  market. These stakeholders noted how in some local television  markets, known as \u201cshort markets\u201d, there is no local broadcast affiliate  station for at least one of the major broadcast networks. Without  distant signal importation, these markets may not have access to one  or more local broadcast television stations affiliated with a major  network. However, according to U.S. Copyright Office data, the most  widely viewed distant signal by satellite service subscribers in the  United States is that of WGN, a superstation. The effects of a partial  phaseout of the statutory licenses on the viewers of distant signals  may be mitigated by the recent conversion of WGN into a cable  network. In Statement of Account filings with the U.S. Copyright  Office, the two satellite service providers no longer reported carrying  WGN as a superstation during the latter part of the 2015 accounting  period and subsequently saw a decrease in the number of their  subscribers receiving distant signals.", "Public television stakeholders raised the concern that a phaseout of  the distant signal licenses may actually lead to some local markets not  being served by a public television station. These stakeholders noted  that in the event a local public television station can no longer provide  service in a community, it may be necessary to import a public  television station from another market as a distant signal.

Thirteen of the 29 who commented on this issue thought  consumer prices would increase, in part due to anticipated increases in  transactions costs under a new licensing system. In general, an increase  in costs to providers of a service may lead to higher consumer prices for  the service. If, in the event of a phaseout, the marketplace alternative  selected to replace the current statutory license structure entails greater  transaction costs, then it is possible that some or all of those costs would  be passed onto the consumer. Similarly, if there were no change to  stakeholder transaction costs, then there should be no change to  consumer prices. This outcome is consistent with our prior work, the  effect of a phaseout on consumer prices for cable and satellite television  is unclear.

Because FCC\u2019s cable price  survey followed a probability procedure based on random selections, the  selected sample is only one of a large number of samples that might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of the particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 5 percent).
