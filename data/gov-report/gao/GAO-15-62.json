Some states have hired private organizations to help individuals apply for federal benefits, but the extent and nature of this practice is not well-known. GAO was asked to study this practice.", "This report examines (1) what is known about the extent to which states have SSI/DI advocacy contracts with private organizations, (2) how SSI/DI advocacy practices compare across selected sites, and (3) the key controls SSA has to ensure these organizations follow SSI/DI program rules and regulations.

Available evidence suggests that this practice\u2014known as SSI/DI advocacy\u2014accounts for a small proportion of federal disability claims. Using a variety of methods, including interviewing stakeholders, GAO identified 16 states with some type of SSI/DI advocacy contract in 2014. In addition, GAO analyzed a sample of 2010 claims nationwide and estimated that such contracts accounted for about 5 percent of initial disability claims with nonattorney representatives, or about 1 percent of all initial disability claims. Representatives working under contract to other third parties, such as private insurers and hospitals, accounted for an estimated 30 percent of initial disability claims with nonattorney representatives.", "Three selected sites represented different approaches to SSI/DI advocacy, but were similar in many respects. For example, Minnesota contracted with 55 nonprofit and for-profit organizations, while Hawaii and Westchester County, New York, each had a single contractor: a legal aid organization, and a for-profit company, respectively. At the same time, all three sites targeted recipients of similar state and county programs, such as General Assistance, and generally paid contractors only for approved disability claims, among other similarities.", "SSA has controls to ensure representatives follow program rules and regulations, but these controls are not specific to those working under contract to states or other third parties and may not be sufficient to assess risks and prevent overpayments\u2014known by SSA as fee violations. Specifically:", "Despite the growing involvement of different types of representatives in the initial disability determination process, SSA does not have readily available data on representatives, particularly those it does not pay directly. This hinders SSA's ability to identify trends and assess risks, a key internal control. SSA's existing data are limited and are not used to provide staff with routine information, such as the number of claims associated with a given representative. SSA has plans to combine data on representatives across systems, but these plans are still in development.", "SSA does not coordinate its direct payments to representatives with states or other third parties that might also pay representatives, a risk GAO identified in 2007. In cases involving SSI/DI advocacy contracts, a representative may be able to collect payments from both the state and from SSA, potentially resulting in an overpayment\u2014a violation of SSA's regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SSA (1) consider ways to improve data and identify and monitor trends related to representatives, and (2) enhance coordination with states, counties, and other third parties with the goal of improving oversight and preventing potential overpayments.

Specifically, we examined (1)  what is known about the extent to which states are contracting with  private organizations to identify and move eligible individuals from state-  or county-administered benefit programs to Social Security disability  programs, (2) how SSI/DI advocacy practices compare across selected  sites, and (3) the key controls SSA has in place to ensure these  organizations follow SSI/DI program rules and regulations.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations and SSA program documentation, including policies and  procedures. To gather more information about the extent to which states  and other government entities are contracting with private organizations  to provide SSI/DI advocacy services, we interviewed SSA and  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials; numerous  state, county, and local officials; and stakeholders and researchers who  work in this area. We also worked with national professional organizations  representing state Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  agencies and state Disability Determination Services (DDS) directors to  help identify states that may be engaged in these practices. In addition,  we reviewed relevant studies; in particular, we reviewed findings from a  recent SSA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report, including the  OIG\u2019s generalizable sample of disability claims with nonattorney  representatives in 2010. In order to obtain in-depth information on states\u2019  and organizations\u2019 SSI/DI advocacy practices, we selected three sites\u2014 Hawaii; Minnesota; and Westchester County, New York\u2014with SSI/DI  advocacy contracts. We selected sites that had an established history of  contracting for SSI/DI advocacy and represented a variety of approaches,  such as contracting at the state or county level, or contracting with a  single organization or multiple for-profit and nonprofit organizations.  Specifically, we selected a state with a single, statewide nonprofit  contractor; a state with multiple for-profit and nonprofit contractors; and a  county with a single, for-profit contractor. We requested data from each  site on the number of SSI and DI claims that were approved and the total  amounts paid under the contract in state fiscal year or contract year 2013.  We also collected SSA data on the total number of claims approved in the  same state or county in calendar year 2012, the most recent year these  federal data were available. We assessed the reliability of these data by  interviewing knowledgeable SSA, state, and contractor officials and  comparing data provided by the state or county and the contractors, and  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  providing contextual information on the size of these contracts. To  analyze national trends in the involvement of representatives over time,  we reviewed SSA data on initial SSI and DI claims with attorney and  nonattorney representatives, from calendar year 2004 to 2013.

In  fiscal year 2015, SSA expects to pay an estimated $147 billion in DI  benefits to about 11 million workers with disabilities and their spouses  and dependents.

Claims from individuals meeting  these criteria are then evaluated by state DDS staff, who review medical  and other evidence and make the initial disability decision. SSA funds the  DDSs, which are run by the states, to process disability claims in  accordance with SSA regulations, policies, and guidelines. Some DDSs  may be independent state agencies, while others may be part of other  state agencies with broader missions, such as departments of human  services. If an initial claim is denied, claimants have several opportunities  for appeal within SSA, starting with a reconsideration; then a hearing  before an SSA administrative law judge (ALJ); and finally at the Appeals  Council, which is SSA\u2019s final administrative appeals level. If the claimant  is determined to be eligible for SSI or DI, SSA will calculate the benefit  amount and begin to pay benefits.

A representative may act on a claimant\u2019s behalf in  a number of ways, including helping the claimant complete the disability  application, obtaining and submitting evidence in support of a claim, and  supporting the claimant during the hearings and appeals process.", "To appoint a representative, a claimant must sign a written notice  appointing the individual to be his or her representative in dealings with  SSA and file the notice with SSA. Representatives can file this notice  using a standard form, which contains the name and address of the  representative. The standard form also indicates whether and how the  representative would like to be paid\u2014by the claimant, directly by SSA out  of a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits (known as a direct payment), or by a  third party.", "Representatives have commonly been involved at SSA\u2019s hearings and  Appeals Council levels, but evidence suggests that representatives have  become increasingly involved at the initial stage of the disability  determination process. SSA data compiled for this report show that the  proportions of SSI and DI claims with a representative at the initial level  increased between 2004 and 2013. From 2004 to 2013, initial SSI claims  with a representative increased dramatically, from almost 11,000 claims  in 2004 (less than 1 percent of all initial SSI claims) to about 278,000  claims in 2013 (about 14 percent of claims). Initial DI claims with a  representative also increased over the same time period, from almost  100,000 claims (about 8 percent of claims) to more than 413,000 claims  (about 20 percent of claims). (See fig. 2.) In 2013, two-thirds of the  representatives associated with initial claims were attorneys and one-third  were nonattorneys.", "These trends may, in part, reflect legislative actions that expanded  payment options for representatives in the disability determination  process. For example, the Social Security Protection Act of 2004  temporarily allowed attorney representatives to receive direct payments  from SSA, out of claimants\u2019 past-due benefits, for SSI claims, and also  required a demonstration project under which SSA\u2019s direct payment  system applied to qualified nonattorney representatives.

At the same time, successful SSI/DI advocacy efforts allow states  to reduce benefit costs or reinvest cost savings into expanding services or  serving other individuals.", "The financial incentives for states to pursue SSI/DI advocacy increased in  two ways with the creation of the TANF program in 1996 and subsequent  changes to TANF requirements. As some researchers noted, under the  former program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, states received  less than half of any savings achieved through transferring individuals to  SSI. Under TANF, however, states retain the savings from federal and  state funds that would have been used to support those individuals and  can use those funds for other allowable benefits or services. At the same  time, the new work participation requirements of the TANF program  required a percentage of each state\u2019s caseload to participate in  employment-related activities. States that do not meet required work  participation rates are at risk of having their annual TANF block grants  reduced. Therefore, the work requirements provided incentives for states  to remove certain families from the calculation of the work participation  rate, including individuals with disabilities who have significant barriers to  work.", "States have taken different approaches to SSI/DI advocacy. Some states  designate state employees to provide SSI/DI advocacy services, while  others contract with for-profit or nonprofit organizations or legal aid  groups.

While SSA collects some  data on representatives working on behalf of claimants, it does not collect  information on whether these representatives are working under contract  to a state or county.

In several states, we identified only county-level contracts  (see fig. 3), and in one state, New York, we identified at least one contract  at the state, county, and city level. Specifically, according to state officials,  New York had a statewide Disability Advocacy Program that provided  grants to a group of nonprofit and legal aid organizations to help  individuals appeal their claim after it was initially denied. Westchester  County also had a contract with a for-profit organization for SSI/DI  advocacy.

We identified multiple states that have ended, or plan to end,  their SSI/DI advocacy contracts, and at least one state that is planning to  renew a contract it ended several years ago. Several state officials and  experts cited reasons for ending or renewing SSI/DI advocacy contracts,  including financial considerations. For example, according to state  officials, Maryland had a contract for over a decade with an organization  to work with TANF recipients who may be eligible for federal disability  benefits. The state paid this organization for each disability application  submitted; however, state officials told us they ended this contract in 2009  because it was no longer financially practical. According to state officials,  in 2014, the state planned to issue a new request for proposals for SSI/DI  advocacy that will only pay the contractor for approved claims. Officials  told us that they expect that the performance-based compensation  structure of the contract will make it financially practical again. In contrast,  officials in Delaware told us they had a contract with a single nonprofit  organization for about 6 years to work with TANF recipients, but the  contract expires in 2014 and will not be renewed due to the relatively low  success rate achieved by the contractor. After the contract expires, state  employees will provide these services instead, which officials believe will  be a better use of resources.

SSA regulations also set  forth specific rules of conduct that apply to all representatives. For  example, representatives are required, with reasonable promptness, to  obtain evidence in support of the claim, submit such evidence as soon as  practicable, help claimants respond to requests for information from SSA  as soon as practicable, and to be familiar with relevant laws and  regulations. Representatives are prohibited from, among other things,  knowingly collecting any fees in violation of applicable law or regulation.  In addition, nonattorney representatives who wish to be eligible for direct  payment of their fees out of a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits also must  satisfy a number of statutory criteria.

In 2008, SSA issued proposed  rules that would have recognized organizations, in addition to individuals,  as representatives. In other words, under the proposed rules a claimant  could appoint an organization or firm to represent them rather than a  single individual from that organization. In the proposed rules, SSA stated  that the business practices of those who represent claimants have  changed, and many representatives practice in group settings and  provide their services collectively to claimants. However, the agency did  not issue final rules on this topic.

SSA officials stated that the agency currently  captures information on representatives in separate, stand-alone systems  that are not well-integrated, which has resulted in concerns about  payment inefficiencies and privacy. SSA plans to integrate information  from the various systems on representatives, creating one system as the  sole source for information on representatives. SSA officials told us that  the agency may identify new data elements related to representatives to  capture in the system, such as the organizations they are associated with,  but there currently is no plan to collect this information.", "Another facet of this initiative involves giving representatives expanded  access to the disability eFolder, SSA\u2019s electronic system containing all of  the documents pertaining to a disability claim. Once implemented,  authorized and registered representatives will have the ability to view  documents for their clients contained in the eFolder and download and  print them. Officials from two professional organizations of  representatives and some SSA staff we interviewed reported that giving  representatives access to the eFolder would be beneficial. By requiring  representatives to register to gain access, SSA could gather more  information on representatives. According to SSA\u2019s vision statement for  this project, successful implementation would provide SSA more readily  available data\u2014and enhanced abilities to respond to management  requests for information\u2014on representatives.

SSA is in the early stages of exploring computerized tools  to enhance efforts to systematically detect potential fraud.", "Using data from recent alleged fraud cases involving representatives,  SSA plans to use computer analytics to examine various characteristics  of disability claims and determine those which may be fraudulent. Known  as predictive analytics, these computer systems and tools can help  identify patterns of potentially fraudulent disability claims. However, as  discussed earlier, SSA does not consistently collect some data that may  aid in its analytics effort, such as information on the organizations or firms  with which individual representatives may be associated. The absence of  readily available data on representatives hinders SSA\u2019s ability to detect  patterns of potential fraud. Specifically, SSA\u2019s current data systems do  not allow staff to identify, in a timely manner, large volumes of claims with  the same representative and the same impairments, which can be a risk  factor for potential fraud, according to SSA officials we interviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Does Not Coordinate with Third Parties Contracting for SSI/DI Advocacy, Which May Result in Overpayments", "paragraphs": ["SSA does not coordinate its direct payments to representatives with  states and other third parties that might also pay representatives. As a  result, it is possible that both SSA and a state or third party could pay the  representative, resulting in more than one payment. More specifically,  under the current system of payments, a representative working under  contract to a state could (1) request direct payment from SSA (deducted  from the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits) for representing a particular  claimant, and (2) also submit an invoice to the state requesting payment  under the terms of the SSI/DI advocacy contract. Generally, SSA  prescribes the maximum fee allowed, and representatives may not  knowingly collect more than the fee that SSA authorizes them to receive  for a case. However, we found that in cases involving SSI/DI advocacy  payments, representatives might be able to collect payments from the  state as well as through SSA fee withholding, totaling more than the  authorized amount. Unless SSA and the state or other third party share  information on their payments or have policies and procedures in place to  prevent such cases, representatives may receive both SSA and state  payments that total more than the SSA-authorized fee.", "In 2007, we reported on this risk of overpayments to representatives and  recommended that SSA take steps to address it. However, SSA has not  fully implemented our recommendation because SSA did not know which  states were paying representatives or the true extent of the problem,  according to a senior agency official. SSA has taken some steps to clarify  authorized payments for representatives. For example, in 2011, SSA  revised the form a claimant uses to appoint a representative (form 1696)  to more clearly indicate how a representative would like to be paid.  Specifically, the updated form requires representatives to declare whether  they intend to be paid by (1) the claimant directly,(2) SSA, out of the  claimant\u2019s past-due benefits, or (3) a third party. (See fig. 5.)", "Although the revised form more clearly delineates allowable fee  arrangements, SSA officials acknowledged that this overpayment  vulnerability still exists. Officials told us that the agency would not know if  a representative was paid from another source outside SSA. The agency  is dependent upon the claimant or the third party to inform SSA about an  overpayment to a representative. Although the updated appointment form  makes it more clear that representatives must choose one type of fee  arrangement, some SSA staff we interviewed reported that claimants  often do not fully understand the forms they are signing or the  implications.", "One state we studied has developed practices in an attempt to avoid  these types of overpayments, but these practices are not universal.  Officials in Minnesota stated that they recently began requiring contracted  organizations to submit copies of their signed form 1696 so the state  could verify that the representatives checked the appropriate box for  payment. By looking more closely at the award notices SSA sends to  claimants and representatives, state officials reported discovering three  instances in 2014 when a representative did not check the appropriate  box to waive direct payment from SSA and could have received an  overpayment. Minnesota officials plan to work with a local SSA field office  to conduct an audit of a sample of claims to identify such cases.  According to a Minnesota official, this effort would begin in December  2014. Officials we interviewed in the other two selected sites reported that  they do not require representatives from contracted organizations to  submit these signed SSA forms, nor did they have plans to audit claims to  detect overpayments.", "SSA does not systematically coordinate with states and other third parties  on the payment of representatives. For example, SSA has not issued  guidance to states or third parties or shared any best practices on  preventing overpayments. SSA and state officials in Minnesota reported  that as SSA expands representative access to the eFolder during the  disability determination process, providing controlled third party access  could efficiently facilitate the detection of potential overpayments. For  example, states could use their access to portions of the eFolder to easily  check the form 1696 submitted by the representative and any additional  documents, such as fee agreements, to prevent overpayment. However,  SSA can only provide access to an eFolder if it is permissible under  federal privacy laws. In general, coordination is important because the  risk of overpayment goes beyond the 16 states we identified with state or  county SSI/DI advocacy contracts.

Since  representatives are increasingly involved in this process and are working  on behalf of a diverse set of third parties, it is critical that SSA  management and employees have mechanisms for monitoring trends and  patterns related to claims with representatives. SSA anticipates being  able to combine data across its systems in order to evaluate data  variations on representatives but those plans are under development.  SSA\u2019s current efforts also face a number of uncertainties which, if left  unaddressed, may undermine the agency\u2019s ability to improve data on  representatives.

The agency did not provide  any further support for this assertion; it is unclear the basis on which SSA  could make this statement, given that officials repeatedly told us during  the course of our work that the agency has no information or data on  states\u2019 contracts. Our report makes it clear that the full extent of states\u2019  and counties\u2019 SSI/DI advocacy practices is unknown, given the absence  of national-level data.

SSA acknowledged that the report accurately describes  initiatives the agency has underway to improve the use and collection of  data related to representatives. SSA stated that, as part of these efforts,  the agency may identify additional data elements that may be helpful to  collect and consider any necessary policy changes. SSA raised concerns,  however, that expanding data collection to a more detailed level could  negatively affect other agency priorities. We fully acknowledge that SSA  has competing priorities and limited resources. With this in mind, we  wrote the recommendation to provide SSA flexibility in implementation,  including suggesting that the agency leverage current initiatives. We  continue to believe that SSA should consider steps to improve available  data on appointed representatives to better monitor the involvement of  these third parties in the disability determination process.", "SSA partially agreed with our second recommendation to take steps to  enhance coordination with states, counties, and other third parties with  the goal of improving oversight and preventing and identifying potential  overpayments. In its general comments, SSA stated that its rules allow  representatives to receive fee payments, and that any payments made by  states are outside of SSA\u2019s authority for oversight purposes. SSA also  stated that our report did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant  enhanced coordination and noted that the agency takes the necessary  actions to recoup fees when it learns of a potential fee violation. Our  report notes, however, that SSA is dependent upon the claimant or the  third party to inform SSA about an overpayment to a representative. In  our audit work in selected states, we also noted three instances when a  representative attempted to be paid by SSA and the state. While we  recognize that payments made by states to representatives are outside of  SSA\u2019s jurisdiction, SSA has established rules of conduct for  representatives, and these rules prohibit a representative from collecting  fees over the amount SSA has authorized.

In July 2014, this  organization became a subcontractor to a company that performs medical  and psychological evaluations for the state\u2019s cash assistance programs.  Specifically, the primary contractor is responsible for determining whether  applicants and recipients of the state\u2019s General Assistance (GA) and  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs have  disabilities that prevent them from engaging in work at a certain level.  Previously, the state had two separate contracts for SSI/DI advocacy and  medical and psychological evaluations. State officials told us that they  combined those services into a single contract, in part, to streamline the  referral process for SSI/DI advocacy. If the primary contractor determines  that an individual\u2019s disability meets Social Security criteria, they refer the  individual directly to their advocacy subcontractor rather than indirectly  through state caseworkers, as was done under the prior contract.", "Disability screening process  Previously, a prospective claimant could be referred by a state caseworker  or walk into the legal aid office.

Organizations could submit proposals to provide services under  one or both components. Minnesota offered higher payments under the  SOAR program because, according to state officials, the homeless  population requires more intensive services.
