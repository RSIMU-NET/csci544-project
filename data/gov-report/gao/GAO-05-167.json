The agency has instructed its regional offices to make seriously injured servicemembers a high priority for all VA assistance, including VR&E services, and has asked DOD to provide data that would help VA identify and monitor this population. It has also deployed additional staff to five major Army military treatment facilities where the majority of the seriously injured are treated. Pending an agreement with DOD for sharing data, VA has relied on its regional offices to learn who the seriously injured are and where they are located. We found that the regional offices we reviewed had developed information that varied in completeness and reliability. We also found that VA does not have a policy for maintaining contact with those with serious injuries who may later be ready for VR&E services but did not initially apply for VR&E. Nevertheless, some regional offices did attempt to maintain contact while other regional offices did not. VA faces significant challenges in expediting VR&E services to seriously injured servicemembers. These include: the inherent challenge that individual differences and uncertainties in the recovery process make it difficult to determine when a servicemember will be ready to consider VR&E services; DOD's concerns that VA's outreach, including early intervention with VR&E, could work at cross purposes to military retention goals for servicemembers whose discharge from military service is not yet certain; and the lack of access to data from DOD that would allow VA to readily know which servicemembers are seriously injured and where they are located. VA and DOD generally concurred with our findings and recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the onset of U.S. operations in Afghanistan in October 2001 and Iraq  in March 2003, the Department of Defense (DOD) has reported that more  than 10,000 service men and women have been injured in combat. While  many return to active duty after they are treated, others who are more  seriously injured are likely to be discharged from their military obligations  and return to civilian life with disabilities. In addition to cash  compensation, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers vocational  rehabilitation and employment (VR&E) services to help veterans with  disabilities restore their lives and participate in the civilian workforce. We  have reported that intervening early after a disabling injury increases the  likelihood that an individual will successfully return to work. Moreover,  there is growing awareness that people with disabilities can and want to  work and that changes in the nature of work and advances in assistive  technologies help them to do so. Further, as the U.S. workforce is  projected to shrink, the U.S. economy will need all who are able to  participate in the paid labor force. Because federal disability programs,  including VA\u2019s, lack emphasis on the potential for vocational rehabilitation  to return people to work and also rely on outmoded assumptions about  the relationship between impairment and work, we have designated these  as \u201chigh-risk\u201d programs.", "In view of the importance of early intervention in returning people who  have been disabled to work, you asked that we review how quickly VA is  able to provide VR&E services to seriously injured servicemembers from  Afghanistan and Iraq who are likely to become veterans with disabilities.  We assessed (1) how VA expedites VR&E services to these seriously  injured servicemembers and (2) the challenges VA faces in its efforts to do  so.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed VA\u2019s formal and informal  procedures for expediting VR&E services to seriously injured  servicemembers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. We reviewed  applicable laws and regulations. We interviewed officials at VA\u2019s central  office and at 12 of VA\u2019s 57 regional offices. Five of these offices are located  near the five major Army medical treatment facilities treating the majority  of the seriously injured Army servicemembers: Brooke Army Medical  Center at Fort Sam Houston, Texas; Darnall Army Community Hospital at  Fort Hood, Texas; Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon,  Georgia; Madigan Army Medical Center at Fort Lewis, Washington; and  Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. The corresponding  VA regional offices are Houston and Waco, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia;  Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C. We selected the other seven  regional offices based on Army data indicating that servicemembers  injured in Afghanistan and Iraq are being treated at military treatment  facilities in their regions. They are Buffalo, New York; Denver, Colorado;  Muskogee, Oklahoma; Nashville, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana;  Wichita, Kansas; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Our findings for  these regional offices cannot be generalized to all of VA\u2019s regional offices.  We focused on Army servicemembers, including activated National Guard  and Reserve, because they constituted the majority of servicemembers  wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, we visited Walter Reed  Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., where most seriously injured  Army servicemembers are initially treated. We also interviewed DOD  officials about their efforts to work with VA on the transition of injured  servicemembers being discharged from active duty. We conducted our  work between April 2004 and November 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s VR&E program is designed to ensure that veterans with disabilities  find meaningful work and achieve maximum independence in daily living.  In 2004, VA estimates that it spent more than $670 million on its VR&E  program to serve about 73,000 participants. This represents about 2  percent of VA\u2019s $37 billion budget for nonmedical benefits, most of which  involves cash compensation for veterans with disabilities.", "VR&E services include vocational counseling, evaluation, and training that  can include payment for tuition and other expenses for education, as well  as job placement assistance. Interested veterans generally apply for VR&E  services after they have applied and qualified for disability compensation  based on a rating of their service-connected disability. This disability  rating\u2014ranging from 0 to 100 percent in 10 percent increments\u2014entitles  veterans to monthly cash payments based on their average loss in earning  capacity resulting from a service-connected injury or combination of  injuries. To be entitled to VR&E services, veterans with disabilities  generally must have at least a 20 percent disability rating and an  employment handicap as determined by a vocational rehabilitation  counselor. Although cash compensation is not available to  servicemembers until after they separate from the military, they can  receive VR&E services prior to separation under certain circumstances.  To make these services available prior to discharge, VA expedites the  determination of eligibility for VR&E by granting a preliminary rating,  known as a memorandum rating.", "VA\u2019s outreach to servicemembers who plan to apply for veterans\u2019 disability  compensation has been part of its transition assistance program, which  was established in 1990. Either in group sessions or in one-on-one  encounters, VA provides servicemembers with information about  disability benefits and services, which includes the VR&E program, and  offers assistance in applying for them. In addition, VA administers a pre- discharge program that expedites the disability compensation claims  processing for servicemembers who are pending discharge. This program  also helps VR&E staff identify those who could benefit from vocational  rehabilitation and employment services. VA has recently included  activated National Guard and Reserve members in its outreach efforts.", "Servicemembers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan are surviving injuries that  would have been fatal in past conflicts, due, in part, to advanced  protective equipment and medical treatment. However, the severity of  their injuries can result in a lengthy transition from injured servicemember  to veteran. Initially, most seriously injured servicemembers, including  activated National Guard and Reserve members, are brought to Landstuhl  Regional Medical Center in Germany for treatment. From there, they are  transported to the appropriate U.S. medical facilities, which are usually  major military treatment facilities (MTFs) but may also be VA medical  centers. According to DOD officials, once stabilized and discharged from  the hospital, servicemembers usually relocate to be closer to their homes  or military bases and are treated as outpatients by the closest VA or  military hospital. (See fig. 1.) At this point, the military generally begins to  assess whether the servicemember will be able to remain in the military, a  process that could take months to complete. The process can take even  longer if the servicemember appeals the military\u2019s initial disability  decision.", "In response to recommendations made by the VA Vocational  Rehabilitation and Employment Task Force, VA is beginning to change its  approach to VR&E to better reflect contemporary views of disability. The  Secretary of Veterans Affairs established this external task force in 2003 to  conduct a comprehensive review of VA\u2019s VR&E program. In addition,  faced with the immediate need to provide benefits and services to a new  generation of veterans with disabilities, VA in August 2003 formed an  internal task force to develop and implement policies to improve the  transition of injured servicemembers back to civilian life. Known as the  Seamless Transition Task Force, it included ad hoc participation from  DOD. Although this task force\u2019s initial priority was to ensure the  continuity of medical care for injured servicemembers as they transition  from military to VA health care, it has also coordinated efforts to ensure  access to all other VA benefits, including VR&E services.", "We have previously reported on the importance of early intervention to  maximize the work potential of individuals with disabilities. We have also  reported, however, that current federal disability programs offer little  opportunity for early intervention with individuals who apply for  compensation. These programs require lengthy assessments in which  applicants must focus on demonstrating their work limitations rather than  their abilities and potential to work. Consequently, vocational  rehabilitation is typically introduced late in the process. Furthermore, we  have designated federal disability programs, including VA\u2019s, as high-risk  programs because they lack emphasis on the potential for vocational  rehabilitation to return people to work and also rely on outmoded  assumptions about the relationship between impairment and work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Taken Steps to Expedite Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services for Seriously Injured Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["VA has instructed its regional offices to make seriously injured  servicemembers a high priority for all VA assistance and asked DOD to  provide data that would ensure VA\u2019s ability to identify and monitor this  population.

In addition, VA  noted the particular importance of early intervention for those who are  seriously injured and emphasized that seriously injured servicemembers  applying for VR&E should receive the fastest possible service. Moreover,  VA reminded VR&E staff that they can initiate evaluation and counseling  and, in some cases, authorize training before a servicemember is  discharged.", "Since most seriously injured servicemembers are initially treated at major  MTFs, VA has detailed staff to these facilities.

VA has been working to develop a  formal agreement with DOD on what specific information to share. In the  spring of 2004, VA submitted a draft memorandum of agreement to DOD\u2019s  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs proposing  that DOD provide lists of all injured servicemembers admitted to MTFs. In  addition, VA requested personal identifying information, medical  information, and DOD\u2019s injury classification for each listed  servicemember. VA also requested monthly lists of servicemembers being  evaluated for medical separation from military service.

When  servicemembers are discharged from an MTF, VA officials told us that the  affiliated VA regional office coordinator notifies the coordinator in the  region to which the person relocates. The new coordinator contacts the  seriously injured servicemember to discuss any claims that have been filed  and to provide those who have not already done so an opportunity to  apply for other benefits, including VR&E services. Regional officials we  interviewed reported that they have followed VA\u2019s instructions to keep  updated logs of all contacts they have with seriously injured  servicemembers. Regional offices are required to send these logs to VA\u2019s  central office, which uses them to monitor outreach.", "In our review of 12 regional offices, we found that they have developed  different information sources resulting in varying levels of information on  seriously injured servicemembers. The nature of the local relationships  between VA staff and military staff at MTFs was a key factor in the  completeness and reliability of the information that the military provided.  For example, the military MTF staff at one regional office provided VA  staff with only the names of new patients with no indication of the severity  of their condition or the theater from which they were returning. Another  regional office reported receiving lists of servicemembers for whom the  Army has initiated a medical separation in addition to lists of patients with  information on the severity of their injuries. Some regional offices were  able to capitalize on longstanding informal relationships. For example, the  VA coordinator responsible for identifying and monitoring the seriously  injured at one regional office had served as an Army nurse at the local  MTF and was provided all pertinent information. In contrast, staff at  another regional office reported that local military staff did not until  recently provide them with information on seriously injured  servicemembers admitted to the MTF.", "Once they have identified the seriously injured servicemembers, regional  office staff reported that they are largely following outreach, coordination,  and case management procedures outlined in VA\u2019s September 2003  guidance. Under these procedures, disability compensation benefit  counselors usually conduct VA\u2019s initial outreach by contacting  hospitalized servicemembers to provide information on all veterans\u2019  benefits, including VR&E. Traditionally responsible for taking applications  and processing disability compensation claims, these staff members are  neither vocational rehabilitation experts nor are they generally trained to  work with persons who have serious injuries. Accordingly, VA reported  that it has begun requiring all staff members who provide in-person or  telephone outreach to receive training on how to interact with seriously  injured servicemembers. VR&E staff reported that they generally rely on  the benefits counselors to notify them of injured servicemembers at MTFs  who are interested in or who apply for VR&E. Only then would a  vocational rehabilitation counselor or counseling psychologist usually  contact the hospitalized servicemember to begin counseling and  evaluation. In one regional office, VR&E staff said that they do not contact  injured servicemembers until they apply for services and obtain a  memorandum rating establishing their eligibility.", "The Washington, D.C. regional office has assigned a vocational  rehabilitation counselor to be available on site at Walter Reed Army  Medical Center, where a large number of seriously injured  servicemembers are treated. Although VA also deployed benefits  counselors to Walter Reed who are responsible for outreach activities and  the provision of information on all VA benefits, the VR&E counselor works  with hospitalized patients specifically to offer and provide vocational  counseling and evaluation. She reported attempting to contact all patients  within 48 hours of their arrival and visiting them routinely thereafter to  establish rapport. Her primary mission is to work with servicemembers  who will need to prepare for civilian employment, although she told us  that her early intervention efforts could also help servicemembers who are  able to remain in the military.", "According to VA staff, many seriously injured servicemembers are not  ready or able to consider VR&E services when they are first contacted.  Yet, we found that VA has no policy for maintaining contact with those  servicemembers who do not apply for VR&E services when they were in  the hospital or when they returned to a home base or to their residence.  Several regional offices reported that they do not stay in contact with  these individuals while others attempt to do so in various ways. One office  said it is considering contacting them after one year. Another regional  VR&E officer reported that staff ask the servicemembers to specify when  they would like to be contacted for further information or to begin  program participation. Staff at this regional office noted that they are  strong advocates of early intervention. They said that they try to contact  servicemembers as soon as possible to establish rapport and provide  VR&E program information even before the servicemembers are  physically ready to begin developing a vocational rehabilitation plan. At  the same time, they noted that readiness to participate in VR&E varies by  individual and that professional judgment is required to balance effective  outreach with an approach that could be viewed as intrusive.", "VR&E program officials noted the potential value of maintaining contact  with seriously injured servicemembers who may not initially be ready to  participate when initially contacted by VA, but they also recognized the  need to focus resources on those who do participate. Nevertheless,  officials from a veterans service organization told us that it is critical to  maintain contact with seriously injured veterans who do not initially apply  for VR&E because they may need months or even years before they are  ready.

The nature of the recovery process is highly  individualized and requires professional judgment to determine the  appropriate time to begin vocational rehabilitation. Further, because VA is  trying to prepare servicemembers who are still on active duty for a  transition to civilian life, DOD is concerned that VA\u2019s efforts may be  working at cross purposes to the military\u2019s retention goals.

The vocational rehabilitation counselor at Walter Reed  reported visiting servicemembers routinely, including evenings and  weekends, so that she would be available when they were ready to discuss  their need for vocational rehabilitation. For one patient, she reported  visiting him 12 times before he expressed interest in VR&E.

To expedite VR&E services, VA\u2019s  outreach process may overlap with the military\u2019s process for evaluating  servicemembers for a possible return to duty. According to DOD officials,  it may be premature for VA to begin working with injured servicemembers  who may eventually return to active duty. (See fig. 2.) With advances in  medicine and prosthetic devices, many serious injuries no longer result in  work-related impairments. Army officials who track injured  servicemembers told us that many seriously injured servicemembers  overcome their injuries and return to active duty. Recognizing this  potential, both Congress and the President have recently expressed  interest in seeing the military provide the retraining needed to support the  return of injured servicemembers to their military occupations or other  occupations within the military if possible. In an attempt to enable more  amputees to return to active duty, Walter Reed Army Medical Center plans  to open a new rehabilitation center in 2005.", "Both VA and DOD officials suggested that the earliest appropriate time for  VA to intervene for regular active duty servicemembers would be when it  is clear that the servicemember will not be retained by the military.  Currently, VA can only provide VR&E services to active duty  servicemembers who are pending discharge due to a disability. VR&E  services could begin earlier for injured members of the National Guard  and Reserve since these individuals usually expect to return to their  previous civilian employment.

VA has  instead had to rely on ad hoc regional office arrangements at the local  level to identify and obtain specific data about seriously injured  servicemembers.
