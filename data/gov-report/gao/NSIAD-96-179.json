In 1981, USIA maintained 16 posts in Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union, but it now has 31 posts in this region. At the same time, the level of its U.S. and foreign service national (FSN) personnel decreased; in 1981, USIA employed 642 Americans and 2,960 FSNs overseas, and by the end of 1996 it will have 523 American and 2,318 FSN employees.

Under the fiscal year 1996 7-year concurrent budget resolution, USIA could receive less than OMB projected. If USIA were to take a proportional share of the proposed reductions in the international affairs account, the congressional plan would call for reductions in funding for USIA to $865 million by 2000.Because of inflation, costs for current services would increase by about 4 percent. Additionally, the fiscal year 1997 House budget resolution assumes that much of USIA will gradually be privatized or eliminated. Therefore, there is a substantial gap between the costs of maintaining the status quo and potential funding levels.

However, the Agency has maintained posts in countries that, by its own criteria, are relatively less important to U.S. interests. In fiscal year 1995, USIA operated posts in 67 countries at a cost of more than $36 million (plus $23 million in exchanges), where USIA believed the United States had limited public diplomacy goals. One post, for example, had four U.S. foreign service officers and 21 FSNs assigned and cost $1.4 million a year to operate. Exchanges to that country cost an additional $643,000. In another country, three U.S. and five foreign nationals were employed, with post and exchange costs totaling $2.5 million.", "In April 1996, USIA announced that it was abandoning its principle of universality because of budget constraints.

In some countries, these costs were even higher: personnel costs in Germany and Japan consumed 65 percent and 68 percent, respectively, of the total USIA country budget.

Individual posts may be losing one or more positions based on a 1993 USIA system that ranks countries by importance and other characteristics, such as population and size, and USIA\u2019s potential to affect U.S. interests there. For each rank, USIA established a benchmark in 1994 for personnel levels and programs, and posts with staffing levels above this benchmark would lose staff. However, this benchmark is based on historic staffing and program levels and therefore may be above actual staffing requirements. For example, one USIA official stated that USIA management recognizes that the post in Germany will be too large even after downsizing, as it reflects the structure established after World War II.", "A more comprehensive approach would be required if there were a major funding reduction. In June 1995, the USIA Director decided to design a strategic vision for its overseas presence, assuming that funding could be reduced by as much as 40 percent. The model acknowledged that the Agency could no longer afford to do some things, and that many posts might have to drop entire products, services, and programs. In response, Agency managers developed a building-block approach under which all USIA overseas posts would include a core advocacy mission and USIA would add information activities, exchanges, and cultural programs only if a country were important to U.S. interests and if USIA\u2019s efforts could be effective. The model called for deemphasizing media and public opinion reporting because other agencies and the private sector already provide such reports, eliminating programs in the arts because they do not add to what is being done privately, and reducing grants to highly developed countries. Top management concluded that without such a redesign, Agency inertia would result in merely a downsized status quo, which would not yield an effective overseas structure.

Such assessments are critical to USIA\u2019s ability to sustain a major reduction and remain viable.", "One activity that we believe merits such review is USIA\u2019s student advising operation. USIA spends about $2.6 million annually to subsidize more than 400 educational advisory centers worldwide that provide information about the U.S. system of education. Some of these centers are housed in USIA offices and are fully funded by the U.S. government. Others are operated by host country universities or U.S. nonprofit organizations and are partially funded by USIA. An additional $1.4 million is spent for training, materials, and other activities. USIA believes that it is in the best interests of the United States to support student advising because international students spend nearly $7 billion a year in the United States, contributing substantially to the U.S. economy, and American students are introduced to different cultures, enhancing diversity. However, the USIA Inspector General recently concluded that new worldwide trends to internationalize higher education, advancements in communication technology, and the increased sophistication of non-U.S. government-sponsored educational advising institutions indicate that a guidance and oversight role for USIA is more appropriate than an operational one. Overall, the USIA Inspector General believes that the increase in private sector counseling services, coupled with dwindling USIA resources, suggest it is now an appropriate time for USIA to turn over its educational advising role to the private sector.", "USIA\u2019s English language training program, which originated in 1941, also is a candidate for review. The purpose of this program is to encourage the teaching of English; develop host country institutional capabilities to teach English; directly teach English in Africa, the Near East, and Asia; and design materials to supplement host countries\u2019 classroom texts in more than 140 countries, including Western countries such as Brazil, France, and Mexico. USIA supports the program in part because it allows the United States access to people and institutions that it might otherwise be denied, such as universities in Islamic countries, and provides a better understanding of and appreciation for American culture and values in the curricula of these institutions.", "Other programs, specific to one or more posts, should also be considered for review if budgets are significantly reduced. For example, a large post like Germany may employ translators and printing facilities and issue post-generated materials whose value would need to be assessed in a time of declining budgets.

Because they may not be co-located with an embassy and require staff to deal directly with the public, they are often expensive to operate. In Germany, for example, the fiscal year 1995 cost to operate six cultural centers (called America Houses) was nearly $9 million, which was for 77 staff and for activities such as reference centers, including online databases; student counseling activities; and cultural events. Lease costs for USIA\u2019s three branch offices in Japan exceed $350,000 a year, and the cost for offices in Milan, Italy, was approximately $137,000.

For example, the USIA Inspector General believes that binational centers are a cost-effective alternative to cultural centers. Binational centers are private, autonomous institutions established to promote mutual understanding between the United States and host countries. USIA may have only minimal or no funds invested in the centers and may or may not assign staff. USIA successfully encouraged the formation of a binational center when funding limitations forced it to close an America House in Germany. USIA collaborated with private industry and the local German government to establish a German-American Institute to further relations through cultural and educational events. This decision could cut USIA\u2019s annual operating costs in Germany by as much as half a million dollars. Of the 126 existing binational centers, 101 are located in Latin America, 16 in Europe, 4 in the Far East, and 5 in the Middle East.", "USIA officials said that the Agency has been forced to incur costs for office space when an embassy or a consulate does not have sufficient room available to house USIA. Nevertheless, when available, colocating with the State Department offers a more cost-effective approach. In 1996, USIA plans to terminate a $366,000 annual lease in Seoul, Korea, and a $455,000 annual lease in Singapore and move into embassy facilities in both countries.

In fiscal year 1995, USIA yielded $3.5 million from customers of its worldwide English language training program. Posts sell materials to clients to cover shipping, administrative, and markup costs. Posts retain 95 percent of the proceeds to spend on programs like their English training specialists or to help host countries develop institutions to teach English. Five percent of the proceeds are returned to headquarters for support. To a much lesser degree, USIA can recoup some of the costs associated with student advising. All USIA-supported student advisory centers can charge for their services. According to USIA officials, however, USIA posts cannot charge for services or headquarters-supplied products. The only exception is independently developed materials, which in Germany are prepared in German, published, and sold directly to students.", "USIA determined that as a global information agency in the information age it needed to modernize its communication technology and in fiscal year 1996 embarked on a modernization plan. Its headquarters reorganization supported the integration of new technologies. It was envisioned that by exploiting electronic technology, USIA could close down high overhead public access libraries in Europe and replace them with information centers, and could open up home pages on the Internet for easy access by users. Home pages may include speeches and other statements of U.S. officials, information on country post activities, clips of U.S. news articles, and other information for researchers. While not explicitly stated, the underlying assumption would appear to be that technology would significantly reduce and change USIA\u2019s involvement in supplying information.", "We observed, however, that some USIA officials in the field appear to view technology more as an addition than as a replacement for their long-standing programs. One official noted, for example, that information centers were opened at the cost of closing traditional libraries that lent out books and other materials.
