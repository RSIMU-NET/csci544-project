Although NATO has no formal program to prepare such nations for NATO membership, it has taken steps to strengthen certain non-NATO members\u2019 relationships with NATO.", "These steps include the PFP program, which NATO initiated in 1994. Twenty-seven non-NATO members now participate in PFP (see fig. 1). PFP objectives include fostering democratization in partners\u2019 defense establishments; encouraging joint planning, training, and military exercises with NATO forces; promoting the ability of partner nations to operate with NATO forces in humanitarian relief, search and rescue, peacekeeping, and other agreed-upon missions; and developing forces that are better able to operate with NATO forces. To implement the program, NATO and each PFP partner develop a plan that depicts NATO-proposed exercises and other PFP-related activities of interest to the partner and lists the partner\u2019s military and other assets that might be used for PFP activities. NATO expects partners to fund their participation. NATO views partners\u2019 level of participation in PFP activities as an important indicator of their interest in joining NATO and, according to DOD officials, has structured PFP as one means of helping partners become better integrated with NATO members.", "In July 1994, the U.S. President announced the Warsaw Initiative, a U.S. bilateral program designed to (1) facilitate the participation of partner states in exercises and interoperability programs, (2) promote interoperability with NATO, (3) support efforts to increase defense and military cooperation with PFP partners, and (4) develop strong candidates for NATO membership. The Departments of State and Defense jointly fund and administer the initiative. The Department of State funds equipment transfers and training, while DOD supports partners\u2019 participation in joint exercises and NATO-PFP interoperability projects. Also, the Department of State and DOD provide training and advice through the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program and the Joint Contact Team (JCT) program and donate excess defense articles.", "The Department of State and DOD agencies programmed about $308.6 million in fiscal year 1995-97 funds to support these efforts in 23 PFP partner states.

The DOD programs are funded through the 050 national defense budget function and account for about 52 percent of the funds.", "To facilitate NATO expansion, the President and Congress enacted the NATO Participation Act of 1994 and the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, which authorized the President to establish security assistance programs for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and any other countries the President believes have made progress in achieving PFP goals. The fiscal year 1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act also earmarked $30 million for foreign military financing grants for the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland and allocated $20 million to subsidize lending up to $242.5 million for purchases of U.S. defense articles, services, and training by these three countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NATO\u2019s PFP Program Helps Partners Prepare for Membership", "paragraphs": ["The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are extensively involved in NATO\u2019s PFP program.

Examples of such activities include exercises on naval peacekeeping in hostile environments, staff studies on the practicalities of conducting out-of-area multinational peacekeeping air operations, staff meetings on tactical communications interoperability, seminars on command and control systems, training in NATO operational terminology, search and rescue and explosive ordinance disposition working parties, and discussions of NATO reconnaissance and surveillance procedures related to peacekeeping.

PFP\u2019s scope does not include preparing partners for the major war-fighting tasks that NATO\u2019s collective defense responsibilities might require. Therefore, according to NATO officials, PFP interoperability goals do not cover the full range of interoperability objectives that NATO has established for its members and a partner\u2019s achievement of PFP interoperability objectives would not necessarily be an indicator of how well that partner would perform in collective security activities.", "Current uncertainties regarding the forces and missions that will be required of the nations invited to join NATO\u2014and the time frames for achieving future interoperability goals for new NATO members\u2014further complicate the task of assessing PFP\u2019s impact on future NATO members.

Funded primarily with Warsaw Initiative FMF funds, the Regional Airspace Initiative is intended to help Central and East European countries make the transition to western air traffic management practices, including those used by NATO members. A DOD study, partially funded by the Warsaw Initiative, concluded that all aspects of the region\u2019s air sovereignty operations needed improvement and that the pace of modernizing outdated systems was being constrained by cost, operational, and transitional implications. We found that other FMF-funded purchases in the region also correspond to NATO-designated objectives, including communications.", "Similarly, DOD has used the Warsaw Initiative\u2019s Defense Resources Management Studies project to support PFP\u2019s defense planning and budgeting cooperation area by programming about $2.8 million in fiscal years 1995-97 to expose the six countries to U.S. defense budget planning and programming practices.

According to NATO and DOD officials, English language training is particularly needed. While NATO has made language training for officers a PFP interoperability objective, it opted to leave foreign language training to its members. We found that the United States had allocated about 20 percent of fiscal year 1995-96 IMET funds ($1.43 million) for these six countries for English language training.

The clearinghouse involves periodic exchanges of data by member states regarding their PFP-related bilateral programs. NATO has not charged this forum with the task of organizing bilateral assistance efforts, however, and the clearinghouse\u2019s ability to gather and disseminate complete data about the full range of bilateral programs has been hampered by certain members\u2019 sensitivities regarding disclosure of data about their programs. These members initially presented only general information about their programs.

Officials from the United States, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom meet after clearinghouse sessions to exchange more detailed information. DOD officials hope to increase the size of this group. Clearinghouse limitations also prompted SHAPE\u2019s PFP unit to develop its own database to help ensure that participating units are not inadvertently scheduled to take part in multiple events at once.
