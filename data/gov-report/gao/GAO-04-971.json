For those transportation-disadvantaged seniors, GAO was asked to identify (1) federal programs that address their mobility issues, (2) the extent to which these programs meet their mobility needs, (3) program practices that enhance their mobility and the cost-effectiveness of service delivery, and (4) obstacles to addressing their mobility needs and strategies for overcoming those obstacles."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Five federal departments--including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--administer 15 programs that are key to addressing the mobility issues of transportation-disadvantaged seniors. These programs help make transportation available, affordable, and accessible to seniors, such as by providing transit passes or reimbursement for mileage. National data indicate that some types of needs are not being met, including those for trips (1) to multiple destinations or for purposes that involve carrying packages; (2) to life-enhancing activities, such as cultural events; and (3) in rural and suburban areas. However, there are limited data available to assess the extent of unmet needs. HHS's Administration on Aging is required by law to provide guidance to states on how to assess seniors' need for services, but officials said the administration has not done so because it has focused on providing other types of guidance. As a result, the local agencies on aging we interviewed--which are ultimately responsible for performing such needs assessments--used inconsistent methods to assess seniors' mobility needs. The Administration on Aging plans to conduct an evaluation of one of its major programs and thus has an opportunity to improve its understanding of seniors' needs and provide guidance to local agencies on performing needs assessments. Local transportation service providers have implemented a variety of practices--including increasing service efficiency, improving customer service, and leveraging available funds--that enhance mobility and the cost-effective delivery of services. Federal programs provide funding and some technical assistance for these practices, but several service providers we interviewed said that the implementation of such practices was impeded by limited federal guidance and information on successful practices. Senior mobility experts and stakeholders identified several obstacles to addressing transportation-disadvantaged seniors' mobility needs, potential strategies that federal and other government entities can consider taking to better meet these needs, and trade-offs associated with those strategies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. population is aging, and transportation is critical to helping  individuals stay independent as they age. Access to transportation, whether  by automobile or some other mode, is considered essential to independent  living, allowing individuals to gain access to the goods, services, and social  contacts that support their day-to-day existence and quality of life. Both the  number of older people and their share of the U.S. population are growing  rapidly. Although many seniors continue to drive for most of their lives, the  growing size of the senior population will increase demand for alternative  transportation services. For example, one study found that more than  600,000 people aged 70 and older stop driving each year and become  dependent on others for transportation. The increase in the potential pool  of seniors needing mobility assistance will challenge federal, state, and  local government agencies\u2019 ability to provide such assistance.", "In 2000, 35 million Americans, or 12.4 percent of the total U.S. population,  were aged 65 and over, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The  Census Bureau projects that this group will double to 70 million people by  2030, representing 20 percent of the total population. A national travel  survey found that seniors take most of their daily trips (about 90 percent)  by automobile, either as drivers or passengers. For the remainder,  approximately 8 percent of trips are by walking, and 2 percent by other  modes (including public transportation and bicycles). As seniors age, their  ability to drive, walk, or use public transportation may become limited by  reduced reaction time; deteriorating night vision; lessening ability to climb,  reach, or stand; or other physical limitations. To help ensure that transportation-disadvantaged seniors have access to health and medical  care, employment, and other basic services, various federal programs  provide funds for a range of senior transportation services to state, local,  and nonprofit agencies that actually provide the services and, in some  cases, also provide their own funds to support those services.", "This report responds to your request for information about the mobility  needs of transportation-disadvantaged seniors. As agreed with your office,  we identified (1) federal programs that address mobility issues for  transportation-disadvantaged seniors, (2) the extent to which federally  supported programs are meeting the mobility needs of transportation-  disadvantaged seniors, (3) program practices that can enhance mobility  and the cost-effective delivery of transportation services to  transportation-disadvantaged seniors and the extent to which federal  programs support the implementation of such practices, and (4) obstacles  to addressing transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 mobility needs and  potential strategies for overcoming those obstacles.", "To identify federal programs that address mobility issues for  transportation-disadvantaged seniors, we interviewed federal program  officials and senior mobility experts and reviewed pertinent GAO reports.  To assess the extent to which transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019  mobility needs are being met, we analyzed data collected by federal  agencies and local agencies on aging; reviewed studies conducted by  research organizations; and obtained the perspectives of experts in the  fields of aging, disability, and transportation. We also conducted  semistructured interviews with officials from a nonprobability sample of 16 area agencies on aging (AAA) from urban, suburban, and rural areas in six  states, selected to represent different regions of the country. To identify  program practices that can enhance mobility and the cost-effective delivery  of transportation services, we reviewed the literature on such practices and  conducted semistructured interviews with officials from 10 local  transportation providers highlighted in the literature to determine the  extent to which federal programs support practices that enhance senior  mobility. These 10 providers were chosen to include a diversity of  geographic areas (i.e., they were from different regions of the country and  from both urban and nonurban areas), types of practices, and federal  funding sources. To identify obstacles to addressing  transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 mobility needs and strategies for  overcoming those obstacles, we reviewed the relevant literature and  interviewed the AAA officials and transportation service providers  previously mentioned. We also interviewed 14 senior mobility experts and  representatives of pertinent professional associations and advocacy  groups. To ensure the reliability of data used in this report, we reviewed  and identified limitations associated with national statistical research  methodologies and documented the quality assurance procedures that  AAAs use to ensure the reliability of the data they collect. We concluded  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, although we  identified several limitations that we discuss throughout the report. We  also corroborated much of the testimonial information provided by AAAs,  local service providers, experts, professional associations, and advocacy  groups by comparing it with the literature and with other interviews. We  sent draft copies of this report to the five pertinent federal agencies\u2014the  Departments of Education, Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor,  Transportation (DOT), and Veterans Affairs\u2014for their review and  comment. We conducted our work from November 2003 through August  2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Appendix I contains more information about our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Seniors are a heterogeneous group\u2014many do not require assistance with  transportation, and, in fact, most drive automobiles. However, according to  data from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey conducted by DOT\u2019s  Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Federal Highway Administration, and  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, approximately 21 percent  (6.8 million) of seniors aged 65 and older do not drive. The percentages are  higher among minority populations aged 65 and older: approximately 42 to  45 percent of African-Americans and Asian-Americans do not drive,  compared with 16 percent of Caucasians. Approximately 40 percent of  Hispanics also do not drive. A person\u2019s driving status is correlated with  travel behavior. For example, one study found that drivers aged 75 and  older made an average of six trips per week, compared with two trips per  week for nondrivers. While some of this difference may be due to  individual preferences or to other circumstances, such as an illness that  prevents travel, some of the difference may be due to a lack of  transportation alternatives.", "Those seniors with poor health or a disability, or who have a limited  income, may face more difficulty finding and accessing transportation.  According to data from the 2000 Census, about 37 percent of persons aged  65 and older reported having at least one disability, and about 10 percent  were below the federal poverty line. Although not all of these seniors need  assistance with transportation, a sizable number are likely to need such  assistance. According to senior transportation experts, the \u201coldest of the  old\u201d (those aged 85 and older) are especially likely to be dependent on  others for rides, particularly if they are also in poor health. Figure 1 shows  some of the factors that affect seniors\u2019 transportation needs. The more of  these factors that seniors have, such as a network of family and friends  who can drive them and an available public transportation system, the  more likely it is that their mobility needs will be met.", "Transportation assistance is an important issue for all seniors. In 2001,  approximately 26 percent of state units on aging surveyed by the Aging  States Project identified transportation as a top health issue for older  adults, and 38 percent identified inadequate transportation as a barrier to  promoting health among older adults. Furthermore, transportation was  among the top five information requests to the Eldercare Locator Service in 2001, 2002, and 2003. There is, however, a significant gender gap in the  amount of time that seniors can expect to be dependent on alternative  sources of transportation. A study published in August 2002 in the  American Journal of Public Health estimated that men aged 70 to 74 who  stopped driving would be dependent on alternative transportation for an  average of 6 years, while women in the same age group can expect to have  an average of 10 years\u2019 dependence on alternative transportation modes.", "Although there is no clear-cut definition of mobility need, the literature and  the experts we consulted indicate that there are two main categories of  mobility need, both of which are important to seniors: (1) \u201cessential\u201d or  \u201clife-sustaining\u201d trips, which include medical trips and trips for  employment, shopping, banking, and other necessary errands, and (2)  \u201cquality of life\u201d or \u201clife-enhancing\u201d trips, which include recreational or  social trips that enable a senior to fully participate and engage in the  community, such as trips to concerts, theatre, visits with family members in  nursing homes or with friends, religious activities, and volunteer activities.  For the purposes of this report, we will use this two-fold definition of types  of trips as our working definition of mobility need. Unmet need occurs  when assistance from others is needed but is not provided or is inadequate.  However, according to the experts we contacted, there is no agreed-upon  standard or benchmark for the number of trips that an individual requires  to take care of essential activities for living (for both life-sustaining and  life-enhancing activities), although experts generally agree that  government should be concerned with meeting both types of needs for  transportation-disadvantaged seniors. The lack of a standard or benchmark  makes it difficult to determine an appropriate way to measure the extent to  which mobility needs are being met. Researchers have begun to identify  and evaluate transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 unmet mobility needs  by comparing the number of trips they make with those of  nondisadvantaged populations. In addition, some researchers have used  satisfaction ratings to measure seniors\u2019 unmet mobility needs. In the  absence of a standard measure of need, we will discuss need and unmet  need by comparing the travel of disadvantaged seniors with the travel of  nondisadvantaged seniors and by using other measures that federal and  local officials have developed.", "The federal government has traditionally provided some assistance in  mobility, mostly for the purpose of accessing other federal program  services. Federal agencies partner with local agencies, nonprofit  organizations, and others that actually provide transportation services and  also contribute their own funds. The federal agency that has a central role  in providing all types of services to seniors is HHS\u2019s Administration on  Aging (AOA). With a total discretionary budget of more than $1.3 billion,  AOA is the official federal agency dedicated to policy development,  planning, and the delivery of supportive home and community-based  services to older persons and their caregivers. AOA works through a  national aging network of 56 state units on aging; 655 AAAs; 241 tribal and  native organizations representing 300 American Indian and Alaskan Native  tribal organizations, and 2 organizations serving Native Hawaiians; and  thousands of service providers, adult day care centers, caregivers, and  volunteers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Address Mobility Issues Mainly through 15 Programs That Help Make Transportation Available, Accessible, and Affordable", "paragraphs": ["Five federal departments administer 15 programs that are key in addressing  mobility issues of transportation-disadvantaged seniors.

Some of these programs specifically target seniors, such as HHS\u2019s  Grants for Supportive Services and Senior Centers (Title III-B). Other  programs\u2014including DOT\u2019s Nonurbanized Area Formula Program (Section  5311)\u2014target other groups, such as rural populations, of which seniors can  be a part. About half of the 15 programs fund transportation for specific  types of trips, including for medical services, employment-related  activities, and other services (such as nutrition) that the programs provide.  The other half of the programs can be used to provide general  transportation for any trip purpose. The programs fund a variety of types of  services, ranging from transit passes and training in the use of public  transit to vehicle purchases or expansion of public transit service.", "Funds from the 15 programs follow various paths in providing  transportation services to seniors (see fig. 2). Many of the programs are  block grants or formula programs through which funds are distributed to  states on the basis of certain criteria, such as population. State agencies  then provide services directly or distribute the funds to local agencies,  nonprofit organizations, transit providers, and other organizations. For  example, funds from DOT\u2019s Capital Assistance Program for Elderly Persons  and Persons with Disabilities (Section 5310) are allotted by formula to state  agencies, which then distribute the funds to private nonprofit organizations  or local public entities (such as transit providers) to purchase vehicles or  other equipment. In another example, funds from HHS\u2019s Grants for  Supportive Services and Senior Centers (Title III-B) are distributed first to  state units on aging according to the number of seniors residing in the  state, and then to local AAAs, which generally contract for services with  local transportation providers. In other programs, such as the Department  of Labor\u2019s Senior Community Service Employment Program, some funds go  through the state while other funds go directly to nonprofit organizations  or local service providers. Finally, other programs\u2014such as HHS\u2019s Rural  Health Care Outreach Services Program\u2014bypass state agencies altogether  and go directly to local entities. Local entities can use funds from a variety  of federal programs to provide transportation services to seniors.

For example, HHS\u2019s Medicaid Program provides transportation that is free  or low-cost for seniors. Some of the programs address other attributes of  senior-friendly transportation, such as acceptability. For example, the  Department of Education\u2019s Independent Living Services for Older  Individuals Who Are Blind program can be used to train seniors in the use  of the public transit system, making it both more accessible and acceptable  to them.", "In addition to the 15 key programs identified in tables 1 and 2, the federal  government helps to make transportation more senior-friendly through  other programs and policies that provide or ensure access to transportation  services for all disadvantaged populations (including seniors). Although  seniors are not the target population of these other programs and policies,  they often benefit from them. For example, seniors are eligible for many of  the programs we identified in a previous report on the coordination of  services for the transportation-disadvantaged. In that report, we identified  62 federal programs that can be used to provide transportation services,  including the 15 programs identified above. For instance, seniors can  benefit from the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s  Community Development Block Grant Program, which can be used to  purchase and operate vehicles in low-income areas, and the Department of  Labor\u2019s Workforce Investment Act Adult Services Program, which can be  used to provide bus tokens or reimbursement for mileage to access training  opportunities.", "Another federal program that does target seniors\u2014Medicare, the federal  health financing program covering almost all persons aged 65 and older and  certain persons with disabilities\u2014was not included in our list of 15 key  programs because it funds only a very specific type of transportation  service for seniors. Medicare covers medically necessary ambulance  services when other means of transportation, such as a wheelchair van or a  taxicab, are inadvisable, given the beneficiary\u2019s medical condition at the  time. Medically necessary ambulance trips include both emergency care,  such as responses to 911 calls, and nonemergency care, such as transfers  from one hospital to another. Medicare covers nonemergency  transports\u2014both scheduled and nonscheduled\u2014if the beneficiary is bed-confined or meets other medical necessity criteria, such as requiring  oxygen on the way to the destination.", "Many programs and policies that address the mobility needs of persons  with disabilities also benefit seniors. For example, the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA) has resulted in changes to many  transportation-related facilities, including transit vehicles and bus stops,  that make transportation more accessible to seniors with disabilities as  well as others. Other federal ADA-related activities can also benefit seniors.  For example, the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division is  responsible for enforcing federal statutes, including the ADA, that prohibit  discrimination on the basis of race, sex, handicap, religion, and national  origin. In addition, Justice has published rules governing the design of  transportation facilities, such as bus stops, to make them accessible to  people with disabilities. Finally, the U.S. Architectural and Transportation  Barriers Compliance Board\u2014an independent entity within the federal  government devoted to accessibility for people with disabilities\u2014develops  and maintains accessibility standards for transit vehicles, provides  technical assistance and training on these standards, and ensures  compliance with accessibility standards for federally funded facilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Indicate That Some Types of Mobility Needs Are Not Being Met, but Information on the Extent of Unmet Needs Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["The data on the nature of mobility needs that we obtained from research  publications and interviews with federal officials, experts, and officials  from 16 local AAAs indicate that federally supported programs are not  meeting some of the mobility needs of transportation-disadvantaged seniors.

Although this information is useful in assessing the  satisfaction of seniors who receive transportation services, it does not  measure the extent of unmet needs. Officials from AOA and the Federal  Transit Administration currently are assessing the state of data on seniors\u2019  mobility needs to identify baseline data on needs and available resources.", "Similarly, few AAAs use, or plan to use, data collection methods that enable  them to determine the extent of seniors\u2019 unmet mobility needs\u2014that is,  information on both the extent of need in the community and the capacity  of services, including their own, to provide transportation to seniors to  meet those needs. AAAs are required to determine the extent of need for  supportive services (which could include transportation) provided through  HHS\u2019s Title III-B program and to evaluate how effectively resources are  used to meet such need. However, several AAAs we interviewed reported  that they do not collect this type of data at all. Of those AAAs reporting that  they do collect data on the extent of unmet needs, most collect data on the  number of seniors who called the AAA to request transportation services  that the agency was unable to provide (including data such as the number  of trip denials and the number of seniors on a waiting list). There are a  number of limitations to this type of data. For example, a few AAAs  reported that waiting list data were not reliable in measuring the unmet  needs of seniors because the data allowed multiple-counting of seniors  who are wait-listed by more than one transportation provider or who  periodically call for rides and are added to the waiting list each time they  call. In addition, AAAs reported that waiting list data were not entirely  representative of unmet needs because these data include information only  on seniors who call for service and not on seniors who do not call (because  no services are available, because they do not know what services are  available, because they are tired of being turned down, because they moved  to an assisted living facility since they had difficulty obtaining  transportation, or because of some other reason) but who may still need  rides. Furthermore, the waiting list data do not allow for calculating the  number of seniors who were referred to other transportation services and  were able to get rides through these other services. Only 2 of the 16 AAAs  (the Salt Lake County Aging Services and the Bear River Association of  Governments, both in Utah) have a method for determining the gap in  transportation service by calculating the difference between the number of  seniors who are in need of transportation and the number of seniors who  are receiving service through other providers, or through family and  friends.", "Finally, there is little information from national surveys and studies that  addresses the extent to which transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 needs  are being met; rather, those surveys and studies focus on the nature of  needs, as discussed in the previous section of this report. For example, one  report prepared by DOT\u2019s Bureau of Transportation Statistics analyzes 2002  data from the Transportation Availability and Use Survey on the travel  behavior of persons with disabilities, but the findings are not broken down  by age. Another Bureau of Transportation Statistics report analyzing the  same data source provides some insights on the types of travel problems  encountered by seniors with disabilities, but it does not provide data that  can be used to measure the extent of those seniors\u2019 transportation needs or  to determine whether those needs are being met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "There Are Several Barriers to Assessing the Extent of Unmet Need", "paragraphs": ["Senior mobility experts told us that there is no clear-cut definition of  mobility needs, making it difficult to determine the extent to which such  needs are being met. Although many of the experts we contacted  mentioned the distinction between life-sustaining and life-enhancing needs,  they did not provide a more concrete definition. Many of these experts also  said that they were not aware of an agreed-upon standard or benchmark for  assessing seniors\u2019 unmet mobility needs. One researcher said that the topic  of seniors\u2019 mobility needs is just beginning to be discussed in the literature,  so a standard has not yet been developed.", "In addition to the lack of consensus on definitions or measures of need,  there is also little guidance on assessing mobility needs. Although some of  the 15 key federal programs we identified require state or local agencies to  assess the need for services, federal agencies provide little guidance on  how to do this. As previously noted, HHS\u2019s Title III-B and Title VI  programs\u2014through which AOA provides grants to states and Native  American tribes for senior services\u2014require AAAs to prepare a plan that  includes an assessment of the needs of disadvantaged seniors, which could  include transportation needs. Furthermore, the Older Americans Act, as  amended, requires AOA to provide guidance to states on assessing needs,  specifically \u201cto design and implement [for program monitoring  purposes]\u2026procedures for collecting information on gaps in services  needed by older individuals\u201d and \u201cprocedures for the assessment of unmet  needs for services....\u201d Although AOA has developed general guidance for  Native American tribes on conducting needs assessments for its Title VI  program, the program guidance that the agency provides to states for its  Title III-B program does not include guidance on how to assess and  measure needs or on specific data collection methods. As a result of the  lack of guidance on assessing need, most of the AAAs that we interviewed  reported assessing seniors\u2019 unmet mobility needs using a range of data  collection methods that resulted in data not specific enough for planning  purposes, and not indicative of the precise extent to which seniors\u2019  mobility needs are being met. While some AAAs said they did not need  additional data, other AAAs we spoke with said that more precise  information on the extent of unmet need would be useful in designing  services and getting political support and funding for services, but some do  not have the staff, funds, or expertise to develop methodologies to do this.  They said that guidance from the federal government in this regard would  be very useful.", "Officials at AOA said that, in the past, they have not provided guidance to  state and local aging agencies on how to assess needs for the Title III-B  program because they received feedback that state and local aging  agencies had a more immediate desire for guidance on assessing the quality  of service and collecting information on client characteristics. To this end,  AOA is currently developing a plan for evaluating the various supportive  services, including transportation, provided through its Title III-B  programs. The evaluation effort will address the needs of states and  communities for supportive services and the extent to which the Title III-B  program is meeting the needs and preferences of the elderly for those  services. As part of the evaluation, AOA plans to address questions about  the role of AAAs in providing supportive services, how needs assessments  are performed by state and local entities, and how the results of those  assessments are used by states in implementing the Title III-B program. On  the basis of the results of our interviews with AAA representatives, the  AOA official responsible for the planned evaluation said that it would be  useful to obtain some additional information during the evaluation to  determine the need for services under the Title III-B program, including (1)  identifying how needs should be defined and measured; (2) determining the  range of methodologies that AAAs use for assessing seniors\u2019 need for  services, including transportation, and unmet needs; and (3) identifying the  kinds of guidance that AAAs want from AOA and states to help them  perform their required needs assessments. AOA plans to complete its  evaluation of this program by January 2006.", "Other federal program regulations also require or encourage local agencies  to assess need to be eligible for funding. For example, DOT\u2019s Capital and  Training Assistance Program for Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility (which  provides funds to bus operators to help make their services more  accessible to persons with disabilities) lists \u201cidentified need\u201d as one of the  criteria for selecting grantees, and HHS\u2019s Community Services Block Grant  Program (which provides funds for services to address the needs of  low-income individuals) requires grantees to assess need for services and  report this information to the state. However, these agencies do not provide  guidance for assessing need for most of these programs. DOT officials said  that they allow local applicants for the Capital and Training Assistance  Program for Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility to decide what measures to  use to demonstrate need, and the measures vary accordingly. For example,  some of these applicants have provided information on the number of trips  that were denied for lack of an accessible vehicle, while other applicants  demonstrate need on the basis of the number of trips provided using an  existing lift-equipped vehicle. For its Job Access and Reverse Commute  Program, DOT asks applicants to provide data on the percentage of  low-income persons in the area as well as on transportation gaps between  existing services and employment opportunities for these persons, and the  agency provides some guidance on how to identify such gaps. HHS  provides some guidance for assessing the need for services under the  Community Services Block Grant Programs, but the guidance is for  assessing a wide range of services, of which transportation is only one.", "Federal officials report that it is difficult to measure unmet mobility needs  largely because of difficulties in measuring the unmet needs of those  transportation-disadvantaged seniors who are not trying to access  transportation services (such as those who do not call for service because  they have given up trying to get transportation or are not aware of  services). Some AAA officials and federal officials said that collecting this  type of data is time-consuming and expensive. In addition, there may be  other difficulties in reaching these seniors. For example, they may have  difficulty hearing questions posed over the telephone, may be wary of  providing personal information, or may be reluctant to admit that they need  assistance or that they can no longer safely drive themselves to activities  they need or want to attend."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transportation Service Providers Implement Practices That Enhance Senior Mobility with Some Federal Support, but Implementation Difficulties Remain", "paragraphs": ["Transportation providers use a variety of practices\u2014which we have  grouped into three categories\u2014to enhance the mobility of  transportation-disadvantaged seniors and promote the cost-effective  delivery of transportation services. These include practices that (1)  improve service efficiency through increasing the use of technology and by  coordinating services with other providers in the community; (2) improve  customer service by providing training sessions for service staff and  seniors, using vehicles that can accommodate seniors\u2019 mobility challenges,  and increasing the level of service provided; and (3) leverage existing  resources by increasing volunteer involvement and forging financial  partnerships with public and private entities in the community. According  to the local service providers we interviewed, these practices, which were  implemented with some federal support, resulted in more senior-friendly  transportation services and more cost-effective service delivery. All 10 local  transportation service providers we interviewed indicated that they had  been able to use funds from 1 or more of the 15 key federal programs in  implementing practices that enhance senior mobility. The most commonly  used programs were DOT\u2019s Capital Assistance Program for Elderly Persons  and Persons with Disabilities (Section 5310) and HHS\u2019s Title III-B and  Medicaid Programs, followed by DOT\u2019s Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program (Section 5311), and HHS\u2019s Community Services Block Grant  Programs.

Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and other advanced  technologies can provide real-time information about where vehicles are  located, when they will arrive to pick up a senior, and how long the trip  may take. Two of the 10 local service providers we interviewed are using  advanced technology to improve their trip scheduling. For example,  Sweetwater Transportation Authority in Rock Spring, Wyoming, is using  GPS technology on board each bus, connecting the bus to software that  will automatically schedule rides and provide an accurate estimated time of  arrival to passengers. The Friendship Center, which offers  door-through-door transportation services in Conroe City, Texas, is  involved in the early stages of implementing a computerized dispatching  and mapping system that will allow same-day scheduling to transport  seniors to their destinations. In the past, all scheduling was done manually  and seniors often had to call 48 hours in advance to schedule a ride.  According to Friendship Center officials, the implementation of the  computerized mapping system will increase efficiency and coordination of  their transportation service, which will also improve the level of service  provided to seniors.", "Coordinating transportation services: According to the TCRP report and  our previous work, coordination of transportation services can improve the  overall efficiency of operations, increase the productivity of services,  reduce service costs, and increase mobility. Our previous work indicated  that the extent of coordination of transportation services varies. Several  service providers we interviewed have implemented a coordinated  transportation service, including Mountain Empire Older Citizens (MEOC),  which is located in central Virginia. MEOC recognized that coordination  was needed because each human service agency in the area was  transporting its own clients exclusively, while other vehicles from other  agencies were picking up passengers in the same area. Under its  coordination contract, MEOC leases vehicles from other specialized  transportation service providers and coordinates all aspects of transporting  their clients (including other transportation-disadvantaged groups, such as  people with developmental disabilities). As a result, MEOC has maximized  the efficient use of vehicle fleet and realized cost savings in service  delivery, according to an agency official. Another service provider, the  Friendship Center, coordinates its transportation services with medical  facility staff to schedule medical appointments for seniors. The dispatchers  at the center work directly with the medical providers to schedule medical  appointments for seniors when the center\u2019s transportation services are  available. In addition, the center\u2019s hours for transportation services reflect  those of the medical centers. By coordinating their services, the center  helps ensure that seniors do not encounter transportation scheduling  problems. Lastly, Medical Motor Service, which provides transportation  and brokerage services to seniors in Monroe County, New York,  coordinates with other nonprofit agencies to provide volunteers who serve  as \u201cshopping buddies\u201d to help seniors carry packages or assist them with  their groceries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements to Customer Service", "paragraphs": ["Providing training to staff and seniors: According to the TCRP report and  a brochure on innovative transit services for seniors developed by the  Beverly Foundation and the Community Transportation Association of  America (hereafter, Innovations Brochure), training for service  staff\u2014particularly drivers\u2014and for senior riders is important in improving  transportation services. The TCRP report states that staff training should  address customer service issues, such as the need for polite and courteous  interactions by drivers with passengers and the physical constraints  seniors encounter while using public transportation. The TCRP report also  indicates that customer service training should be part of an overall change  in organizational focus, from just operating vehicles to serving customers.  Several service providers we interviewed were implementing training to  improve customer service by helping seniors feel more comfortable while  being transported. For example, Altoona Metro Transportation, which  provides public transit service to the general public in central Blair County  in Pennsylvania, developed a driver-training sensitivity program through  which drivers receive specialized training to recognize the diverse needs of  seniors. In what is considered a \u201chands-on\u201d session, drivers wear special  glasses to distort their vision so that they can temporarily experience the  physical limitations that some seniors face while riding public  transportation. An Altoona Metro official also told us that drivers are  encouraged to socialize with senior passengers and foster relationships to  make seniors feel comfortable and welcomed. In addition to training for  staff, providers are also implementing travel-training programs to teach  seniors who are not accustomed to using transit services how to use public  transportation. One service provider, North County Lifeline, Inc. (a  curb-to-curb transit service located in the northern San Diego area),  developed a travel-training program for seniors to learn about public transit  and reduce any concerns they may have about personal safety when using  transit. The program includes instruction in how to problem-solve, map out  a trip, make transfers, and understand the rights and responsibilities they  have while riding public transportation.", "Using vehicles that can accommodate seniors\u2019 mobility challenges: Using  vehicles that accommodate the mobility challenges of seniors\u2014such as  purchasing low-floor buses, equipping vehicles with lifts, or modifying  vehicles to make them identifiable and visually appealing (by using buses  with distinctive colors to designate specific routes or with large  see-through windows)\u2014may help address some of the physical challenges  (such as difficulties boarding a bus or van) and emotional challenges (such  as concerns about boarding the wrong bus or personal safety) that seniors  may face while using public transportation. For example, the TCRP report  states that low-floor buses provide advantages over conventional buses  because they shorten the distance between the first step on the bus and the  curb (e.g., the first step on a conventional bus is approximately 9 to 12  inches above the curb, whereas the first step on the latest low-floor buses  is less than 3 inches above the curb). However, there may be constraints in  using such buses\u2014one service provider we interviewed found them  impractical for the provider\u2019s service area, which contains hilly terrain  and many narrow streets. The majority of service providers we interviewed  use lift-equipped vehicles to transport seniors who use wheelchairs.  Several of the service providers are also using vehicles that are easily  identifiable and visually appealing to further address concerns seniors may  have about using public transportation. For example, several of the service  providers we interviewed said that they transport seniors in vehicles that  are color-coded to designate specific routes or that have large, nontinted  windows to limit the confusion that seniors face while trying to determine  which bus to board, to provide a sense of personal security, and to  \u201cdemystify\u201d public transportation for seniors.", "Increasing level of service: According to the TCRP report, increasing  overall service levels is vital to meeting the mobility needs of a growing  senior population. Some of the local service providers we interviewed said  that the practices they implemented allowed them to improve their services  by expanding service hours for life-sustaining trips (as much as their  funding allows), accommodating all requests as they arise (even if that  means temporarily modifying a route), and expanding services to include  life-enhancing trips (e.g., field trips sponsored by senior centers and trips  to a therapeutic warm-water pool program). For example, a MEOC official  told us that the provider expanded its service from 8 hours to 12 hours per  day on weekdays to provide transportation for life-sustaining trips (e.g.,  medical appointments), and that the agency plans to modify an existing  route to provide service regardless of how little notice is given. MEOC\u2019s  computer scheduling system enables dispatchers to radio the nearest  driver and ask him or her to modify the current route to fit in an extra  pick-up or drop-off. In another example, Gold Country Telecare, a  nonprofit agency that provides accessible specialized transportation in  rural northern California, learned through interviews with others in the  local community involved in senior transportation that seniors were often  isolated on weekends, when transportation services were rarely available  for them. To address this need, the agency increased its service level by  implementing an all-day Sunday transportation service for seniors to get to  church or other activities, such as grocery shopping."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements to Leverage Available Funds", "paragraphs": ["Increasing volunteer involvement: According to the TCRP report and the  Innovations Brochure, volunteer involvement may lead to cost savings in  delivering transportation services to seniors by reducing the need for paid  staff. The local service providers we interviewed used volunteers in a  variety of ways. For example, Gold Country Telecare implemented a  volunteer driving program under which volunteers are reimbursed for  mileage expenses incurred in using their personal vehicles to transport  seniors to medical and health treatment facilities located in a nearby urban  center. According to a Gold Country Telecare official, this program allows  seniors to participate in health therapies or medical services not found in  their rural community. OATS, Inc., a transportation service provider in  Missouri, uses volunteers who act as dispatchers, taking calls in their  homes from people in the community who need trips. The volunteers  transfer requests to the driver, who then schedules the trips. The use of  volunteers allows OATS to provide more cost-effective and more frequent  service by avoiding the administrative expense of having an office in each  of the 87 counties it serves. Furthermore, according to an OATS official, the  value of the volunteer hours (including the in-kind allowance for the use of their personal telephones and space in their home) translates into  approximately $1.6 million in cost savings per year.", "Forging partnerships with private and public entities: The TCRP report  suggests forging financial partnerships with public and private entities in  the community to address funding concerns and to diversify funding  sources. Several of the local service providers we interviewed developed  private/public partnerships such as (1) contracts with private entities to  engage in revenue-enhancing activities, such as using the service providers\u2019  vehicles to transport other groups when the vehicles were not being used  for senior transportation or transporting seniors to specific locations, such  as shopping sites, or (2) joint agreements with human service agencies to  provide specialized services for clients who need additional assistance. For  example, the Friendship Center contracts with private entities to provide  shuttle services from employee parking to employment sites, from  overflow parking lots to special event venues, to community churches on  Sunday mornings, and other similar transportation services. According to  center officials, these additional contracts for shuttle services bring in  approximately $140,000 in additional annual revenue, which is being used  to provide additional senior transportation services and represents  approximately 15 percent of the center\u2019s annual budget for senior  transportation. Another local service provider that diversified its funding  sources, Medical Motor Service, developed a partnership with a regional  private supermarket to supplement its fund-raising efforts. Under this  arrangement, Medical Motor Service receives approximately $300,000 in  annual funding from the supermarket to transport seniors to and from the  grocery store. This sum represents 18 percent of the provider\u2019s annual  senior transportation budget. As a result of this arrangement, seniors  residing in 55 housing complexes have transportation for grocery shopping  or for renewing medical prescriptions at any of the 14 supermarkets  located in Monroe County. However, one trade-off in having an exclusive  partnership with one grocery store chain is that, unlike seniors (and  others) who can drive, seniors who rely on such a service do not have a  choice of where to shop. In that regard, Special Transit, a local service  provider in Boulder, Colorado, identified a need to diversify its funding  sources to reduce dependence on any one source of funds, helping to  ensure continuity of service for all of its clients, including seniors. To do so,  it hired an outreach coordinator to identify other service providers in the  community (such as senior day care programs, senior centers, and local  hospitals) that were interested in having Special Transit provide  transportation services. In addition, the coordinator was tasked with  identifying opportunities for generating private donations. Through its  partnerships, Special Transit reduced its dependence on public funding  (including federal and local government grants and matching funds) from  more than 80 percent of its total revenue sources in the mid-1980s to  approximately 65 percent in 2004. Presently, Special Transit\u2019s service  contracts and private donations account for approximately 30 percent of its  total revenues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Practices and Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["Table 3 provides examples of some of the practices and federal funding  sources used by the local service providers we interviewed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Local Practices Have Enhanced the Senior-Friendliness and Cost-effectiveness of Services", "paragraphs": ["The implementation of these practices contributed to the improvement of  senior transportation services by making them more senior-friendly,  according to the 10 local service providers we interviewed.

(See table 3  for the federal funding sources associated with each service provider.) We  found that DOT\u2019s Capital Assistance Program for Elderly Persons and  Persons with Disabilities (Section 5310) and HHS\u2019s Grants for Supportive  Services and Senior Centers (Title III-B) and Medicaid Programs are the  federal programs most often used by the 10 providers we interviewed,  followed by DOT\u2019s Nonurbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5311)  and HHS\u2019s Community Services Block Grant Programs.", "According to some of the service providers, the federal programs had both  a direct and an indirect role in providing technical assistance for the  implementation of practices to enhance transportation-disadvantaged  seniors\u2019 mobility. In some cases, federal programs provided direct technical  assistance (by providing information on how to apply for program funding  or how to implement the service or by providing contact information for  other resources) through program representatives or through the  program\u2019s Web site. Several providers stated that, as grantees, they  obtained technical assistance from DOT\u2019s Intelligent Transportation  Systems (ITS) program, which assigned consultants to their organizations  to provide assistance in selecting software and hardware and developing  requests for proposals. One service provider further added that he found  DOT\u2019s ITS program Web site to be useful in obtaining information on best  practices and on other technology-related resources. Another service  provider received technical assistance through both Federal Transit  Administration representatives and the state\u2019s transit association on how to  obtain funding through the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program. In  other cases, some providers stated that the federal government indirectly  provided guidance or technical assistance. For example, guidance on  implementing practices and marketing services to the senior community  was provided through federally funded professional organizations, such as  the Community Transportation Association of America and the National  Academy of Sciences\u2019 Transportation Research Board.", "Other service providers we interviewed told us that the federal programs  did not provide assistance (other than funding) or guidance on  implementing practices to enhance transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019  mobility, so they had to look to other state and regional transit agencies or  other local transportation service providers to provide guidance or  technical assistance. One service provider said that it researched and  sought out other mobility management programs and travel-training  programs to learn how to implement such programs, because this  information was not available from federal or state agencies. Several  providers told us that finding information on successful practices for  enhancing transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 mobility required  considerable staff time and other resources, and that a centralized  source\u2014particularly a Web-based source\u2014for such information would be  useful. Many of the providers suggested that providing such a Web site  would be an appropriate role for the federal government.

Although federal programs  provide financial support for practices that enhance senior mobility, an  expert in senior mobility and several service providers stated that receiving  federal funds entails burdensome reporting requirements. Often, the local  service providers receive funding from several federal programs with  different reporting requirements and therefore have to submit several  different reports calling for different data. One provider stated that  submitting all of the required documentation for DOT\u2019s Capital Assistance  Program for Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities (Section 5310)  and HHS\u2019 Grants for Supportive Services and Senior Centers (Title III-B)  Program necessitated the dedication of 720 administrative hours each year  (equivalent to over $10,000), costing the provider more in administrative  costs than the actual funding received through the federal programs.  Another service provider we interviewed said it has designated about 1,690  administrative hours annually to complying with the reporting  requirements of the Title III-B program, Medicaid, and DOT\u2019s Congestion  Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, including doing such  tasks as tracking the different data requested by each program, organizing  documents, and following up on required information. The provider  noted that the 1,690 hours (equivalent to about $60,000 in costs)  represented a significant portion (14 percent) of the total federal program  funding received under those programs. Federal officials have told us that  the Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility\u2014a federal body,  consisting of representatives from 10 federal agencies, including the  Departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services,  Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, that is charged with coordinating  transportation services provided by federal programs and promoting the  maximum feasible coordination at the state and local levels\u2014is examining  possible ways to streamline reporting requirements of the various federal  programs that fund transportation for disadvantaged populations. Council  officials said that a paper addressing this issue will be developed and  presented in 2004 or early 2005.", "Some of the local providers said that federal guidance on how to apply for  funding and comply with reporting procedures is limited. For example, one  service provider stated that it has not received technical guidance from  DOT that explains the funding process for the Urbanized Area Formula  Program (Section 5307). Instead, the provider contacted other local  nonprofit organizations to seek their technical assistance in understanding  the funding process, but the funds were delayed in the meantime. The  provider said that it contacted local DOT representatives but was unable to  determine the cause of the delay in funds. As a result, the provider said that  it had to convince its nonprofit board of directors to continue to provide  services without the promised federal funds so that seniors would still have  transportation services available.", "Lastly, several of the service providers perceive that program guidelines are  rigid and lack flexibility, although the federal officials we contacted  disagreed with the providers\u2019 interpretations. For example, one provider  stated that the program guidelines for DOT\u2019s Nonurbanized Area Formula  Program (Section 5311) are very rigid in that the funds may only be used for  transportation for the general public. The service provider stated that the  Section 5311 guidelines require it to track the type of passenger who  requests demand-response service and the trip destination. If a senior  requests transportation to a senior center or any other human service  program destination, the service provider told us it must find another  funding source (e.g., Title III-B) for that trip because Section 5311 funding  is designated for general rural transportation services and not specialized  services. However, a DOT official told us that rural transit providers  receiving Section 5311 assistance may transport a senior to a senior center  if the service is also made available to the general public."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experts and Stakeholders Suggested Strategies for Overcoming Mobility Obstacles", "paragraphs": ["Through a review of the literature and interviews with experts on senior  transportation and aging, representatives of pertinent professional  associations and advocacy groups, local officials, and transportation  service providers, we identified several obstacles to addressing  transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 mobility needs and potential  strategies that the federal government and other government levels, as  appropriate, can consider taking to better address those needs and  enhance the cost-effectiveness of the services delivered. We grouped these  obstacles and strategies around three themes: (1) planning for alternatives  to driving as seniors age to extend the lifespan of their mobility, (2)  accommodating seniors\u2019 varied mobility needs, and (3) leveraging federal  and other government funding to better use limited resources. The  suggested strategies for addressing obstacles to senior mobility involve  certain trade-offs, and these obstacles, strategies, and trade-offs are  discussed in each of the following sections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the senior population doubles over the next 25 years, it will become  increasingly important to target resources to the areas of greatest need and  to know whether current methods and programs are working to reduce  transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 unmet needs and improve their  mobility and access to services. The 655 local area agencies on aging that  are required to gather data to assess seniors\u2019 needs for services could serve  as valuable sources of information for federal agencies to use in program  planning, evaluation, and resource allocation. However, without guidance  from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration on  Aging on assessing needs for services, including transportation, these local  agencies are using a variety of methods\u2014some less comprehensive than  others\u2014to assess seniors\u2019 mobility needs. As a result, it is not possible to  determine whether current programs are reducing unmet needs and  improving transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019 mobility and access to  services. The Administration on Aging is now embarking on a  comprehensive assessment of seniors\u2019 needs for services that affords a  good opportunity for the administration to help state and local agencies  conduct and use the results of improved needs assessments.", "The experiences of other federal agencies, such as the Department of  Transportation, that have developed guidance for assessing or  demonstrating needs for some of the programs they administer, such as the  Job Access and Reverse Commute Program, could be useful in designing  guidance for area agencies on aging to assess needs. The Coordinating  Council on Access and Mobility is uniquely positioned to provide a forum  for such a coordinated effort because all of the federal agencies that  administer the key programs we identified are members, and many of these  agencies are involved in the council\u2019s efforts to improve mobility for all  transportation-disadvantaged populations. As the agency designated by the  Older Americans Act as the lead for gathering information on seniors\u2019  needs for services, and as one of the original members of the council, the  Administration on Aging is well-situated to lead a coordinated effort to  design guidance for assessing seniors\u2019 needs.", "Not having information on alternatives to driving is an obstacle to both  seniors and service providers. Without such information, seniors do not  plan for a time when they can no longer drive, and providers waste time  and money \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d and become frustrated with federal  programs. Some federal efforts, such as the community awareness pilot  project implemented by the Department of Transportation\u2019s National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration, have already begun to address this  obstacle, but the expected growth in the senior population will require  broader efforts. As service providers and representatives from the  advocacy groups and professional associations we interviewed said, an  important role for the federal government would be to provide a central  forum for comprehensive information on transportation services, perhaps  through a centralized Web site that could enhance seniors\u2019 awareness of  available services and improve providers\u2019 ability to serve them. Such a Web  site would also be useful for publicizing activities the various federal  agencies are undertaking to improve transportation-disadvantaged seniors\u2019  mobility. Although the Administration on Aging (the federal focal point and  advocacy agency for seniors) has a Web site with information on  transportation services, most of this information is aimed at service  providers rather than at seniors or their caregivers. Furthermore, many of  the service providers and representatives from advocacy groups and  professional organizations we interviewed did not seem to be aware of the  presence of such information on the administration\u2019s Web site.

We obtained statistics  presented in the introduction and background of this report about seniors  and their mobility from an article published in the American Journal of  Public Health, the 2000 Census, the Aging States Project, and the Eldercare  Locator Service; because this information is included as background only,  we did not assess its reliability.", "To identify federal programs that address transportation-disadvantaged  seniors\u2019 mobility issues, we asked experts who had participated in a senior  mobility forum we moderated in July 2003 to identify those federal  programs that they consider key for providing transportation services to  seniors who cannot drive or have limited their driving. We verified the  resulting list of 15 programs with federal program officials. To assess the  extent to which the 15 federal programs address each of the five A\u2019s of  senior-friendly transportation (as identified by the Beverly Foundation), we  reviewed program legislation and guidance and interviewed federal  officials and senior mobility experts.

In addition,  we asked experts\u2014including academics conducting research in the fields  of aging, disability, and transportation; advocacy policy analysts  knowledgeable about senior transportation; and federal officials  responsible for senior transportation programs\u2014to identify sources of data  and relevant studies. We included in our review only nationwide surveys or  focus groups (1) that were conducted in multiple states or types of  communities, (2) that were conducted after 1995, (3) that had variables that  analyzed transportation behavior of individuals aged 65 and older, and (4)  that were reported in published or soon-to-be-published journals or  reports. Also, we identified federal agency performance indicators and  other data collected by federal agencies that have key transportation  programs for seniors. For the performance indicators and data sources we  identified, we assessed the extent to which they provided meaningful  information about the extent to which seniors\u2019 mobility needs are being  met. To assess the reliability of research publications, we reviewed the  studies\u2019 overall designs and methodologies, including the selection  processes for any participants, response rates, and measures used.

To select the nonprobability sample of 15 AAAs that we  interviewed, we asked the 42 state units on aging that have AAAs in their  states (8 states\u2014Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, New Hampshire, North  Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Wyoming\u2014and the District of  Columbia do not have AAAs and instead the state unit on aging is the single  planning and service area under the Older Americans Act) to identify 1  urban, 1 rural, and 1 suburban AAA in their state, and for each, to identify  the method by which the AAA collects data on seniors\u2019 unmet mobility  needs. Of the 42 states that have AAAs, 30 responded to our request. From  these responses, we selected AAAs to ensure geographic dispersion (West,  South, Northeast, and Midwest); representation of AAAs with different  population density (urban, rural, and suburban); representation of different  data collection methods (survey, focus group, census, or other);  representation of input from community stakeholders (service providers,  caregivers, seniors, and professionals); and representation of states with  higher-than-average and lower-than-average percentages of seniors in their  population. In addition to selecting 3 AAAs from each of 4 states\u20141 in the  West, 1 in the South, 1 in the Midwest, and 1 in the Northeast\u2014we also  selected 3 AAAs in New York State because it had recently completed an  audit of transportation for seniors that included an evaluation of AAAs\u2019  procedures for conducting needs assessments. We also interviewed the  state unit on aging from 1 of the 8 states that do not have AAAs (South  Dakota). Using a semistructured interview, we asked senior-level  management and staff that had responsibilities for assessing seniors\u2019 unmet  mobility needs at each of the AAAs (and 1 state unit on aging) to provide  information on transportation services offered and restrictions to service;  on their processes for collecting data on seniors\u2019 unmet mobility needs,  including information about how they ensure the reliability of the data they  collect and their methodology for reporting and maintaining the data; on  their perspectives on the extent to which seniors\u2019 mobility needs are being  met; and on the additional data that should be collected, if any. To assess  the reliability of the data obtained from AAAs, we reviewed the data for  obvious errors in accuracy and completeness and interviewed agency  officials knowledgeable about the data. Specifically, we asked whether any  tests were conducted to ensure that data were entered accurately and  whether the quality of the collected data had been reviewed.
