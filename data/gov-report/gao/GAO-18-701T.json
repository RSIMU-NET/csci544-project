For example, EOIR did not have efficient practices for hiring immigration judges. EOIR data showed that on average from February 2014 through August 2016, EOIR took more than 21 months to hire a judge. GAO also found that EOIR was not aware of the factors most affecting the length of its hiring process. GAO recommended that EOIR assess its hiring process to identify efficiency opportunities. As of January 2018, EOIR had made progress in increasing its number of judges but remained below its fiscal year 2017 authorized level. To better ensure that it accurately and completely identifies opportunities for efficiency, EOIR needs to assess its hiring process.", "In November 2014, GAO reported that the number of aliens who participated in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program increased from 32,065 in fiscal year 2011 to 40,864 in fiscal year 2013.

Each  year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiates hundreds of  thousands of cases with the U.S. immigration court system to decide  whether respondents\u2014foreign nationals charged on statutory grounds of  inadmissibility or deportability\u2014are removable as charged; and, if so,  should be ordered removed from the United States or granted any  requested relief or protection from removal and permitted to lawfully  remain in the country. Within DHS, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) operated on a budget of nearly $3 billion in fiscal year  2017 to manage the U.S. immigration detention system, which houses  foreign nationals, including families, whose immigration cases are  pending or who have been ordered removed from the country.", "With regards to the immigration court system, the Department of Justice\u2019s  (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) is responsible for  conducting immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and  administrative hearings to fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly administer  and interpret U.S. immigration laws and regulations. Within EOIR,  immigration judges at 58 immigration courts located nationwide preside  over removal proceedings for respondents detained by ICE or released  pending the outcome of their proceedings, to determine their removability  and eligibility for any relief being sought. In addition to removal  proceedings, immigration judges also conduct certain other types of  hearings, such as to review negative credible fear determinations and ICE  custody and bond decisions, as well as make decisions on motions, such  as motions to reopen cases or reconsider prior decisions. Members of  EOIR\u2019s Board of Immigration Appeals hear and issue decisions regarding  appeals of immigration judges\u2019 decisions and certain DHS decisions.", "With regards to the ATD program, ICE is responsible for the oversight of  foreign nationals who, if not detained in a detention facility, were released  into the community. In November 2014, we reported that ICE uses one or  more release options when it determines that a foreign national is not to  be detained in ICE\u2019s custody\u2014including bond, order of recognizance,  order of supervision, parole, or on condition of participation in the ATD  program. ICE implemented the ATD program in 2004 to be a cost- effective alternative to detention that uses case management and  electronic monitoring to ensure adult foreign nationals released into the  community comply with their release conditions\u2014including requirements  to appear at immigration court hearings\u2014and comply with final orders of  removal from the United States.", "The ATD program seeks to provide an enhanced monitoring option for  those foreign nationals for whom ICE, or an immigration judge, has  determined that detention is neither mandated nor appropriate, yet may  need a higher level of supervision than that provided by the less  restrictive release conditions, such as being released on bond. Foreign  nationals enrolled in the ATD program may be subject to various types of  supervision, including office visits, unscheduled home visits, and  electronic monitoring\u2014Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment or a  telephonic reporting system. ICE generally makes all decisions about the  appropriate level of supervision and type of technology with which a  foreign national should be monitored.

This statement is based  on two reports and one testimony that we issued between November  2014 and April 2018, as well as actions agencies have taken, as of  September 2018, to address our recommendations from the reports. To  perform the work for our previous reports and testimony on the  immigration courts, we analyzed data on immigration case receipts and  completions from EOIR\u2019s case management system for fiscal years 2006  through 2015; examined documentation, such as contracts for workforce  planning services; and interviewed EOIR and DHS officials from  headquarters and six immigration courts. To perform the work for our  previous report on ATD, we reviewed agency documents, analyzed ATD  program data from fiscal years 2011 through 2013, and interviewed ICE  officials responsible for the ATD program. More detailed information  about our scope and methodology can be found in our reports and  testimony. To determine actions the agencies have taken to address  recommendations we made in these reports as of September 2018, we  collected documentation and testimony from ICE and EOIR officials.", "The work upon which this testimony is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For the purpose of our analysis, the immigration courts\u2019  annual caseload was comprised of three parts: (1) the number of new  cases filed by DHS; (2) the number of other case receipts resulting from  remands from the Board of Immigration Appeals and motions to reopen  cases, reconsider prior decisions, or recalendar proceedings; and (3) the  case backlog\u2014the number of cases pending from previous years that  remain open at the start of a new fiscal year. During this 10-year period,  the immigration courts\u2019 overall annual caseload grew from approximately  517,000 cases in fiscal year 2006 to about 747,000 cases in fiscal year  2015, as shown in figure 1.", "We further reported in June 2017 that, according to our analysis, total  case receipts remained about the same in fiscal years 2006 and 2015 but  fluctuated over the 10-year period, with new case receipts generally  decreasing and other case receipts generally increasing. Over the same  period, EOIR\u2019s case backlog more than doubled. Specifically, immigration  courts had a backlog of about 212,000 cases pending at the start of fiscal  year 2006 and the median pending time for those cases was 198 days.  By the beginning of fiscal year 2009, the case backlog declined slightly to  208,000 cases. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the case backlog  grew an average of 38,000 cases per year. At the start of fiscal year  2015, immigration courts had a backlog of about 437,000 cases pending  and the median pending time for those cases was 404 days.", "The increase in the immigration court case backlog occurred as  immigration courts completed fewer cases annually. In particular, the  number of immigration court cases completed annually declined by 31  percent from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2015\u2014from about 287,000  cases completed in fiscal year 2006 to about 199,000 completed in 2015.  According to our analysis, while the number of cases completed annually  declined, the number of immigration judges increased between fiscal year  2006 and fiscal year 2015. This resulted in a lower number of case  completions per immigration judge at the end of the 10-year period.", "Additionally, we reported in June 2017 that initial immigration court case  completion time increased more than fivefold between fiscal year 2006  and fiscal year 2015. Overall, the median initial completion time for  cases increased from 43 days in fiscal year 2006 to 286 days in fiscal  year 2015. However, case completion times varied by case type and  detention status. For example, the median number of days to complete a  removal case, which comprised 97 percent of EOIR\u2019s caseload for this  time period, increased by 700 percent from 42 days in fiscal year 2006 to  336 days in fiscal year 2015. However, the median length of time it took  to complete a credible fear case, which comprised less than 1 percent of  EOIR\u2019s caseload during this period, took 5 days to complete in fiscal year  2006 as well as in fiscal year 2015. Initial case completion times for both  detained and non-detained respondents more than quadrupled from fiscal  year 2006 through fiscal year 2015. The median case completion time  for non-detained cases, which comprised 79 percent of EOIR\u2019s caseload  from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2015, grew more than fivefold from 96  days to 535 days during this period. Similarly, the median number of days  to complete a detained case, which judges are to prioritize on their  dockets, quadrupled over the 10-year period, increasing from 7 days in  fiscal year 2006 to 28 days in fiscal year 2015.", "EOIR officials, immigration court staff, DHS attorneys, and other experts  and stakeholders we interviewed provided various potential reasons why  the case backlog may have increased and case completion times slowed  in recent years. These reasons included: a lack of court personnel, such as immigration judges, legal clerks,  and other support staff;  insufficient funding to appropriately staff the immigration courts; a surge in new unaccompanied children cases, beginning in 2014,  which may take longer to adjudicate than other types of cases;   frequent use of continuances\u2014temporary case adjournments until  a different day or time\u2014by immigration judges; and   issues with the availability and quality of foreign language  translation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EOIR Has Initiated Actions to Improve Its Management of the Immigration Courts, but Has Faced Long-Standing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["We also reported in June 2017 that EOIR has faced long-standing  management and operational challenges. In particular, we identified  challenges related to EOIR\u2019s workforce planning, hiring, and technology  utilization, among other things. We recommended actions to improve  EOIR\u2019s management in these areas. EOIR generally concurred and has  initiated actions to address our recommendations. However, EOIR needs  to take additional steps to fully implement our recommendations to help  strengthen the agency\u2019s management and reduce the case backlog.", "Workforce planning. In June 2017, we reported that EOIR estimated  staffing needs using an informal approach that did not account for long- term staffing needs, reflect EOIR\u2019s performance goals, or account for  differences in the complexity of court cases. For example, in developing  its staffing estimate, EOIR did not calculate staffing needs beyond the  next fiscal year or take into account resources needed to achieve the  agency\u2019s case completion goals, which establish target time frames in  which immigration judges are to complete a specific percentage of certain  types of cases. Furthermore, we found that, according to EOIR data,  approximately 39 percent of all immigration judges were eligible to retire  as of June 2017, but EOIR had not systematically accounted for these  impending retirements in its staffing estimate.", "At the time of our review, EOIR had begun to take steps to account for  long-term staffing needs, such as by initiating a workforce planning report  and a study on the time it takes court staff to complete key activities.  However, we found that these efforts did not align with key principles of  strategic workforce planning that would help EOIR better address current  and future staffing needs. EOIR officials also stated that the agency had  begun to develop a strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2023 that  could address its human capital needs. We recommended that EOIR  develop and implement a strategic workforce plan that addresses key  principles of strategic workforce planning.", "EOIR agreed with our recommendation. In February 2018, EOIR officials  told us that they had established a committee and working group to  examine the agency\u2019s workforce needs and would include workforce  planning as a key component in EOIR\u2019s forthcoming strategic plan.  Specifically, EOIR officials stated that the agency had established the  Immigration Court Staffing Committee in April 2017 to examine how to  best leverage its existing judicial and court staff workload model to  address its short- and long-term staffing needs, assess the critical skills  and competencies needed to achieve future programmatic results, and  develop strategies to address human capital gaps, among other things. In  February 2018, EOIR officials stated that the agency replaced this  committee, which had completed its work, with a smaller working group of  human resource employees charged with addressing the agency\u2019s  strategic workforce planning. These are positive steps, but to fully  address our recommendation, EOIR needs to continue to develop, and  then implement a strategic workforce plan that: (1) addresses the  agency\u2019s short- and long-term staffing needs; (2) identifies the critical  skills and competencies needed to achieve future programmatic results;  and (3) includes strategies to address human capital gaps. Once this  strategic workforce plan is completed, EOIR needs to monitor and  evaluate the agency\u2019s progress toward its human capital goals.", "Hiring. Additionally, in our June 2017 report, we found that EOIR did not  have efficient practices for hiring new immigration judges, which has  contributed to immigration judges being staffed below authorized levels  and to staffing shortfalls. For example, in fiscal year 2016, EOIR received  an appropriation supporting 374 immigration judge positions but had 289  judges on board at the end of the fiscal year. EOIR officials attributed  these gaps to delays in the hiring process. Our analysis of EOIR hiring  data supported their conclusion. Specifically, we found that from February  2014 through August 2016, EOIR took an average of 647 days to hire an  immigration judge\u2014more than 21 months. As a result, we recommended  that EOIR (1) assess the immigration judge hiring process to identify  opportunities for efficiency; (2) use the assessment results to develop a  hiring strategy that targets short- and long-term human capital needs; and  (3) implement any corrective actions related to the hiring process  resulting from this assessment.", "In response to our report, EOIR stated that it concurred with our  recommendation and was implementing a new hiring plan as announced  by the Attorney General in April 2017 intended to streamline hiring.  Among other things, EOIR stated that the new hiring plan sets clear  deadlines for assessing applicants moving through different stages of the  process and for making decisions on advancing applicants to the next  stage, and allows for temporary appointments for selected judges  pending full background investigations. In February 2018, EOIR indicated  to us that it had begun to use the process outlined in its hiring plan to fill  judge vacancies. The Attorney General also announced in April 2017 that  the agency would commit to hire an additional 50 judges in 2018 and 75  additional judges in 2019. In January 2018, EOIR officials told us that the  agency had a total of 330 immigration judges, an increase of 41 judges  since September 2016. However, EOIR remained below its fiscal year  2017 authorized level of 384 immigration judges based on funding  provided in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Additionally, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2018 provided funding for EOIR to hire at least 100  additional immigration judge teams, including judges and supporting staff,  with a goal of fielding 484 immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019.", "In September 2018, EOIR reported it had a total of 351 immigration  judges and was continuing to hire additional judges.", "Hiring additional judges is a positive step; however, EOIR has not  assessed its hiring process to identify opportunities for efficiency, and we  found in our June 2017 report that EOIR was not aware of the factors  most affecting its hiring process. For example, we reported that EOIR  officials attributed the length of the hiring process to delays in the Federal  Bureau of Investigation background check process, which is largely  outside of EOIR\u2019s control. However, our analysis found that while  background checks accounted for an average of 41 days from fiscal year  2015 through August 2016, other processes within EOIR\u2019s control  accounted for a greater share of the total hiring time. For example, for the  same period our analysis found that an average of 135 days elapsed  between the date EOIR posted a vacancy announcement and the date  EOIR officials began working to fill the vacancy. By assessing its hiring  process, EOIR could better ensure that it is accurately and completely  identifying opportunities for efficiency. To fully address our  recommendation, EOIR will need to continue to improve its hiring process  by (1) assessing the prior hiring process to identify opportunities for  efficiency; (2) developing a hiring strategy targeting short- and long-term  human capital needs; and (3) implementing corrective actions in response  to the results of its assessment of the hiring process.", "Technology utilization. In June 2017 we also reported on EOIR\u2019s  technology utilization, including the agency\u2019s oversight of the ongoing  development of a comprehensive electronic-filing (e-filing) capability\u2014a  means of transmitting documents and other information to immigration  courts through an electronic medium, rather than on paper. EOIR  identified the implementation of an e-filing system as a goal in 2001, but  had not, as of September 2018, fully implemented this system. In 2001,  EOIR issued an executive staff briefing for an e-filing system that stated  that only through a fully electronic case management and filing system  would the agency be able to accomplish its goals. This briefing also cited  several benefits of an e-filing system, including, among other things,  reducing the data entry, filing, and other administrative tasks associated  with processing paper case files; and providing the ability to file court  documents from private home and office computers.", "As we reported in June 2017, EOIR initiated a comprehensive e-filing  effort in 2016\u2014the EOIR Court and Appeals System (ECAS)\u2014for which  EOIR had documented policies and procedures governing how its primary  ECAS oversight body\u2014the ECAS Executive Committee\u2014would oversee  ECAS through the development of a proposed ECAS solution. However,  we found that EOIR had not yet designated an entity to oversee ECAS  after selection of a proposed solution during critical stages of its  development and implementation. We recommended that in order to help  ensure EOIR meets its cost and schedule expectations for ECAS, the  agency identify and establish the appropriate entity to oversee ECAS  through full implementation. EOIR concurred and stated that it had  selected and convened the EOIR Investment Review Board to serve as  the ECAS oversight body with the EOIR Office of Information Technology  directly responsible for the management of the ECAS program.", "EOIR officials told us in February 2018 that the board convened in  October 2017 and January 2018 to discuss, among other things, the  ECAS program. However, as we reported in June 2017, EOIR officials  previously told us that the EOIR Investment Review Board was never  intended to oversee ECAS implementation due to the detailed nature of  this system\u2019s implementation. As of September 2018, EOIR has not  demonstrated its selection of, or how the EOIR Investment Review Board  is to serve as the oversight body for ECAS. Additionally, we  recommended in June 2017 EOIR develop and implement a plan that is  consistent with best practices for overseeing ECAS to better position the  agency to identify and address any risks and implement ECAS in  accordance with its cost, schedule, and operational expectations. As of  September 2018, EOIR has not indicated that it has developed such a  plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATD Participation Increased and Costs Less than Detention; ICE Established Program Performance Measures Participation in the ATD Program Increased and Average Daily Cost of the Program Was Lower than the Average Daily Cost of Detention", "paragraphs": ["In November 2014 we reported that the number of foreign nationals who  participated in the ATD program increased from 32,065 in fiscal year  2011 to 40,864 in fiscal year 2013 in part because of increases in either  enrollments or the average length of time foreign nationals spent in one of  the program\u2019s components. For example, during this time period, the  number of foreign nationals enrolled in the component of the program that  was run by a contractor who maintained in-person contact with the foreign  national and monitored the foreign national with either GPS equipment or  a telephonic reporting system, increased by 60 percent. In addition, the  average length of time foreign nationals spent in the other component of  the program, which offered a lower level of supervision at a lower contract  cost but still involved ICE monitoring of foreign nationals using either  telephonic reporting or GPS equipment provided by a contractor,  increased by 80 percent\u2014from about 10 months to about 18 months. ICE  officials stated that how long a foreign national is in the ATD program  before receiving a final decision on his or her immigration proceedings  depends on how quickly EOIR can process immigration cases.", "We also found in our November 2014 report that the average daily cost of  the ATD program was $10.55 in fiscal year 2013, while the average daily  cost of detention was $158. While our analyses showed that the  average daily cost of the ATD program was significantly less than the  average daily cost of detention, the length of immigration proceedings  affected the cost-effectiveness of the ATD program to varying extents  under different scenarios. As previously discussed, immigration judges  are to prioritize detained cases, and our June 2017 report found that  EOIR data showed that median case completion times for non-detained  cases were greater than for detained cases. Accordingly, the length of  immigration proceedings for foreign nationals in detention may be shorter  than those in the ATD program.", "Specifically, in our November 2014 report, we conducted two analyses to  estimate when the cost of keeping foreign nationals in the ATD program  would have surpassed the cost of detaining a foreign national in a facility.  Under our first analysis, we considered the average costs of ATD and  detention and the average length of time foreign nationals in detention  spent awaiting an immigration judge\u2019s final decision. We found that the  ATD program would have surpassed the cost of detention after a foreign  national was in the program for 1,229 days in fiscal year 2013\u2014 significantly longer than the average length of time foreign nationals spent  in the ATD program in that year (383 days). In our second analysis, we  considered the average costs of ATD and detention and the average  length of time foreign nationals spent in detention\u2014regardless of whether  they had received a final decision from an immigration judge\u2014since some  foreign nationals may not be in immigration proceedings or may not have  reached their final hearing before ICE released them from detention.  ICE reported that the average length of time that a foreign national was in  detention in fiscal year 2013 was 29 days. Using this average, we  calculated the average length of time foreign nationals could have stayed  in the ATD program before they surpassed the cost of detention would  have been 435 days in fiscal year 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICE Established ATD Performance Measures, and Took Actions to Ensure the Measures Monitored All Foreign Nationals Enrolled in the Program", "paragraphs": ["We found in our November 2014 report that ICE established two program  performance measures to assess the ATD program\u2019s effectiveness in (1)  ensuring foreign national compliance with court appearance requirements  and (2) ensuring removals from the United States, but limitations in data  collection hindered ICE\u2019s ability to assess overall program performance.", "Compliance with court appearances. For the component of the ATD  program managed by the contractor, data collected by the ATD contractor  from fiscal years 2011 through 2013 showed that over 99 percent of  foreign nationals with a scheduled court hearing appeared at their  scheduled court hearings while participating in the ATD program. The  court appearance rate dropped slightly to over 95 percent of foreign  nationals with a scheduled final hearing appearing at their hearing.  However, we reported that ICE did not collect similar court compliance  data for foreign nationals in the component of the ATD program that ICE  was responsible for managing\u2014which accounted for 39 percent of the  overall ATD program in fiscal year 2013. As a result, we recommended  that ICE collect and report data on foreign national compliance with court  appearance requirements for participants in this component of the ATD  program.", "As of June 2017, ICE reported that the ATD contractor was collecting  data on foreign nationals\u2019 court appearance compliance for foreign  nationals in both components of the ATD program, and at that time, was  collecting data for approximately 88 percent of foreign nationals that were  awaiting a hearing. ICE officials stated that they did not expect that 100  percent of foreign nationals in the ATD program would be tracked for  court appearance compliance by the contractor because there may be  instances where ICE has chosen to monitor a foreign national directly,  rather than have the contractor track a foreign national\u2019s compliance with  court appearance requirements. Officials stated that ICE officers may  decide to monitor a foreign national directly because they determined that  it is in the government\u2019s best interest, or it was fiscally responsible when a  foreign national\u2019s court date was far in the future and court tracking  conducted by the contractor would be costly. In July 2017, ICE reported  that they assessed whether ICE officers that directly monitor foreign  nationals in the ATD program had reliable data to determine court  appearance compliance and found no practical or appropriate way to  obtain such data without devoting a significant amount of ICE\u2019s limited  resources. Although ICE is not collecting court appearance compliance  data for all foreign nationals in both components of the ATD program, as  of July 2017, it has met the intent of our recommendation by collecting  and reporting on all available data on the majority of foreign nationals in  both components of the ATD program.", "Removals from the United States. For this program performance  measure, a removal is attributed to the ATD program if the foreign  national (1) was enrolled in ATD for at least 1 day, and (2) was removed  or had departed voluntarily from the United States in the same fiscal year,  regardless of whether the foreign national was enrolled in ATD at the time  the foreign national left the country. The ATD program met its goal for  removals in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. For example, in fiscal year  2013, ICE reported 2,901 removals of foreign nationals in the ATD  program\u2014surpassing its goal of 2,899 removals.", "ATD program performance measures provide limited information about  the foreign nationals who are terminated from the ATD program prior to  receiving the final disposition of their immigration proceedings, or who  were removed or voluntarily departed from the country. Specifically, ICE  counts a foreign national who was terminated from the program and was  subsequently removed from the United States toward the ATD removal  performance measure as long as the foreign national was in the program  during the same fiscal year he or she was removed from the country.  However, foreign nationals who were terminated from the program do not  count toward court appearance rates if they subsequently do not appear  for court. ICE officials reported that it would be challenging to determine a  foreign national\u2019s compliance with the terms of his or her release after  termination from the ATD program given insufficient resources and the  size of the nondetained foreign national population. In accordance with  ICE guidance, staff resources are instead directed toward apprehending  and removing foreign nationals from the United States who are  considered enforcement and removal priorities.", "Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member McCaskill, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
