On the journey to the United States, many UAC have traveled thousands of miles under dangerous conditions.", "The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 included a provision for GAO to, among other things, review how DHS cares for UAC. This report examines, among other things, the extent to which DHS has developed policies and procedures to (1) screen all UAC as required and (2) care for all UAC as required. GAO reviewed TVPRA and other legal requirements, DHS policies for screening and caring for UAC, fiscal year 2009 through 2014 apprehension data on UAC, and 2014 Border Patrol UAC care data. GAO also randomly sampled and analyzed case files of Mexican UAC whom Border Patrol apprehended in fiscal year 2014. GAO interviewed DHS and HHS officials in Washington, D.C., and at Border Patrol and OFO facilities in Arizona, California, and Texas selected on the basis of UAC apprehension data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued policies and procedures to evaluate, or screen, unaccompanied alien children (UAC)\u2014those under 18 years old with no lawful immigration status and no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody\u2014as required by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA). However, CBP's Border Patrol agents and Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers who screen UAC have not consistently applied the required screening criteria or documented the rationales for decisions resulting from screening. Specifically, under TVPRA, DHS is to transfer UAC to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but may allow UAC from Canada and Mexico to return to their home countries, that is, to be repatriated, if DHS determines that UAC (1) are not victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons, (2) are not at risk of trafficking upon return, (3) do not have a fear of returning due to a credible fear of persecution, and (4) are able to make an independent decision about returning. GAO found that agents made inconsistent screening decisions, had varying levels of awareness about how they were to assess certain screening criteria, and did not consistently document the rationales for their decisions. For example, CBP policy states that UAC under age 14 are presumed generally unable to make an independent decision, but GAO's analysis of CBP data and a random sample of case files from fiscal year 2014 found that CBP repatriated about 93 percent of Mexican UAC under age 14 from fiscal years 2009 through 2014 without documenting the basis for decisions. Providing guidance on how CBP agents and officers are to assess against UAC screening criteria could better position CBP to meet legal screening requirements, and ensuring that agents document the rationales for decisions would better position CBP to review the appropriateness of these decisions.", "DHS has policies in place to implement UAC care requirements, such as providing meals, and GAO's observations and interviews at 15 CBP facilities indicate that CBP generally provided care consistent with these policies at the time of GAO's visits. However, DHS does not collect complete and reliable data on care provided to UAC or the length of time UAC are in DHS custody. GAO analyzed available data on care provided to nearly 56,000 UAC apprehended by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2014 and found that agents documented 14 of 20 possible care actions for fewer than half of the UAC (the remaining 6 actions were documented for more than 50 percent of the UAC). Also, OFO has a database to record UAC care, but officers at most ports of entry do not do so. Developing and implementing processes to help ensure agents and officers record UAC care actions would provide greater assurance that DHS is meeting its care and custody requirements. Further, the interagency process to refer and transfer UAC from DHS to HHS is inefficient and vulnerable to errors because it relies on e-mails and manual data entry, and documented standard procedures, including defined roles and responsibilities, do not exist. DHS and HHS have experienced errors, such as assigning a child to two shelters at once, and holding an empty bed for 14 days at a shelter while HHS officials had placed the child elsewhere. Jointly developing a documented interagency process with defined roles and responsibilities could better position DHS and HHS to have a more efficient and effective process to refer, transfer, and place UAC in shelters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS, among other things, provide guidance on how agents and officers are to apply UAC screening criteria, ensure that screening decisions are documented, develop processes to record reliable data on UAC care, and document the interagency process to transfer UAC from DHS to HHS.

In fiscal year 2014, in  particular, DHS apprehended more than four times the number of UAC  (about 73,700) than in fiscal year 2011 (about 17,100). On the journey to  the United States, many UAC have traveled hundreds or thousands of  miles under dangerous conditions, such as atop trains or on foot through  deserts. In addition, during the journey, UAC are vulnerable to sexual  exploitation, human trafficking, and other crimes. For example, the  nongovernmental organization Appleseed reported in 2011 that along the  travel route, the possibility of UAC abuse\u2014being robbed, assaulted, or   At the height of the increase  sexually violated\u2014is real and ever-present.in UAC apprehensions during spring and summer 2014, the White House  directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a unified,  interagency response, led by DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA), to provide humanitarian services to UAC, including  housing, care, medical treatment, and transportation.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 delegated the apprehension,  detention, transfer, and repatriation of UAC to DHS.

ICE\u2019s Office of  Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is generally responsible for  transferring UAC, as appropriate, to the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), or repatriating UAC to their countries of nationality or last  habitual residence. HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) works  with DHS to place UAC in shelters, takes custody from DHS of UAC who  are not repatriated, and identifies qualified sponsors in the United States  who will take custody of the children once they leave the shelters and are  awaiting immigration proceedings. ORR has cooperative agreements  with shelters throughout the United States to temporarily house UAC until  shelter staff identify sponsors.", "A variety of legal requirements apply to how DHS, in conjunction with the  Department of State (State) and HHS, must treat UAC. In particular, the  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA)  requires that these departments establish policies and programs to  ensure that UAC in the United States are protected from traffickers and    others seeking to victimize or engage such children in harmful activity. Further, under TVPRA, DHS is required, in conjunction with State, HHS,  and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to develop policies and procedures  to ensure that UAC are safely repatriated to their countries of origin.

In addition, we analyzed CBP\u2019s human trafficking and UAC virtual learning course and  assessed CBP training efforts against TVPRA requirements and training  best practices. We also analyzed fiscal year 2009 through 2014 Border  Patrol and fiscal year 2012 through 2014 OFO UAC apprehension data\u2014 the most recent years for which complete UAC data were available\u2014to  determine the outcome of the screening process for UAC from Canada  and Mexico, as well as UAC from other countries. In addition, we  obtained and analyzed Border Patrol data on UAC who claimed fear of  returning to their country of origin for fiscal year 2014, the most recent  year for which data were available. We assessed the reliability of the data  by, for example, reviewing the data for missing data or obvious errors and  interviewing CBP officials responsible for ensuring data quality. We found  Border Patrol\u2019s and OFO\u2019s apprehension data to be sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of determining whether CBP transferred UAC to an HHS  shelter or repatriated them to their countries of origin.", "Because neither Border Patrol nor OFO had complete information on  screening decisions stored in an aggregate manner in its database, we  randomly sampled and analyzed case files of Mexican UAC whom Border  Patrol apprehended in fiscal year 2014. Further, we visited 11 Border Patrol facilities and four land ports of entry (POE) in three regions\u2014 Arizona, southern California, and south Texas\u2014from July 2014 through  October 2014 to, among other things, observe DHS screening operations  and interview Border Patrol agents, OFO officers, and Mexican consular  officials regarding implementation of UAC screening policies and  procedures. During our visit to south Texas, we observed Border Patrol  agents screen 8 UAC. The results from our visits to these three regions  cannot be generalized; however, the visits provided us with first-hand  observations on how agents and officers screen UAC at these locations  and insights into the implementation of CBP\u2019s policies and procedures. In  addition, we interviewed CBP officials to discuss CBP\u2019s UAC screening  policies, procedures, and training. We compared CBP\u2019s UAC screening  practices discussed during these visits and interviews and the screening  information obtained from our analyses of CBP information with TVPRA  screening requirements, CBP policies, and standards in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. In addition, we reviewed  reports on the screening of Mexican UAC completed in 2011 by the  nongovernmental organization Appleseed, and in 2014 by the United  Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). We reviewed the  reports\u2019 methodologies and discussed the reports with both organizations,  as well as with CBP. We determined that the conclusions in these reports  were valid and reasonable for use in our report.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed CBP and ICE policies,  procedures, and training documents regarding how their personnel are  required to care for UAC, such as CBP\u2019s March 2009 memorandum and  human trafficking virtual learning course, ICE\u2019s September 2014 directive  related to operations at its holding facilities, and ICE training for its field  office juvenile coordinators, who are responsible for coordinating the  placement of UAC with ORR. We compared these against TVPRA and  Flores Agreement requirements related to care.", "During our visits to 15 CBP facilities in Arizona, California, and Texas  from July 2014 through October 2014, we observed care provided to UAC  and interviewed Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE officials regarding how they  care for UAC in these locations. The results from our visits are specific to  the care observed at facilities in these three regions at a specific point in  time and cannot be generalized; however, the visits provided us with first- hand observations of the care provided to UAC and the conditions of  facilities in which UAC are held during various operating conditions,  including surge and normal operations. In addition, we analyzed Border  Patrol data on the care of 55,905 UAC in Border Patrol custody from  January 2014 through September 2014. Border Patrol officials told us  they could not provide us with complete care data prior to fiscal year 2014  because they did not fully implement their data system until then. To  assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed Border Patrol officials  in headquarters, and in Arizona, Texas, and California, who are  responsible for managing or entering the data, and examined the data for  completeness and potential errors. We determined that these Border  Patrol data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining how  consistently agents used Border Patrol\u2019s automated system to document  UAC care across eight specific elements, and the frequency and types of  potential errors, if any, in the data. We also examined available Border  Patrol, OFO, and ICE data on dates and times of custody, and reviewed  reports that ICE submits to the Department of Justice concerning UAC  who were in custody longer than 72 hours. The reliability of these data is  discussed later in this report. For information on whether UAC were  eligible for or received federal benefits, see appendix I.", "To determine the effectiveness of the process to transfer UAC from DHS  to HHS, we examined e-mails between HHS and Border Patrol from July  6 to 8, 2014, and from November 17 to 19, 2014. We chose these dates  so we could analyze communications during a month of higher UAC  apprehensions (July) and a lower month of apprehensions (November).  We also observed and discussed the interagency transfer process in  Arizona, Texas, and California, and interviewed DHS policy, FEMA,  Border Patrol, OFO, ICE, and HHS officials in headquarters about the  interagency process. To understand the repatriation process, we  analyzed all 30 DHS-negotiated local repatriation arrangements with  Mexico, as well as a 2004 memorandum of understanding with Mexico,  and evaluated these arrangements against TVPRA requirements for  repatriation of UAC to contiguous countries of the United States. We also  interviewed Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE officials, and Mexican consular  officials in Arizona, Texas, and California, and State officials in  Washington, D.C. We compared DHS repatriation-related agreements  with TVPRA requirements for contiguous country agreements.", "To address the third objective, we obtained and analyzed financial data  from CBP and ICE for fiscal year 2014. Because CBP and ICE did not  collect data on UAC costs prior to 2014, we analyzed available financial  data collected using UAC project codes from February through  September 2014 to determine DHS\u2019s UAC costs during that time period.We reviewed policies and procedures for tracking UAC costs and  interviewed CBP and ICE officials. Additionally, we analyzed UAC  transportation cost estimates developed by ICE to determine the  estimated UAC transportation costs from fiscal years 2009 through 2013.  These estimates were derived using fiscal year 2013 average costs and  applied throughout fiscal years 2009 through 2013. We assessed the  reliability of the cost data by, for example, reviewing costs for obvious  errors and interviewing CBP and ICE officials responsible for ensuring  cost data quality. We found CBP\u2019s and ICE\u2019s project code cost data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining a minimum UAC cost  for apprehending, transporting, and caring for UAC while in DHS custody.  We also found ICE\u2019s transport cost data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of determining an estimate of ICE\u2019s UAC transport costs for  fiscal years 2009 through 2013.", "According to ORR officials, actual cost per bed varies based on shelter type, location,  actual number of beds, and actual number of days for which beds were contracted. obligations.average monthly funded bed capacity data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of reporting average cost per bed for basic shelters. On the  basis of information provided by HHS, we are unable to report on the  average cost per bed for secure and therapeutic shelters because the  annual cost and bed capacity data were not comparable across these  shelter types. As a result, we focused on average cost per bed in basic  shelters.", "We also determined that ORR\u2019s basic shelter costs and  We conducted this performance audit from May 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, TVPRA requires that, except in exceptional circumstances,  UAC are transferred to the care and custody of HHS within 72 hours of  determining a child is a UAC. However, TVPRA also provides special  rules for UAC from Canada and Mexico who are apprehended at a land  border or POE.

Further,  Border Patrol agents and OFO officers at 5 of the 15 facilities we visited  stated that they repatriate UAC under the age of 14 if the Mexican  consulate is able to locate a family member in Mexico, and other Border  Patrol officials stated that they seek approval from the Mexican consulate  before returning any Mexican UAC. However, it is not the responsibility of  the Mexican government to assess whether Mexican UAC who enter the  United States merit international protection outside of Mexico. Rather,  TVPRA provides DHS with the authority to make the determination as to  whether a Mexican UAC can make an independent decision to withdraw  his or her application for admission and return to Mexico when the UAC  has met specified screening criteria, and provides no role for the Mexican  government with respect to this decision. Further, our analysis of CBP  apprehension data indicates that agents and officers may not have  understood or followed CBP policy regarding the ability of UAC younger  than 14 years old to make an independent decision. Specifically, we  found that CBP repatriated about 95 percent of all Mexican UAC whom  agents and officers apprehended during fiscal years 2009 through 2014,  and 93 percent of Mexican UAC under the age of 14 during this time  period. Further, eight of nine Border Patrol sectors along the southwest  border repatriated at least 80 percent of Mexican UAC under age 14 from  fiscal years 2009 through 2014. In addition, from fiscal years 2012  through 2014, OFO repatriated about 50 percent of Mexican UAC and 65  percent of Canadian UAC under age 14.", "According to CBP headquarters officials, the Form 93 is a sufficient tool to  conduct screening and Border Patrol officials and, in particular, these  officials stated that the signatures on the Form 93 confirm that agents and  officers considered whether the UAC were able to make an independent  decision about whether to return to Canada or Mexico. CBP officials also  stated that agents and officers use their training and experience to make  independent decision determinations and are capable of making these  determinations without a set of specific questions on the Form 93.  However, based on our interviews and our review of CBP apprehension  data, it is unclear if agents and officers assessed Canadian and Mexican  UAC\u2019s ability to make an independent decision before signing the Form  93 because there was no written documentation of this assessment other  than the signatures.", "In addition, other organizations have also identified limitations to CBP\u2019s  implementation of the independent decision-screening requirement. For  example, a June 2014 UNHCR report identified concerns that CBP as a  whole was not assessing whether Mexican UAC are able to make an  independent decision to withdraw their applications for admission to the  United States and return to Mexico. Specifically, UNHCR found that there  are no questions or instructions built into CBP\u2019s process for CBP officials  to assess UAC\u2019s ability to make the decision to return to Mexico.  Further, UNHCR reported that, when presented with hypothetical  examples of a child who is not able to make an independent decision  about returning home and questioned about whether they would handle  the processing of such a Mexican differently, a number of agents  responded that the children would be returned to Mexico like the other  Mexican UAC. In addition, the nongovernmental organization Appleseed  reported in 2011 that its interviews with Border Patrol agents and OFO  officers in the field indicated that no uniform guidelines or standards  existed on how to ascertain whether a child is capable of making an  independent decision to return to Mexico, and that this absence of  direction led to inconsistent practices across different regions of the  southwest border. Further, Appleseed reported that the repatriated  Mexican UAC it interviewed seemed to have little understanding of what  might happen to them if they did not agree to return to Mexico. CBP  officials responsible for outreach with these organizations stated that  while they have had discussions with nongovernmental organizations  about the Form 93 and UAC screening, there were no plans, as of April  2015, to revise the form to include additional indicators or questions  related to the ability of UAC to make an independent decision.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that  agencies should design and implement continuous built-in components of  operations\u2014in this case, indicators or questions agents and officers  should ask related to independent decision making\u2014to provide  reasonable assurance of meeting agency missions, goals, and  objectives. Revising the Form 93 to include indicators or questions that agents and officers should ask to better assess a child\u2019s ability to make  an independent decision would help ensure agents and officers obtain the  necessary information to determine whether UAC can independently  make a decision to withdraw their application prior to repatriation, in  compliance with TVPRA requirements and CBP policy.", "Second, although CBP repatriated most Mexican UAC under the age of  14 from fiscal years 2009 through 2014, we found that Border Patrol  agents did not consistently document the basis for their decisions, as  required. CBP\u2019s 2009 memorandum specifically instructs agents and  officers to document the basis for all determinations regarding  independent decisions on the Form I-213. Our analysis of a random  sample of 180 Border Patrol case files of UAC apprehended in fiscal year  2014 showed that agents did not document the rationales for their  conclusions related to UAC\u2019s independent decision-making ability.  Specifically, on the basis of our review of Forms I-213 from our sample of  cases, which included children of all ages, we estimate that none of the  15,531 forms for Mexican UAC nationwide from fiscal year 2014 included  documentation of the agents\u2019 basis for their determinations regarding the  UAC\u2019s ability to make an independent decision. In particular, in one  case we reviewed, the Border Patrol agent documented that the  unaccompanied alien child was \u201cemotionally distraught\u201d and \u201cunable to  speak clearly,\u201d but determined that the child should be allowed to return  to Mexico. Because the agent did not document the reason for deciding  that the child should be repatriated, it was unclear whether or how the  agent took into account the child\u2019s physical and mental state, which,  according to the 2009 memorandum, is one factor to consider when  assessing UAC\u2019s ability to make an independent decision. In addition, two  of the five Border Patrol agents we observed conducting interviews in the  Rio Grande Valley sector told us that the Mexican UAC they interview and  repatriate generally have not understood the options available to them  that would allow them to remain in the United States while they await  removal proceedings. As discussed above, a child\u2019s familiarity with the  U.S. immigration process is to be a factor that agents and officers  consider when determining the ability of the UAC to make an independent  decision.", "A Border Patrol headquarters official responsible for the UAC program  stated that agents typically document the basis for the independent  decision assessment only if the agent determines that the  unaccompanied alien child is unable to make an independent decision  because agents have typically not documented the decision in the past.  Further, he stated that this course of action follows the spirit of the 2009  UAC policy memorandum. CBP officials also stated that agents and  officers may not have adequately documented screening decisions  because they were more focused on working to transfer custody of UAC  to HHS as quickly as possible, particularly during the summer of 2014.  However, the 2009 memorandum specifically states that Border Patrol  agents and OFO officers are to document the basis for all determinations  regarding independent decisions. Moreover, our review of Form I-213s  from our sample of cases included apprehensions that occurred  throughout fiscal year 2014, which accounts for time periods with high  and low apprehension rates as well as sectors that did not experience a  surge in UAC. Ensuring that Border Patrol agents document the basis for  their determinations regarding independent decision making would better  position CBP to ensure that such determinations are appropriate.", "Credible fear of persecution. We found that Border Patrol agents and  OFO officers are not making consistent decisions about whether Mexican  UAC have a credible fear of persecution if they return to Mexico.  According to TVPRA and CBP\u2019s 2009 policy memorandum, CBP is to  transfer to HHS all Canadian and Mexican UAC who have a fear of  returning to their countries because of a credible fear of persecution. To  implement this policy, agents and officers are to ask four credible fear  determination questions on the Form 93, which solicit information from  the UAC about why they left their home countries, if they have any fear of  returning, or if they believe they would be harmed if returned. However,  we found that agents\u2019 and officers\u2019 understanding varies as to what types  of fear expressed by UAC and what types of responses to these fear  questions should warrant transferring the UAC to HHS. In particular, our  analysis of Border Patrol case files showed that agents made different  screening decisions when presented with similar responses to the  credible fear questions.claimed fear because her grandmother had abused her, and the agent  transferred the child to HHS. However, in two other cases we reviewed,  sisters told the interviewing agent that their aunt had mistreated them and  the agent repatriated these UAC. In another case, a child claimed that he  was fearful of gangs and transnational criminal organizations in his  hometown and the interviewing agent decided to transfer him to HHS.  However, one child claimed fear of gangs and another claimed fear of  violence in Mexico, and the interviewing agents decided to repatriate both  of these UAC.", "We did not discuss UAC screening at two facilities we visited in Arizona. At the third  remaining facility, CBP officials stated that they had never determined that a Mexican  unaccompanied alien child had credible fear. some agents and officers these DHS officials interviewed stated that they  needed to ask more questions than those on the Form 93 to know if fear  claimed by UAC warranted protection (that is, being transferred to HHS).  In addition, according to a June 2014 UNHCR report, more than half of  the 96 CBP officials interviewed by the UNHCR officials in 2012 and 2013  stated that it was not their job to assess a child\u2019s fear of returning to his or  her country; instead, UNHCR reported that CBP officials said that they  process the case so that the child\u2019s claim can be heard by an appropriate  adjudicator. However, some CBP officials told UNHCR officials that their  definition of fear is that it must be fear of persecution or harm inflicted  directly by the government and that UAC who fear gangs or cartels do not  have fear of government persecution and are therefore returned home.", "GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1. persecution would better help them assess and protect Mexican UAC  consistent with TVPRA requirements and CBP policy, as well as  consistently across the agency.", "Victim of trafficking. CBP\u2019s implementation of the TVPRA requirement  related to assessing whether UAC are at risk of a severe form of  trafficking in persons also has limitations. First, the Form 93 and the 2009  memorandum do not provide instructions on how agents and officers are  to apply the questions and indicators on the Form 93 to assess a child\u2019s  trafficking risk. Second, Border Patrol agents did not document the  rationales for some of their decisions related to whether Mexican UAC  were victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons.", "Regarding CBP\u2019s trafficking guidance, we found inconsistencies in the  information Border Patrol agents obtained from UAC for the same  trafficking questions. The Form 93 provides examples of trafficking  indicators and 12 questions to assist agents and officers in their  assessments of whether UAC from Canada and Mexico have been  trafficked. For example, one trafficking question on the Form 93 asks  Border Patrol agents and OFO officers to determine if the UAC are  engaged in labor. We analyzed a random sample of 180 Form 93s for  Mexican UAC apprehended by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2014. On the  basis of our analysis, we estimate that Border Patrol agents found 3  percent of these UAC were engaged in labor\u2014a trafficking indicator\u2014 because they were acting as smugglers. However, we estimate that in  another 4 percent of the apprehensions during this time period, the  Border Patrol agents identified the UAC as smugglers but recorded on the  Form 93 that they were not engaged in labor. According to Border Patrol  agents in south Texas, agents have previously identified smugglers who  were trafficking victims, and documenting that UAC are smugglers can be  an important step in assessing if CBP should allow the children to return  to Mexico. According to our review of the case files, Border Patrol agents  did not always document whether Mexican UAC were smugglers. As a  result, we do not know whether agents\u2019 inconsistent classification of UAC  smugglers as engaged in labor was a pervasive issue. However, given  the potential consequences of child trafficking, it is important for agents to  consistently apply the Form 93 trafficking questions for all UAC.", "In addition, we found instances where interviewers did not apply the  trafficking indicator from the Form 93 correctly. For example, according to  the form, one indicator of trafficking is when a child is isolated from  others, and the agent or officer is prompted to ask if the child has been  able to freely contact friends or family. However, we estimate that, in 4  percent of the cases, Border Patrol agents incorrectly documented  whether the UAC were able to contact someone while in custody at the  Border Patrol station after they had been apprehended (instead of during  their journey).charge of the UAC program, to determine if the child is a victim of  trafficking, the interviewing agent would need information on whether the  child was allowed to contact friends or family before, not after,  apprehension.", "According to a Border Patrol headquarters official in  Other groups have also reported that CBP has not provided Border Patrol  agents and OFO officers with sufficient guidance on how to implement the  Form 93 screening tool with regard to trafficking. For example, Appleseed  reported that the form lacks depth or detail sufficient to draw out the  information for an agent to evaluate whether a child has been trafficked.  In addition, UNHCR reported that the form does not provide the  necessary guidance for the interviewing agents and officers in a clear,  accurate, and user-friendly manner. For example, UNHCR found that  one agent, who was observed conducting screening, did not understand  that some trafficking questions applied to the period of time before an  unaccompanied alien child\u2019s apprehension. UNHCR reported that, with  some guidance on the substance of what the agent is screening for, the  agent could more effectively screen UAC for protection needs.", "According to CBP officials, agents and officers are not authorized to make  trafficking determinations, as agents refer UAC who may be victims of  trafficking to either ICE or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  These officials also stated that the trafficking questions on the Form 93  are intended as good questions to prompt UAC responses, but that  agents and officers ultimately use their training and experience to make  trafficking decisions. Although agents and officers must use their  discretion, prior to repatriating a UAC from Mexico or Canada, CBP policy  and TVPRA require them to assess whether the UAC has been a victim  of a severe form of trafficking in persons or is at risk of being trafficked  upon return, and we found inconsistencies in how agents applied the  trafficking questions designed to conduct that assessment.

Developing and implementing guidance on how  Border Patrol agents and OFO officers are to implement the TVPRA  requirement to transfer to HHS all Canadian and Mexican UAC who are  victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons\u2014such as the purpose of  each trafficking question on the Form 93 and how to interpret UAC\u2019s  responses to the questions\u2014would better ensure agents and officers can  make consistent and informed screening decisions.", "Further, these standards state that management is  Second, Border Patrol agents did not document the rationale for some of  their decisions related to whether Mexican UAC were victims of a severe  form of trafficking in persons, as required. According to the Form 93, if a  trafficking indicator is present during the screening process, the  interviewing Border Patrol agent or OFO officer is to ask age-appropriate  questions that will help identify the key elements of a trafficking scenario.  Moreover, agents and officers are to use the Form I-213 to document the  circumstances involving any potential trafficking. On the basis of the  sample of Form 93s that we reviewed, we project that 7,832 of the about  15,500 (50 percent) Mexican UAC whom Border Patrol apprehended in  fiscal year 2014 had at least one trafficking indicator present. However,  agents determined that these 7,832 UAC were not trafficking victims but  did not document any follow-up questions the agents may have asked or  UAC responses to those questions to alleviate any trafficking concerns.", "For example, we estimate that in 45 percent of cases, the Border Patrol  agent indicated that the child did not have possession of his or her  identification documents but determined the child was not a trafficking  victim. In the cases we reviewed, the agent did not document any  responses to follow-up questions he or she may have asked, even though  the Form 93 instructs the interviewing agent or officer to determine who  has control of the documents. According to Border Patrol agents in one  sector, not having an identification document should not be an indicator of  someone being trafficked. However, the Form 93 states that the lack of  possession or control of documents is a trafficking indicator and provides  a suggested question specific to that situation. In other cases, Border  Patrol agents determined UAC did not appear to be victims or potential  victims of trafficking even though agents documented that there were  trafficking indicators for these children, such as being isolated from  others, engaging in labor, having restricted movements, being threatened  with harm, being recruited for one purpose but forced to engage in some  other job, or providing coached responses. As a result, it is unclear  whether Border Patrol agents correctly applied CBP\u2019s policies.", "CBP officials stated that they may not have adequately documented  screening decisions during the surge of UAC in the summer of 2014  because they were more focused on working to transfer custody of UAC  to HHS as quickly as possible. Also, Border Patrol officials stated that it is  not necessary to document responses to follow-up questions because (1)  agents have latitude to use their judgment based on training and  experience to make trafficking assessments based on the totality of  responses to the trafficking questions; (2) agents and supervisors discuss  the circumstances of each case, as appropriate; and (3) supervisors  review and approve agents\u2019 screening decisions. While an agent\u2019s  judgment is an important aspect of the screening process, it is unclear if  agents are following TVPRA and CBP policy requirements to only  repatriate Mexican UAC if CBP determines they have not been victims of  a severe form of trafficking in persons. Moreover, on the basis of our  review of Form 93s from our sample of cases, we estimate that Border  Patrol agents did not complete the trafficking section of the Form 93 for 7  percent (1,077) of Mexican UAC they repatriated in fiscal year 2014.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that  internal controls and all transactions and other significant events need to  be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily  available for examination.trafficking indicators whom Border Patrol repatriated, asking follow-up  questions of UAC when trafficking indicators are present and  documenting UAC responses would better position CBP to ensure that  UAC who may be victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons are not  repatriated. Further, recording the rationale for agents\u2019 decisions to  repatriate UAC who demonstrate a trafficking indicator would allow CBP  to better assess on an agency-wide basis whether agents\u2019 decisions were  justified and consistent with TVPRA requirements and CBP policy.", "Given the rate of Mexican UAC with  Credible evidence of risk of being trafficked upon return. The Form  93 states that the trafficking questions will assist agents and officers in  determining if the UAC may be victims of trafficking, but the form does not  include indicators or questions for assessing whether there is credible  evidence that the UAC are at risk of being trafficked upon return to their  countries of origin\u2014a screening requirement under TVPRA and CBP  policy. CBP officials stated that the guidelines established in Form 93  outline indicators and suggested questions that could help show that UAC  are victims of trafficking whether they are going to be repatriated or were  subject to it prior to apprehension. However, none of the 12 trafficking  questions prompts the interviewing agents and officers to ask the UAC  about, for example, conditions in their homes or countries of origin that  could help them assess whether the child would be a potential victim if  repatriated. In addition, agents and officers at five facilities we visited  stated that they focus on indicators of current trafficking victims\u2014such as  signs of abuse or fear of an adult in their group\u2014rather than indicators of  potential trafficking should the child return to his or her country of origin.  Further, during our observations of five UAC interviews, Border Patrol  agents did not ask any questions pertaining to the risk of a child being  trafficked upon return to his or her country of origin. CBP officials also  stated that before CBP would allow a Mexican unaccompanied alien child  to return, Mexican consulate officials interview each child and question  him or her regarding possible abuse or trafficking. If any of these factors  are present, consulate officials notify CBP. However, Mexican consulate  officials in two of the three states we visited stated that they do not  influence CBP\u2019s TVPRA screening decisions. Moreover, as previously  stated, it is not the responsibility of the Mexican government to assess  whether Mexican UAC who enter the United States merit international  protection outside of Mexico.", "Other organizations have reported on similar limitations in CBP\u2019s Form  93.

UNHCR reported that indicators for when a child may be at risk of being  trafficked if returned to his or her country may be different from indicators  of current trafficking victims, and that CBP agents and officers may need  to ask different questions. UNHCR officials reported a lack of awareness  among CBP officials about how to identify UAC who might be at risk of  trafficking if returned to their countries of nationality.

According to CBP officials, in October 2012, CBP combined two virtual  learning courses\u2014one on TVPRA requirements and another on the care  of UAC\u2014and made the course mandatory. Since that time, Border Patrol  agents and OFO officers have been required to complete this training  annually. The course aims to familiarize agents and officers with the  provisions of TVPRA, the screening of UAC, and other issues pertaining  to the processing and care of UAC. However, our analysis indicates that  CBP does not have reliable data on whether agents and officers  completed the training. In particular, CBP officials stated that CBP\u2019s  training system tracks the number of agents and officers who have  completed the course but it does not reflect the total number of those who  should have taken the course. Furthermore, we interviewed CBP training,  Border Patrol, and OFO officials regarding how agents and officers  document completion of UAC training, and reviewed additional  information these officials provided about these data. These officials  stated that CBP\u2019s training system does not contain accurate data on  which agents and officers are required to take the mandated training or  those who did not take it. Further, tracking completion of the UAC training  course is a long-standing issue, as the DHS Office of Inspector General  (OIG) reported in September 2010 that CBP has not developed a tracking  system to verify that personnel responsible for processing and detaining  UAC have completed the mandatory annual training.", "CBP officials stated that it is the responsibility of local supervisors to  ensure that all of their agents and officers who have substantive contact  with UAC complete required training. According to CBP training officials,  some agents and officers may be exempt from the training for a particular  year, for example, if they are on a detail assignment overseas or on  extended administrative leave. Also, Border Patrol and OFO  headquarters officials stated that some supervisors are better than others  at monitoring their agents\u2019 and officers\u2019 training requirements and may  prioritize operational assignments over required training. For example,  Border Patrol officials reported that the increase in apprehensions in fiscal  years 2013 and 2014 could have led to below-optimal training completion  percentages. Similarly, OFO officials stated that some officers were  unable to complete the UAC training because operational needs took  precedence. However, TVPRA requires all federal personnel who have  substantive contact with UAC to receive specialized training, and  completion of the annual UAC virtual learning course is a CBP  requirement.

CBP and its  components, Border Patrol and OFO, have several policy documents that  provide guidance for how agents and officers are to implement the Flores  Agreement requirements to care for UAC. These documents are  generally consistent with and address Flores Agreement requirements to  care for UAC, and in some cases include more rigorous care  requirements.

Figure 6 shows part of the NPC, including a  number of portable toilets. At the NPC, we observed Border Patrol agents  and OFO officers helping U.S. government public health volunteers  provide basic care to UAC, including helping children as young as 2 and 3  years old eat and bathe. At the time of our visit, Border Patrol officials in  Arizona were supplementing food supplied by a FEMA contractor with  food purchased separately using Border Patrol funding.

At these 7 facilities, we observed or were told that female and  young male UAC would at times be placed in hold rooms with families.  Border Patrol and OFO personnel told us that because of limited space in  most of these facilities, they made decisions on how to segregate adults  and children based on risk level. For example, some agents and officers  stated that because of facility layouts, open areas are not a safe solution  for lack of space, and determined that female and young male UAC were  safer in hold rooms with families than in open areas with no physical  barriers between UAC and adult males.", "The DHS OIG has reported that CBP has generally met care  requirements, but identified some isolated problems.

However, in 2010, DHS OIG found that Border Patrol and OFO were not  documenting care as required and recommended that CBP develop  uniform documentation requirements for UAC care. Border Patrol and  OFO have taken some steps to develop and implement automated data  systems that can record and maintain data on UAC care.

After CBP or ICE officials examine the  e-mails to identify which UAC are in their respective custody, they  coordinate to transport the child to the shelter.

ORR officials in headquarters, as well as Border Patrol, OFO,  and ICE officials in Arizona, Texas, and California, told us that the referral  and placement process is inefficient and time and resource intensive.  Each agency uses its own data system to manage and track UAC, and  because the data systems do not automatically communicate information  with one another, the agencies rely on e-mails and duplicative manual  data entry when coordinating the placement of UAC in shelters. In some  cases, ORR sent e-mails concerning the shelter placements for multiple  UAC to an entire Border Patrol sector, and the POEs within it, making the  e-mails time-consuming to search. For example, in September 2014, we  observed a team of Border Patrol agents in Texas who had been  reassigned from other duties to search through placement e-mails for all  UAC in the sector to determine if any UAC in their custody had been  placed in a shelter. HHS headquarters officials stated that ORR sends  shelter placement information to the recipients indicated by DHS. Table 4  shows that this increase in apprehensions resulted in higher numbers of  UAC transferred to HHS.", "The reliance on e-mail and associated manual data entry also makes the  referral and placement process vulnerable to error and possible delay in  the transfer of UAC from DHS to HHS. We analyzed e-mail exchanges  between ORR and Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley sector to place  593 UAC in shelters during a 3-day period in July 2014, during the influx  of UAC, and 135 UAC during a 3-day period in November 2014, after the  influx had ended. We identified miscommunications between agencies, as  well as errors during both time periods, including UAC who had to be  redesignated to different shelters after initial placements and UAC who  were assigned to multiple shelters simultaneously. For example, in the  e-mails we examined, we found that ORR staff recorded one UAC\u2019s  personal information incorrectly, which resulted in a Texas shelter holding  an empty bed for 14 days while the child had been already placed in a  shelter in Pennsylvania. The incorrect entry of this child\u2019s personal  information also meant that ORR and DHS had to exchange multiple e- mails to resolve the discrepancy between their records.", "DHS components use different methods to refer UAC to HHS. DHS  and ORR have identified the lack of compatible data systems as a  challenge in the UAC referral and shelter placement process and, in fiscal  year 2014, began exploring ways to automate communications to address  inefficiencies. In summer 2014, ORR began allowing CBP and ICE to  enter information directly into ORR\u2019s UAC data system when referring  UAC for placement in shelters.

However, ICE officials stated that using ORR\u2019s system  directly has increased data entry requirements without reducing  reliance on e-mail and phone communication. ICE officials also told us  that, despite the increased data entry requirements, they are  continuing to use ORR\u2019s system.", "Border Patrol and ORR officials stated that efforts are under way to  automate most of the steps in the referral process between these  agencies. However, as of May 2015, Border Patrol is not entering  referral information directly into ORR\u2019s data system because Border  Patrol officials said they do not want agents to have to enter the same  data into its two separate systems (as ICE is doing) or train all of the  agents on how to operate ORR\u2019s system. Border Patrol and ORR  have been unable to move forward with a fully automated referral and  placement process because DHS has not accredited the security of  ORR\u2019s data system. In March 2015, CBP officials stated that DHS is  waiting to begin its security accreditation process until HHS accredits  ORR\u2019s system. ORR officials told us in January and April 2015 that  they are also working to update their data system to meet HHS  security requirements. In the interim, Border Patrol and ORR are  developing a temporary automated process that allows Border  Patrol\u2019s system to automatically fill out the referral form when agents  create a new apprehension record. Agents are to send an encrypted  referral form to ORR via e-mail, and ORR is to import the information  directly into its system without ORR staff having to manually enter it.  Border Patrol officials said that eliminating the duplicate data entry in  the referral process will increase efficiency for Border Patrol.  According to Border Patrol officials, automating most of the referral  process will decrease UAC processing time by 5 minutes per case,  which would have saved a total of about 5,000 hours of agents\u2019 time  during fiscal year 2014. Border Patrol officials stated that they would  like to pilot the alternative system in one sector in May 2015 before  fully implementing it in all sectors, but did not have a time frame for  when they would have a fully automated way to communicate with  ORR\u2019s data system because of the security accreditation requirement.", "OFO headquarters officials said that they were unaware that their  officers could access ORR\u2019s system and are not involved in or  planning any efforts to link OFO\u2019s data system with ORR\u2019s system.

OFO headquarters officials  said they have not received feedback from the field about the current  referral process. However, OFO officials in the Rio Grande Valley told  us that the placement process has cost them time and resources. For  example, one POE on the U.S. southwest border set up a port-wide e- mail specifically for ORR placements, which all officers on duty check  regularly and which officials reported took significant amounts of time.  However, we observed that these port officials continued to handle  large quantities of e-mails despite having no UAC in custody at the  time of our visit in September 2014.

The  roles and responsibilities of DHS components are not consistent during  the referral and placement process, and DHS points of contact for ORR  vary across Border Patrol sectors and ICE and OFO areas of operation.  For example, the ICE San Diego field office coordinates placements with  ORR on behalf of all Border Patrol stations and POEs in its area of  operations, except for two stations in the El Centro sector. However, in  the Rio Grande Valley and Tucson stations and POEs, CBP handles  referral and placement communications with ORR. Border Patrol officials  stated that they have a designated UAC coordinator for every sector  along the southern border who is responsible for UAC placement and  other tasks.

We also  found multiple instances in which different ORR officials sent duplicate  placement e-mails for the same UAC. The inefficiencies in the placement  process for UAC have been a long-standing challenge for DHS and HHS.  In 2005, the DHS OIG found that, despite an initial effort to create a  memorandum of understanding that would outline roles and  responsibilities, the two departments had not delineated their respective  organizational functions regarding UAC. In particular, the DHS OIG  reported that clear roles and responsibilities across DHS components  would help provide a point of contact for entities outside of DHS.

In 2013, DHS developed an  internal concept of operations to be used in the event of another large  increase in UAC apprehensions; however, DHS policy officials told us that  this document was never approved or implemented.

In June 2014, the DHS Secretary directed FEMA to take the lead in  managing interagency coordination for UAC issues as the head of the  Unified Coordination Group, which includes CBP, ICE, the Department of  Defense, and HHS. FEMA officials told us that, during the influx in 2014,  they identified the UAC placement process as a challenge and helped  facilitate ORR placement operations in Arizona as a temporary measure.  As of April 2015, FEMA leads the Unified Coordination Group, which has  created an emergency response plan for the Rio Grande Valley region  that outlines steps to rapidly increase federal capacity if the number of  UAC reaches extremely high levels again. However, the plan does not  address the interagency referral and placement process that is in place  during routine operations, nor does it address operations outside of the  Rio Grande Valley.", "Best practices of high-performing organizations include fostering  collaboration both within and across organizational boundaries to achieve  results; moreover, federal programs contributing to the same or similar  results should collaborate to ensure that program efforts are mutually  reinforcing, and should clarify roles and responsibilities for their joint and  individual efforts. Further, agencies should work together to establish a  shared purpose and shared goals; develop joint strategies or approaches  that complement one another and work toward achieving shared goals;  and ensure the compatibility of the standards, policies, procedures, and  data systems to be used. We have reported on a range of mechanisms  agencies can use to implement these practices for collaboration. These  include interagency agreements and memorandums of understanding, as  well as collaboration technologies such as shared databases and web  portals that help facilitate collaboration. DHS and HHS have utilized some  of these mechanisms under emergency operations during the large  increase in UAC apprehensions in fiscal year 2014. However, DHS and  HHS do not have a documented interagency process that clearly defines  the roles and responsibilities of each DHS component and ORR for UAC  referrals and placements during normal operations.

As these  arrangements and the memorandum of understanding represented the  primary agreements with Mexican officials for UAC repatriation, we  reviewed them to determine whether they reflected minimum  requirements for agreements with contiguous countries regarding UAC  repatriation. Our analysis of the memorandum of understanding and local  repatriation arrangements indicates that they reflect some, but not all,  repatriation requirements in TVPRA. Specifically, the memorandum states  that UAC should be returned during daylight hours, where possible to  appropriate family welfare officials, but it does not identify appropriate  officials or contain any provisions for the training of border personnel in  the arrangements.", "Further, our analysis of the 30 DHS-negotiated local repatriation  arrangements shows that fewer than one-third contained provisions  directing that no UAC be returned unless to appropriate employees or  officials, for example, by providing titles of Mexican officials to whom  Mexican nationals are to be returned; and only one arrangement  identified child welfare representatives. In terms of prohibiting the return  of UAC outside of reasonable business hours, fewer than half of  arrangements identified the hours during which UAC could be returned to  Mexico. Among those that identified the hours, the allowable hours for  repatriation varied widely. In most cases, UAC could not be repatriated  later than 6 p.m., but according to one arrangement, UAC can be  repatriated until 10 p.m., and another permits UAC to be repatriated at  any hour. According to officials from DHS\u2019s policy office, reasonable  business hours depend on the availability of Mexican government  officials, with whom DHS officials in the field coordinate, to accept UAC.  Last, none of the local repatriation arrangements addresses the  requirement that border personnel be trained in the terms of the  repatriation arrangements.

Of OFO\u2019s UAC costs, about 76 percent was for personnel travel,  salaries, overtime, and benefits and about 18 percent was for equipment,  supplies, and materials. Table 6 shows additional details of the costs  charged to UAC project codes for CBP\u2019s Border Patrol, Office of  Administration, OFO, and other offices from March through September  2014.", "The project codes are generally used to capture UAC costs that CBP and  ICE officials can easily distinguish from costs for accompanied children  and adults; however, such UAC costs vary by type across DHS  components. For example, Border Patrol tracked costs for UAC custody,  care, and transportation such as food, medical services, showers, and  other contracts during the large UAC increase, as well as personnel  salaries, benefits, and travel expenses for those assigned to provide UAC  care and custody. Border Patrol also implemented a second project code  to track costs for law enforcement activities to interdict or disrupt the flow  of UAC into the United States. However, according to Border Patrol  officials, they do not track UAC costs for general activities (such as  overhead) because these costs cannot be easily differentiated from costs  for other detainees. For OFO, the project code captures costs incurred  specifically for UAC, including personnel overtime, procurements, and  other direct costs, such as temporary duty travel for personnel to assist  with the UAC increase. In general, according to OFO officials, their  project code does not capture UAC operational costs, such as employee  salaries and overhead, because OFO cannot easily distinguish these  costs from costs for adults and accompanied children. For ICE, the  project code captures costs for UAC care, transport, and detention as well  as personnel, such as salaries and travel to escort UAC. According to  CBP and ICE officials, CBP and ICE personnel are required to use the  project codes when UAC costs are easily distinguished from costs for  other detainees. However, OFO allows its program managers to decide  whether it is practical to use the UAC project code. Therefore, DHS costs  charged to the project codes represent the minimum UAC costs to the  department from February through September 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Total UAC Costs and Average Daily Cost per Bed in Basic Shelters Have Increased since Fiscal Year 2009", "paragraphs": ["HHS ORR\u2019s costs for its UAC program totaled over $2 billion from fiscal  years 2009 through 2014, with about $910 million (45 percent) of the  costs incurred during fiscal year 2014.

TVPRA requires  that DHS establish policies and programs to ensure that UAC in the  United States are protected from traffickers and others seeking to  victimize or engage such children in harmful activity. Developing and  implementing training for OFO officers at airports, who have substantive  contact with UAC, could better position those officers to comply with  TVPRA requirements. DHS is also responsible for screening UAC and  either safely repatriating them or referring them to an HHS shelter.  Revising the Form 93 to include indicators or questions for all TVPRA  screening criteria that Border Patrol agents and OFO officers are to  assess before repatriating a child, and developing written guidance on  how they are to implement the trafficking and credible fear criteria, would  better ensure that agents and officers have the necessary information to  determine outcomes for UAC that are consistent and in accordance with  TVPRA requirements and CBP policy. In addition, ensuring that Border  Patrol agents consistently document the rationales for their decisions  regarding the independent decision and trafficking criteria would allow  CBP management to assess on an agency-wide basis whether these  decisions, which account for case-by-case factors, were justified and  consistent with TVPRA and CBP policy.

Furthermore, developing a documented interagency referral and transfer  process with defined roles and responsibilities, as well as procedures to  disseminate placement decisions, for each agency involved could better  enable agencies to find shelters for UAC in an efficient and effective  manner, and with minimal errors.

On the basis of  interviews with CBP officials and written responses these officials  provided to explain how they document completion of UAC training, we  determined that the data were not sufficiently reliable to report training  completion rates.

Further,  we analyzed Border Patrol\u2019s, OFO\u2019s, and ICE\u2019s fiscal years 2009 through  2014 apprehension data to determine whether DHS transferred UAC to  an HHS shelter or repatriated them, as well as demographic trends, such  as the age, gender, and country of origin of UAC.reliability of the data by (1) reviewing related documentation, such as data  fields, the database schema, and database training materials; (2)  interviewing CBP officials responsible for ensuring data quality; (3)  reviewing the data for missing data or obvious errors; (4) comparing  selected data fields with information from UAC case files and HHS data;  and (5) tracing certain data fields to source documents. During our   We assessed the  assessment, we found some inconsistencies in the disposition, or  outcome, data field when conducting internal checks of the data. We  rounded this information to the nearest hundred for reporting purposes.  We found Border Patrol and OFO\u2019s apprehension data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of determining whether CBP transferred UAC to  an HHS shelter or repatriated them to their countries of nationality or last  habitual residence. We also found the DHS apprehension data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting UAC demographic trends,  such as age, gender, and country of nationality.", "Further, we reviewed 21 OFO and 20 Border Patrol nongeneralizable,  randomly selected cases of non-Canadian and non-Mexican UAC  apprehended at land borders and ports of entry (POE) during fiscal year  2014 that CBP databases indicated were repatriated to determine if the  disposition for each child was correct.", "Because neither Border Patrol nor OFO has complete information on  screening decisions in its database stored in an aggregate manner, we  analyzed fiscal year 2014 case files of Mexican UAC Border Patrol  apprehended. We selected this population because Mexican UAC  apprehended by Border Patrol account for 90 percent of the Canadian  and Mexican UAC whom CBP apprehended that year. Specifically, we  drew a stratified random sample of 180 Mexican UAC from a study  population of 15,531 Mexican UAC who were recorded in Border Patrol\u2019s  database as having been apprehended in fiscal year 2014. We selected  these 180 UAC with probabilities proportionate to the number of Mexican  UAC from two strata defined by the outcome of the UAC screening  process\u2014repatriation to Mexico or transfer to an HHS shelter. With this  random sample, each member of the study population had a nonzero  probability of being included, and that probability could be computed for  any unaccompanied alien child. The sample size for the stratum of UAC  that Border Patrol repatriated to Mexico was 97 out of the 14,931 that the  Border Patrol database show were repatriated in fiscal year 2014. The  sample size for the stratum of UAC that Border Patrol transferred to HHS  was 84 of the 600 Mexican UAC who Border Patrol\u2019s database showed  were transferred to HHS that year. In reviewing the case file information  for these UAC, we found that the outcome listed for one child did not  match the outcome information in the CBP database, and we excluded  that case. As a result, the sample for the stratum of UAC that Border  Patrol transferred to HHS decreased from 84 to 83 cases. We analyzed  case file information, including CBP Form 93s to determine if CBP  screening complies with relevant TVPRA requirements and CBP policies  and procedures. Because we followed a probability procedure based on  random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples  that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval.

We  selected Arizona and south Texas because they have historically had the  most UAC apprehensions by Border Patrol, while southern California has  had the most UAC encounters by OFO. The locations were also chosen  for geographic variability. During our visit to south Texas, we observed  the screening of 8 UAC by Border Patrol agents. The results from our  visits to these three regions cannot be generalized; however, the visits  provided us with first-hand observations on UAC screening practices, and  insights regarding how Border Patrol agents and OFO officers implement  screening policies and procedures. In addition, we interviewed  headquarters Border Patrol, OFO, and Office of Training and  Development officials to discuss CBP\u2019s UAC screening policies,  procedures, and training.

Our analysis included reviewing the reports\u2019 methodologies and  discussing the reports with both the organizations, as well as with CBP.  Further, we reviewed a September 2010 DHS Office of Inspector General  (OIG) report on the treatment of UAC in CBP custody, which discussed  CBP\u2019s UAC training efforts. Our analysis included reviewing the report\u2019s  methodology. We also met with the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil  Liberties officials who conducted visits to south Texas CBP facilities in  July 2014 to investigate civil rights complaints submitted by UAC and  discussed their methodology and findings regarding the screening of  UAC.

We also evaluated ICE policies, such as ICE Directive  11087.1, Operations of Holding Facilities, September 2014, among  others. We compared these against TVPRA and Flores Agreement  requirements related to care. Further, we reviewed DHS UAC training  documents, including CBP\u2019s human trafficking virtual learning course and  ICE\u2019s UAC and Field Office Juvenile Coordination training. In addition, we  reviewed September 2005 and September 2010 DHS Office of Inspector  General reports on DHS\u2019s responsibilities for juveniles and the treatment  of UAC in CBP custody respectively, which discussed DHS and CBP\u2019s  care of UAC.", "During our site visits to Arizona, southern California, and south Texas, we  observed the care of UAC at 15 CBP facilities and discussed care of UAC  with officials at each facility. The results from our visits are specific to the  care observed at facilities in these three regions at a specific point in time  and cannot be generalized; however, the visits provided us with first-hand  observations of the care provided to UAC and the conditions of facilities in  which UAC are held during various operating conditions, including surge  and normal operations. To ensure that we observed and discussed care  systematically at each facility, we developed a care checklist with the  eight elements of care required by Border Patrol and OFO policy as well  as three additional elements required only by Border Patrol policy. We  evaluated these elements of care at each facility we visited based on the  totality of our observations and interviews. For example, we observed and  discussed with relevant officials the presence or absence of elements,  such as access to drinking water, food, toilets, and sinks. On the basis of  our observations and interviews, we determined that CBP had  implemented its care policies at these facilities if at least 80 percent of the  facilities we visited were generally providing care consistent with policy  requirements at the time of our visits. However, to assess CBP  implementation of the requirement that UAC be \u201cheld in the least  restrictive setting appropriate for their age and special needs,\u201d we  evaluated our observations and interviews to determine whether there  was (1) no less restrictive environment available, and if there was a less  restrictive environment, why the child was not placed in the least  restrictive setting and (2) evidence that agents and officers considered  requisite factors, including the child\u2019s age, special needs, and particular  vulnerability as a minor. However, we did not discuss every element at  each facility we visited in Arizona because we developed the checklist  after the visit to Arizona.", "We analyzed several data sets of information on DHS\u2019s care of UAC.  OFO and ICE do not collect data on the care of UAC in their custody in an  accessible format, so we analyzed only Border Patrol data on the care of  UAC in Border Patrol custody. We examined the Border Patrol policy on  documentation of care, OBP 50/10.9-C Use of the e3 Juvenile Detention  Module, April 2012, which requires agents to document all care of UAC in  their automated system, the e3 Detention Module. Border Patrol officials  told us they could not provide us with complete care data prior to fiscal  year 2014 because they did not fully implement their data system until  then. We analyzed data on the care of 55,905 UAC in Border Patrol  custody from January through September 2014. To assess the reliability  of these data, we interviewed Border Patrol officials in headquarters and  in Arizona, Texas, and California, who are responsible for managing or  entering the data, and examined the data for completeness and potential  errors. Because our initial analysis of the data showed potential errors,  and because Border Patrol officials told us that they were unsure about  the consistency with which agents in the field used Border Patrol\u2019s  automated system, we determined that the Border Patrol custody data  were not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining if Border  Patrol agents cared for UAC as required. However, we determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining how  consistently agents used the automated system to document care of UAC  and the frequency and type of potential errors, if any, in the data. To  determine how consistently agents entered care information into Border  Patrol\u2019s automated system, we analyzed the completeness of the custody  data by cross-checking the data with Border Patrol apprehension data  from January through September 2014. We measured if, and how often,  meals and welfare checks were entered for each child in custody. We  used meals and welfare checks because both actions are required by  policy for all UAC in custody, and must be performed at frequent enough  intervals that agents should perform each action at least once for every  child in custody, according to policy. We also analyzed how frequently  agents used each care action that is available in the system. We also  interviewed Border Patrol officials in Arizona, Texas, and California on  their use of the automated system.", "In our initial data analysis, we found that agents were entering the same  care action multiple times in a short time period. Therefore, in our full data  analysis, we measured the frequency of these potential errors in the data  by measuring how often a care action was entered more than once within  a short time period. When agents entered an action more than once, they  did not record them simultaneously, and so we did not identify these  actions as duplicates and definite errors. However, these actions, such as  meals, phone calls, or showers, were unlikely to have taken place more  than once in a short time period. Therefore, we measured the frequency  with which actions were entered within three time intervals: 10 minutes, 5  minutes, and 2 minutes. We selected these intervals because, while it is  possible that an action could, on occasion, be performed more than once  within a 10-minute period, it is unlikely that any of the actions would be  performed more than once within a 2-minute interval. Thus, the 2-minute  interval most strongly suggests error. However, because the volume of  likely errors made it prohibitive for us to verify if each likely error was in  fact an error, our analysis identifies those actions that we determined to  be likely errors. We also interviewed Border Patrol officials in Texas,  California, and headquarters to understand why these likely errors may  be occurring. We compared these care efforts against the Flores  Agreement, DHS policies, and standards in Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government.", "With regard to time in custody, Border Patrol provided us with the dates  and times that UAC were booked in to Border Patrol custody for UAC in  custody from January 2014 through September 2014, which also  contained information on book outs and transfers. OFO provided us with  the dates and times that UAC were booked in and ICE provided book in  dates, but neither DHS component was able to provide the dates and  times that UAC were booked out. Additionally, we examined  documentation about system requirements regarding time in custody for  all components, and interviewed Border Patrol, OFO, and ICE officials  about the reliability of the time-in-custody fields in their systems. On the  basis of our analysis of Border Patrol data, and interviews with Border  Patrol officials, we found Border Patrol time-in-custody data to be reliable.  On the basis of interviews with OFO and ICE officials, we found the OFO  and ICE time-in-custody data to be unreliable. As a result, we could not  report the time UAC spent in DHS custody.", "We also reviewed reports listing the UAC that were in DHS custody  longer than the statutorily required 72 hours, which ICE compiles and  submits to the Department of Justice every 6 months to be submitted to  plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as required by the Flores v. Reno Stipulated Settlement  Agreement. Our analysis of the reports from 2009 to 2013 showed  missing fields, dates that indicated children were in custody for less than  72 hours, and apprehension dates that occurred after the transfer to  HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). Additionally, for UAC  apprehended by Border Patrol, we compared the dates of apprehension  documented in the reports with Border Patrol\u2019s apprehension data and  found that many of the apprehension dates were entered incorrectly by  ICE in the reports. We also interviewed ICE officials in headquarters and  the field about the reports, and officials at the Department of Justice who  receive the reports. According to our analysis and our interviews, we  found the reports unreliable for determining the number of UAC that were  in DHS custody for longer than 72 hours. We compared these efforts  against the TVPRA requirement for transferring UAC and standards in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To determine the effectiveness of the process to transfer UAC from DHS  to HHS, we examined e-mails between ORR intake and Border Patrol in  the Rio Grande Valley sector to place UAC in shelters. We analyzed 111  e-mails to place 593 UAC from July 6 to 8, 2014, and 65 e-mails to place  135 UAC from November 17 to 19, 2014. We chose these dates so we  could analyze communications during the surge of UAC (in July) and after  the surge of UAC (November), and we chose the Rio Grande Valley  sector because (1) over 70 percent of all UAC apprehended by Border  Patrol in fiscal year 2014 were apprehended in that sector, and (2) Rio  Grande Valley officials had an in-box e-mail account set up for ORR  placement e-mails that allowed the officials to easily extract them. We  analyzed the e-mails for cancellations, redesignations, and multiple  placements and, on the basis of the rationales in the e-mails, identified  and categorized the reasons for cancellations, redesignations and  multiple placements. Our conclusions are not generalizable but provide  important insight into the placement process.", "We observed and discussed the interagency transfer process in Arizona,  Texas, and California, and interviewed DHS Policy, Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), Border Patrol, OFO, ICE, and ORR  officials in headquarters about the interagency process. In addition, we  reviewed September 2005 and September 2010 DHS OIG reports on  DHS\u2019s responsibilities for juveniles and the treatment of UAC in CBP  custody respectively, which discussed roles and responsibilities for UAC  within DHS, and the interagency process to transfer UAC to HHS. Our  analysis included reviewing the reports\u2019 methodologies. We also reviewed  a 2008 HHS OIG report on ORR\u2019s efforts that discussed interagency  coordination with DHS for UAC and reviewed the report\u2019s methodology.  Additionally, we analyzed plans developed by DHS to respond to a UAC  influx, which included provisions for interagency coordination, such as an  interim 2015 concept of operations developed for internal use by DHS.  We also reviewed an emergency response plan created by the Unified  Coordination Group, which includes both DHS and HHS. We compared  these efforts at interagency coordination, and information contained in the  IG reports about the prior efforts to coordinate, against best practices and   We also visited two HHS  mechanisms for interagency collaboration.shelters in Arizona and spoke with grantees and shelter employees at  these sites to better understand the transfer process.", "To understand the repatriation process, we interviewed Border Patrol,  OFO, and Mexican consular officials in Arizona, Texas, and California, as  well as DHS policy and ICE officials in Washington and officials from the  Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. We also  analyzed all 30 DHS-negotiated local repatriation arrangements and the  2004 memorandum of understanding between DHS and Mexico  regarding the repatriation of Mexican nationals. We compared provisions  for UAC in the arrangements with TVPRA requirements for the content of  agreements with contiguous countries regarding the repatriation of UAC.  Where there were not provisions in the arrangements specific to UAC, but  were provisions that would reasonably apply to UAC, we evaluated the  more general provisions against these TVPRA requirements; for example,  provisions that applied to all aliens being repatriated.", "To identify costs associated with apprehending, transporting, and caring  for UAC in DHS custody, we obtained and analyzed financial data from  CBP and ICE for fiscal year 2014. Because CBP and ICE did not collect  data on UAC costs prior to fiscal year 2014, we analyzed available  financial data collected using UAC project codes from February through   To determine the  September 2014 to determine DHS\u2019s UAC costs.extent to which UAC costs were identified, we reviewed policies and  procedures for tracking UAC costs and interviewed CBP and ICE officials.  Additionally, we analyzed UAC transportation cost estimates developed  by ICE to determine the estimated UAC transportation costs from fiscal  years 2009 through 2013. These estimates were derived by ICE using  fiscal year 2013 average costs and applied throughout fiscal years 2009  through 2013, adjusting for average annual inflation. We assessed the  reliability of the cost data by (1) reviewing related documentation, such as  financial statement audits and prior GAO work; (2) interviewing CBP and  ICE officials responsible for ensuring cost data quality; and (3) looking for  missing cost items or obvious errors. We determined that CBP\u2019s and  ICE\u2019s financial project code costs were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of determining a minimum UAC cost for apprehending,  transporting and caring for UAC while in DHS custody. We also  determined that ICE\u2019s transport cost data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of determining an estimate of ICE\u2019s UAC transport costs for  fiscal years 2009 through 2013.", "To identify costs associated with UAC in HHS custody, we obtained and  analyzed financial summary data for HHS ORR\u2019s UAC program.  Specifically, we analyzed UAC program cost data reported by ORR as of  April 23, 2015\u2014the most recent data available\u2014to determine the total  shelter, administrative, and UAC services costs. These data include  summary information on end-of-year obligations by cost category  compiled by ORR for fiscal years 2009 through 2014. We assessed the  reliability of the data by (1) reviewing related documentation, such as prior  GAO work; (2) comparing data against data in published sources, such as  ORR\u2019s Annual Report to Congress; and (3) interviewing ORR officials  knowledgeable about the data. We asked the officials about the reliability  of their data\u2014including questions about the purpose for which the data  were collected, the source of the data, and how the data were compiled.  We determined that ORR\u2019s financial summary data for its UAC program  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting total program costs  based on end-of-year obligations.", "To determine the average cost per bed for basic shelters, we analyzed  cost data for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 for UAC shelters by type of  shelter, which was compiled by ORR and reported as of April 23, 2015\u2014 the most recent data available. We also analyzed the average monthly  funded bed capacity for basic shelters reported by ORR as of April 7,  2015\u2014the most recent data available. Since bed capacity fluctuates  throughout the year, we averaged the average monthly funded bed  capacity data to determine the average annual number of beds. We then  calculated the average annual cost per bed for basic shelters by dividing  the shelter costs by the average annual number of beds for basic  shelters. For the average daily costs, we divided the average annual cost  per bed by 365 days. According to ORR officials, actual cost per bed  varies based on shelter type, location, actual number of beds, and actual  number of days for which beds were contracted. We assessed the  reliability of the data by (1) reviewing related documentation, such as prior  GAO work; (2) comparing data against data in published sources, such as  ORR\u2019s Annual Report to Congress; and (3) interviewing ORR officials  who were knowledgeable about the data. We asked them data reliability  questions, including questions about the purpose for which the data were  collected, the source of the data, and how the data were compiled. We  determined that ORR\u2019s shelter costs and average monthly funded bed  capacity data for basic shelters were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of reporting the average cost per bed for basic shelters. On the basis of  information provided by HHS, we are unable to report on the average cost  per bed for secure and therapeutic shelters because the annual cost and  bed capacity data were not comparable across these shelter types. As a  result, we focused on average cost per bed in basic shelters.", "In addition to analyzing UAC costs for DHS and HHS, we analyzed grant  funding documentation for 5 of HHS ORR\u2019s 34 UAC shelter grantees for  fiscal year 2013. We selected the 5 grantees to reflect a variety of  shelters based on the number of beds, dollar amount of the grant, type of  shelter, and geographic location. We analyzed the federal financial report  (White House Office of Management and Budget Standard Form 425)  filed at the end of fiscal year 2013 for each grant to determine the total  amount authorized and expended for each grantee. Further, we analyzed  each grantee\u2019s funding application (White House Office of Management  and Budget Standard Forms 424 and 424A) to determine the budgeted  costs for each cost category. In some cases, a grantee may have had  multiple grants or multiple funding requests within a single grant, which  we included in our analysis. Additionally, we obtained data, reported by  ORR as of April 7, 2015\u2014the most recent data available\u2014for the total  number of beds by shelter type for fiscal year 2013 for each of the 5  grantees. We assessed the reliability of the data by comparing the data  with shelter types identified in source documentation and interviewing  ORR officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining the maximum  funded bed capacity for each sampled grantee.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
