For  example, an SBIR award from the Department of Health and Human  Services helped a small business develop glasses that allow people with  color vision deficiency to see the full color palette, and this business has  made more than $20 million in annual sales, according to information on  the SBIR website. Congress established the related Small Business  Technology Transfer (STTR) program in 1992. The SBIR and STTR  programs are similar in that participating agencies identify topics and  make awards for R&D projects led by small businesses. The STTR  program further requires the small business to partner with a nonprofit  research institution, such as a college, university, or federally funded  research and development center. Each year, small businesses may  apply for SBIR and STTR awards to develop and commercialize  innovative technologies. The awards generally do not exceed $150,000  for the initial award and $1 million for subsequent follow-on awards.", "Federal agencies with obligations of $100 million or more for extramural  R&D are required to participate in the SBIR program, and those with such  obligations of $1 billion or more are also required to participate in the  STTR program. Since the SBIR and STTR programs began, federal  agencies have awarded at least 162,000 contracts and grants totaling  around $46 billion to small businesses to help them develop and  commercialize new technologies. According to the Small Business  Administration (SBA), which oversees the SBIR and STTR programs, 11  federal agencies participated in the SBIR program in fiscal year 2016 and  obligated around $2.4 billion for SBIR awards, and five agencies also  participated in the STTR program in fiscal year 2016 and obligated  around $314 million for STTR awards, the most recent year for which  data are available.", "Within these 11 agencies, a number of component agencies provide  SBIR or STTR awards. For example, within the Department of Defense,  the Air Force and Navy provide SBIR and STTR awards, as do nine other  component agencies within the department. In addition, the Army has  separate program offices for its SBIR and STTR awards. Similarly, the  Department of Commerce has two component agencies that provide  SBIR and STTR awards\u2014the National Institute of Standards and  Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Table 1 lists the 28 component agencies we reviewed.", "SBA provides policy directives on the general operation of the SBIR and  STTR programs. According to the SBA policy directive for SBIR and  STTR, at least once a year, each participating agency issues a solicitation  requesting proposals on a variety of topics. Each agency reviews the  proposals it receives to determine which small businesses should receive  awards, then negotiates contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to  issue the awards to the selected small businesses. The Small Business  Act and SBA directive state that most agencies are required to review  proposals and to notify applicants of the agency\u2019s decision no more than  90 calendar days after the closing date of the solicitation. Further, the  directive recommends that most agencies issue awards\u2014that is, finalize  the funding agreement with the selected small businesses\u2014no more than  180 calendar days after the closing date of the solicitation. According to  an SBA official, these time periods apply to both the initial phase I award  and the follow-on phase II awards.", "The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019 included provisions requiring the Department of Defense to institute  a pilot program to reduce the award issuance time for SBIR and STTR  programs. The Act also included provisions for GAO to report annually  for 4 years on the timeliness of agencies\u2019 SBIR and STTR proposal  review and award issuance, and to identify best practices for shortening  proposal review and award times, among other things. This report\u2014the  first of the annual reports required by the act\u2014covers fiscal years 2016  through 2018 and describes: (1) the amount of time agencies spent  reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals and notifying awardees, and the  factors that affect the time spent; and (2) the amount of time agencies  spent issuing SBIR and STTR awards, and the factors that affect the time  spent.", "To describe the time agencies spent reviewing proposals and issuing  awards, we collected information on awards made by 28 component  agencies from fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the 3 most recent years for  which data were available. For every award issued in these years, we  asked each component agency to report certain dates, including the  proposal submission date, the solicitation close date, the date the  awardee was notified that they were selected for an award, the date the  award was issued, and the award\u2019s period of performance\u2014the period of  time during which the awardee is expected to complete the award  activities. We calculated the time spent reviewing a proposal and  notifying the awardee starting from the solicitation close date and ending  at the notification of the awardee. We calculated the time spent issuing an  award starting from the solicitation close date and ending at either the  award issuance date or the first day of the period of performance if the  issuance date was not available.", "We took several steps to assess the reliability of the data provided. First,  we evaluated the data for potential outliers by looking for awards with  particularly long or short notification or issuance periods. We also looked  for potential duplicates by identifying awards with identical award  numbers. We then asked the component agencies to review the data on  these specific awards and make any necessary corrections, which we  then included in our data. In addition, we compared our data for fiscal  year 2016 awards to information in SBA\u2019s fiscal year 2016 annual report  to Congress on the SBIR and STTR programs, the most recent report  available. To verify the accuracy of the data provided, we also  compared the dates reported by each of the component agencies to  dates in grant or contract documents, emails, and other relevant agency  documentation\u2014for between two and six awards per component  agency\u2014and assessed any discrepancies. After updating the data as  needed based on these steps, we used the resulting data set of 15,453  awards to calculate the proposal review and notification time and award  issuance time for each award. As part of our data collection, we also  asked each component agency about the processes they used to record  the data and to provide it to us. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of describing the time spent reviewing proposals  and issuing awards at each component agency.", "We performed additional analysis to corroborate our proposal review and  notification time and award issuance time results and found that they  were robust when controlling for selected characteristics. We created  regression models of notification and issuance times and, using these  models, we estimated how awards\u2019 timeliness varied across five factors:  the dollar value of each award, whether each award was phase I or phase  II, the award\u2019s fiscal year, whether each award was through the SBIR or  STTR program, and each award\u2019s type of grant or contract. Further, we  used the model to estimate how mean notification or issuance times  (reported below) changed with interagency differences in these factors.  The models\u2019 timeliness predictions for a theoretical award with  government-wide-average characteristics were generally quite similar to  the actual mean at the agency. For example, for agencies with a mean  issuance time that was longer than recommended, the model almost  always predicted that the agency would also take longer than the  recommended period to handle an award with government-wide-average  characteristics. These results suggest that factors in addition to the five  that we modelled explain differences in review time.", "To describe the factors that affect the time agencies spent reviewing  proposals and issuing awards, we interviewed officials at 24 of the 28  component agencies and received written responses to our questions  from two other offices. These officials included the program manager of  the SBIR or STTR program, and in some cases also included officials  from the component agency\u2019s contracting or grants management offices.  We also interviewed an official from SBA responsible for overseeing the  SBIR and STTR programs. We reviewed their responses and  summarized the factors they identified. We did not evaluate the effect or  relative importance of the factors on the amount of time spent reviewing  proposals and issuing awards.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2019 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Timeliness of SBIR and STTR Proposal Review and Notification", "paragraphs": ["Overall, component agencies reviewed proposals and notified awardees  within the required time for 12,890 of the 15,453 SBIR and STTR awards  that we reviewed (84 percent), for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The  Small Business Act and SBIR/STTR policy directive require most  agencies notify applicants of the agency\u2019s decision within 90 calendar  days and require NIH and NSF do so in 1 year. Agencies notified  awardees after the required time period for 2,533 of 15,453 awards (16  percent). Three of the 28 component agencies met the notification  requirement for every award in the data we reviewed, and nine additional  component agencies did so for at least 90 percent of their awards. The  remaining 16 component agencies met the notification requirement for  less than 90 percent of their awards. Table 2 lists the mean and median  notification times and the percentage of awardees notified within the  required time period for each component agency.", "Some notifications occurred within days after the required time period,  while others occurred months later. For example, all of the notifications by  the Department of Education from fiscal year 2016 through 2018 that took  longer than 90 days occurred in 91 days. Department officials attributed  the one day difference to interpreting the 90-day requirement as a 3- month requirement. Similarly, all of the notifications for Army STTR  awards that occurred after the 90-day requirement occurred within 92  days. Of the 2,533 awards with notifications after the required time,  notifications occurred on average about 1 \u00bd months later.", "During the 3 fiscal years that we reviewed, some component agencies  had substantial changes from year to year in the percentage of awardees  that they notified within the required time period, while other component  agencies consistently notified about the same percentage of awardees.  For example, the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science and the Army  SBIR program each had a single fiscal year during which they notified  less than 50 percent of awardees within the required time period,  substantially less than during the other fiscal years we examined. Table  3 describes the percent of awardees notified within the required time by  each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we examined.", "Agency officials described several factors that affect the time spent  reviewing proposals and notifying awardees, including (1) the availability  of reviewers, (2) the number of proposals to review, and (3) other agency- specific factors.", "Availability of reviewers. Officials from some component agencies we  interviewed said the availability of agency staff or external reviewers  affected the time they spent reviewing proposals. For example, USDA  officials told us that the agency cannot notify awardees within 90 days  because they need additional time to identify and recruit experts for their  external peer review system. USDA officials compared their review  process to that of the NSF and NIH, the two agencies that are directed to  complete proposal review and notification within 1 year. Similarly, Navy  officials said that the availability of reviewers was the biggest variable in  completing their proposal review and notification process. These  reviewers are Navy employees who contribute part of their time to  reviewing SBIR and STTR proposals while continuing to perform their  regular duties. According to Navy officials, although they give reviewers  deadlines based on the number of proposals they have to review,  conflicts with their regular duties or higher priority tasks may cause  reviewers to miss their deadlines. In contrast, Department of Education  officials said that they identify and train reviewers before the agency  receives proposals so that the reviews may begin as soon as possible.", "Other agencies, however, may not know what areas of expertise  reviewers will need until the agency has examined the proposals it  received.", "Number of proposals. Officials from some component agencies we  interviewed said the number of proposals they receive affected the time  spent reviewing proposals and notifying awardees. For example, officials  from the Department of Transportation said that the number of proposals  they receive can range between two and 40, which makes it difficult to  predict the workload of agency evaluators who perform the proposal  reviews. Similarly, National Institute of Standards and Technology officials  said that the number of proposals they receive fluctuates from year to  year. Because agencies must review all proposals that meet the minimum  requirements, an increase in the number of proposals directly increases  the workload of proposal reviewers.", "Other agency-specific factors. Some component agency officials  identified factors specific to their agency or process as factors affecting  the time needed. For example:", "Two component agencies within the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2014the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014notified none of  their awardees within the required time in fiscal years 2016 through  2018. CDC and FDA participate in the solicitation and review process  led by the NIH. However, while the NIH has 1 year to notify awardees,  these agencies are required to notify awardees within 90 calendar  days. CDC officials said that participating in the longer NIH program is  more efficient than creating their own review process and allows them  to leverage additional programs at NIH that support small business  awardees.", "Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that their review  process includes three consecutive reviews, which leads the agency  to regularly request waivers to exceed the 90-day notification  requirement. These reviews include an administrative review for  responsiveness to the solicitation, an external peer review process,  and an internal review by the SBIR program office.", "Some agency officials also identified continuing resolutions,  sequestration, or government shutdowns as factors that could slow  proposal review. Proposal review and notification activities could be  affected because the availability or amount of funds for agency  activities is uncertain in these instances. For example, a Defense  Microelectronics Activity official told us that their agency generally  completes its proposal review process within 90 days, but does not  notify awardees until it has determined funding availability for awards  later in the fiscal year.", "National Institute of Standards and Technology officials described a  delay notifying one awardee, a replacement awardee, due to the initial  awardee being determined ineligible during a pre-award assessment.  The agency made a replacement selection immediately, but this  replacement awardee was notified approximately 20 days after the  90-day requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timeliness of SBIR and STTR Award Issuance", "paragraphs": ["Overall, component agencies issued 11,710 of the 15,453 awards we  reviewed (76 percent) within the recommended time period, for fiscal  years 2016 through 2018. The SBIR/STTR policy directive recommends  that most agencies issue an award within 180 days and recommends that  NIH and NSF do so in 15 months. Agencies issued 3,743 of the 15,453  awards (24 percent) after the recommended time period. Three of 28  component agencies issued every award in the data we reviewed within  the recommended time, and five additional component agencies did so  for at least 90 percent of their awards. The remaining 20 component  agencies issued less than 90 percent of their awards within the  recommended time period.

For example, the Department of Energy\u2019s  Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy issued no awards within the  recommended time in each of the three years we examined. Table 5  describes the percent of awards issued within the recommended time  period by each component agency for each of the 3 fiscal years we  examined.", "Agency officials described several factors that increased the time spent  issuing awards, including (1) additional time needed to issue certain types  of contracts, (2) the availability of grants and contracting officers, (3)  delays coordinating among agency officials, (4) the responsiveness of  awardees, and (5) the availability of funding for the awards.", "Cost reimbursement contracts. Officials from some component  agencies we interviewed said that the contract type was a factor that  affected the time needed to issue SBIR and STTR awards. Specifically,  officials said cost reimbursement contracts took longer to issue because  of the need to review the awardee\u2019s accounting system in accordance  with federal acquisition regulations. For example, officials from the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) said cost  reimbursement contracts routinely take more time to award than fixed- price contracts because of this accounting system review. According to  DARPA officials, this review can add 45 days or more to the awards  process. In February 2019, we found that the Department of Defense  does not have a mechanism to monitor and ensure that contractor  business system reviews and audits are conducted in a timely manner  and recommended that the department develop such a mechanism.", "Our analysis of the SBIR and STTR award data confirmed that  component agencies spent more time issuing awards identified as cost  reimbursement contracts than issuing fixed price contracts. We found that  SBIR and STTR awards identified as cost reimbursement contracts in the  fiscal year 2016 through 2018 data took significantly longer to issue than those identified as fixed-price, as shown in figure 1. Fixed-price contracts  took on average 152 days and cost reimbursement contracts took 231  days (79 days longer). Cost reimbursement contracts also took on  average 40 days longer than contracts that were not specified as fixed or  cost reimbursement.", "Availability of grants or contracting officers. The availability or  experience of agency staff to negotiate the contract or grant can be a  factor, according to some component agency officials. First, some officials  said limited availability of grants or contracting officers was a factor in the  time to issue awards and may result in delays. For example, officials from  both Army program offices said that the workload for contracting officers  is high, and SBIR and STTR awards are part of a larger contracting  backlog. Similarly, officials from the National Institute of Standards and  Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also said that the availability of grants and contracting officers is a pervasive  issue for federal agencies that can affect award timeliness. Second,  officials from some component agencies said that the contracting officer\u2019s  level of experience with small business awards affects the time needed to  issue SBIR and STTR awards.", "Coordination among agency officials. Air Force officials said that the  need for coordination among agency officials, such as between the  contracting officer and proposal evaluators, can create delays. Because  the proposal review and award process can require coordination among  multiple officials who are not always immediately available, delays may  occur as one official waits for input or information from another. Beginning  in fiscal year 2018, the Air Force made changes to its proposal review  and award process for a subset of awards that included scheduling  dedicated time for reviewers, contracting officers, and other agency  officials to jointly evaluate proposals and process awards. This change  guaranteed the availability of agency officials and reduced the time  needed for coordination among these officials. Overall, it allowed the  agency to issue awards within a few days or weeks. According to agency  officials, the Air Force awarded about 150 awards in 2018 through this  process and they expect about one-third of Air Force awards in fiscal year  2019 and half of awards in fiscal year 2020 will use this expedited  process.", "Responsiveness of awardees. Some component agency officials said  that the responsiveness of the small business was a factor in delays. For  example, officials from USDA said that the majority of SBIR grantees at  USDA are first-time grantees who have never worked with the federal  government, and this can extend the time it takes to issue the award. In  order to receive an SBIR or STTR award, the small business must,  among other things, submit a certification that it meets size, ownership,  and other requirements. Delays in providing these certifications or other  information required by the awarding agency can therefore delay award  issuance. In our July 2018 report that reviewed DOD\u2019s weapon-systems- related contracts awarded from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016,  contracting officials stated that quicker contractor responses to requests  for additional information could help reduce the time between when a  solicitation is issued to when a contract is awarded.", "Availability of funding. Some component agency officials said that  delays in determining the amount of funding available for small business  awards due to continuing resolutions or delays in intradepartmental fund  transfers may delay the issuance of awards. For example, NASA officials  said that they estimate the agency\u2019s R&D budget at the start of the fiscal  year to calculate the amount required for SBIR and STTR awards.  According to these officials, if NASA is operating under a continuing  resolution at the start of the fiscal year, the estimate may be smaller than  the final appropriated amounts. In this case, NASA would go back to its  proposals to make additional awards from the pool of proposals that were  rejected under the original estimate, and this would lead to longer  issuance times for some awards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SBA and the 11 agencies that  participated in the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal years 2016 through  2018 for their review and comment.

We may further examine differences between phase I and phase  II awards in subsequent reports.", "SBA also described the importance of minimizing delays between phase I  and phase II awards. We did not evaluate the time between phase I and  subsequent phase II awards in this report, but agree that the time  between awards may be of interest in future reports because, as noted by  SBA, the time between awards may affect small businesses' ability to  retain key personnel.
