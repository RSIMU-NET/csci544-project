GAO reviewed relevant legislation, OMB circulars and guidance, action plans of interagency councils responsible for overseeing grants management reforms, and previous GAO work and other literature on grants management reforms. GAO also reviewed its previous work on collaborative mechanisms and management consolidation efforts. GAO also interviewed officials from OMB, grant-making agencies, and associations representing a variety of grantee types."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the past 14 years, since the passage of the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-107), there has been a series of legislative- and executive-sponsored initiatives aimed at reforming aspects of the grants management life cycle. Recently, a new grants reform governance body, the Council on Financial Assistance Reform (COFAR), replaced two former federal boards--the Grants Policy Committee (GPC) and Grants Executive Board (GEB). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) created COFAR and charged it with identifying emerging issues, challenges, and opportunities in grants management and policy and providing recommendations to OMB on policies and actions to improve grants administration.", "In addition to this new governance structure, OMB and other entities involved with federal grants management are overseeing several ongoing reform initiatives intended to address the challenges grantees encounter throughout the grants life cycle. These initiatives include consolidating and revising grants management circulars, simplifying the pre-award phase, promoting shared information technology (IT) solutions such as the development of shared end-to-end grants management systems, and improving the timeliness of grant close out and reducing undisbursed balances. Management and coordination challenges could hinder the progress of some of these initiatives. For example, although promoting shared IT solutions for grants management--an original goal of P.L. 106-107--remains a priority, there has been uncertainty regarding the status of this initiative and future plans for it. The lead agency for this initiative changed several times since 2012, and it has been unclear at times whether promoting shared IT systems for grants management would continue to be a priority, and if so, which agency was in charge. After receiving GAO's draft report for review, OMB issued a \"Controller Alert\" on April 29, 2013, announcing that the Department of the Treasury would lead efforts to transform federal financial management by, among other things, relying on common standards, shared services, and using state-of-the-art technology.", "Although COFAR has recently identified several high-level priority goals for 2013 through 2015, it faces some of the same management challenges identified in previous GAO reports on grants management, such as the lack of a comprehensive plan for implementing reforms, confusion over roles and responsibilities among grants governance bodies, and inconsistent communication and outreach to the grantee community. COFAR has not yet released to the public an implementation plan that includes key elements such as performance targets and goal leaders for each goal, and mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on progress made toward stated goals. Furthermore, agencies involved with current grants management reforms are not always clear on their roles and responsibilities for various streamlining initiatives which may cause such initiatives to languish. Finally, GAO found that members of the grant recipient community continue to voice concern because they do not see a role for themselves as OMB and COFAR develop priorities for reforming federal grants management. In the comments it provided on April 29, 2013, OMB described actions it is taking to address these challenges, such as using a more detailed project plan internally and scheduling outreach events with federal partners and members of the grantee community."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Director of OMB: (1) develop and make publiclyavailable an implementation schedule that includes performance targets, goal leaders who can be held accountable for each goal, and mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; (2) clarify the roles and responsibilities for various streamlining initiatives; and (3) develop an effective two-way communication strategy with relevant stakeholders.

Federal outlays for grants to state and local governments steadily  increased from $91 billion in fiscal year 1980 (about $221 billion in 2011  constant dollars) to approximately $545 billion in fiscal year 2012. Over  time, growth in the numbers of grant programs to state and local  governments and their level of funding has contributed to greater diversity  and complexity in the federal grants management processes. Multiple  reporting systems and data requirements associated with administering  these federal grants have increased the burden and cost of grants  management for agencies and grantees.", "Efforts to streamline federal grants management have been under way for  well over a decade. Concerned that aspects of the grants management  process lacked coordination among agencies and consistency with  application and reporting requirements, Congress passed the Federal  Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, commonly  referred to by the grants community as P.L. 106-107. Since the  enactment of P.L. 106-107, the federal government has taken a number  of additional steps to reform government-wide grants management to  achieve greater efficiency and transparency. While P.L. 106-107  sunsetted in 2007, a number of reform initiatives continue, and new  initiatives have been put into place. Our previous work described many of  these initiatives and the related challenges\u2014the lack of a comprehensive  plan for implementing reforms, confusion over roles and responsibilities  among grants governance bodies, and inconsistent communication and  outreach to the grantee community\u2014that have undermined the  government\u2019s ability to simplify grants management processes, reduce  unnecessary burden on applicants, grantees, and federal agencies, and  improve delivery of services to the public.", "You asked us to examine federal grants management reform efforts. To  accomplish this, we reviewed (1) what the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) and other federal grants governance bodies have done  since the passage of P.L. 106-107 in 1999 to reform grants management  processes and reduce unnecessary burdens on applicants, grantees, and  federal agencies; and (2) what actions, if any, have been taken to  address what we have found to be persistent management challenges.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed P.L. 106-107, relevant OMB  circulars and guidance, and action plans created by former and current  interagency councils with responsibility for overseeing grants  management reforms.

For competitive grant programs,  the public is notified of the grant opportunity through an announcement,  and potential recipients must submit applications for agency review. In the  award stage, the agency identifies successful applicants or legislatively  defined grant recipients and awards funding. The implementation stage  includes payment processing, agency monitoring, and recipient reporting,  which may include financial and performance information.

The purpose of this effort was to  make it easier for grantees to find and use the information in the OMB  circulars and agencies\u2019 grant regulations by creating a central point for all  grantees to locate all government-wide grants requirements. As of March  2013, OMB has completed revisions on guidance related to two areas\u2014- suspension and debarment and drug-free workplace. All grant-making  agencies have relocated their suspension and debarment regulations to  one title of the Code of Federal Regulations and some have relocated the  drug-free workplace regulations.", "OMB has also been consulting with stakeholders to evaluate potential  reforms in federal grant policies contained in the multiple grant circulars.  As a first step, in February 2012, OMB published an advanced notice of  proposed guidance detailing a series of reform ideas that would  standardize information collection across agencies, adopt a risk-based  model for single audits (annual audits required of nonfederal entities that  expend more than $500,000 in federal awards annually), and provide new  administrative approaches for determining and monitoring the allocation  of federal funds. After receiving more than 350 public comments on the  advanced notice of proposed guidance, OMB published its circular reform  proposal in February 2013 and plans to implement the reforms by  December 2013.

These approaches could be a  useful model for COFAR to build upon with different grantee communities.  For example, we have previously reported that the research community  established avenues of communication with relevant federal agencies  through the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), a cooperative  initiative of 10 agencies and over 90 research institutions. Agency  officials and members of the research community continue to describe  this partnership as an effective model for promoting two-way  communication. Officials from the HHS Grants.gov PMO told us they  solicit information and feedback related to the functionality of Grants.gov  through quarterly meetings and open forum-type sessions with FDP  members.

Likewise, a FDP  official told us face-to-face meetings with grantor agency officials allow  them to provide input on proposed changes to grants management  policies and practices.", "In a second example, several state and local grantee association officials  referred to the communication channels that were set up while  implementing the Recovery Act as an example of effective two-way  communication they would like to see replicated. In the same letter  submitted to OMB after the creation of COFAR was announced, 10  organizations representing state and local officials referenced the  constant and consistent communication OMB and the Recovery Board  engaged in with members of the grantee community as a requirement for  success. We have also previously reported that OMB and Recovery  Board officials held weekly conference calls with state and local  representatives to hear comments, concerns, and suggestions from them  and share decisions. As a result of these calls, federal officials changed  their plans and related guidance. This type of interaction was essential in  clarifying federal intent, addressing questions, and establishing working  relationships for the implementation efforts. However, several officials  said these outreach efforts have dwindled, and they again feel OMB is not  involving them in COFAR priority-setting discussions.

Given this fiscal reality, it becomes more important to design  and implement grants management policies that strike an appropriate  balance between ensuring accountability for the proper use of federal  funds without increasing the complexity and cost of grants administration  for agencies and grantees. Duplicative, unnecessarily burdensome, and  conflicting grants management requirements result in resources being  directed to nonprogrammatic activities, which could prevent the cost- effective delivery of services at the local level. Streamlining and  simplifying grants management processes is critical to ensuring that  federal funds are reaching the programs and services Congress intended.", "In October 2011, OMB created COFAR and tasked it with overseeing the  development of federal grants management policy. Although COFAR  recently identified some priorities, it has not yet released to the public an  implementation plan that includes performance targets, mechanisms to  monitor, evaluate, and report on progress made towards stated goals,  and goal leaders who can be held accountable for those goals. Although  OMB officials provided us with some additional and updated information  in their comment letter that we were unable to assess or validate, they  agreed with our recommendations that OMB and COFAR need to  develop an implementation schedule and mechanisms to monitor,  evaluate and report on results, clarify roles and responsibilities for the  various streamlining initiatives and engagement with federal stakeholders,  and develop an effective two-way communication strategy that includes  the grant recipient community. OMB officials acknowledged that more  needs to be done to clarify roles and responsibilities and plans for moving  forward with various streamlining initiatives.
