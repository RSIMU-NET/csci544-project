For the 3 years covered by GAO's review, the judges' contributions represented more than 50 percent of the JSAS normal costs for fiscal year 1999, but less than 50 percent for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. To cover 50 percent of JSAS estimated future normal costs, the judges' contributions would need to increase by 0.1 percentage point above the 2.2 percent of salaries paid by retired judges.

The act requires us to review JSAS  costs every 3 years and to determine whether the judges\u2019 contributions  represent 50 percent of the plan\u2019s costs.  If the contributions represent less  than 50 percent of these costs, we are to determine what adjustments to the  contribution rates would be needed to achieve the 50 percent figure.

Three  separate retirement plans apply to various groups of judges in the federal  judiciary, with JSAS being available to participants in all three retirement  plans to provide annuities to their surviving spouses and children.   Appendix I provides additional information regarding retirement plans that  are available to federal judges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of JSAS", "paragraphs": ["JSAS was created in 1956 to provide financial security for the families of  deceased federal judges.  It provides benefits to eligible spouses and  dependent children of judges who elect coverage within either 6 months of  taking office, 6 months after getting married, or during an open season  authorized by statute.  Active and senior judges currently contribute 2.2  percent of their salaries, and retired judges generally contribute 3.5 percent  of their retirement salaries to JSAS.  Upon a judge\u2019s death, the surviving  spouse is to receive an annual annuity that is equal to 1.5 percent of the  judge\u2019s average annual salary during the 3 highest consecutive paid years  (commonly known as the \u201chigh 3\u201d) times the judge\u2019s years of creditable  service.  The annuity may not exceed 50 percent of the high 3 and is  guaranteed to be no less than 25 percent.  Separately, an unmarried  dependent child under age 18, or 22 if a full-time student, receives a  survivor annuity that is equal to a maximum of 10 percent of the judge\u2019s 3  highest paid years or 20 percent of the judge\u2019s 3 highest paid years divided  by the number of children, whichever is smaller.  JSAS annuitants receive  an annual adjustment in their annuities at the same time, and by the same  percentage, as any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) received by CSRS  annuitants.  Spouses and children are also eligible for Social Security  survivor benefits.", "Since its inception in 1956, JSAS has changed several times.  Because of  concern that too few judges were participating in the plan (74 percent of  federal judges participated in 1985, which was down from 90 percent in  1976), Congress made broad reforms effective in 1986 with the Judicial  Improvements Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-336).  The 1985 Judicial  Improvement Act (1) increased the annuity formula for surviving spouses  from 1.25 percent to the current 1.5 percent of the high 3 for each year of  creditable service and (2) changed the provisions for surviving children\u2019s  benefits to relate benefit amounts to judges\u2019 high 3 rather than the specific  dollar amounts provided by the Judicial Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act of  1976 (Public Law 94-554).  In recognition of the significant benefit  improvements that were made, the 1985 Judicial Improvements Act  increased the amounts that judges were required to contribute from 4.5  percent to 5 percent of their salaries, including retirement salaries.", "The 1985 Judicial Improvements Act also changed the requirements for  government contributions to the plan by specifying that the government  would contribute whatever amounts were necessary (up to a maximum of 9  percent of participating judges\u2019 salaries or retirement salaries) to keep the  plan fully funded.  Under the 1976 Judicial Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act,  the government matched the judges\u2019 contributions of 4.5 percent of salaries  and retirement salaries.  Despite the benefit improvements in the 1985  Judicial Improvements Act, the rate of participation in JSAS continued to  decline.  In 1991, the rate of participation was about 40 percent overall and  25 percent for newly appointed judges.", "In response to concerns that required contributions of 5 percent may have  created a disincentive to participate, Congress enacted the 1992 Federal  Courts Administration Act.  Under this act, participants\u2019 contribution  requirements were reduced to 2.2 percent of salaries for active and senior  judges and 3.5 percent of retirement salaries for retired judges.  Another  significant change was an increase in benefits for survivors of retired  judges.  This increase was accomplished by including years spent in  retirement in the calculation of creditable service and the high 3 salary  averages.", "The 1992 Federal Courts Administration Act also allowed the judges to stop  contributing to the plan if they ceased to be married and granted benefits to  survivors of any judge who died in the interim between leaving office and  the commencement of a deferred annuity.  As of September 30, 2001, there  were 1,256 active and senior judges, 203 retired judges, and 260 survivor  annuitants covered under JSAS compared to 1,284 active and senior judges,  136 retired judges, and 241 survivor annuitants as of September 30, 1998.", "Defining Cost for JSAS JSAS is financed by judges\u2019 contributions and direct appropriations in an  amount estimated to be sufficient to fund the future benefits to current  participants.  The government\u2019s contribution is approved through an  annual appropriation and is not based on a rate or percentage of judges\u2019  salaries.  An enrolled actuary engaged by the Administrative Office of the  United States Courts (AOUSC) calculates the annual amount of funding  needed based on the difference between the present value of the expected  future benefit payments to participants and the present value of net assets  in the plan.  Appendix II provides more details on the formulas used to  determine the participants\u2019 and the government\u2019s contributions and lump  sum payments.", "The cost of a retirement or survivor benefit plan is typically not measured  by annual expenditures for benefits.  Such expenditures are not an  indicator of the overall long-term cost of a plan.  The more complete and  acceptable calculation of a plan\u2019s cost is the projected future outlays to  retirees or survivors, based on the current pool of participants, with such  costs allocated annually.  This annual cost allocation is referred to as the  normal cost.  Normal cost calculations, prepared by an enrolled actuary,  are estimates and require that many actuarial assumptions be made about  the future, including mortality rates, turnover rates, return on investments,  salary increases, and COLA increases over the life spans of current and  future participants.  The plan\u2019s actuary using the plan\u2019s funding method, in  this case, the aggregate cost method, determines the plan\u2019s normal cost.   Under the aggregate cost method, the normal cost is the level percentage of  future salaries, which will be sufficient, along with investment earnings and  the plan\u2019s assets, to pay the plan\u2019s benefits.  There are many acceptable  actuarial methods for calculating normal cost.  Regardless of which cost  method is chosen, the expected total long-term cost of the plan should be  the same; however, year-to-year costs may differ, depending on the cost  method used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine whether participating judges\u2019  contributions for the 3 years ending in fiscal year 2001 accounted for 50  percent of the JSAS costs and, if not, what adjustments in the contribution  rates would be needed to achieve the 50 percent figure.", "To satisfy our objectives, we examined the normal costs reported in the  JSAS annual report submitted by AOUSC to the Comptroller General for  plan years 1999 through 2001.  We also examined participants\u2019  contributions and other relevant information in the annual report.  An  independent accounting firm hired by AOUSC audited the JSAS financial  and actuarial information, included in the JSAS annual report, with input  from an enrolled actuary regarding relevant data such as actuarial present  value of accumulated plan benefits.  An enrolled actuary certified those  amounts that are included in the JSAS annual report.

In fiscal year 1999, the participating judges  contributed approximately 61 percent of JSAS normal costs, and in fiscal  years 2000 and 2001, the participating judges contributed approximately 48  percent of the JSAS normal costs.", "On the basis of data from plan years 1999, 2000, and 2001, the participating  judges contributed, on an average, approximately 52 percent of JSAS  normal costs; the government\u2019s share amounted to, on an average,  approximately 48 percent.  Table 1 shows the judges\u2019 and government\u2019s  contribution rates and shares of JSAS normal costs (using the aggregate  cost method, which is discussed in appendix II) for the period covered in  our study.", "The judges\u2019 and the government\u2019s contribution rates for each of the 3 years,  shown in table 1, were based on the actuarial valuation that occurred at the  end of the prior year.  For example, the judges\u2019 contribution of 2.36 percent  and the government\u2019s contribution of 2.60 percent in fiscal year 2001 were  based on the September 30, 2000, valuation contained in the fiscal year  2001 JSAS report.", "The judges\u2019 share of JSAS normal costs in the above table decreased from  approximately 61 percent in fiscal year 1999 to approximately 48 percent in  fiscal years 2000 and 2001, while the government\u2019s share of JSAS normal  costs increased from approximately 39 percent to approximately 52  percent.  During those same years, the judges\u2019 contribution rates remained  constant, while the government\u2019s contribution rate increased from 1.5  percent of salaries in fiscal year 1999, based on the September 30, 1998,  valuation, to 2.6 percent of salaries in 2000 and 2001.  The increase in the  government\u2019s contribution was primarily a result of the increase in total  normal costs determined by the actuary from 3.86 percent of salaries in  fiscal year 1999, based on the September 30, 1998, valuation, to 4.97 percent  of salaries in fiscal year 2000.  The increase in normal costs resulted from a  decline in the market value of assets held in JSAS, as well as an increase in  plan benefits being paid out over the period.", "Specifically, the total plan assets decreased from $366.7 million in fiscal  year 1998 to $363.6 million in fiscal year 1999.  At the same time, the  accumulated plan benefit obligations increased from $311.9 million in fiscal  year 1998 to $329.3 million in fiscal year 1999.  The increase in the JSAS  normal costs reflects the combined effect of the decrease in the value of  plan assets and increase in the estimates of plan benefit obligations.   Although the judges\u2019 contribution rate remained fairly constant, the judges\u2019  share of normal costs decreased to approximately 48 percent in fiscal years  2000 and 2001 because the total normal costs increased.   In fiscal year  2001, the normal costs covered by the judges\u2019 and government\u2019s  contributions remained constant because the percentage change in asset  value was approximately 6.5 percent, which was in line with the 7.0 percent  rate of return on investments that was assumed by the plan actuary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adjustment That Would Be Needed in Judges\u2019 Contribution Rates", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of the information contained in the JSAS actuarial report as of  September 30, 2001, we determined that the participating judges\u2019 future  contributions would have to increase a total of 0.1 percentage point above  the current 2.2 percent of salaries for active and senior judges and 3.5  percent of retirement salaries for retired judges in order to cover 50  percent of JSAS costs.  If the increase were distributed equally among the  judges, those contributing 2.2 percent would have to increase to 2.3  percent, and those contributing 3.5 percent would have to increase to 3.6  percent.", "A potential effect of increasing the contribution rates could be a decline in  the participation rate for JSAS, which would run counter to the goal of  increasing participation\u2014a major reason for the changes made to JSAS in  1992.  However, this potential impact appears to be less likely as compared  with our findings from 3 years ago, when we reported that an increase of  0.3 percentage points would have been needed to achieve the 50 percent  contribution goal.  Since fiscal year 1998, the participating judges increased  from 1,420 to 1,459 as of September 30, 2001.  However, increasing the  contribution rates now could affect the judges\u2019 decision to participate in  JSAS.", "Even if contribution rates are adjusted to the levels currently estimated to  cover 50 percent of future normal costs, the future normal costs are  estimates that could change in any given plan year.  During the course of  any year, certain events, such as the number of survivors or judges who  have died, the number of new judges electing to participate, or the number  of judges who decide to retire, as well as the value of and the rates of return  on assets in the plan could create normal statistical variances that would  affect the annual normal costs of the plan.  Since the plan only has 1,459  participants\u2014both active and retired judges\u2014and 260 survivor annuitants,  such variances can have a significant effect on the expected normal costs  and lead to short-term variability.", "Therefore, the long-term view is important when evaluating the expected  judges\u2019 contributions of 50 percent of the normal costs.  As shown in table  2, the average of the annual share of judges\u2019 contributions since enactment  of the 1992 Federal Courts Administration Act has been approximately 47 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Director of  AOUSC or his designee.
