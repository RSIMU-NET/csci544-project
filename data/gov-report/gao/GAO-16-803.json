This is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control for monitoring, which state that management should remediate identified internal control deficiencies on a timely basis. GAO found instances where VHA actions in response to recent recommendations for organizational structure changes were incomplete, not documented, or not timely. For example, VHA chartered a task force to develop a detailed plan to implement selected recommendations from the independent assessment of VHA's operations required by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014; according to VHA, the assessment cost $68 million. It found, among other things, that VHA central office programs and staff had increased dramatically in recent years, resulting in a fragmented and \u201csilo-ed\u201d organization without any discernible improvement in business or health outcomes. It recommended restructuring and downsizing VHA's central office. The task force of 18 senior Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and VHA officials conducted work over about 6 months, but did not produce a documented implementation plan or initiate implementation of recommendations. Without a process that documents the assessment, approval, and implementation of organizational structure changes, VHA cannot ensure that it is making appropriate changes, using resources efficiently, holding officials accountable for taking action, and maintaining documentation of decisions made.", "VHA central office's monitoring of the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) realignment\u2014a recent and significant organizational structure change\u2014has been limited, and the office has provided little implementation guidance. In October 2015, VHA began to implement a realignment of its VISN boundaries, which involves decreasing the number of VISNs from 21 to 18 and reassigning some VA medical centers (VAMC) to different VISNs. VHA officials anticipate this process will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018. VHA officials on the task force implementing the realignment told GAO they thought VISNs could implement the realignment independently without the need for close monitoring. VHA also did not provide guidance to address VISN and VAMC challenges that could have been anticipated, including challenges with services and budgets, double-encumbered positions (two officials in the same position in merging VISNs), and information technology. Further, VHA officials said they do not have plans to evaluate the realignment. VHA's actions are inconsistent with federal internal control standards for monitoring (management should establish monitoring activities, evaluate results, and remediate identified deficiencies) and risk assessment (management should identify, analyze, and respond to changes that could affect the system).

In addition, in 2014, a series of events called into question the ability of  veterans to gain timely access to care from VHA medical facilities. As a  result of these and other systemic problems, we concluded that VA health  care is a high-risk area and added it to our High Risk List in 2015.", "In response to criticism that VHA was not succeeding in providing timely  health care services to veterans, VA announced a major organizational  initiative in September 2014 called MyVA.

One attribute of the federal internal control standard for timely  remediation for identified deficiencies is assigning responsibility and  authority for carrying out corrective actions. The three task force charters  did not require senior leadership to make decisions on the results of  reviews within a certain time frame, or ensure implementation of agreed- upon recommendations. As a result, when officials retired (as did the  chairs for all three task forces) or resumed their regular duties, there were  no other individuals or offices responsible for ensuring that  recommendations were acted on, or any documentation available to track  progress made. VHA officials expressed frustration and confusion at the  lack of response from central office to the findings and recommendations  resulting from task forces.

The governance task  force evaluated several options for aligning VISN boundaries with MyVA  regions and for aligning VISN boundaries better with state lines, and  proposed an 18-VISN configuration.

According to VHA, the realignment is not expected to  impact veterans\u2019 access to health care. For example, officials told us that  the VISNs are expected to continue to honor historical geographical  referral patterns for veterans\u2014that is, to continue to refer veterans to the  same VAMC or outpatient facility they were referred to prior to the  realignment even if that VAMC or facility is part of a different VISN post- realignment.", "VHA has provided little monitoring of VISNs\u2019 implementation efforts, and it  has not provided adequate guidance in anticipation of implementation  challenges.

Although these meetings provide a  structure for VISN directors to share actions taken and challenges  encountered in the realignment process, VHA has not taken an active role  in implementing the realignment. VISN Realignment Workgroup officials  told us that at the beginning of the realignment, the workgroup provided  guidance in the form of a communication plan that answered frequently  asked questions about the realignment\u2019s purpose, and made decisions  about how the VISNs would be numbered. However, officials added that  they wanted to be facilitators, rather than directors or implementers, for  the realignment, and that VISN directors were capable of implementing  the realignment independently without the need for a close level of  monitoring.", "Directors from several VISNs affected by the realignment told us that they  have made decisions independently about how to implement the  realignment in their VISNs, and many also noted that they continue to  face challenges with implementation, including services and budgets. Directors from 12 of the 15 VISNs affected by  the realignment told us they continue to face challenges in managing  services and budgets. The director of a VISN that gained a VAMC  with after-hours call center services on site told us he faced an  unexpected task of consolidating his VISN\u2019s existing call center  services with those being provided at the VAMC. In addition, a VAMC  director expressed concern about potentially having to re-start a VISN  strategic planning exercise that the VAMC had participated in for 18  months because the VISN to which it had been reassigned had not  done similar planning work.

Six of the 15 VISNs affected by  the realignment are in the process of merging, which has resulted in  double-encumbered positions\u2014two officials serving in the same  position, such as two Chief Financial Officers. For example, one VISN  director told us at the time of our interview (February 2016) that there  were about 30 double-encumbered positions between two merging  VISNs, which represented about one-third of their total staff.  According to VHA, 23 positions remained double-encumbered in the  merged VISN as of August 2016. Several VISN directors described  challenges in resolving double-encumbered positions. For example,  without authorization to offer Voluntary Separation Incentive  Payments\u2014also known as buyout authority\u2014or specific instructions  from central office, directors told us they were concerned that any  actions they took (such as having officials compete for the position)  would be inconsistent with other VISNs. VHA officials told us that they  have been involved in helping VISNs address double-encumbered  positions, such as assisting in finding staff new positions within VHA,  but not all such situations had been resolved. Further, according to  VHA, one merged VISN received central office approval to pursue  buyout authority, and two other merged VISNs were awaiting approval  as of August 2016. VISN directors with double-encumbered staff  expressed frustration at the lack of resolution of this issue and told us  it has contributed to low staff morale. Double-encumbered positions  were a VISN realignment challenge that VHA could have anticipated  and made plans to address before the realignment started, but  according to senior task force officials, the task force did not establish  a subgroup on human resources until after the realignment began. As  of August 2016, VHA reported there were 37 double-encumbered  positions across the three merged VISNs.  information technology. Six of the 15 directors from VISNs affected  by the realignment told us that they continue to face information  technology challenges, including having to manually reconstruct  datasets to add or delete VAMCs that are still electronically  associated with their former VISNs. One VISN director described  difficulties in obtaining access rights to data from VAMCs that were  reassigned to the VISN. Similarly, a VAMC director told us that the  facility was no longer able to access its own data after changing  VISNs because the data were located on their former VISN\u2019s server,  requiring workarounds to gain access because there was no  guidebook or plan for how to transfer VAMC data from one VISN to  another.", "VISN Realignment Workgroup officials told us they were aware of  continued realignment challenges, but had no plans in place at the time of  our review to expand their monitoring efforts to include an evaluation of  the implementation of the realignment. Officials said that if they  conducted an evaluation, the best time frame would be after the  realignment is mostly complete because realignment actions are still in  the process of being implemented. However, an evaluation may be useful  to correct any identified implementation deficiencies. It can also help  inform future organizational structure changes by offering VHA the  opportunity to anticipate challenges and proactively provide guidance to  address them. For example, the Under Secretary for Health told us he  would be open to other VHA organizational structure changes in the  future once he completes the process of filling vacant leadership positions  within VHA. In addition, the implementation of the Commission on Care  report recommendations could result in large-scale organizational  structure changes.

VHA would also miss the opportunity to apply lessons  learned from such an evaluation to future organizational structure  changes, such as those it makes in response to the Commission on Care  report\u2019s recommendations.

Develop a process to ensure that organizational structure  recommendations resulting from internal and external reviews of VHA  are evaluated for implementation. This process should include the  documentation of decisions and assigning officials or offices  responsibility for ensuring that approved recommendations are  implemented.  2.  Conduct an evaluation of the implementation of the VISN realignment  to determine whether deficiencies exist that need corrective actions,  and apply lessons learned from the evaluation to future organizational  structure changes, such as possible changes to VISN staffing models  or actions to implement Commission on Care recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA for comment.
