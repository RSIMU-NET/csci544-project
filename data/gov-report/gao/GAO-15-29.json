In regard to cost estimating requirements for projects, DOE's 2010 project management order requires 1 of the 12 cost estimating best practices\u2014conducting an independent cost estimate\u2014for larger projects at certain stages of development. In contrast, DOE's 2011 cost estimating guide describes recommended approaches for using 10 of 12 best practices and partially contains information about the other 2. Furthermore, because DOE's cost estimating guide was issued in 2011\u2014after DOE's 2010 project order was issued\u2014it is not referenced in the order. As a result, users of the order may not be aware of the guide's availability and may not benefit from its usefulness. In addition, although NNSA programs are required to follow DOE's budget formulation order and NNSA's budget process, both of which require the development of cost estimates, neither the order nor the process requires the use of best practices in developing the estimates. In February 2014, for example, GAO found that NNSA's lifecycle cost estimate for the Plutonium Disposition Program did not follow all key steps for developing high-quality cost estimates, in part because the agency did not have a requirement to develop a life-cycle cost estimate. In the absence of a requirement for using best practices, it is unlikely that DOE, NNSA, and their contractors will consistently develop reliable cost estimates.", "NNSA's project and program reviews issued during fiscal year 2009 through March 2014 identified cost estimating weaknesses that can be attributed to not following best practices. DOE and NNSA require independent project reviews, including reviews of cost estimates at certain stages of development and at the discretion of project managers. Of the 50 reviews GAO analyzed, 39 identified a total of 113 cost estimating weaknesses. GAO determined that 71 of the 113 weaknesses\u2014or about 63 percent\u2014can be attributed to not following four best practices: (1) determining the estimating structure, (2) identifying ground rules and assumptions, (3) conducting risk and uncertainty analysis, and (4) documenting the estimate. Neither DOE nor NNSA, however, requires reviews of program cost estimates. Of the three program reviews conducted during fiscal years 2009 to 2013, two were of the B61 Life Extension Program, which is to extend the operational life of this nuclear weapon. Both reviews identified weaknesses in the cost estimates that can be attributed to not following three best practices: (1) determining the estimating structure, (2) defining program characteristics, and (3) obtaining data. In addition, a February 2014 GAO report on NNSA's program to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium found that NNSA did not follow several cost estimating best practices, such as conducting an independent cost estimate and as a result, the program cost estimate was not reliable. While the program reviews and GAO's February 2014 report indicate weaknesses in a few program cost estimates, the extent of program cost estimate weaknesses is largely unknown because neither DOE nor NNSA requires reviews of program cost estimates.

We also  recommended that DOE revise its project management order to  require life-cycle cost estimates covering the full cost of programs that  include both construction projects and other efforts and activities not  related to construction. DOE concurred with recommendations to  analyze the programs cost increases and revise and update the  program life-cycle cost estimate following best practices.

Some of the near term efforts include development of a Life- Cycle Cost handbook, a Key Performance Parameters and Statement of  Work handbook, and Analysis of Alternatives guidance. In addition,  NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs has taken steps to fill the existing  gaps in the cost estimating framework for programs. For example, in  2011, Defense Programs established an Office of Cost Policy and  Analysis to provide it with a cost analysis capability. In March 2014,  NNSA\u2019s Office of Program Integration issued a cost estimating  improvement plan, which includes proposed guidance for conducting cost  estimate briefings to the Office of Defense Programs Assistant Deputy  Administrator, establishing a defense programs database, and  implementing various process improvements to improve cost accounting  and performance. While these efforts are intended to improve, among  other things, cost estimating practices, none of these efforts include  establishing requirements to follow cost estimating best practices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Project Reviews Indicate Cost Estimating Weaknesses and Program Reviews Are Not Required and Therefore the Extent of Weaknesses Is Largely Unknown", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s project and program reviews for fiscal years 2009 to 2014  identified cost estimating weaknesses that can be attributed to not  following best practices.

We determined that 71 of the 113 weaknesses\u2014or about 63 percent\u2014 can be attributed to not following 4 of the 12 best practice steps. These  four steps are: determining the estimating structure,  identifying ground rules and assumptions,  conducting risk and uncertainty analysis, and documenting the estimate.", "For example, as part of this review, we examined NNSA\u2019s 2012  independent review of the Nuclear Material Safeguards and Security  Upgrades Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory and it identified  three weaknesses, one of which can be attributed to not following the  best practice of updating the estimate to reflect actual costs and changes.  In particular, the review found deficiencies in the estimate that could lead  to an inaccurate cost and schedule estimate for the project. In another  example, a 2012 review of NNSA\u2019s Waste Solidification Building identified  four weaknesses, including not following the best practice of conducting  risk and uncertainty analysis. Several other reviews that we examined  found similar weaknesses in project cost estimating. For example, the  2012 Independent Project Review of the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility at  the Savannah River Site identified flaws in the project\u2019s cost estimate that  include: (1) basic assumptions concerning project reserves and  contingency cost; (2) data reliability of cost information considering the  design maturity of the project; (3) the sensitivity analysis; and (4) the  project risk analysis. The review also concluded that the most significant  risk to the project\u2019s success was NNSA\u2019s under-estimation of the cost to  complete the facility.", "We also found that the remaining 42 weaknesses could be attributed to  not following seven other best practice steps. These best practices are developing an estimating plan, defining program characteristics, developing a point estimate and comparing it to an ICE,  conducting a sensitivity analysis, presenting the estimate to management for approval, and updating the estimate to reflect actual costs and changes.", "Appendix II includes the cost estimating weaknesses we identified for  each of the project reviews we assessed and the best practice step not  followed to which the weakness can be attributed to not following."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Reviews Are Limited to LEPs So the Extent of Cost Estimating Weaknesses in NNSA Programs Is Largely Unknown", "paragraphs": ["DOE and NNSA do not require reviews of programs, including reviews of  program cost estimates. As a result, reviews of cost estimates for  programs are limited, and the extent to which program cost estimates  have weaknesses is largely unknown. While program reviews are not  required, we identified and analyzed three LEP program reviews from the  beginning of fiscal year 2009 through February 2014, two of which were  reviews of the B61 LEP. These identified several weaknesses in the cost  estimates for this program that can be attributed to not following three  best practice steps: (1) obtaining data, (2) defining program  characteristics, and (3) determining the estimating structure. For example,  both reviews identified weaknesses in obtaining the data needed to  compile the B61 cost estimate. In addition, one of the reviews noted that  the estimate was not based on a sound program definition, while the  other review stated that a standard WBS was not used to develop the  B61 LEP cost estimate. Both reviews concluded that the B61 cost  estimate is inaccurate, with one review noting that the program will cost  approximately $3.6 billion more than NNSA\u2019s 2011 $6.5 billion Weapon  Design and Cost Report estimate.", "While we did not identify any additional reviews of cost estimates for  NNSA programs, we reported in February 2014 on the results of our  review of the cost estimates for the Plutonium Disposition Program. We  concluded that the life-cycle cost estimate for the overall program was not  reliable and found that it did not fully reflect the characteristics of high- quality, reliable estimates as established by best practices. Specifically, in  developing its April 2013 draft life-cycle cost estimate of $24.2 billion for  the Plutonium Disposition Program, we found that NNSA followed several  cost estimating best practices; including obtaining the data, defining the  estimate\u2019s purpose, and defining the program\u2019s characteristics. However,  we also found that NNSA did not follow other key steps such as  conducting an independent cost estimate and, as a result, the estimate  was not reliable. We recommended, among other things, that NNSA  revise and update the program\u2019s life-cycle estimate using cost estimating  best practices, including conducting an independent cost estimate. NNSA  agreed with this recommendation.", "Without a requirement for conducting program reviews, NNSA does not  have the appropriate internal controls necessary for assessing program  performance. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, federal agencies are to employ internal control  activities, such as functional reviews by management of projects and  programs to compare actual performance to planned or expected results  throughout the organization and analyze significant differences.

Nonetheless, NNSA continues to struggle with significant cost overruns  on its major projects. Because DOE does not require the use of most of  the 12 cost estimating best practices for its projects and programs, it is  unlikely that NNSA and its contractors will consistently develop reliable  cost estimates. In addition, while DOE has developed a cost estimating  guide, it does not fully describe all 12 cost estimating best practices. As a  result, DOE and NNSA have not provided its contractors with all the  detailed guidance needed to consistently develop reliable cost estimates.  Also, because DOE Order 413.3B has not been updated since 2010, it  omits reference to the supplemental cost estimating guide; users of the  order may not be aware of the guide\u2019s availability and may not benefit  from its usefulness.

DOE stated that it has  established a log of issues to be addressed when revising Order 413.3B,  which includes this recommendation. DOE also stated that this  recommendation will be fully considered during this revision process. In  the interim, DOE stated that its cost estimating guide incorporates the 12  cost estimating best practices, albeit not in the same format as our  guidance. DOE also stated that it has begun internal efforts for the  publication of a Departmental Cost Estimating and Schedule Policy and  that the policy will complement existing cost estimating guidance and will  incorporate our cost estimating guidance.
