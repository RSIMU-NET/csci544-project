GAO was asked to review these programs.", "This report examines (1) how selected veterans and employers used the programs and how widely they have been used; (2) to what extent VA and states have taken steps to inform veterans and employers about these programs; (3) what challenges, if any, veterans and employers have faced in using them; and (4) to what extent VA has assessed the performance of its programs. GAO analyzed VA program data as of March 2015 and DOL program data from 2013 and 2014, and assessed outreach materials.

Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits were initially available only for higher education, but in 2011 provisions were enacted that expanded benefits to cover OJT and apprenticeship. Many veterans GAO interviewed (21 of 28) said that the supplemental income the programs provided helped them offset income losses they experienced when leaving the military. About half of the veterans responding to GAO's survey (80 of 156) reported that the program allowed them to use their GI Bill benefits even though college was not a good fit for them. Since OJT and apprenticeship benefits became available in 2011, about 27,000 of the 1.2 million veterans who have received Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits have participated in these programs.", "VA primarily provides information about the OJT and apprenticeship programs through mandatory briefings for transitioning servicemembers and on its website. While VA's outreach efforts include some information on these programs, VA's mandatory briefings and web resources generally emphasize higher education and lack sufficient detail for veterans to reasonably understand how to use their GI Bill benefits for OJT and apprenticeships. State officials GAO surveyed reported conducting outreach in a variety of ways, such as attending job fairs and speaking to veterans groups. Without more outreach, veterans who could benefit from these programs may not learn about them.", "Key challenges faced by veterans and employers using these programs include lack of awareness and administrative burdens, according to state officials, veterans, and employers GAO surveyed. Most state officials surveyed (39 of 44) reported that lack of awareness about the programs is a primary challenge they face in facilitating veteran and employer participation. Further, over half of state officials surveyed (24 of 42) cited challenges related to VA's current paper-based payment processing system, which requires employers to fax or mail monthly forms to VA in order for a veteran to receive benefits. In addition, 11 of the 15 employers and apprenticeship sponsors GAO interviewed said the process is burdensome or inefficient, and 6 of the 28 veterans GAO interviewed said their benefits have sometimes been delayed. VA is developing a new data system, but it may not be implemented until 2017 at the earliest, according to VA officials, and administrative challenges in the interim could hinder program participation.", "Little is known about the performance of VA's Post-9/11 GI Bill OJT and apprenticeship programs because VA does not measure program outcomes, such as whether participants retain employment after completing the program. Absent such information, GAO examined Department of Labor (DOL) outcome data for its related OJT and apprenticeship programs, which indicate the potential for positive outcomes for these training models. Standards for internal control call for establishing and reviewing performance measures to allow an agency to evaluate relevant data and take appropriate actions. Without such measures, VA is limited in its ability to assess its programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA improve outreach, ease administrative challenges, and establish outcome measures for its OJT and apprenticeship programs.

In 2011, provisions were enacted that  extended benefits under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance  Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) for eligible veterans interested in such  opportunities. Before those provisions were enacted, Post-9/11 GI Bill  benefits were available to attend a college or university, which may not be  the best path for every veteran. For those who may not be interested in  higher education, OJT and apprenticeships can offer interested veterans  an opportunity for employment and to improve their economic  opportunities.", "Given the importance of veterans\u2019 employment to their long-term financial  well-being, you asked us to examine the Post-9/11 GI Bill OJT and  apprenticeship programs administered by the U.S. Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA). This report provides information on the following  questions:  (1) How have selected veterans and employers used the Post-9/11  OJT and apprenticeship programs, and how widely have these  programs been used?  (2) To what extent have VA and states taken steps to inform veterans  and employers about these programs?  (3) What challenges, if any, do veterans and employers report facing  in using the Post-9/11 OJT and apprenticeship programs?  (4) To what extent has VA assessed the performance and  effectiveness of its Post-9/11 OJT and apprenticeship programs?", "Our approach for reviewing the Post-9/11 OJT and apprenticeship  programs was comprised of various methodologies. For example, we  conducted four surveys to gather various perspectives on aspects of the  programs that spanned several of our research questions, including  program use, outreach, and challenges veterans and employers reported  in using the programs. (See table 1.)", "For our first objective, we analyzed VA program data and conducted two  nongeneralizable surveys\u2014one of veterans who have participated in the  Post-9/11 GI Bill OJT or apprenticeship programs and one of employers  and apprenticeship sponsors who have participated in these programs.  Specifically, we requested and analyzed data from two VA datasets, the  Long Term Solution database, which includes information on the number  of veterans who have received Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits under the OJT  and apprenticeship programs, and the Web Enabled Approval  Management System, which includes information on the number of  approved OJT and apprenticeship facilities. For both sources, the data  VA provided covered participants, employers, and apprenticeship  sponsors who participated in the program between October 1, 2011,  when OJT and apprenticeship benefits first became available, and March  23, 2015, the most current data available at the time of our review. We  assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing existing information  about the data and the system that produced them and by interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For our  survey of participating veterans, we selected participants in a probability  sample stratified by gender. We sent a web-based survey to 5,200  veterans and received responses from 156. Similarly, for our survey of  participating employers and apprenticeship sponsors, we randomly  sampled 600 participating employers and apprenticeship sponsors with  email addresses, and received responses from 153. While not  generalizable, the findings from these surveys allowed us to provide a  greater range of participant perspectives than we could have gathered  through site visits alone.", "For our second objective, we conducted a third survey of officials in all 44  states that oversee the OJT and apprenticeship programs. We also  conducted site visits in Missouri and North Carolina and interviewed state  officials from an additional 11 states (Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana,  Maine, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and  Virginia.) We chose these 13 states to reflect a range in the number of  active OJT and apprenticeship programs, the number of Post-9/11  veterans within the population, and geographic location. While not  generalizable, the perspectives of officials in these 13 states provided  context and specific examples to supplement our survey findings. We  also analyzed VA and Department of Labor (DOL) website information,  and VA and DOL outreach materials. DOL separately administers an  apprenticeship program and OJT services in its programs serving adult  and dislocated workers. Because all servicemembers participating in the  Transition Assistance Program (TAP) must take VA Benefits I and II  courses, we analyzed curriculum materials from these courses. We  selected these portions of the TAP curriculum because they are intended  to be comprehensive and cover the entire spectrum of VA benefits for  servicemembers and their families. In analyzing what steps VA has  taken to inform veterans of these programs, we examined to what extent  VA materials include information on the Post-9/11 OJT and  apprenticeship programs. We compared these informational materials to  criteria established in the Plain Writing Act of 2010 and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government regarding agencies\u2019  communications with external stakeholders.", "For the third objective, we conducted a survey to learn whether a lack of  awareness among veterans could be a barrier to participation.  Specifically, we randomly sampled 5,150 veterans who used their GI Bill  benefits to attend a non-college degree program, such as a vocational  school, but did not participate in the OJT or apprenticeship programs, and  received responses from 127 veterans. Even though these results are not  generalizable, the survey provides information on the extent to which  survey respondents were aware of the OJT and apprenticeship programs.  We also analyzed results from our survey of state officials and our other  two non-generalizable surveys of participating veterans and of employers  and apprenticeship sponsors to identify their reported challenges. In  addition, we interviewed 28 participating veterans and 15 participating  employers and apprenticeship sponsors during our site visits to obtain  specific examples. Lastly, we compared information on VA\u2019s process for  submitting and processing paperwork for benefits with standards for  internal control in the federal government.", "For our fourth objective, we requested that VA provide outcome data for  its OJT and apprenticeship programs. In assessing VA\u2019s capability to  provide such data on program performance, we used as criteria  standards for internal control in the federal government and leading  practices for federally funded employment and training programs, as set  out in the Vice President\u2019s Job Driven Training Report. To provide  broader information on the performance of OJT and apprenticeship  training models, we obtained outcome data on DOL\u2019s programs. More  specifically, we requested and analyzed DOL outcome data on OJT  services in its programs serving adult and dislocated workers from the  Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) data on  Post-9/11 veterans in the fourth quarter of 2013. We also examined DOL  outcome data from 2014 pertaining to participants in Registered  Apprenticeship programs from the Registered Apprenticeship Partners  Information Management Data System (RAPIDS).We selected these  timeframes because they were the most current data available at the time  of our review. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing  existing information about the data and the system that produced them  and by interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. In addition, we interviewed experts on employment and training  programs to better understand the academic literature on the  effectiveness of DOL\u2019s OJT services and apprenticeship programs. While  the views of these experts are not generalizable, they helped provide  perspectives on the literature related to the effectiveness of OJT and  apprenticeship training models. Finally, for all objectives we reviewed  relevant federal laws and regulations.

VA\u2019s website has resources for individuals to learn  about GI Bill benefits, including a web page for the GI Bill, a web page  dedicated to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and a GI Bill Comparison Tool. While  there is also a web page for the OJT and apprenticeship programs, the  language used on the other GI Bill-focused web pages, and resources  generally, refers to higher education and does not reference OJT or  apprenticeships. For example, the main heading of the GI Bill web page is  \u201cEducation and Training.\u201d However, the rest of the page uses language  and visual cues that reference higher education, such as \u201cchoose a  school\u201d and \u201cverify school attendance.\u201d Moreover, the logo for the Post- 9/11 GI Bill\u2014a graduation cap with dog tag tassels\u2014further emphasizes  higher education to the exclusion of other types of GI Bill benefits.", "VA\u2019s GI Bill Comparison Tool also uses language that emphasizes higher  education, even though the tool can be used to access information on  employers. The main heading, for example, is \u201cChoosing a School,\u201d and  the options below are \u201cAbout Your School\u201d and \u201cCompare This School\u201d  even when an employer is chosen\u2014it may not be apparent to veterans  that they can use this tool to explore OJT and apprenticeship benefits.", "Lack of Sufficient Detail on OJT and Apprenticeship Programs  In addition, the information provided on VA\u2019s Post-9/11 GI Bill web page  and on its OJT and apprenticeship web page lacks enough detail for  users to reasonably understand how to use their GI Bill benefits for the  OJT and apprenticeship programs. For example, the page content does  not articulate how OJT programs are different from apprenticeship  programs\u2014a difference that could have meaningful career implications  for veterans. Participants in an apprentice program, for example, earn a  license or national industry certification and generally train longer, while  OJT participants generally receive a certificate of completion and train for  a shorter period of time. In addition, the web page lists three occupations  that might be available through OJT or apprenticeship, union plumber,  hotel manager, and firefighter, but does not provide additional details,  such as descriptions of what OJT or apprenticeship programs associated  with these occupations might involve, or testimonials on how actual  veterans used and benefited from these programs. In addition to the  requirements for clear and meaningful communication described in the  Plain Writing Act of 2010, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state that management should ensure there are adequate  means of communicating with external stakeholders in which there could  be a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. Further, VA\u2019s  strategic goals include empowering veterans to improve their well-being  and managing and improving VA operations to deliver seamless and  integrated support.

Prior to  2014, this process was not streamlined, and SAAs independently  assessed whether a Registered Apprenticeship program sponsor seeking  approval for GI Bill eligibility met these regulatory requirements. In  September 2014, the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Labor  announced that any DOL or State Apprenticeship Agency-approved  Registered Apprenticeship program was qualified to be approved under  the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The joint letter making this announcement was sent  to approximately 10,000 Registered Apprenticeship programs to alert  program officials that participating veterans could be eligible to receive  benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, according to VA officials. The letter  included detailed information on how Registered Apprenticeship  programs could obtain GI Bill approval and also contained two outreach  flyers. One flyer was designed for veterans. The other, for Registered  Apprenticeship sponsors, provided detailed information on the GI Bill  program and its benefits.", "DOL also conducted two additional outreach efforts, one targeted at  apprenticeship sponsors and the other at veterans, to raise awareness  that veterans can receive GI Bill benefits while participating in a DOL  Registered Apprenticeship program. Regarding the first effort, DOL  officials told us they created a pop-up window that appears when  apprenticeship sponsors enter information into the Registered  Apprenticeship database about a new apprentice. The pop-up window  reminds sponsors that their apprenticeship program is qualified to be  approved under the GI Bill, and that veteran apprentices may be entitled  to receive GI Bill benefits while participating in the program. The pop-up  window also links to several different resources created by both DOL and  VA that apprenticeship sponsors can use to learn more about VA\u2019s  program. Regarding the second outreach effort to veterans, DOL created  a Registered Apprenticeship website targeted specifically to veterans that  highlights the availability of GI Bill benefits for apprenticeships.

VA has taken a  first step towards easing these administrative challenges by deciding to  incorporate the OJT and apprenticeship programs into its development of  the new VA-CERTS data system to process program approvals and  benefit payments. However, this system may not be implemented until at  least 2017, and increasing numbers of veterans will become eligible for  Post-9/11 OJT and apprenticeship benefits as the military continues to  draw down its forces. In the interim, and in the absence of efforts to ease  administrative challenges for employers who experience difficulty in  submitting monthly certifications and for veterans who experience  delayed payments, some veterans will likely continue to experience  delayed payments.
