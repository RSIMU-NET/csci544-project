High turnover: Over half of all DDS directors surveyed said that examiner turnover was too high in their offices. We found that examiner turnover was about twice that of federal employees performing similar work. Nearly twothirds of all directors reported that turnover has increased SSA's hiring and training costs and claims-processing times. And two-thirds of all directors cited stressful workloads and noncompetitive salaries as major factors that contributed to turnover. Recruiting and hiring difficulties: More than three-quarters of all DDS directors said they had difficulties over a three-year period in recruiting and hiring examiners. Of these, more than three-quarters said these difficulties contributed to increases in claims-processing times, examiner caseload levels, backlogs, and turnover. More than half of all directors reported that state-imposed compensation limits contributed to hiring difficulties. Gaps in key skills: Nearly one-half of all DDS directors said that at least a quarter of their examiners needed additional training in areas critical to disability decision-making. Over half of all directors cited factors related to high workload levels as obstacles to examiners' receiving additional training. Despite the workforce challenges facing them, a majority of DDSs do not conduct long-term, comprehensive workforce planning. In prior reports, GAO found that such planning should include key strategies for recruiting, retaining, training, and otherwise developing a workforce capable of meeting long-term agency goals. However, of the DDSs that engage in longer-term workforce planning, a majority have plans that lack such key workforce planning strategies. Directors cited numerous obstacles to long-term workforce planning, such as lengthy state processes to approve DDS human capital changes. SSA's workforce efforts have not sufficiently addressed current and future DDS human capital challenges. Federal law requires agencies to include in their annual performance plans a description of the human capital strategies needed to meet their strategic goals. However, GAO's review of key SSA planning documents shows they do not include a strategic human capital plan that addresses current and future DDS human capital needs. Thus, SSA does not link its strategic objectives to a workforce plan that covers the very people who are essential to accomplishing those objectives. GAO also found that SSA has not provided human capital assistance in a consistent manner across the DDSs and that SSA's effectiveness in helping the DDSs negotiate human capital changes with the states can be limited by such factors as state budget problems and personnel rules. Finally, SSA has not used its authority to establish uniform human capital standards, such as minimum qualifications for examiners, which would address, on a nationwide basis, some of the DDS challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Disability Insurance  (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs paid about $74.1  billion to about 8.5 million individuals with disabilities. Under the Social  Security Act, SSA oversees and fully funds 54 primarily state-operated  Disability Determination Service (DDS) offices that determine whether  applicants are eligible for disability benefits. Key to the accuracy and  timeliness of these disability determinations are the more than 6,500  disability examiners employed by the DDSs to review medical and  vocational evidence and help decide eligibility for disability benefits. The  critical role played by the examiners will likely increase in the future, with  the projected dramatic growth over the next decade in the number of  applications for disability benefits as baby boomers enter their disability- prone years.", "In our prior work, we have noted that the DDSs are confronting an  impending retirement wave of skilled staff and stiff competition in the  labor market for qualified staff. At the same time, SSA is facing problems  with the accuracy and timeliness of its disability determinations. Beyond  these immediate challenges, the design of SSA\u2019s disability programs  remains grounded in outmoded concepts of disability that persist despite  scientific advances and economic and social changes that have redefined  the relationship between impairments and the ability to work. Because  other federal disability programs are also not in line with the current  status of science and the labor market, we designated modernizing federal  disability programs\u2014including SSA\u2019s DI and SSI programs\u2014as a high-risk  area in 2003. In September 2003, the Commissioner unveiled her vision of  a long-term strategy for improving the disability claims process to enhance  timeliness and accuracy of decisions and for testing work incentives and  opportunities aimed at helping people with disabilities return to work.  The success of such a fundamental reorientation of SSA\u2019s disability  determination process will depend greatly on having the staff with the  right skill mixes and areas of expertise available when and where needed.  DDS workforces will be a critical component in any future restructuring  undertaken by SSA to modernize its disability programs.", "In view of the significance of human capital management in the DDSs, this  report addresses (1) the challenges the DDSs face today in retaining and  recruiting examiners and enhancing their expertise, (2) the extent to  which the DDSs engage in workforce planning and encounter obstacles in  doing so, and (3) the extent to which SSA is addressing present and future  human capital challenges in the DDSs.", "To address these issues, we surveyed directors of 52 of the 54 primarily  state-operated DDSs. Our survey included questions about long-term  workforce planning, recruiting and hiring, compensation, training and  development, and retention of disability examiners. We also collected  human capital data from the federal DDS, which provides case-processing  assistance to state DDSs during periods of high workload demands, among  other responsibilities.", "For the purposes of this report, strategic workforce planning is a  framework for decision-making that aims to ensure that an organization  has the people with the right skills, available when and where needed, to  respond to change and accomplish the agency\u2019s strategic goals. To be  effective, workforce planning must be fully integrated with the agency\u2019s  mission and goals and must be based on accurate and comprehensive  workforce data. While such planning can include a range of programs and  strategies, our prior work has found that the following strategies are key  to effective workforce planning, including  recruiting strategies,  retention strategies,  training and professional development strategies,    compensation strategies,    performance expectation and evaluation strategies,    employee-friendly workplace strategies,    succession planning and strategies for maintaining expertise in the long    contingency plans, in the event that resource levels do not meet  expectations.", "In addition, we reviewed relevant documents, including SSA laws,  regulations, and procedures, and other pertinent laws. We also obtained  and analyzed human capital data from DDSs, SSA, and other federal  agencies. We interviewed disability examiners and their managers at two  DDSs to gain an in-depth understanding of the issues related to our  objectives. We also visited three SSA regional offices, interviewing  officials who are responsible for DDS management assistance and serve as  liaisons between SSA regional offices, the DDSs, and their respective state  governments. In addition, we interviewed SSA officials at headquarters  and a variety of key stakeholders such as officials of the National Council  of Disability Determination Directors, the National Association of  Disability Examiners, and staff of the Social Security Advisory Board.

The DI program, established in  1956 by the Social Security Act, provides monthly cash benefits to workers  with disabilities (and their dependents and survivors) whose employment  history qualifies them for disability benefits. In 2002, SSA paid about $55.5  billion in DI benefits to 5.5 million workers with disabilities (age 18 to 64).  SSI is a means-tested income assistance program created in 1972 that  provides a financial safety net for individuals who are aged or blind or  have other disabilities and who have low income and limited resources.

Under these agreements, SSA\u2019s primary  role was to fund the states\u2019 disability operations. However, following  criticism from GAO and others about the quality and uniformity of the  disability determination process, Congress amended the Social Security  Act in 1980 to strengthen SSA management of the disability programs and  allow greater SSA control and oversight of the DDSs. The 1980  amendments directed SSA to issue regulations specifying performance  standards and administrative requirements to be followed to assure  effective and uniform administration of disability determinations across  the nation.", "The regulations issued by SSA, which established the current federal-state  relationship, allow SSA to remove the disability determination function  from a state if the DDS fails to make determinations that meet thresholds  for performance accuracy and processing time. SSA\u2019s regulations give  DDSs maximum managerial flexibility in meeting the performance  standards, allowing them to retain substantial independence in how they  manage their workforce. For example, under the regulations, the DDSs  are to follow state personnel standards in selection, tenure, and  compensation of DDS employees.", "As employees of the state, DDS staff are subject to the rules and  regulations of each state\u2019s individual personnel classification system.  Classification systems generally categorize positions on the basis of job  responsibilities and the knowledge, skills, and competencies required to  perform them. Within a classification system, a group of positions that  have sufficiently similar responsibilities are put in the same class.  Arranging positions in classes with common levels of difficulty and  responsibility makes it possible to set ranges of compensation for whole  classes of jobs across multiple state agencies. Specifying the  responsibilities of each position also allows the state to identify and  develop effective hiring qualifications, promotion criteria, and training  requirements. The development and operation of such a classification  system depend upon the adequacy of information about individual  positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Description of the DDSs and the Disability Examiner Position", "paragraphs": ["Within the federal-state relationship, each DDS reports to its own state  government, usually to a parent agency such as the state vocational  rehabilitation agency. DDS staff generally include a variety of positions,  such as medical consultants, vocational specialists, quality assurance  personnel, as well as disability examiners. The number of disability  examiners varies substantially among the DDSs. Data from our survey  show that the number of full-time permanent examiners in each DDS  ranged from 9 to 529 at the end of fiscal year 2002. Our prior work has  found that the examiner\u2019s job\u2014which involves working with medical  consultants to determine impairment severity, ability to function, and  disability benefit eligibility\u2014requires considerable expertise and  knowledge of complex regulations and policies. And according to the  Social Security Advisory Board, changes in agency rules and in the types  of disability claims received by the DDSs have made disability   decision-making more subjective and difficult. In addition, as part of its  efforts to reduce claims-processing times, SSA has been testing a new  disability examiner position called the single decision-maker (SDM),  which would expand an examiner\u2019s authority to independently decide  claimants\u2019 eligibility for benefits. 20 DDSs are testing this new position.", "Qualification requirements for new examiner hires vary substantially  among the states. While five DDSs require a master\u2019s or a registered  nursing degree for certain new examiner hires, figure 1 shows that over  one-third of all DDSs can hire new examiners with either a high school  diploma or less. In addition, data show that examiners in nearly one-half  of all DDSs are covered by union agreements, and issues related to  compensation levels, hiring and promotion procedures, and weekly hours  worked are open to union negotiation in the majority of these DDSs.", "To enhance the skills of both new and experienced examiners, SSA  provides a number of optional training tools to the DDSs, including written  materials covering new examiner basic training, interactive video  programs supplementing basic training and providing refresher training  and updates on policy changes, and materials and presentations provided  by the regional offices and SSA headquarters. However, states have  primary responsibility for training examiners, and many DDSs adapt or  supplement SSA\u2019s training to meet their examiners\u2019 training needs. DDSs  generally provide new examiners with SSA\u2019s basic examiner training,  followed by extensive on-the-job training, including mentoring by  experienced examiners who guide the less experienced examiners in  becoming more proficient in the disability claims process. New hires  generally are not considered fully proficient until after one to two years of  experience.", "The DDSs\u2019 ability to hire examiners is affected by both SSA and state  government funding decisions and hiring policies. SSA determines the  funding available for each DDS and advises the DDSs about the number of  full-time equivalent staff supported by this funding, and SSA adjusts these  levels throughout the fiscal year based on workload fluctuations and  funding availability. Normally SSA allows DDSs to replace staff who leave  the DDS as long as they remain within authorized staffing levels, but for  over half of fiscal year 2003, SSA froze DDS hiring, preventing DDSs from  hiring new examiners or replacing those who had left. SSA officials told us  that the temporary freeze was necessary to ensure that SSA\u2019s expenditures  did not exceed authorized levels and to avoid future layoffs of DDS staff.", "DDSs also have experienced state government hiring restrictions in recent  years. Despite full federal funding, under the current federal-state  relationship, DDSs generally cannot spend funds for new personnel  without the approval of their state governments. States currently are  facing severe budget crises, causing them to cut their payrolls for most  state government functions. When states use methods such as hiring  freezes, reductions in force, and early retirement incentives to limit  spending on state employee payrolls, these policies sometimes prevent  DDSs from hiring and retaining examiners at levels authorized by SSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modernizing Federal Disability Programs Designated as a High-Risk Area", "paragraphs": ["In earlier reports, we have noted that SSA\u2019s disability determination  process is mired in concepts from the past and needs to be brought into  line with the current state of science, medicine, technology, and labor  market conditions. With other federal disability programs similarly  structured around outmoded concepts, we designated modernizing federal  disability programs\u2014including SSA\u2019s DI and SSI disability programs\u2014as a  high-risk area in 2003. (See appendix III for a list of GAO reports on  modernizing federal disability programs.) We made this designation owing  in part to SSA\u2019s (1) outmoded concepts of disability, (2) lengthy  processing times, and (3) decisional inconsistencies:    SSA\u2019s outmoded concepts of disability. While technological and  medical advances and societal changes have increased the potential for  some people with disabilities to participate in the labor force, few DI and  SSI beneficiaries leave the disability rolls to work. Our prior work shows  that, unlike some private sector disability insurers and social insurance  systems in other countries, SSA does not incorporate into its disability  eligibility assessment process an evaluation of what is needed for an  individual to return to work. These private insurers and other social  insurance systems have access to staff with a wide range of expertise to  apply, not only in making eligibility decisions, but also in providing return- to-work assistance. We have recommended that SSA develop a  comprehensive return-to-work strategy that integrates earlier  identification of work capacities and the expansion of such capacities by  providing return-to-work assistance for applicants and beneficiaries.  Adopting such a strategy is likely to require fundamental changes to the  disability determination process, as well as changes to staff skill mixes and  areas of expertise.", "Lengthy processing times for disability claims. The disability claims  process can be lengthy, with many individuals who appeal SSA\u2019s initial  decision waiting a year or longer for final decisions on their benefit claims.  According to SSA, a claimant can wait as long as 1,153 days from initial  claim through a decision from the Appeals Council. As one means of  reducing its claims-processing time, SSA aims to eliminate backlogs for  initial disability claims, hearings, and appeals by 2008. Nevertheless,  growth in the disability claims workload is likely to exacerbate SSA\u2019s  claims-processing challenges: SSA expects the DI rolls to grow by 35  percent between 2002 and 2012.", "Inconsistencies in disability decisions. SSA has had difficulty ensuring  that decisions regarding a claimant\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits are  accurate and consistent across adjudicative levels and locations, raising  questions about the fairness, integrity, and cost of these programs. For  example, the Social Security Advisory Board has shown wide variances  among the DDSs in rates of allowances and denials of disability benefits.  The Advisory Board has cited differences in state-established personnel  policies such as salaries, training, and qualifications of disability  examiners across the DDSs, along with state economic and demographic  differences, as some of the key factors that may affect the consistency of  disability decision-making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s New Long-Term Strategy for Improving Its Disability Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Commissioner\u2019s September 2003 testimony sets forth her long-term  strategy for improving the timeliness and accuracy of the disability claims  process and fostering return to work for people with disabilities. For  example, to speed decisions for some claimants, the Commissioner  intends to initiate an expedited decision for claimants with more easily  identifiable disabilities, such as aggressive cancers. Under this new  approach, special units located primarily in SSA\u2019s regional offices would  handle the expedited claims, leaving DDS examiners responsible for  evaluating the more complex claims. The Commissioner\u2019s strategy also  aims to increase decisional accuracy by, among other approaches,  requiring DDS examiners to develop more complete documentation of  their disability determinations, including explaining the basis for their  decisions. Beyond steps to improve the timeliness and accuracy of the  process, the Commissioner also plans to conduct several demonstrations  aimed at helping people with disabilities return to work by providing work  incentives and opportunities earlier in the disability process.", "In addition, to improve the disability decision process, the Commissioner  has implemented some shorter-term remedies while developing her  longer-range strategies. For example, SSA is accelerating its transition to  an electronic disability claims folder, through which the DDSs, the field  offices, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals are to be linked to one  another. The folder is being designed to transmit case file data  electronically from one claims-processing location to another and to serve  as a data repository\u2014storing documents that are keyed in, scanned, or  faxed.

We also noted that effective workforce planning must be  fully integrated with an agency\u2019s mission and program goals and be based  on accurate and comprehensive workforce data. We recently identified a  few key principles for strategic workforce planning. These principles  include  involving top management, employees, and other key stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing the workforce plan;   determining the critical skills and competencies needed to achieve current  and future program goals, and developing strategies to fill identified gaps;   building the capability necessary to address administrative, educational, or  other requirements to support the workforce strategies; and   monitoring and evaluating progress in meeting workforce goals and how  well the workforce plan has contributed to reaching overall program goals.", "Congress has additionally recognized the importance of workforce  planning and, in 2002, added to the Government Performance and Results  Act a provision requiring agencies to include human capital strategies  needed to meet their strategic goals in their annual performance plans.

Our analysis of data from our survey  and from federal agencies shows that, over fiscal years 2000 through 2002,  DDS examiner turnover was about twice that of Veterans Benefits  Administration (VBA) disability examiners with responsibilities similar to  those of DDS examiners. For example, DDS examiner turnover averaged  13 percent over fiscal years 2000 to 2002, compared with 6 percent for VBA  disability examiners. (See table 1.) In addition, during the same period, the  turnover rate of DDS examiners was substantially greater than that of all  SSA employees as well as that of all federal government employees. DDS  examiner turnover has been even higher among new hires: turnover of  examiners hired in fiscal year 2001 was 25 percent, compared with 14  percent among all DDS examiners. Moreover, while it is typical for new  hires to leave at higher rates than other employees, turnover of new DDS  examiners was considerably higher than that of new VBA examiners, new  SSA employees, and all new federal government employees in fiscal years  2000 and 2001.", "Our survey results also show that examiner turnover is particularly high in  some DDSs. An examination of three-year averages (fiscal years 2000 to  2002) of DDS turnover rates showed that one DDS had a turnover rate of  43 percent, and a quarter of the DDSs had turnover rates of 20 percent or  greater. (See fig. 2.)", "When we asked DDS directors in our survey about the consequences of  turnover, they told us that examiner turnover increased hiring and training  costs and hindered claims processing by decreasing overall examiner skill  levels, and increasing examiner caseloads, claims-processing times, and  backlogs, as follows:    Increased hiring and training costs. Nearly two-thirds of all DDS  directors reported in our survey that turnover had increased SSA\u2019s  recruiting, hiring, or training costs. Directors and other DDS officials  explained in interviews why these costs had increased as a result of  turnover. Some DDS directors said that they must invest time in reviewing  applications, interviewing candidates, and making hiring decisions. They  also said they have to provide inexperienced new hires with 12 to 18  months of extensive training and mentoring. SSA estimates the cost of  turnover of its own employees at 1.5 times average annual salary. Using  this rate, we estimate that the cost of DDS examiner turnover in fiscal year  2002 was in the tens of millions of dollars.", "Decreased overall examiner skill levels. Two-thirds of all DDS  directors reported that losses of experienced staff due to turnover have  decreased overall examiner skill levels. While SSA officials told us that  one to two years of experience is generally required to become proficient  in the examiner role, our survey data show that, in two-thirds of the DDSs,  at least a quarter of examiners had two years or less experience at the end  of fiscal year 2002.", "Increased examiner caseloads. Nearly two-thirds of all DDS directors  we surveyed said turnover had increased examiner caseload levels. DDS  directors and SSA officials explained in interviews and survey comments  that the caseloads of examiners who leave the DDS have to be  redistributed among those who remain. Some directors told us that these  higher caseloads created a more stressful work environment for the  remaining employees.", "Increased claims-processing times and backlogs. Our survey results  showed that over one-half of all directors said that turnover had increased  DDS claims-processing times and backlogs. DDS directors and SSA  officials we spoke with explained that turnover increased claims- processing times because new examiners hired to fill vacancies are less  productive due to their inexperience and time spent in training. These  officials also told us that the productivity of experienced staff is lowered  while they are training and mentoring the new examiners. SSA itself  acknowledged the potential impact on service in a 2001 internal document.  This document noted that the need to replace retiring managers, by  drawing from an examiner pool already diminished by turnover, would  further reduce the examiner ranks and exacerbate the challenge of  processing the growing claims workload. In addition, we noted in a prior  report that a majority of DDS directors expressed the view that examiner  turnover is likely to jeopardize their ability to complete periodic reviews of  beneficiaries\u2019 disability status, known as continuing disability reviews,  potentially contributing to backlogs of these reviews.  When we asked DDS directors about causes of examiner turnover, more  than two-thirds identified each of the following as contributing factors:   (1) large examiner caseloads along with workplace stress, high production  expectations, and highly complex work and (2) noncompetitive pay.", "High caseloads, stress, production expectations, and highly  complex work. Over two-thirds of all DDS directors identified large  examiner caseloads, a stressful workplace, high production expectations  for the number of cases completed, and the highly complex nature of the  work as factors contributing to examiner turnover. DDS directors  explained in interviews that the combination of growth in the claims  workloads and increasingly complex examiner responsibilities is making  the examiner position more challenging and stressful. DDS directors also  noted in our survey and in interviews that insufficient staffing had  increased the caseloads and stress levels of their examiners. Nearly 9 out  of 10 DDS directors surveyed reported that the number of examiners in  their DDSs had not been sufficient for their workload in at least one of the  past three fiscal years, and nearly all of these directors said that this  understaffing had resulted in a more stressful work environment.", "Noncompetitive pay. Two-thirds of all directors stated that  noncompetitive pay had contributed to examiner turnover. Our survey  data showed that many state DDS examiners were paid substantially less  than examiners employed by the federal DDS in 2002 despite comparable  skills and experience. Specifically, all of the state DDSs for which we  have data have average examiner salaries that are less than the federal  DDS average salary, and over half of the DDSs (31) have an average  examiner salary that is less than two-thirds of the federal DDS average  salary. In addition, we found that DDS examiner salaries are substantially  lower than those of VBA examiners nationwide. For example, the average  salary for DDS examiners was $40,464 in 2002, compared with $49,684 for  VBA examiners. Specifically, we found that average DDS examiner  salaries are less than those of VBA examiners in 47 states. (See fig. 3.)  Several DDS directors told us in interviews that examiners have left some  DDSs to accept higher salaries in federal agencies, particularly in SSA  offices. For example, our analysis of selected case data provided by two  DDS directors showed that, between 2000 and 2003, 13 former examiners  received pay increases ranging from 9 to 48 percent when they moved  from their DDSs to positions in SSA offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DDSs Face Difficulties in Recruiting and Hiring Partly Due to State- Imposed Personnel Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["In addition to facing high turnover and growing caseloads, more than  three-quarters of all DDS directors (43) reported experiencing difficulties  over a three-year period in recruiting and hiring enough people who could  become successful examiners.

For example, one SSA official  explained that, because of state-imposed hiring restrictions, one DDS  developed a large backlog of cases that negatively affected its  productivity.", "When we asked DDS directors what made it difficult for their DDSs to  recruit and hire, they said that the following factors, many of which were  related to state personnel restrictions, made it moderately to much more  difficult than it would be otherwise to recruit and hire:    state limits on examiner salaries and other forms of compensation,   restrictive job classification system for state employees,    state-imposed hiring limitations or hiring freezes and lengthy time periods  for the state to hire DDS examiners, and    SSA-imposed hiring restrictions and budget allocations limiting DDS  staffing levels.", "State limits on examiner salaries and other forms of compensation.  More than two-thirds of all directors reported that state limits on examiner  salaries hindered recruiting and hiring, and the same proportion reported  that noncompetitive salaries were insufficient to recruit or retain staff with  the skills necessary to assume enhanced examiner responsibilities. One  DDS director noted in survey comments that the low entry-level salary for  examiners in that particular state no longer attracted \u201c\u2026the caliber of  employees needed to perform the increasingly complex  job.\u201d  Another commented that, owing to noncompetitive salaries, job  candidates \u201c\u2026who have the requisite combination of skills needed as a   will find better offers of employment,  either  better pay or less workload stress.\u201d And officials we spoke with in an SSA  regional office said that low examiner salaries in still another DDS have  meant that this DDS has been unable to recruit candidates with strong  analytical skills. They noted that the DDS has, therefore, had difficulty  training its new examiners in such challenging tasks as weighing the  credibility of medical and other evidence. In addition to citing limits on  salaries, more than half of all directors reported that state limits on other  forms of compensation, such as performance-based pay and hiring  bonuses, also contributed to recruiting and hiring difficulties.", "Restrictive job classification system.

The immediate challenges that DDS  directors face today in maintaining and improving the examiner workforce  are unlikely to lessen with time and will likely have even more severe  consequences as the DDSs confront increasing numbers of applicants for  disability benefits. The critical task of making disability decisions is  complex, requiring strong analytical skills and considerable expertise, and  it will become even more demanding with the implementation of the  Commissioner\u2019s new long-term improvement strategy and the projected  growth in workload. Moreover, because SSA has not set uniform minimum  qualifications for examiners, some DDSs may find it difficult to justify an  appropriate job classification and level of compensation needed to recruit  and retain these critical employees.", "Without a plan to develop and maintain a skilled workforce\u2014as well as  measures to establish uniform minimum qualifications for examiners,  close critical skill gaps, and improve training\u2014SSA\u2019s ability to provide  high-quality service to disability claimants could be further weakened by  gaps in critical competency areas and the loss of experienced DDS  examiners due to high turnover. As vacancies are filled by new hires and  trainees who need one to two years to become fully productive, the DDSs  will likely have difficulty maintaining skill levels and successfully coping  with expected high growth in workloads. The combination of decreased  overall skill levels and increased workload could make the work  environment even more stressful, further increasing turnover. This  spiraling effect, if not addressed, could undermine the agency\u2019s efforts to  ensure that disability decisions are made accurately, consistently, and in a  timely manner.", "A strategic workforce plan is even more critical to the Commissioner\u2019s  long-term strategy for improving the disability claims process and her  ability to bring SSA\u2019s approach to disability decision-making in line with  the current state of science, medicine, technology, and labor market  conditions. Failure to look ahead and plan to ensure that the appropriate  mix of skills and capabilities are available when and where needed could  obstruct SSA\u2019s progress as it seeks to fundamentally restructure its  disability programs to improve the accuracy and timeliness of decisions  and focus on identifying and enhancing claimants\u2019 productive capacities.

It should  additionally enable SSA to anticipate and plan for the future workforce  that will be needed as SSA modernizes and fundamentally transforms  its approach to disability decision-making. To develop and implement  this comprehensive workforce plan, SSA should work in partnership  with the DDSs and their parent agencies. As part of the planning  process, SSA should:  a. Identify a small number of key DDS indicators of human capital  performance, including recruiting and hiring measures, level of stress  in the workplace, training needs, and turnover. SSA should establish  standards for acceptable performance on these indicators, routinely  collect and analyze the data to identify trends, and use this information  to guide decisions regarding future DDS workforce needs and the  strategies to meet them.  b. Provide necessary tools and technical assistance to the DDSs to  enable them to conduct long-term workforce planning. SSA should  ensure that SSA staff responsible for providing this assistance are well  trained in the tenets of workforce planning.  c. Require each DDS to develop its own long-term workforce plan that  is linked to the nationwide long-term DDS workforce plan. SSA should  work in partnership with the DDSs and their parent agencies to  develop these plans.  d. Establish an ongoing program of outreach from SSA\u2019s leadership to  state governors and national associations of state government officials  to discuss the benefits and challenges of the federal-state relationship  and encourage them to address human capital challenges identified by  DDS directors, such as salary limits and hiring freezes.  e. Link performance expectations of appropriate SSA executives to  their efforts in accomplishing goals and objectives of the workforce  plan.  2.  Issue regulations that establish uniform minimum qualifications for  new disability examiners. The minimum qualifications should be based  on an analysis of the position that identifies the examiner\u2019s  responsibilities and the minimum knowledge, skills, and competencies  necessary to adequately perform them. The minimum qualifications for  the examiner\u2019s position should take into account any changes in the  complexity of the tasks required for this position stemming from the  Commissioner\u2019s new long-term strategy.  3.  Work with DDSs to close the gaps between current examiner skills and  required job skills. To do so, SSA should work with the DDSs to:  a. analyze examiner training needs, using as a foundation the analysis  of job responsibilities and related minimum knowledge, skills, and  competencies recommended above;  b. improve training content and delivery to meet these needs, basing  such efforts on analyses of training content and appropriateness of  training delivery methods; and  c. develop performance measures to track effectiveness of these  improvements to training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SSA for comment. SSA generally  agreed with the intent of the recommendations in the report but stated  that the report does not fairly address or adequately discuss the many  sides of the DDS human capital management issues. In particular, SSA  criticized some of our study\u2019s methods and expressed concern that we did  not sufficiently acknowledge the difficulties involved in making changes to  the federal-state relationship. We continue to believe, however, that the  report presents a fair and balanced portrayal of the multifaceted issue of  human capital management in the DDSs.", "Generally agreeing with the intent of our recommendations, SSA said it  would consider incorporating a nationwide strategic workforce plan for  the DDSs into its current strategy to improve the disability determination  process. To do so will be essential, since the Government Performance  and Results Act now requires agencies to report annually, as we noted in  our report, on human capital strategies needed to meet their strategic  goals. Regarding our recommendation on improving training, SSA said that  it would continue ongoing efforts to improve examiner job skills. Results  from our survey of DDS directors, however, revealed gaps in critical  examiner knowledge and skills and a large proportion of DDS directors  who would be able to spend fewer resources on adapting SSA\u2019s training if  SSA were to improve the quality, completeness, and timeliness of its  training. Given such results, our report recommended that SSA go beyond  its current efforts and base its training improvement initiatives on a  systematic assessment of the examiner\u2019s job responsibilities and related  knowledge, skills, and competencies. In terms of our recommendation on  outreach, SSA said that it is already conducting an outreach program to  state officials and that it intends to engage in discussions with the NGA on  DDS issues. While we noted efforts on the part of SSA\u2019s regional offices to  negotiate human capital changes with state governments, we maintain that  SSA\u2019s outreach program requires the sustained attention of SSA\u2019s  leadership at the national level. SSA\u2019s expressed intent to pursue such  discussions with the NGA is therefore a step in the right direction.", "SSA criticized some of our study methods, saying that we relied heavily on  opinions of DDS directors and used rather leading and ambiguous survey  questions. In terms of survey design, we surveyed DDS directors because  their first-hand experiences make them some of the most knowledgeable  respondents about human capital challenges experienced in their  organizations. In addition, our survey was developed in accordance with  GAO\u2019s guidance on survey design and development, including extensive  pretesting with current and former DDS directors to identify potential  question bias and to clarify wording. We also gave SSA disability program  officials, on two occasions, the opportunity to review and comment on the  survey. Following the second review, the SSA official coordinating the  review said that, while some of the questions might be difficult for the  DDS directors to answer, we should go ahead with the survey as it stood.  The official did not refer to any bias in the survey questions. SSA also was  concerned that we administered the survey at a time of budget constraint  that SSA said influenced some of the directors\u2019 responses. Our survey,  however, reflects ongoing challenges facing the DDSs and was not limited  to the particular circumstances of 2003. Further, our study findings did not  rest solely on the opinions expressed in our survey of DDS directors. In  addition to the survey, we gathered information through interviews with  several other sources as well, including officials at two DDSs, three SSA  regional offices, and SSA headquarters; officials of the National Council of  Disability Determination Directors and the National Association of  Disability Examiners; and staff of the Social Security Advisory Board. We  also reviewed pertinent laws, regulations, and procedures, and obtained  and analyzed human capital data from several sources.", "SSA was also concerned that we did not sufficiently acknowledge the  attitudes of the states toward modifying federal regulations to establish  uniform human capital standards and the complexities involved in such  regulatory changes, such as the problems that SSA says it would face if a  large state declined to make disability determinations and transferred  these responsibilities to the federal government. We acknowledged in our  report the difficulties SSA has encountered in convincing the DDSs to  comply with SSA guidelines on personnel issues, due in part to the states\u2019  perceptions of infringements on traditional state responsibilities. We also  stressed that establishing uniform minimum qualifications for examiners  will be difficult, requiring delicate and time-consuming discussions with  some state governments. But we maintain that, despite the difficulties,  SSA is obligated to address the human capital challenges facing the DDSs.   An outreach program involving SSA\u2019s leadership and a close working  partnership among SSA, the DDSs, and their state parent agencies will be  vital to help ensure the success of SSA\u2019s efforts.", "In addition, SSA expressed a number of other concerns about the draft  report. These concerns, as well as our comments on them, are provided in  full in appendix IV.", "Copies of this report are being sent to the Commissioner of SSA,  appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

We did not  survey directors in Guam and the South Carolina Office for the Blind  because these offices each had only one disability examiner. We mailed  surveys to 53 DDS directors and received responses from all of them.  However, because most of the questions in our survey do not apply to the  federal DDS, we reported results for 52 DDSs. Our survey included  questions about long-term workforce planning, recruiting and hiring,  compensation, training and development, and retention of disability  examiners. The survey results in this report represent the views of the  DDS directors and do not necessarily represent the views of examiners or  other DDS staff or the views of Social Security Administration (SSA)  officials.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey introduce various types  of errors related to survey responses. For example, differences in how a  particular question is interpreted and differences in the sources of  information available to respondents can be sources of error. In addition,  respondents might not be uniformly conscientious in expressing their  views or they may be influenced by concerns about how their answers  might be viewed by GAO, SSA, or the public. We included steps in both the  data collection and analysis stages for the purpose of minimizing such  errors. For example, to address differences in how questions were  interpreted, we asked two members of the Social Security Advisory Board,  as well as current and past officers of the National Council of Disability  Determination Directors and the National Association of Disability  Examiners, to review and critique the survey questions before pretesting.  SSA disability program officials also reviewed our survey on two  occasions. In addition, we pretested the survey with four former DDS  directors and four current DDS directors. We modified the survey  questions based on the results of these pretests.", "Because we conducted our survey while 20 DDSs were testing the  feasibility of implementing an examiner position with enhanced  responsibilities, we tailored a few of the survey questions to be relevant  for those DDSs testing these enhanced positions as well as for those not  testing such positions. We also tailored questions for California\u2019s survey,  which had separate offices testing and not testing the enhanced examiner  position. In addition, we tailored questions for the survey that went to the  federal DDS.", "To address possible director concerns about how their answers might be  viewed, we stated in the introduction to the survey that their responses  would be reported in summary form only, without being individually  identified, and that their responses would not be released unless requested  by a member of Congress (see appendix II for a copy of our survey)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Data from Our Survey and Other Sources", "paragraphs": ["When we analyzed the data from our survey, where possible, we checked  survey answers involving numbers and percentages to ensure they  summed correctly.

To do this, we compared the turnover rate of DDS examiners  with that of Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) examiners, SSA  employees, and all federal employees. VBA examiners were selected  because they perform duties similar to DDS examiners, such as developing  claims using medical and disability program knowledge. We compared  DDS examiner turnover rates with SSA turnover rates because SSA fully  funds the DDSs to achieve its disability program mission. The federal  employee turnover rate was selected as a general baseline.", "We used data from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Central  Personnel Data File (CPDF) to calculate turnover rates for VBA  examiners, SSA employees, and all federal employees. We counted how  many permanent employees in each group left their position in each of  fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. For VBA examiners and SSA employees,  transfers to other agencies were counted as separations. For all federal  employees, only separations from federal service were counted as  separations. To calculate overall turnover, we divided the number  separated each year by the average of the number of staff (which we  obtained by averaging the number of staff at the beginning of the fiscal  year and the number of staff at the end of the fiscal year).", "We also calculated a new hire turnover rate. We defined a new hire  separation as a separation of an employee hired in one fiscal year who left  before the end of the following fiscal year (for example, hired in fiscal year  2000 and left before the end of fiscal year 2001). To determine the turnover  rate for new hires, we counted all career and career conditional  appointments for each fiscal year 2000 and 2001. We then determined how  many of these separated before the end of the following fiscal year and  divided this by the number of new hires in the prior fiscal year. We also  calculated turnover rates for DDS examiners using the same formulas.", "We also compared DDS examiner salaries with VBA examiner salaries. We  analyzed data from OPM\u2019s CPDF to calculate the average base salary,  including locality adjustments, for VBA examiners state by state. We  divided each DDS\u2019s average examiner salary by the average VBA examiner  salary for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This  resulted in a measure of DDS average salary relative to average VBA  examiner salaries for each location.", "When we analyzed salaries of examiners who left DDSs to accept higher  salaries in federal agencies, directors of two DDSs provided information  on both the salaries of these examiners while they were employed by the  DDSs, and on the federal General Schedule (GS) grade levels for their new  SSA positions. To determine SSA salaries, we used the 2002 federal  government GS pay scale, including locality adjustments. For cases in  which the directors provided us with two possible SSA grade levels, we  used the first step of the lower grade in our analysis. Three of these  disability examiners also served as quality assurance reviewers, hearing  officers, or trainers while employed in their DDS.

We believe that the report presents a fair and balanced portrayal of the  multifaceted issue of human capital management in the DDSs. We  designed the survey to obtain DDS directors\u2019 opinions about the extent  to which, if any, a DDS had experienced certain human capital  challenges and the likely factors and consequences involved.   Moreover, the opinions were obtained from directors whose first-hand  experiences make them some of the most knowledgeable sources of  information about such issues in their organizations. But in addition to  our survey, our overall study methods relied on information and data  from several other sources as well. For example, we interviewed  disability examiners and their managers at two DDSs, officials  responsible for DDS management assistance at three of SSA\u2019s regional  offices, SSA officials at headquarters, officials of the National Council  of Disability Determination Directors and the National Association of  Disability Examiners, and staff of the Social Security Advisory Board.   We also reviewed pertinent laws, regulations, and procedures, and  obtained and analyzed human capital data from the DDSs, SSA, and  other federal agencies.", "Our survey was developed in accordance with GAO's guidance on  survey design and development. To avoid the potential for questions  to be leading, on every question in which we asked for directors\u2019  opinions, we gave them the opportunity to say that they did not  experience that particular challenge, contributing factor, or  consequence. To this end, we constructed the questions so that the  first response choice was \u201cno extent\u201d or equivalent wording. In  addition, each question was specifically assessed for possible bias or  problematic wording during extensive survey pretesting. We pretested  the survey eight times\u2014with four former DDS directors and four  current directors. On the basis of these pretests, we modified the  questions until pretesters raised no further issues.", "We also gave SSA disability program officials the opportunity, on two  occasions, to review and comment on the survey. SSA officials first  reviewed the survey prior to its pretesting. Among other suggestions,  they noted that some survey questions were leading in nature and that,  in addition, we should develop scaled responses to provide  respondents with the opportunity to modulate their answers (e.g., from  \u201cno extent\u201d to \u201cvery great extent\u201d). We modified the survey on the  basis of their comments, including revising or eliminating questions  that they thought were leading and constructing scaled responses as  suggested. After additionally incorporating comments of several  pretesters, we provided SSA with the chance to review a revised  version of the survey. The official coordinating SSA\u2019s second review e- mailed us in reply, saying that, while some of the survey questions  might be difficult for the DDS directors to answer, we should go ahead  with the survey as revised. The official did not refer to any bias in the  revised questions.", "Our survey questions and our findings reflect ongoing human capital  challenges facing the DDSs and were not limited to the particular  circumstances of fiscal year 2003. The survey questions themselves  were generally not limited to the most recent year, and several  explicitly asked for data for the past two or three fiscal years or for the  future. While the impact of the continuing resolution and the related  SSA hiring freeze that was in place throughout much of fiscal year 2003  may have affected DDS directors\u2019 responses, DDS and SSA officials  have told us that resource constraints and budget uncertainties have  been ongoing challenges for a number of years. Furthermore, certain  aspects of the time period in which the survey was conducted likely  downplayed some of the human capital challenges facing the DDSs.  For example, DDS officials said in interviews that they expected  examiner turnover to increase as economic conditions improved in the  future.  2.  Our report acknowledges the efforts made by SSA regional offices to  persuade state governments to increase examiner salaries in light of  their new responsibilities. Our report, however, does not assert that   24 DDSs were refused assistance with negotiating salary increases for  examiners after they had requested it. Rather, we said that, of the DDS  directors who reported wanting help from SSA with negotiating salary  increases, more than half (24 DDSs) said they had not received this  kind of help. (SSA interpreted wanting help and not receiving it as  having requested help and been refused such assistance.) But  regardless of whether directors have specifically requested this or  another type of human capital assistance, they reported in their survey  responses that they want active support from SSA on this and a  number of other issues involving human capital management.  3.  Our report acknowledges that some states have strategic workforce  planning initiatives that consider their DDS employees. However, the  issue relevant to our study was not whether statewide human capital  management offices were generally effective, as SSA suggests, but  whether there were any workforce planning efforts by SSA or the  DDSs that were integral to and supportive of SSA\u2019s mission and goals.  As we noted in the report, even sophisticated statewide workforce  planning efforts are not necessarily focused on ensuring that the DDSs  have the workforces needed to accomplish such SSA goals as reducing  claims-processing times.  4.  Our report acknowledges SSA\u2019s current efforts at outreach to state  officials. For example, our report describes efforts on the part of  regional office officials to persuade state governments to exempt  examiners from state hiring restrictions, reclassify DDS examiner  positions, and increase examiner salaries. We also emphasize that SSA  and its regional offices can be limited in their ability to help the DDSs  negotiate changes by such factors as state political and budget  concerns, as well as state personnel rules. However, as noted in our  report, we found no record to date of any discussions with the  National Governors Association (NGA) or of NGA focusing on this  topic. Our recommendation that SSA reach out to national associations  such as the NGA is an acknowledgment that the DDSs and SSA\u2019s  regional offices cannot successfully confront these difficult human  capital challenges without the sustained attention of SSA\u2019s leadership  at the national level. For clarity, we have emphasized this point in the  text of our recommendation. SSA\u2019s expressed intent to pursue  discussions on a national level with NGA is a step in the right  direction.  5.  We recounted in our report the view of SSA officials that requiring  uniform human capital standards might be perceived by some states as  unwelcome federal interference and could raise the prospect of states  withdrawing their participation in making disability determinations.  We also noted the difficulties SSA has encountered in the past in  convincing the DDSs to comply with SSA guidelines on personnel  issues, due in part to the states\u2019 perceptions of infringements on  traditional prerogatives. Accordingly, we stressed in our report that  establishing uniform minimum qualifications for examiners throughout  the DDSs will be difficult, requiring delicate and time-consuming  discussions with some state governments. However, establishing such  qualifications will also be worthwhile, helping some DDSs justify an  appropriate job classification and level of compensation needed to  recruit and retain qualified disability examiners. As an agency with  fiduciary responsibility for administering disability programs that are  nationwide in scope, SSA has an obligation to do no less than take firm  steps to address the human capital challenges facing the DDSs. We  understand SSA\u2019s concern about the difficulties it would face if states  opted out of the disability program and transferred these  responsibilities to the federal government. To help ensure the success  of SSA\u2019s efforts, outreach from SSA\u2019s leadership to the state governors  will be vital. Also essential will be a close working partnership among  the immediate stakeholders\u2014SSA, the DDSs, and their state parent  agencies\u2014in developing a nationwide strategic workforce plan.  6.  We did not examine the accuracy and timeliness of claims processing.", "Nevertheless, even had these measures of performance improved, the  Commissioner noted in her September 25, 2003, testimony that SSA  still has \u201ca long way to go\u201d in its efforts to be more timely and  accurate, despite positive strides in the short term. Moreover, SSA\u2019s  own published strategic plan for 2003 to 2008 warns that \u201cthe length of  time it  takes to process these claims is unacceptable.\u201d  Results from our survey of DDS directors demonstrate the need to  address such DDS human capital issues as high turnover and recruiting  and hiring difficulties in order to improve the timeliness and accuracy  of claims processing. Of the directors (43) who reported experiencing  difficulties in recruiting and hiring enough people who could become  successful examiners, more than three-quarters said that such  difficulties contributed to decreased accuracy in disability decisions or  to increases in claims-processing times. Moreover, over one-half of all  directors reported that turnover had increased claims-processing  times.    7.  Our report neither states nor assumes that higher salaries alone  guarantee improved DDS performance. Rather, it states that, according  to more than two-thirds of all DDS directors, noncompetitive pay was  one of several factors contributing to examiner turnover. Moreover,  our report emphasized the costly consequences of such turnover,  noting that the estimated cost of examiner turnover in fiscal year 2002  was in the tens of millions of dollars. (Our estimates show that this  would be the case, regardless of whether the calculation is based on  total turnover or turnover that is above that of the federal government  as a whole.) SSA itself has been attempting to persuade state  governments to increase examiner salaries to reflect new job  responsibilities. Although increased compensation may increase costs,  the turnover that can result from not addressing human capital  management concerns, such as not compensating employees  appropriately, can be costly as well, as we note in the report.", "We agree with SSA that some attrition is desirable. But over half of all  DDS directors told us in our survey that examiner turnover in their  offices was too high, and we found that examiner turnover was about  twice that of federal employees performing similar work. Because  turnover is costly, we emphasize the importance of using data to  identify current and future human capital needs. We have found in  prior work that high-performing organizations analyze who is leaving,  what skill gaps result, and how much turnover is desirable or  acceptable. Organizations that fail to effectively manage their turnover  risk not having the capacity to achieve their goals. A balance needs to  be achieved between bringing in new employees with fresh and vibrant  perspectives and retaining experienced employees whose institutional  knowledge can maintain goals and help train others.  8.  We cited the Department of Education\u2019s experience to show that  establishing federal qualifications requirements for state employees, as  we recommended that SSA do, can and has been done. While we have  not studied federal experiences with workforce planning in an  intergovernmental arena, the GAO reports we provide in appendix III  highlight an array of initiatives on the part of federal agencies to  embrace workforce planning, including SSA\u2019s planning models for its  own employees. SSA has been willing to take the lead and develop  models in workforce planning for its own employees. It should  therefore build on its own internal expertise and lessons learned in this  field to develop models of workforce planning in the demanding  intergovernmental context as well. Lack of an existing model for the  range of changes we recommend may make implementation more  challenging, but it is not a convincing argument for inaction.   9.  We support SSA\u2019s leadership in its efforts to improve the disability  determination process and to help people with disabilities remain in or  return to the workforce. SSA said that it generally agreed with the  intent of our recommendations and would consider incorporating a  nationwide strategic workforce plan for the DDSs into its current  strategy to improve disability determinations. To do so will be  essential, since the Government Performance and Results Act now  requires agencies to report annually, as we noted in our report, on  human capital strategies needed to meet their strategic goals. While we  did not provide an exhaustive treatment of states\u2019 reactions to  proposals for increased federal control, our report did note past  opposition of some states to federal guidelines on personnel matters.", "In addition, we have added further detail in the report about the  regulatory development process. We acknowledge the complexities  involved in pursuing regulatory change. But despite these difficulties,  we maintain that SSA has an obligation to address DDS workforce  needs.  10.  SSA said that it would continue ongoing efforts to improve examiner  job skills. Results from our survey of DDS directors, however, revealed  gaps in critical examiner knowledge and skills. Moreover, a large  proportion of directors said they would be able to spend fewer  resources on adapting SSA\u2019s training if SSA were to improve the  quality, completeness, and timeliness of this training. Given such  results, our report recommended that SSA go beyond its current  efforts and base its training improvement initiatives on a systematic  assessment of the examiner\u2019s job responsibilities and related  knowledge, skills, and competencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made  significant contributions to this report: Barbara Bordelon, Marissa Jones,  Suit Chan, and Beverly Crawford, Education, Workforce, and Income  Security Issues; Ellen Rubin, Strategic Issues; Gregory Wilmoth, Applied  Research and Methods; and B.
