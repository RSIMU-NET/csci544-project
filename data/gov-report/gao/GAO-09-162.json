In 2005, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) expanded upon the HIPC Initiative by eliminating additional debt owed to four international financial institutions (IFI): the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), African Development Fund (ADF), and Inter-American Development Bank (IaDB). These four IFIs are projected to provide $58 billion in total debt relief to 41 countries. GAO (1) analyzed the U.S. financing approach for debt relief efforts; (2) reviewed the extent to which MDRI might affect resources available to countries for poverty-reducing activities; and (3) assessed revisions to the analyses conducted by the World Bank and IMF to review and promote future debt sustainability. GAO analyzed Treasury, IFI, and country documents and data, and interviewed officials at Treasury and the four IFIs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury's approach to financing MDRI, known as early encashment, does not fully fund current and future U.S. commitments. The approach does not fully fund the current U.S. MDRI commitment because the United States is in arrears on its IDA replenishment. These arrears are due to requirements under U.S. law for withholdings and across-the-board rescissions. Under early encashment, the World Bank requires that the U.S. commitment to the IDA replenishment be paid in full before early encashment income can be used to fund MDRI. The World Bank deducts the U.S. arrears to IDA from any early encashment income before applying this income toward the U.S. MDRI commitment, resulting in a current MDRI shortfall of $149 million. Treasury officials said that if the United States ultimately pays its arrears to the IDA replenishment, early encashment income will then fully fund the U.S. MDRI commitment. However, to fully fund the U.S. MDRI commitment, (1) Treasury will need to release a withholding of $94 million by reporting to Congress that the World Bank has accomplished transparency reforms required under U.S. law, and (2) Congress will need to appropriate approximately $49 million to compensate for the rescissions. Moreover, GAO estimates that the early encashment approach will be insufficient to fully finance future U.S. MDRI commitments even if U.S. payments are made on time and in full because these commitments exceed projected early encashment income. GAO estimates that the HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief from the four IFIs combined may provide countries for which data are available with nearly $44 billion in additional resources over the next 50 years, but the extent to which countries spend these resources on activities to reduce poverty is unknown. In addition to providing debt relief, the MDRI program for IDA and ADF provides for a reallocation of assistance, based in part on a consideration of the strength of country policies and institutions. The estimated amount of this MDRI assistance individual countries receive will vary. Although IFIs and the U.S. government encourage recipient countries to spend resources generated from debt relief on efforts to reduce poverty, the extent to which such spending occurs is unknown for two reasons. First, debt relief resources are difficult to track, because these resources cannot easily be separated from other types of financial flows such as international assistance and fiscal revenues. Second, country data on poverty-reducing expenditures are not comparable across countries and also may not be reliable. The World Bank and IMF have improved their country debt sustainability analyses (DSA) since 2005, including by addressing weaknesses GAO previously reported. DSAs now consider the strength of a country's policies and institutions in determining sustainable debt loads and assess future debt sustainability under multiple scenarios that adjust economic assumptions. Furthermore, IDA and ADF now structure their assistance based on a country's risk of debt distress. While the new DSAs have identified numerous ambitious actions countries should take to avoid eroding their debt sustainability, implementing these actions could prove difficult."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A buildup of foreign debt throughout the 1970s and 1980s\u2014combined with  low growth, falling commodity prices, and other economic difficulties\u2014 left many poor countries with significantly more debt than they could  repay. In order to address this problem, the international community has  provided increasing amounts of debt relief to 41 such heavily indebted  poor countries over the last decade. These efforts include the Heavily  Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, which was launched in 1996 as  an approach for international financial institutions (IFI), commercial  creditors, and individual nations to lower the debt levels of the world\u2019s  poorest and most indebted nations to \u201csustainable\u201d levels. \u201cSustainable\u201d  means that a country can make its future debt payments on time and  without rescheduling.", "Multilateral debt relief efforts culminated in the Multilateral Debt Relief  Initiative (MDRI), which was announced in 2005.

Countries must complete the  HIPC Initiative before they can receive MDRI debt relief. Of the 41  countries that may benefit from both programs, 23 have received  irrevocable HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief and another 11 have  begun receiving debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.

Donor governments (including the U.S.  government) have agreed to help fund multilateral debt relief. Donor  governments have provided funding to IFIs to support the HIPC Initiative  through means such as a trust fund established at the World Bank. To fund  MDRI, governments may (1) provide funding in addition to their regular  contributions or replenishments to the institutions, (2) provide their  regular contributions early and generate credits through an approach  known as early encashment, or (3) do both. The U.S. Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) is currently using early encashment to fund the U.S.  MDRI commitment. In July 2008, we reported that even if the U.S.  government provides full funding for IDA, this early encashment approach  results in a U.S. funding shortfall for MDRI by 2014.", "In response to your request, we (1) analyzed the U.S. financing approach  for debt relief efforts; (2) reviewed the extent to which MDRI might affect  resources available to countries for poverty-reducing activities; and (3)  assessed revisions to the analyses conducted by the World Bank and IMF  to review and promote future debt sustainability. In addition, you asked us  to review strategies for addressing legal actions brought by companies to  collect outstanding claims from countries receiving HIPC and MDRI debt  relief. These strategies are discussed in appendix II. We have previously  reviewed debt-related issues, including the HIPC Initiative and MDRI.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed documents and analyzed data  provided by Treasury, the World Bank, IMF, ADF, and IaDB, and spoke  with officials at Treasury and these four institutions.

Our calculations reflect relevant data for debt relief  countries as of November 21, 2008. All figures provided in this report are  expressed in end-2008 present value dollars unless otherwise noted. To  illustrate the impact of debt relief on individual countries, we selected five  countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nicaragua, Rwanda, and Tanzania) as case  studies based on several criteria, including geographic diversity and  dispersion of country ranking in terms of the percentage of total HIPC and  MDRI debt relief they received from the four institutions. In terms of  percentage of debt relief received, we selected countries at or near the top,  middle, and bottom of the ranking as examples of how the program works.

In response  to concerns over the continuing vulnerability of poor countries, the World  Bank and IMF enhanced the initiative in 1999 by reducing the qualifying  thresholds and increasing the number of potentially eligible countries.  Countries must meet numerous criteria in order to qualify for HIPC  Initiative debt relief, such as establishing a track record of reform and  sound policies. To fully benefit from HIPC debt relief, countries must  progress through different phases of the initiative (see fig. 1). At a  country\u2019s \u201cdecision point,\u201d IDA and IMF use certain criteria to determine  whether a country qualifies to receive HIPC Initiative debt relief. If a  country is determined to qualify, it can begin to receive interim HIPC debt  relief. Subsequently, at the \u201ccompletion point,\u201d IDA and IMF determine  whether the country meets additional criteria and can receive full and  irrevocable HIPC debt relief. As of November 2008, of the 41 countries that  may benefit from debt relief efforts, 23 had reached the completion point  and 11 more had reached the decision point. An additional seven countries  are considered \u201cpre-decision point\u201d countries and have not yet qualified  for debt relief.

The amount of total debt relief provided under each initiative  will be about equal, with over $28 billion provided under the HIPC  Initiative and about $30 billion provided under MDRI. IDA is to provide the  greatest level of debt relief at $34 billion (almost 60 percent of the total).  IMF is to provide $10.6 billion, while ADF and IaDB are to provide $9.1  billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. Table 1 provides data on the amount  of funding each institution will provide for each program.", "For the 33 countries currently receiving debt relief under both programs,  IDA has secured about $8.6 billion for the HIPC Initiative and $4.4 billion  for MDRI (for more detailed information, see app. III). This total of $13.1  billion represents 47 percent of the total required IDA financing of almost  $27.8 billion for these countries under both debt relief initiatives. ADF will  provide about $7.5 billion in HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief and has  secured about $5.7 billion, about 76 percent of this amount. IMF and IaDB  have fully financed their $8 billion and $3.8 billion of HIPC Initiative and  MDRI debt relief for the countries currently receiving such relief,  respectively, using internal resources and donor-provided funds.

In recent years, Congress has withheld a portion of the U.S.  replenishment contribution to encourage the World Bank to undertake  specified reforms such as strengthened efforts to enhance transparency  and combat corruption. In fiscal year 2006, Congress required that 20  percent of the funds appropriated to IDA be withheld from disbursement  until the Secretary of the Treasury reported to Congress that the World  Bank had undertaken certain anticorruption reforms. In fiscal year 2006,  most of these funds were eventually disbursed pursuant to the  requirements in the law; however, there was a shortfall in fiscal year 2006  of approximately $41 million due to both the anti-corruption withholding  provision and an across-the-board rescission. In fiscal year 2007 there was  an additional rescission of about $9.5 million. In fiscal year 2008, Congress  rescinded $7.7 million and required that 10 percent, or $94 million, of IDA  funds be withheld until Treasury reported that the World Bank had  undertaken anticorruption reforms, and that another 10 percent be  withheld until Treasury reported that the World Bank had enacted certain  transparency reforms.

IMF and the World  Bank do not independently track poverty-reducing expenditures, and  instead rely on country governments to provide such data even though the  accuracy of these data and country capacity to provide such information  are uncertain.  Additionally, the 2005 IMF assessment found that while 20  countries define poverty-reducing spending in their PRSPs, not all  countries could identify these areas of expenditures in their budgets or  report on such spending. Limitations in country capacity to report on  poverty-reducing spending raise further concerns about the reliability of  the combined data published by IMF and the World Bank.", "Moreover, while it is difficult to establish that debt relief has led directly to  increased poverty-reducing expenditures, it is even more difficult to  determine if debt relief has improved progress toward the MDGs. We  found that for all five of our case study countries, progress data on the  MDG targets were often either lacking or incomplete.

The  DSF uses the World Bank\u2019s CPIA index to sort countries into three policy  performance categories (strong, medium, or poor). Countries with strong  policies and institutions have a higher CPIA rating. An acceptable risk of  debt distress for current strong performers, such as Tanzania, allows for  higher levels of debt compared to countries with currently low CPIA  ratings, such as Sierra Leone. Furthermore, performance categories are  updated annually according to the latest CPIA ratings and, therefore,  certain countries\u2019 annual performance categories have varied since the  new process was introduced in 2005. For example, Burkina Faso\u2019s 2007  DSA noted that the country was a strong performer, but the country\u2019s  CPIA rating was subsequently lowered and the 2008 DSA identified  Burkina Faso as a medium performer. As a result, DSAs for Burkina Faso  now require lower levels of debt in order to be categorized as debt  sustainable. The new process provides flexibility to assess every country\u2019s  risk differently based on individual performance, as well as an ability to  adjust risk assessments within a specific country\u2019s DSA over time as CPIA  ratings shift. Currently, of the 23 countries receiving HIPC Initiative and  MDRI debt relief, a majority (14) have been identified as medium  performers, 5 as poor performers, and 4 as strong performers.", "DSAs conducted under the DSF now consider debt burden \u201cthreshold\u201d  indicators when assessing a country\u2019s debt sustainability position. Five  thresholds have been established that provide key insights into a country\u2019s  debt situation and that vary according to a country\u2019s CPIA-based  performance category (see table 5). Other DSAs, on the other hand, assess  primarily only one variable. Strong performers have higher thresholds,  indicating an ability to carry higher debt levels while maintaining debt  sustainability.", "In order to project a country\u2019s risk of future debt distress, these threshold  indicators are compared against a country\u2019s performance under a  \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario based on assumptions of macroeconomic performance  expected for the future in areas such as national income, inflation,  exports, imports, and government revenues and expenditures. Various  sensitivity scenarios are also used to test the robustness of the indicators  to changes in key assumptions. These scenarios include the following:    (1) numerous temporary standardized \u201cstress\u201d or \u201cshock\u201d scenarios that  consider possibilities such as lower growth in national income or exports  than experienced in the past; and (2) two additional scenarios: (a) a  scenario that assumes a level of public loans on terms that are less  concessional, and (b) a historical scenario that uses macroeconomic  assumptions based on past performance (which has often, but not always,  been less optimistic than the baseline scenario in the past). IMF and World  Bank staff explained that baseline assumptions will diverge from the  historical scenario if the institutions agree that the economic outlook of a  country has changed. Such changes must be explained in the DSA. For  example, in the case of Tanzania\u2019s 2007 DSA, a baseline GDP growth rate  of 7.6 percent was used, rather than the historical 5.3 percent growth rate.

IFI officials have considered  refinements to the \u201cmoderate\u201d risk classification that would provide  greater distinctions within risk assessments, but have determined that  there is currently no need to revise the category.", "New DSA assessments of country debt sustainability under multiple  scenarios address past concerns that DSAs only used one scenario, which  may have contained overly-optimistic economic assumptions. For  example, we reported in 1998, 2000, and 2004 that expected debt  sustainability for debt relief countries was calculated based on one  scenario that assumed high economic growth, including strong and  sustained export growth. We noted that such growth could be unrealistic  given that many countries had very narrow export diversity (i.e., a limited  number of exported goods), and these exports tended to be concentrated  in the area of commodities that are highly vulnerable to events outside a  country\u2019s control, such as drought or price fluctuations. IMF officials told  us that current DSAs use assumptions that have been lowered to more  realistic levels. They also stated that DSAs, which include descriptions of  macroeconomic assumptions, are now transparent because they are  publicly available and subject to scrutiny by outside parties. In addition,  IMF officials noted that because DSAs are conducted on an annual basis,  DSAs can now begin to incorporate events such as increases in food or  fuel prices in a timelier manner.", "However, IMF officials also noted that the current approach for  determining future macroeconomic performance assumptions is \u201cnot a  perfect science,\u201d particularly when it makes projections over a 20-year  period, and cannot be executed without potential forecast errors. In  addition, a debt management capacity building group concluded that the  sensitivity analyses contained in DSAs do not alter all relevant variables  and exclude additional or secondary effects.

ADF officials told us that ADF has adopted a similar system.  According to World Bank officials, when a country\u2019s risk of future debt  distress changes, the change is reflected in IDA allocations annually. This  approach directly aligns IDA and ADF assistance with a country\u2019s assessed  ability to repay debt, and is relevant to our past reporting that the  increased use of grant assistance would have a positive impact on future  debt sustainability. However, IDA and ADF reduce the volume of grant  assistance provided under this system. Specifically, IDA and ADF reduce  grant assistance by 20 percent for countries classified at a high or  moderate risk of debt distress, thereby reducing resources available for  poverty reduction. The 20 percent volume reduction is divided into an  \u201cincentives\u201d-related portion and a \u201ccharges\u201d-related portion.

Conversely, regarding borrowing  decisions, IDA, ADF, and IMF officials stated that they work with country  governments to improve their understanding and use of DSAs in future  borrowing decisions. For example, IMF officials noted that DSAs are  discussed as part of regular economic consultations with countries.  Furthermore, according to an IMF and World Bank report, since 2005 eight  training workshops have been organized in Africa, Asia, and Latin America  and attended by officials from all 23 countries receiving HIPC Initiative  and MDRI debt relief.

Of the 23 countries receiving HIPC Initiative  and MDRI debt relief, 13 (over 50 percent) have been found to have a  moderate or high risk of future debt distress. These countries maintain this  level of risk despite substantial HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief.  DSAs have stressed numerous policies or growth scenarios that countries  should achieve in order to avoid further eroding their debt sustainability.  For example, DSAs note that projected debt sustainability could be eroded  if countries do not realize broad objectives that affect their overall  economy, such as the following: continued concessional borrowing,  implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, strengthened debt  management capacity, sustained national income or export growth, and  increased export diversity.", "Such broad and ambitious objectives could prove difficult for countries to  achieve over the course of the 20-year DSA period for various reasons. A  country\u2019s debt position may be at risk even after it receives significant  debt relief if, for example, its economy remains overly dependent on one  export. For instance, Burkina Faso still held a moderate debt risk in 2007  despite World Bank and IMF reports that the HIPC Initiative and MDRI  had substantially reduced its debt burden, because its economy is highly  dependent on cotton exports (60 percent of total export value in 2006)  which are vulnerable to large price fluctuations and weather shocks such  as drought. In 2008, Burkina Faso\u2019s debt risk was elevated to high due to  deteriorating country performance. Other unexpected factors beyond a  country\u2019s control, such as oil and food import prices, may also affect  economic position and debt sustainability. IMF and the World Bank have  projected that countries may eventually return to pre-MDRI debt positions  as they accumulate new debt over time.", "Continued concessional borrowing is cited frequently as an action  countries must take to maintain debt sustainability. IFIs have taken  actions to address the issue of excessive nonconcessional borrowing.  While IFIs aim to lower the risk of debt distress in low-income countries  by providing new financial assistance on appropriately concessional  terms, other creditors and borrowing governments may gain from  nonconcessional lending that is made possible following large-scale debt  relief or in conjunction with IFI grant assistance. According to the World  Bank, rating agencies may upgrade commercial risk ratings for countries  that have received MDRI debt relief, improving the countries\u2019 ability to  secure nonconcessional loans. The risk of realizing an unsustainable  nonconcessional debt burden is particularly high in resource-rich  countries that can more easily obtain nonconcessional borrowing by using  expected future export earnings as collateral to back such loans. In  addition, IDA has noted that countries are experiencing significant risks  associated with their weak debt management capacity. Debt management  offices in low-income countries lack adequate capacity to monitor and  accurately record debt data and new resource flows, let alone effectively  manage them.", "IDA established a nonconcessional borrowing policy in 2006 to prevent the  rapid reaccumulation of unsustainable debt. This policy states that IDA  has two instruments at its disposal to confront excessive nonconcessional  borrowing\u2014 reducing its assistance volumes (primarily used in countries  where debt sustainability is a major concern) and \u201chardening\u201d its lending  terms in countries with stronger debt sustainability and greater financial  market access. According to IDA staff, hardened lending terms could  include an increased interest rate, a shorter grace period, or a reduced  repayment period. IDA has also reported that these options come with  trade-offs as volume cuts reduce resources available to pursue poverty  reduction, and hardened terms may exacerbate debt sustainability  problems. As of June 2008, IDA reported that there had been two cases of  hardened lending terms (Angola and Ghana) and, as allowed, one  exception (Mali) granted under its nonconcessional borrowing policy.  IMF can impose limits on nonconcessional loans for countries that have a  current arrangement with the institution.

The current U.S. approach for financing MDRI has several  limitations. First, if the U.S. government does not fully pay its regular  contributions to IDA on time, which is currently the case primarily due to  withholdings, early encashment funding will be used to cover shortfalls in  U.S. funding to IDA, rather than to solely fund debt relief.

IDA, ADF, and IaDB provided aggregate, annual debt relief  and country-specific annual MDRI debt relief data for all current and  expected future MDRI recipient countries, including our five case-study  countries. To calculate the aggregate reduction of annual assistance from  IDA and ADF, we applied each IFI\u2019s encashment schedule to the  disbursement of the annual MDRI debt relief that both IDA and ADF  provided. While 1 year\u2019s debt relief is matched by a reduction in 1 year\u2019s  IDA or ADF assistance, the reduction in assistance takes place over a 9- year disbursement cycle for IDA and a 10-year disbursement cycle for  ADF.

The staff of both IFIs concurred that our  approach was a valid way to analyze MDRI.", "To determine the portion of the MDRI debt relief to be reallocated to  recipients as additional HIPC countries reach their completion point, we  created a weighted allocation index based on data provided by the World  Bank. The World Bank told us that the group of 23 completion point  countries is currently receiving 50 percent of the reallocated cancelled  debt relief funds, and that this would rise to 60 percent as the interim  (decision point) countries reach their completion points, which is  assumed to occur during 2009 and 2010. To determine the portion of the  additional 10 percentage points that would go to each of the 10 interim  countries, we created a weighted allocation index by dividing each  country\u2019s projected percentage of IDA14 assistance flows by the portion of  IDA14 assistance going to this group of 10 countries. To compute each  country\u2019s share of the IDA PBA reallocation, we multiplied their weighted  allocation index by the 10 additional percentage points to calculate the  portion of the 10 percent that each would receive. Finally, to calculate the  changing PBA allocation over the period as the individual countries reach  their completion point, we added each country\u2019s respective share of the 10  percentage points on to the 50 percent base, arriving at 60 percent in 2010.  We used the same methodology to determine the additional portion of the  MDRI pool of debt relief that would go to 8 pre-decision point countries,  based on their projected completion point dates that the Bank provided.  We assume that the pre-decision point countries will account for a  proportional percentage of the 10 percentage points, reflecting their  projected portion of IDA14 assistance flows. Based on this methodology,  we estimate that, adding on the 8 pre-decision point countries, 41 HIPCs  would receive about 67 percent of the reallocated MDRI debt relief and the  remainder would go to all other low-income countries eligible to receive  only concessional loans from IDA or ADF. ADF provided us with the  amount of MDRI debt relief reallocated to all of its member countries, as  well as the projected completion point dates for the HIPCs. To determine  the portion of ADF\u2019s MDRI debt relief to be reallocated to recipients as  additional HIPC countries reach their completion point, we added each  country\u2019s percentage of total MDRI debt relief to the current reallocation  percentage as countries successively reach their completion point.

Through grants, the DRF supports heavily  indebted IDA-only countries that undertake reforms to retain  professional services necessary in preparing these commercial debt  reduction operations and assists the countries in funding the cost of  these operations. For example, court judgments against Nicaragua  were settled through the DRF-supported buyback. All four litigating  creditors participated in the buyback operation and accepted a  significant cut in the value of their legal claims. The Nicaragua buyback  extinguished about $1.3 billion in commercial debt. Another buyback  operation has been concluded for Mozambique.

We use  the same assumptions that are being used by Treasury and IDA, but  describe the process in nominal dollars. The U.S. government plans to pay  its share of IDA\u2019s debt relief costs for MDRI from the encashment income  generated by paying its regular IDA replenishment commitment over a 4- year period, rather than over the standard 9-year period. Table 10  describes this process.", "The U.S. replenishment obligation for IDA15, which covers the period 2009  through 2011, is $3.7 billion. Column (a) describes the annual standard  encashment or payment schedule over the 9-year period from 2009  through 2017. Column (b) is the annual U.S. payment over a 4-year period.  Column (c) is the annual outstanding excess payment. In 2009, this  amount consists of the difference between what the U.S. government pays,  $1.1 billion, and the required amount of $252 million. In subsequent years,  it consists of the annual excess in payment plus the outstanding excess  payment balance. Beginning in the fifth year, no new payment is made.  The excess payment balance is used to cover the required payment. In the  ninth year, the excess payment balance is just sufficient to pay the last  year\u2019s required payment. Column (d) is the annual encashment investment  income. This amount is the estimated earned income calculated by  multiplying the excess payment balance by the agreed-upon interest rate,  which is 4 percent for the IDA15 replenishment. The line \u201cTotal (nominal)\u201d  shows that the total payments under the standard encashment schedule is  equal to the total under the early encashment schedule. The total nominal  dollar earned income is $359 million.", "Treasury and IDA use a different method to compute early encashment  income. Under their method, Treasury and IDA first calculate the present  value sum of the payment schedules. The present value is a statistical  method that takes into consideration the amount of annual payments, the  time during which these payments are made, and the interest rate when  computing the sum. Although the nominal sums of the two schedules are  the same, the present value of the early encashment schedule, $3,414  million, is larger than that of the standard schedule, $3,114 million.  Treasury and IDA compute the percent face value as the difference  between these present values divided by the present value of the standard  schedule. The percent face value, 9.63 percent in this example, is  multiplied by the nominal sum of early encashment payments, $3,705  million, to calculate the early encashment income of $357 million. This is  the agreed-upon methodology and $357 million will be used toward paying  the U.S. IDA MDRI commitment of $356 million. The surplus $1 million can  be used to pay future MDRI obligations.", "In the previous example, the U.S. government pays its replenishment in  full and all the early encashment income is used to pay its MDRI  obligation. In the next example, we assume that the U.S. government does  not pay its replenishment in full, either due to a rescission or a decision to  withhold payment until certain reforms are made by the World Bank.  Under the agreed-upon methodology, early encashment income is first  used to pay off the replenishment shortfall. Any remaining encashment  income is then used to pay the U.S. IDA MDRI commitment. Table 11  describes the calculation of early encashment income when there is a  replenishment shortfall. We assume an across-the-board shortfall in U.S.  annual payments of 5 percent, resulting in a shortfall of $185 million.  Thus, the total nominal early encashment payments are $3,520 million.  Since the annual U.S. payments are less, the earned income in column (d)  is less: $308 million or a 14-percent reduction. The calculated early  encashment income to pay for the U.S. MDRI commitment is $146 million,  a 59 percent reduction. Most of the earned encashment income is used to  pay the replenishment shortfall. If the across-the-board shortfall were 8.8  percent or more of the replenishment, all of the earned encashment  income would be used to pay the shortage and nothing would be used to  pay the U.S. MDRI commitment.", "Treasury and ADF have agreed to use a different methodology to compute  early encashment income. We applied this ADF approach to the IDA15  replenishment. If there is no funding shortfall, the results are identical  between the two approaches. When there is a shortfall, the ADF approach  implicitly reduces the standard encashment schedule payments by the  average across-the-board percentage shortfall. Thus, the nominal total of  the standard encashment schedule is the same as the total early  encashment schedule payments. In the previous example with a 5 percent  shortfall, the computed early encashment income would total $339 million  and all of this amount would be used to pay the MDRI obligation.

Under these conditions, the early encashment approach to finance the U.S.  IDA MDRI commitment is more costly than paying the U.S. commitment  directly.", "Assuming that the full replenishment and IDA MDRI commitments are  paid, we estimate that the cost to the U.S. government for early  encashment payments, including financing costs for IDA15, will be  $3,347.2 million in end-2008 present value dollars.
