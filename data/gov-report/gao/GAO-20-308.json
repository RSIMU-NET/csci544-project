A nonprofit organization for Indian education we  interviewed also said JOM contractors need training on a range of issues,  including how to complete JOM annual reports and other documentation,  and on how to operate following implementation of the Modernization Act.  According to the nonprofit organization, regular training on JOM is  particularly important because certain aspects of the program, such as  conducting annual assessments to determine the learning needs of Indian  children served by the program, can be technically challenging. Officials  from one tribal contractor we interviewed said the tribe provides its own  training to school staff that implement local JOM programs on such topics  as how to conduct Indian Education Committee meetings, how to fill out  reimbursement claims, and how to organize and maintain financial  records for program administrators and parents on Indian Education  Committees. The contractor said that BIE training on topics, including  how to conduct and how often to hold Indian Education Committee  meetings, would be particularly helpful.

As a result,  these contracts\u2014totaling over $300,000\u2014expired and were not  renewed, disrupting JOM services. A BIE official informed us there  were lapses in administering these contracts because BIE closed the  office responsible for administering them as a result of its  reorganization which began in 2014, and never assigned anyone to  assume responsibility for the contracts associated with that office.

In October 2019, BIE officials began efforts to  identify and contact officials responsible for all the JOM programs  whose contracts lapsed in California due to gaps in BIE\u2019s  administration of the program and began the process to start new  JOM programs in the future. However, without identifying staff to  administer all JOM contracts, problems with renewing and awarding  contracts may persist.", "Reviewing the appropriateness of contract types. Interior\u2019s Office  of the Solicitor does not have a role in reviewing the issuance of new  JOM contracts, according to a senior attorney in that office. The Office  of the Solicitor\u2019s lack of a role in reviewing JOM contracts increases  the risk that contracts are not used appropriately. For example, we  found that BIE has been using self-determination contracts to  disburse JOM funds to non-tribal contractors, which is not authorized  by the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act. Under  the Act, only Indian tribes and tribal organizations are eligible to enter  into self-determination contracts; these contracts may not be used for  non-tribal entities, such as school districts and states. The use of self- determination contracts for contractors that are not eligible to receive  them can result in costs to the government. Self-determination  contracts include provisions that would not otherwise be included in  non-tribal JOM contracts, according to a senior attorney in the Office  of the Solicitor. For example, self-determination contracts may include  contract support costs and extend the Federal Tort Claims Act to tribal  government employees administering the federal program(s) under  these contracts. Therefore, school contractors that were disbursed  JOM funds through self-determination contracts may have received  contract support costs and legal protections they would not have been  eligible to receive, according to the senior attorney.", "BIE officials told us that they have not determined how long self- determination contracts have been used to disburse JOM funds to  non-tribal entities, how many non-tribal contractors were awarded  these contracts, or whether the government has incurred costs as a  result of using the wrong types of contracts. They said this information  will be difficult to obtain because it is not systematically collected.  After we found that BIE was using self-determination contracts to  disburse JOM funds to school contractors, a senior attorney in the  Office of the Solicitor said that her office would provide assistance as  requested to BIE in transitioning these contracts to appropriate  contracts. By systematically including the Office of the Solicitor in the  process for reviewing JOM contracts, BIE can ensure that its  contracts are the appropriate type and can minimize the risk of future  inappropriate costs to the federal government.", "Conducting JOM oversight activities. BIE has not defined the roles  and responsibilities related to overseeing JOM programs or identified  staff dedicated to this function. For example, BIE has not identified  staff at Education Resource Centers or other BIE offices with the  capacity to conduct site visits and review JOM annual reports  submitted by contractors. As a result, the bureau\u2019s oversight of JOM  contractors is done on an ad-hoc basis and sometimes not done at all,  according to BIE officials. For example, in an internal memo  addressed to BIE\u2019s Director, a senior BIE official said that because the  bureau has not identified staff with the capacity to conduct site visits,  most Education Resource Centers have not conducted any site visits  in at least 5 years. Officials from one tribal JOM contractor that said it  is subject to BIE oversight told us that BIE has not conducted a site  visit of their program in 10 years. They noted that BIE\u2019s past site visits  resulted in recommendations that improved their program activities  and procedures and changed how they defined student eligibility. In  addition, the head of an Education Resource Center said that JOM  oversight activities are collateral duties that his staff do not have time  to fulfill.", "Further, the responsibilities of officials who are charged with  overseeing JOM programs have not been clearly defined. For  example, BIE has not defined the responsibilities related to  conducting site visits, such as what aspects of the program should be  reviewed and which contractors should be selected for site visits. This  lack of clearly defined responsibilities has resulted in inconsistencies  in how officials are conducting oversight activities and potential gaps  in coverage of contractors that are subject to oversight. BIE\u2019s lack of  oversight may also increase the risk of misuse and abuse of JOM  funds. According to Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General, there have  been three identified cases of theft related to the JOM program that  occurred between 2004 and 2010. For example, a program  coordinator of a JOM contract stole program funds as part of an  embezzlement fraud scheme and was ordered to pay nearly $36,000  in restitution.
