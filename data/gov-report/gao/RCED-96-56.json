(Fig. 1 shows a typical tank farm under construction.) Storing, managing, and cleaning up these wastes pose many challenges. Some tanks, for example, contain flammable gas or potentially combustible organic compounds. Injected into the tanks as liquids, the wastes have assumed a variety of forms as they have settled and recombined over the years. These forms include sludge and a hard \u201csaltcake\u201d that may have to be pulverized before it can be removed from the tanks. Wastes in at least 67 single-shell tanks have leaked or are assumed to have leaked into the ground as the concrete-and-steel structures have deteriorated.", "DOE\u2019s program for addressing these wastes, called the Tank Waste Remediation System, calls for a series of actions to chemically characterize the waste in the tanks, remove it from the tanks, and prepare it for permanent disposal during the several hundred thousand years in which some of it will remain dangerously radioactive. This program is expected to cost $36 billion over its life-cycle.", "Waste characterization is the first major action. Since fiscal year 1989, the first year for which reliable cost data exist, DOE has spent about $260 million on characterization. The purpose of characterization is to provide sufficient information for safe storage of the waste in the tanks while awaiting the development of processes for remediating it, as well as for designing the steps of the remediation process itself. These steps include removing the wastes (retrieval), separating them into low-level and high-level portions (pretreatment), treating them (vitrification), and preparing them for permanent disposal.", "DOE began characterizing the waste in Hanford\u2019s tanks in 1985. Since then, its efforts have repeatedly fallen behind schedule. DOE\u2019s March 1994 schedule resulted from the renegotiation of an agreement originally signed in 1989. This Tri-Party Agreement with Washington State\u2019s Department of Ecology (Ecology) and EPA initially called for completing the characterization of single-shell tanks by 1998. DOE subsequently found itself unable to comply with the characterization deadline and renegotiated the agreement. The revised Tri-Party Agreement calls for characterizing all 177 tanks for retrieval, pretreatment, treatment, and disposal by September 1999.", "In a separate agreement to address concerns raised by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an independent executive-branch oversight body, DOE agreed to another set of characterization requirements related primarily to the safe storage of the waste. Under this agreement, DOE was to characterize the 54 \u201cwatchlist\u201d tanks\u2014those with known or suspected safety problems, such as potential flammability\u2014by October 1995 and to sample and assess safety conditions associated with all 177 tanks by October 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characterization Has Fallen Behind Schedule", "paragraphs": ["DOE and Westinghouse have made limited progress in meeting the agreed-upon deadlines for characterization.

In September 1995, DOE acknowledged that the Tri-Party Agreement and Safety Board characterization deadlines could not be met and proposed a two-phased approach for characterizing tank wastes that would extend characterization activities well beyond 1999.

The Safety Board agreement also called for taking core samples from all 54 watchlist tanks by October 1995; by that date, Westinghouse had obtained core samples from 10 watchlist tanks. At Westinghouse\u2019s current estimated sampling pace, all 408 core samples will not be done until 2002\u2014more than 5 years after the agreement\u2019s October 1996 deadline.

Westinghouse currently estimates that it will be able to take about four core samples per month through March 1996 and five per month thereafter.", "During fiscal years 1994 through 1995, Westinghouse also used other types of samples besides core samples to augment its understanding of tank wastes, completing 177 of 210 planned samples. These other methods yield results that are generally considered less comprehensive than core samples, because they usually do not involve a top-to-bottom sampling of the waste. However, the results of these samples can supplement what is learned from core samples because they can provide information on tank vapors and liquids that core samples may not provide. Even with these other efforts, to date no tank has yet been sufficiently characterized either to meet the Safety Board\u2019s sampling requirements or to support any of the subsequent steps in the waste treatment process. The Director of DOE\u2019s characterization division said that he was unable to estimate when the characterization of any tank would be completed.", "DOE and Westinghouse officials believe that characterization difficulties are not affecting the safe storage of tank wastes. According to the assistant manager of DOE\u2019s tank waste remediation program, Westinghouse has placed controls on tank farm operations to reduce the risk of an unintentional release. The controls include using sparkless equipment and avoiding certain types of drilling procedures. However, these controls have made it more difficult for DOE to maintain its desired sampling rate.", "DOE and Westinghouse characterization managers have acknowledged that they will not meet the Safety Board or Tri-Party Agreement deadlines. They have prepared a draft revision of the original implementation plan agreed to with the Safety Board. This draft, which does not specify a completion date, is discussed in more detail in the next section. DOE and Westinghouse also acknowledged the need to propose changes to the Tri-Party Agreement, but at the time we completed our work, they had not yet submitted a formal proposal to Ecology or EPA. However, Ecology has informed DOE and Westinghouse that in the state\u2019s view, the inability to obtain adequate samples does not provide sufficient grounds for renegotiating the characterization milestones of the Tri-Party Agreement.

DOE accepted the reports, but Ecology, the body that must approve the reports, has criticized their contents, including Westinghouse\u2019s extensive reliance on historical information. Rather than approve the 23 reports submitted in fiscal years 1993 and 1994, Ecology received them on the condition that Westinghouse develop additional characterization data and resubmit the reports for approval within 2 years. In connection with the fiscal year 1995 reports, Ecology\u2019s characterization team leader said that 25 of the 30 reports were inadequate because they contained mainly historical information, modeling results that had not been verified, and limited analytical results.

As a result, DOE and Westinghouse are still having difficulty answering fundamental methodological questions that have existed since the characterization program began: how to take reliable samples, what types of and how much sampling data to gather, and how to reliably predict the waste constituents on the basis of sampling and other data.", "Limited progress in taking samples has led DOE and Westinghouse to search for another characterization approach that would satisfy the requirements of the Tri-Party Agreement as well as their commitments to the Safety Board. The latest approach, proposed in September 1995, aims to evaluate the program on a continuing basis while taking samples and collecting data, rather than following a fixed schedule. DOE now views sampling as an iterative process in which the total number of samples needed depends on the results of the initial samples taken. This viewpoint is in contrast to DOE\u2019s earlier strategy that required a fixed number of samples.", "DOE\u2019s latest characterization strategy has two phases: Phase one concentrates primarily on ensuring safe storage while demonstrating the approach\u2019s overall validity. More specifically, phase one includes reducing the number of core samples from 408 to 109, which would be done by grouping tanks believed to contain similar wastes and taking core samples from the 25 to 30 tanks considered representative of the various groups; supplementing data obtained from the reduced number of core samples with historical data, temperature and moisture measurements, and data obtained from other types of samples (such as vapor and auger samples); and using computer models to analyze the various data in order to predict the tanks\u2019 contents and evaluate the risk of potential combustion.", "Westinghouse characterization project officials acknowledged that if assumptions about the validity of this approach are not successfully demonstrated during fiscal years 1996 and 1997, more core samples and other types of samples may be needed in phase one.", "Phase two of Westinghouse\u2019s approach would focus primarily on the characterization of tank wastes to support the treatment and disposal steps.

Despite slower-than-expected progress on characterization, DOE plans to begin testing equipment for retrieving tank wastes in fiscal year 1996 and to begin designing treatment facilities the following year. According to the assistant manager of DOE\u2019s tank waste remediation program, DOE believes that (1) current knowledge is sufficient to proceed with the initial facility design and retrieval of selected wastes and (2) additional characterization information will be available before the design reaches a critical phase.

Under such an approach, a company or a consortium of companies from the private sector would finance, design, build, and operate pretreatment and treatment facilities and deliver the finished product\u2014in this case, vitrified waste encased in stainless steel containers\u2014to DOE for a fee. DOE expects this approach to save billions of dollars because the potential for innovation in the private marketplace could lead to greater efficiencies and improved performance.

In our previous work on DOE\u2019s waste-processing facilities, we found that DOE had experienced major start-up problems, cost increases, and schedule delays caused in part by a \u201cfast track\u201d approach where construction began before major technical uncertainties were resolved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE and Westinghouse Have Taken Some Actions to Improve Characterization", "paragraphs": ["\u201c has been unsuccessful in demonstrating tangible results on waste characterization; total program performance is considered a significant deficiency for the evaluation period.

In addition, DOE, Westinghouse, and Ecology provided annotated comments on technical aspects of the draft. We have incorporated those comments where appropriate.", "DOE said that while the report accurately describes past difficulties with the characterization program, the report does not adequately recognize the performance improvements accomplished since February 1995. DOE provided a list of accomplishments that included developing program strategy documents, completing tank safety analyses and tank characterization reports, performing laboratory testing of wastes, acquiring new drilling equipment, and increasing the number of samples taken. In determining DOE\u2019s progress, we used the criteria in the agreements DOE has signed with Washington State, EPA, and the Safety Board. We also developed and compared data on waste samples planned and accomplished, since sample data are essential for completing characterization. In addition, we documented other activities DOE accomplished that could help in meeting characterization objectives and included many of them in our report. We believe that we have adequately emphasized that DOE recently has made more progress in taking and analyzing samples and in completing other characterization activities.", "DOE and Westinghouse were concerned that our report could be interpreted to mean that because of problems with the characterization program, DOE could not ensure that the tanks are safe. DOE and Westinghouse officials believe that the tanks are safe because of the controls they have put in place over tank farm operations, including sampling activities. These controls are designed to prevent harmful releases due to such conditions as high temperature and/or flammability risks. We did not evaluate the level of safety associated with the tank wastes and did not intend to imply that the tanks are unsafe because of deficiencies in the characterization program. We revised our report to clarify that DOE believes the tank wastes are being safely stored. However, our report does explain that the Safety Board has directed DOE to conduct additional characterization of tank wastes to ensure that they are safely stored. Until those characterization activities are complete and the waste constituents are better understood, DOE has placed controls over the tanks to provide an added level of assurance.", "While DOE officials agreed with the value of having an outside technical review of the characterization program, they noted that DOE had recently begun such an effort with one of its contractors, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Specifically, DOE is planning to fund a study team to help resolve critical uncertainties related to the safety of the tank wastes. The team will also develop an approach to integrate data needs to support all aspects of the tank waste program, from current operations to treatment and disposal of the wastes. This proposal was drafted in December 1995, after we completed our field work. On the basis of the initial documentation DOE provided, it appears the study team will focus on resolving uncertainties related to tank safety rather than evaluate the viability of the characterization program. We continue to believe that a group, independent of ongoing tank waste and related DOE activities, needs to address the technical feasibility of the characterization strategy.", "DOE and Westinghouse disagreed with our view that difficulties in characterizing the wastes could affect the remaining steps in the disposal program, including the design and construction of facilities to treat the wastes. DOE said that at sampling rates achieved since March 1995, it expects characterization of the wastes to be complete by 2004, which DOE believes is adequate to support the disposal program. In addition, DOE said that enough information exists now to proceed with the design and construction of treatment facilities. DOE expressed concern that any deferral of funding for remediation could make it difficult to keep the project moving forward to accomplish waste treatment and disposal. Ecology officials shared similar concerns.", "We believe our report accurately describes the potential effect that characterization difficulties could have on the remaining steps in the remediation program. For example, even DOE\u2019s latest schedule for completing characterization could be in jeopardy. First, DOE is unsure if Westinghouse can maintain a core sampling rate of four to five samples per month. Recent additional controls placed on the tanks and other sampling problems may make this sampling rate difficult to achieve. Second, DOE\u2019s projected completion of characterization by 2004 is based on a characterization approach that has not been validated. Third, quantities of certain waste constituents need to be determined to minimize uncertainties that affect the construction of treatment facilities. On the basis of our discussions with DOE and Ecology, we agree that facility design activities could proceed as characterization work continues, and we have modified our report accordingly. However, on the basis of this report and our previous work, we continue to believe that construction of treatment facilities should not be funded until the technical adequacy of DOE\u2019s characterization strategy is confirmed or established by independent sources and sufficient waste characterization information is available to reliably define the requirements of those facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Most of our work was performed at DOE\u2019s Hanford site in Washington State. To determine DOE\u2019s progress in meeting the tank waste characterization commitments, we reviewed tank waste characterization milestones that DOE committed to with the Washington State Department of Ecology and the Environmental Protection Agency in the Tri-Party Agreement and with the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. We compared these commitments with DOE\u2019s actual sampling results through September 1995, the latest month for which data were available.", "To identify impediments to progress and determine what impact these impediments could have, we reviewed tank characterization reports, engineering studies, characterization technical basis documents, characterization project strategy documents, and other materials. We reviewed Ecology and Safety Board reports and correspondence with DOE on concerns associated with the characterization program, and we reviewed program documents detailing program improvements in the management of the characterization project and in Westinghouse\u2019s sampling capability.
