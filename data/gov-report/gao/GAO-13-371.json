While no single requirement was cited as burdensome by a majority of the 18 experts, 11 cited various consumer disclosure requirements--such as those pertaining to campus safety--primarily due to the time and difficulty needed to gather the information. Beyond consumer disclosures, 4 experts cited \"Return of Title IV Funds\"--which requires schools to calculate and return unearned financial aid to the federal government when a recipient withdraws from school--as burdensome because schools find it difficult to calculate the precise amount of funds that should be returned. More broadly, 6 experts said that the cumulative burden of multiple requirements is a substantial challenge. Experts also noted some benefits. For example, an expert said required loan disclosures help students understand their repayment responsibilities.", "School officials who participated in each of the eight discussion groups GAO conducted expressed similar views about the types of burdens and benefits associated with Title IV requirements. Participants in all groups said requirements for consumer disclosures and Return of Title IV Funds are costly and complicated. Regarding consumer disclosures, participants questioned the value of disclosing data that cannot be readily compared across schools, like data on graduates' employment, which may be calculated using different methodologies. Participants in four groups found Return of Title IV Funds requirements difficult to complete within the required time frame. Participants also cited some benefits, such as how consumer disclosures can help applicants choose the right school and unearned Title IV funds can be redirected to other students.", "Education seeks feedback from schools on regulatory burden mainly through formal channels, such as announcements posted in the Federal Register, on its website, and on a department listserv. However, Education officials said they have received a limited number of comments about burden in response to these announcements.

Schools participating in Title IV programs must comply with a  variety of requirements established by statute and Education\u2019s  regulations. For example, some of these requirements are designed to  maintain the integrity of the federal programs, while others require the  disclosure of information that can help consumers make more informed  decisions about postsecondary attendance.

To understand which, if any,  federal requirements experts say are burdensome, we conducted  interviews with representatives of nine higher education associations as  well as nine individuals with postsecondary expertise, including  researchers and financial aid professionals from individual schools. We  chose these experts based on several factors such as the relevance of  their published work to our topic. To determine the types of burdens and  benefits that schools say requirements create, we conducted eight  discussion groups at two national conferences comprised of a  nongeneralizable sample of 51 representatives from public, private  nonprofit, and private for-profit schools. To determine how Education  solicits feedback from stakeholders on regulatory burden, we interviewed  Education officials and reviewed documents related to the department\u2019s  retrospective analysis of regulations, as well as its negotiated rulemaking  process. We also examined public comments on burden provided in  response to Education\u2019s notices about its plans to collect information by  reviewing a database from reginfo.gov.

Among other  things, these disclosure requirements include providing certain  information about schools, such as student enrollment, graduation rates,  and cost of attendance. The most frequently mentioned consumer  disclosure requirement\u2014cited by 5 experts as burdensome\u2014was the  \u201cClery Act\u201d campus security and crime statistics disclosure requirement.  Two experts noted the burden associated with reporting security data,  some of which may overlap with federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies. Beyond consumer disclosures, 4 experts stated that schools  are burdened by requirements related to the return of unearned Title IV  funds to the federal government when a student receiving financial aid  withdraws from school. According to 2 experts, schools find it  particularly difficult both to calculate the precise amount of funds that  should be returned and to determine the date on which a student  withdrew. Finally, 6 experts we interviewed stated that, in their view, it is  the accumulation of burden imposed by multiple requirements\u2014rather  than burden derived from a single requirement\u2014that accounts for the  burden felt by postsecondary schools. Three stated that requirements are  incrementally added, resulting in increased burden over time.", "Experts also described some of the benefits associated with Title IV  requirements.

For example, participants in four  groups said the requirement that schools receiving Title IV funds post a  net price calculator on their websites\u2014an application that provides  consumers with estimates of the costs of attending a school\u2014has proven  costly or complicated, noting challenges such as those associated with  the web application, obtaining the necessary data, or providing  information that may not fit the schools\u2019 circumstances. School officials  from six discussion groups also noted that complying with requirements  related to the Return of Title IV Funds can be costly because of the time  required to calculate how much money should be returned to the federal  government (see Appendix III for information on selected comments on  specific federal requirements school officials described as burdensome).", "Participants in six of eight discussion groups said that consumer  disclosures were complicated, and participants in seven groups said that Return of Title IV Funds requirements were complicated. For  example, participants in one discussion group stated that consumer  disclosures are complicated because reporting periods can vary for  different types of information. Another explained that the complexity of  consumer disclosures is a burden to staff because the information can be  difficult to explain to current or prospective students. Also, participants in  two groups stated that the complexity of consumer disclosures makes it  difficult for schools to ensure compliance with the requirements. Likewise,  participants noted that calculating the amount of Title IV funds that should  be returned can be complicated because of the difficulty of determining  the number of days a student attended class as well as the correct  number of days in the payment period or period of enrollment for courses  that do not span the entire period. Participants in three discussion groups  found the complexity of Return of Title IV requirements made it difficult to  complete returns within the required time frame. In addition, participants  from four groups noted the complexity increases the risk of audit findings,  which puts pressure on staff.", "Discussion group participants identified other types of concerns that apply  primarily to consumer disclosures. For example, participants in two  groups said that it is burdensome for schools to make public some  disclosures, such as graduates\u2019 job placement data, because they cannot  easily be compared across schools, thereby defeating the purpose of the  information.", "Like six of the experts we interviewed, participants in six discussion  groups noted that burden results from the accumulation of many  requirements rather than a few difficult requirements. Two participants  said that when new requirements are added, generally, none are taken  away. Similarly, two other participants commented that the amount of  information schools are required to report grows over time. Another  commented that it is difficult to get multiple departments within a school to  coordinate in order to comply with the range of requirements to which  schools are subject under Title IV. Other federal requirements, in addition  to those related to Title IV, may also apply to postsecondary schools (see  Appendix IV for selected examples).", "School officials also described some benefits of Title IV requirements.  Participants in three discussion groups pointed out that some consumer  information can be used to help applicants choose the right school. Other  participants commented that consumer disclosures encourage  transparency.

Specifically, four experts and participants in six of  our discussion groups expressed concern that when the negotiated  rulemaking process does not achieve consensus, the department may  draft regulations unencumbered by negotiators\u2019 input, which may have  addressed burden. According to those we spoke with, consensus may not  be achieved, for example, if Education includes controversial topics over  which there is likely to be disagreement or declines to agree with other  negotiators. Education officials responded that their goal during  negotiated rulemakings is to draft the best language for the regulation.  Further, department officials said that negotiators can collectively agree to  make changes to the agenda, unanimous consensus provides negotiators  with an incentive to work together, and that the department cannot avoid  negotiated rulemaking on controversial topics.

Except in  unusual instances, the date of the institution\u2019s determination that the  student withdrew should be no later than 14 days (less if the school has a  policy requiring determination in fewer than 14 days) after the student\u2019s  last date of attendance as determined by the institution from its  attendance records.\u201d Federal Student Aid Handbook, June 2012, and  Education \u201cDear Colleague Letters\u201d GEN-04-03 Revised, Nov. 2004, and  DCL GEN-11-14, July 20, 2011.", "Summary of Related Federal Provisions  An institution is required to return any unearned Title IV funds it is  responsible for returning within 45 days of the date the school determined  the student withdrew. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091b(b)(1), 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 668.22(j)(1),  668.173(b).", "For a student who withdraws from a school that is not required to take  attendance without providing notification, the school must determine the  withdrawal date no later than 30 days after the end of the earlier of (1) the  payment period or the period of enrollment (as applicable), (2) the  academic year, or (3) the student\u2019s educational program. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7  668.22(j)(2).  \u201cIf a student who began attendance and has not officially withdrawn fails to  earn a passing grade in at least one course over an entire period, the  institution must assume, for Title IV purposes, that the student has  unofficially withdrawn, unless the institution can document that the student  completed the period.  \u201cIn some cases, a school may use its policy for awarding or reporting final  grades to determine whether a student who failed to earn a passing grade  in any of his or her classes completed the period. For example, a school  might have an official grading policy that provides instructors with the  ability to differentiate between those students who complete the course  but failed to achieve the course objectives and those students who did not  complete the course. If so, the institution may use its academic policy for  awarding final grades to determine that a student who did not receive at  least one passing grade nevertheless completed the period. Another  school might require instructors to report, for all students awarded a non- passing grade, the student\u2019s last day of attendance (LDA). The school  may use this information to determine whether a student who received all  \u201cF\u201d grades withdrew. If one instructor reports that the student attended  through the end of the period, then the student is not a withdrawal. In the  absence of evidence of a last day of attendance at an academically  related activity, a school must consider a student who failed to earn a  passing grade in all classes to be an unofficial withdrawal.\u201d Federal  Student Aid Handbook, June 2012, and Education \u201cDear Colleague Letter\u201d  GEN-04-03 Revised, Nov. 2004.", "All references to \u201cstatute\u201d or \u201cregulations\u201d are references to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA),  as amended, and Education\u2019s implementing regulations.", "All references to \u201celigible institutions\u201d refer to eligible institutions participating in Title IV programs, as  defined by the HEA, as amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Selected Examples of Other Federal Requirements That May Apply to Postsecondary Schools", "paragraphs": ["Postsecondary schools may be subject to numerous federal requirements  in addition to those related to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965,  as amended, which may be established by various other statutes or  regulations promulgated by different agencies.
