SBA's guaranteed portion on these loans was approximately $28.8 million. Of the total population of 170 loans, 74 loans defaulted, 55 of which (74 percent) originated from four lenders that had the highest loan volume and default rates on loans to the franchisees. SBA made guarantee payments of around $11 million on the defaulted loans to franchisees, including about $8.5 million in guarantee payments on the 55 defaulted loans from these four lenders. Of the 88 loans reviewed from the four lenders, 55 (63 percent) defaulted. In comparison, 19 of the 82 loans (23 percent) that originated at the other 50 lenders to the franchisees defaulted. As part of GAO's investigative work, GAO interviewed the owners of 22 franchisees of the franchise organization in GAO's review, of which 16 defaulted on their loans and 10 filed for bankruptcy protection. Interviewed franchisees noted difficulties meeting anticipated revenue estimates and limited access to information that would aid in business planning.", "GAO was unable to conclusively determine whether the loan agent referred to GAO for investigation intentionally provided exaggerated revenue projections to franchisees to help them qualify for SBA loans, and SBA has taken initial steps to enhance program oversight. The loan agent stated that she obtained the revenue projections from her employer and former clients, one of which she identified. She then provided these revenue projections to clients. The employer and former client she identified denied providing the revenue projections to the loan agent. SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management debarred the loan agent and her employer for encouraging false statements, among other things, making them ineligible to work with the federal government for a period of 3 years beginning in January 2012. According to GAO's analysis, the first-year projected revenues on loan applications involving the loan agent or her employer were, on average, more than twice the amount of actual first-year revenue for 19 of the 24 franchisees reviewed. Potential franchisees should include first-year revenue estimates in their SBA loan applications. However, this information is not necessarily available to potential franchisees in the franchise organization's disclosure document, which provides information about the organization's financial performance representations and franchisees' estimated initial investment, among other things. Further, federal regulations do not require franchise organizations to provide actual first-year average revenues for start-up businesses in their disclosure document. Thus, potential franchisees may have to conduct due diligence to identify this information from other sources, if available. GAO also identified discrepancies and other issues in SBA's franchise loan data with respect to fields used for risk-based oversight of its loans portfolio, such as default status, number of loans, and loan agent information. SBA has taken, or is considering steps, to address these issues and enhance oversight of loan agents. For instance, SBA is working with a third-party vendor to replace SBA's current franchise codes with publicly available identifiers used in the franchise industry. At the time of GAO's review, it was too early in the process to assess the effectiveness of these actions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2003 to 2012, the Small Business Administration (SBA)  guaranteed 32,323 franchise loans under its 7(a) program\u2014a lending  program intended to assist small-business borrowers, including  franchisees\u2014totaling around $10.6 billion.

Default on an SBA loan may result in taxpayer loss, as  well as potential personal hardship for the borrower, such as financial  distress or bankruptcy. As part of its oversight efforts, SBA generally  conducts reviews of all 7(a) lenders with SBA-guaranteed loan portfolios  of $10 million or more on a 12- to 24-month cycle. SBA can conduct  additional reviews of the lenders if it identifies specific performance  concerns.", "We have previously reported on SBA\u2019s oversight of the 7(a) program, in  particular SBA\u2019s assessments of lenders\u2019 practices for determining  whether borrowers were unable to obtain credit at reasonable terms in the  conventional lending market and the agency\u2019s use of the lender risk-rating  system for oversight and predicting lender performance. We reported  that SBA\u2019s 7(a) program had some program weaknesses, such as limited  guidance on how lenders should document that borrowers could not  obtain credit elsewhere. We made several recommendations, including  one that SBA issue more detailed guidance to lenders on how to  document their compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. SBA  generally agreed and has taken some action in response, such as  revising its guidance to lenders on how to document their determination  that borrowers could not obtain credit elsewhere.", "You asked that we examine SBA-guaranteed loans to franchisees, and to  investigate an allegation that a loan agent provided exaggerated revenue  projections to franchisees of the same franchise organization to help them  qualify for SBA loans.

We selected this date range in  order to obtain a broad understanding of SBA-guaranteed loans to  franchisees during different economic conditions and from multiple  lenders. The original dataset we received from SBA included 184 loans to  franchisees; however, 16 of these indicated that the lender canceled the  guarantee on the loan and 2 were outside the scope of our review. We  therefore excluded these loans from our analysis. From these data, we  selected four lenders with the highest loan volume and default rates.  Three of these four lenders are preferred lenders, which mean they have  delegated authority to make lending decisions on behalf of SBA. We also  reviewed 88 SBA loan packages for these four lenders in order to  examine characteristics of individual loans, such as the extent to which  the franchisees\u2019 projected first-year revenues differed from actual first- year revenues, as well as to assess the accuracy of certain data fields in  the SBA franchise loan data. These loan packages included all loan  packages for these lenders during this time period. We assessed the  reliability of the SBA loan data by comparing it to information in loan files  for the four lenders and interviewing knowledgeable agency officials.

We compared these calculations with the projected revenues in  SBA loan applications for select franchisees. We also calculated average  revenues for a broader population of franchisees, and compared it to  average revenues reported in the franchise organization\u2019s disclosure  documents. We identified several issues with the accuracy and  completeness of the franchise organization\u2019s revenue data, including  missing, duplicate, and nonsequential revenue data.

We interviewed the owner of the  franchise organization, the loan agent who was the subject of the  allegation, her employer, eight former franchisees that were referred to us  during the course of the investigation, and a bank officer who reviewed  loans related to the allegation. To better understand the franchisees\u2019  experience with the 7(a) program, we interviewed 14 additional  franchisees of the select franchise organization. We selected these  franchisees on the basis of a range of factors, including whether they  used a loan agent, geographic dispersion, and performance status of the  loan. The 14 franchisees received 19 SBA-guaranteed loans from one of  the four lenders included in our review.

The only other  lender with a comparable number of loans had one defaulted loan.", "In addition, we provided a draft of this report to the franchise organization  for its review and comment. The representatives of the franchise  organization provided comments on a draft of this report, which we have  reprinted in appendix IV. In their comments, representatives of the  franchise organization stated that our comparison of average revenues in  the FDD and our first-year average revenue calculations is potentially  misleading and inaccurate because the two sets of data being compared  are not analogous. Specifically, representatives of the franchise  organization stated that we are comparing two different sets of data and  that we point out a significant difference in revenue without explaining the  differences in such figures. The representatives requested that we more  clearly state the differences between revenue information contained in the  FDD and our calculations, which we did.", "However, we disagree with the representatives\u2019 comments that our  comparison is potentially misleading and inaccurate. The report  comments on the use of the FDD for projecting first-year revenue, not on  the accuracy of the average revenue reported in the franchise  organization\u2019s FDDs. Specifically, the report states that the average  revenue in the FDD accounted for all franchisees in operation the full  calendar year before issuance of the FDD. However, we added additional  language to clarify that our calculation is of first-year average revenue  obtained from reviewing additional revenue data we obtained from the  franchise organization. Our comparison highlights the difficulties of using  the FDD as a basis for projecting first-year revenues, since the revenue  reported in the franchise organization\u2019s FDD is derived from businesses  in operation at least the full calendar year prior to issuance of the FDD.  As noted in our report, while franchise organizations can choose to  include earnings statements in the FDD, federal regulations do not  require them to provide first-year average revenues for start-up  businesses in the disclosure document. However, franchisees are  required to include first-year revenue estimates in SBA loan applications,  and this information is not necessarily available to potential franchisees in  the FDD; thus, they may have to conduct additional due diligence to  identify this information from other sources, if available. As noted in our  report, several franchisees told us that they use FDDs when developing  revenue estimates, and we found that the reported average revenue in  the franchise organization\u2019s FDD tended to be higher than our first-year  average revenue calculations. The purpose of our analysis was not to  assess the accuracy of the franchise organization\u2019s reported revenues in  the FDD, as the representatives suggest in their comments, but to  demonstrate how the FDD figures were, on average, higher than our first- year average revenue calculations.", "In addition, as noted in the report, our calculation of average revenues  including existing businesses did not vary substantially from the franchise  organization\u2019s figures. Representatives of the franchise organization  requested that we state more clearly in the text of the report that we did  not identify a substantial difference between our average revenue  calculations and the franchise organization average revenue in the FDD  when including existing businesses. We modified our report to more  clearly state this information. However, by excluding existing businesses  in our calculation, to the extent possible, we highlighted how average  revenues disclosed in the franchise organization\u2019s FDDs tended to be  higher than first-year average revenues, which we believe is material to  our discussion about the importance of franchisees\u2019 conducting due  diligence when applying for a 7(a) loan. The franchise organization  agreed that potential franchisees must be careful in using information in  the FDD for estimating first-year revenue. In addition, the representatives  of the franchise organization noted additional provisions in the FDD that  address how a prospective franchisee can gather further information.

We  selected this date range in order to obtain a broad understanding of SBA- guaranteed loans to the franchisees during different economic conditions  and from multiple lenders. The original dataset we received from SBA  included 184 loans to franchisees; however, 16 of these indicated that the  lender canceled the guarantee on the loan and 2 were outside the scope  of our review. We therefore excluded these loans from our analysis of  SBA\u2019s loan data for the franchise organization. From these data, we  selected four lenders with the highest loan volume and default rates.  Three of these four lenders are preferred lenders that have delegated  authority to make lending decisions on behalf of SBA. We also reviewed  88 SBA loan packages for these four lenders in order to assess  characteristics of individual loans, such as the extent to which the  franchisees\u2019 projected first-year revenues differed from actual first-year  revenues, and to assess the accuracy of certain data fields in the SBA  franchise loan data. These loan packages included all loan packages for  these lenders during this time period. We obtained copies of SBA\u2019s risk- based review reports for the four lenders. We also searched the website  PACER.gov to determine if any of the franchisees that received 1 of the  88 SBA loans filed for bankruptcy.information from the four lenders when available. To assess the reliability  of the SBA franchise loan data for the franchisees of the franchise  organization, we (1) interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the  data, (2) performed electronic testing for completeness and accuracy on  select data fields, and (3) traced fields in SBA\u2019s loan database to primary  source files when possible. We found discrepancies between data in  SBA\u2019s loan database and information in the loan files we reviewed. We  discussed reasons for the differences between the data sources, as well  as the agency\u2019s processes and policies for managing the quality of  franchise loan data, with SBA officials. After discussions with SBA, we  determined the SBA loan data were sufficiently reliable for reviewing  loans to the franchise organization.  Moreover, we analyzed revenue data that we obtained from the franchise  organization to calculate actual first-year revenues of franchisees, when  possible. We compared these calculations with the projected first-year  revenues in SBA loan applications for 19 franchisees who used the loan  agent, or her employer, who was the subject of the allegation. We also  used the franchise organization\u2019s revenue data to calculate average first- year revenues for a broader population of franchisees, and compared it to  average revenues reported in the franchise organization\u2019s disclosure  documents. We noted several data limitations with the franchise  organization\u2019s revenue data. The scope of our review included  businesses with a full 12 months of revenue data that began from years  2000 to 2011, since our objective was to calculate an entire year of  business revenue for businesses that opened during that time period. The  original revenue data provided by the franchise organization included 746  businesses. After excluding 59 businesses with fewer than 12 months of  revenue data and 149 businesses that may have opened prior to January  2000 (16 businesses affected by both of these issues), the total  population of businesses in the revenue data was reduced to 554. In  addition, we identified 115 businesses with revenue data that highlighted  potential reliability issues, including missing, duplicate, and nonsequential  revenue data. For purposes of data reliability, we excluded these  businesses from our calculations, and conducted analysis on the  remaining 439 businesses. To the extent possible, we calculated an  average revenue figure that reflected first-year revenue of start-up   We obtained franchise loan  franchisees. Accordingly, for part of our analysis, we excluded 63  businesses from the revenue dataset that the franchise organization  identified as existing businesses, for a total population of 376 businesses.  The franchise organization was not able to confirm that it identified all  existing businesses, so our average revenue calculations may include  both start-up franchisees and existing franchisees. Nonetheless, we  believe the average revenue figures we calculated provide a reasonable  basis of comparison to projected revenues for select start-up franchisees,  as well the franchise organization\u2019s disclosure documents. We discussed  this methodology with representatives of the franchise organization, who  confirmed our approach was reasonable. To further assess the reliability  of the revenue data, we interviewed representatives of the franchise  organization and performed electronic testing on the data provided. We  determined that the franchise organization\u2019s revenue data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We also interviewed SBA officials about their activities related to  oversight of the four lenders, efforts to track and monitor loan agents, and  the assistance provided to potential franchisees during the loan  application process. In addition, we examined SBA\u2019s policies and  procedures for overseeing lenders in the 7(a) program. We also reviewed  reports by SBA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and other related  documents.", "To conduct our investigative work, we reviewed an allegation that a loan  agent intentionally exaggerated first-year revenue projections on SBA  loan applications in order to ensure that franchisees would qualify for SBA  7(a) loans. We interviewed the owner of the franchise organization, the  loan agent who was the subject of the allegation, her employer, eight  former franchisees that were referred to us during the course of the  investigation, and a bank officer that reviewed loans related to the  allegation. To better understand the franchisees\u2019 experience with the 7(a)  loan program, we interviewed 14 additional franchisees of the select  franchise organization who received 19 SBA-guaranteed loans from one  of the four lenders with the highest loan volume and default rates. These  franchisees were selected on the basis of a range of factors, including  whether they used a loan agent, geographic dispersion, and performance  status of the loan. We also interviewed three additional loan agents. In  addition, on the basis of the 88 loan packages we reviewed for the four  lenders, we identified 24 franchisees that used the loan agent connected  to the allegation, or her employer, 19 of whom had data available to  compare the first-year revenue projections on their SBA loan applications  with the franchisees\u2019 actual first-year revenue. We cannot generalize our  findings from these interviews to other franchisees, loan agents, franchise  organizations, or borrowers in the 7(a) program.

Rather  than suspending or revoking delegated authority, officials said SBA is  more likely to deny a renewal of delegated authority or grant a shortened  renewal period, since the renewal period can be from 6 months to 2  years.
