For example, heating and air conditioning units could stop functioning properly and card-entry security systems could cease to operate.", "Year 2000-related problems have already been identified. For example, an automated Defense Logistics Agency system erroneously deactivated 90,000 inventoried items as the result of an incorrect date calculation. According to the agency, if the problem had not been corrected (which took 400 work hours), the impact would have seriously hampered its mission to deliver materiel in a timely manner. In another case, the Department of Defense\u2019s Global Command Control System, which is used to generate a common operating picture of the battlefield for planning, executing, and managing military operations, failed testing when the date was rolled over to the year 2000.", "Our reviews of federal agency Year 2000 programs have found uneven progress. Some agencies are significantly behind schedule and are at high risk that they will not fix their systems in time.

Key economic sectors that could be seriously impacted if their systems are not Year 2000 compliant are information and telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; utilities; and manufacturing and small business. The information and telecommunications infrastructure is especially important because it (1) enables the electronic transfer of funds, (2) is essential to the service economy, manufacturing, and efficient delivery of raw materials and finished goods, and (3) is basic to responsive emergency services. Illustrations of Year 2000 risks follow.", "According to the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision\u2014an international committee of banking supervisory authorities\u2014failure to address the Year 2000 issue would cause banking institutions to experience operational problems or even bankruptcy. Moreover, the Chair of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, a U.S. interagency council composed of federal bank, credit union, and thrift institution regulators, stated that banking is one of America\u2019s most information-intensive businesses and that any malfunctions caused by the century date change could affect a bank\u2019s ability to meet its obligations. He also stated that of equal concern are problems that customers may experience that could prevent them from meeting their obligations to banks and that these problems, if not addressed, could have repercussions throughout the nation\u2019s economy.", "According to the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the year 2000 presents a serious challenge to the world\u2019s financial markets. Because they are highly interconnected, a disruption in one segment can spread quickly to others.", "FAA recently met with representatives of airlines, aircraft manufacturers, airports, fuel suppliers, telecommunications providers, and industry associations to discuss the Year 2000 issue. Participants raised the concern that their own Year 2000 compliance would be irrelevant if FAA were not compliant because of the many system interdependencies. Representatives went on to say that unless FAA were substantially Year 2000 compliant on January 1, 2000, flights would not get off the ground and that extended delays would be an economic disaster.", "Another risk associated with the transportation sector was described by the Federal Highway Administration, which stated that highway safety could be severely compromised because of potential Year 2000 problems in operational transportation systems. For example, date-dependent signal timing patterns could be incorrectly implemented at highway intersections if traffic signal systems run by state and local governments do not process four-digit years correctly.", "One risk associated with the utility sector is the potential loss of electrical power. For example, Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff believe that safety-related safe shutdown systems will function but that a worst-case scenario could occur in which Year 2000 failures in several nonsafety-related systems could cause a plant to shut down, resulting in the loss of off-site power and complications in tracking post-shutdown plant status and recovery.", "With respect to the health, safety, and emergency services sector, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Year 2000 issue holds serious implications for the nation\u2019s health care providers and researchers. Medical devices and scientific laboratory equipment may experience problems beginning January 1, 2000, if the computer systems, software applications, or embedded chips used in these devices contain two-digit fields for year representation. In addition, according to the Gartner Group, health care is substantially behind other industries in Year 2000 compliance, and it predicts that at least 10 percent of mission-critical systems in this industry will fail because of noncompliance.", "One of the largest, and largely unknown, risks relates to the global nature of the problem. With the advent of electronic communication and international commerce, the United States and the rest of the world have become critically dependent on computers. However, there are indications of Year 2000 readiness problems in the international arena. In September 1997, the Gartner Group, a private research firm acknowledged for its expertise in Year 2000 issues, surveyed 2,400 companies in 17 countries and concluded that \u201chirty percent of all companies have not started dealing with the year 2000 problem.\u201d", "Based on its survey, the Gartner Group also ranked certain countries and areas of the world. According to the Gartner Group, countries/areas at level I on its scale of compliance\u2014just getting started\u2014include Eastern Europe, many African countries, many South American countries, and several Asian countries, including China. Those at level II\u2014completed the inventory process and have begun the assessment process\u2014include Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Taiwan, and Western Europe. Finally, some companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia are at levels II while others are at level III. Level III indicates that a program plan has been completed and dedicated resources are committed and in place.", "Although there are many national and international risks related to the year 2000, our limited review of these key sectors found a number of private-sector organizations that have raised awareness and provided advice.

The amount of attention devoted to this issue has increased in the last year, culminating with the issuance of a February 4, 1998, executive order establishing the President\u2019s Council on Year 2000 Conversion. The Council Chair is to oversee federal agency Year 2000 efforts as well as act as spokesman in national and international forums, coordinate with state and local governments, promote appropriate federal roles with respect to private- sector activities, and report to the President on a quarterly basis.", "This increased attention could help minimize the disruption to the nation as the millennium approaches.

According to OMB\u2019s latest report, as of February 15, 1998, only about 35 percent of federal agencies\u2019 mission-critical systems were considered to be Year 2000 compliant. This leaves over 3,500 mission-critical systems, as well as thousands of nonmission-critical systems, still to be repaired, and over 1,100 systems to be replaced. It is unlikely that agencies can complete this vast amount of work in time. Accordingly, it is critical that the executive branch identify those systems that are of the highest priority. These include those that, if not corrected, could most seriously threaten health and safety, the financial well-being of American citizens, national security, or the economy.", "Agencies must also ensure that their mission-critical systems can properly exchange data with other systems and are protected from errors that can be introduced by external systems. For example, agencies that administer key federal benefits payment programs, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, must exchange data with the Department of the Treasury, which, in turn, interfaces with financial institutions, to ensure that beneficiary checks are issued.

Accordingly, the status of these agencies\u2019 Year 2000 programs has not been monitored centrally. On March 9, 1998, OMB asked 31 independent agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, to report on their progress in fixing the Year 2000 problem by April 30, 1998. OMB plans to include a summary of those responses in its next quarterly report to the Congress. However, unlike its quarterly reporting requirement for the major departments and agencies, OMB does not plan to request that the independent agencies report again until next year. Since the independent agencies will not be reporting again until April 1999, it will be difficult for OMB to be in a position to address any major problems.", "Agencies are required to report their progress in repairing noncompliant systems but are not required to report on their progress in implementing systems to replace noncompliant systems, unless the replacement effort is behind schedule by 2 months or more. Because federal agencies have a poor history of delivering new system capabilities on time, it is essential to know agencies\u2019 progress in implementing replacement systems.", "OMB\u2019s guidance does not specify what steps must be taken to complete each phase of a Year 2000 program (i.e., assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation).

Accordingly, in their February 1998 quarterly reports, several agencies reported that they planned to develop contingency plans only if they fall behind schedule in completing their Year 2000 fixes.", "Agencies that develop contingency plans only for systems currently behind schedule, however, are not addressing the need to ensure the continuity of a minimal level of core business operations in the event of unforeseen failures. As a result, when unpredicted failures occur, agencies will not have well-defined responses and may not have enough time to develop and test effective contingency plans. Contingency plans should be formulated to respond to two types of failures: those that can be predicted (e.g., system renovations that are already far behind schedule) and those that are unforeseen (e.g., a system that fails despite having been certified as Year 2000 compliant or a system that cannot be corrected by January 1, 2000, despite appearing to be on schedule today).", "Moreover, contingency plans that focus only on agency systems are inadequate. Federal agencies depend on data provided by their business partners as well as on services provided by the public infrastructure. One weak link anywhere in the chain of critical dependencies can cause major disruptions. Given these interdependencies, it is imperative that contingency plans be developed for all critical core business processes and supporting systems, regardless of whether these systems are owned by the agency.", "In its latest governmentwide Year 2000 progress report, issued March 10, 1998, OMB clarified its contingency plan instructions. OMB stated that contingency plans should be developed for all core business functions.

The committee has also established subcommittees on (1) best practices, (2) state issues and data exchanges, (3) industry issues, (4) telecommunications, (5) buildings, (6) biomedical and laboratory equipment, (7) General Services Administration support and commercial off-the-shelf products, and (8) international issues.", "The committee\u2019s effectiveness could be further enhanced. For example, currently agencies are not required to participate in the Year 2000 Committee. Without such full participation, it is less likely that appropriate governmentwide solutions can be implemented. Further, while most of the committee\u2019s subcommittees are currently working on plans, they have not yet published these with associated milestones. It is important that this be done and publicized quickly so that agencies can use this information in their Year 2000 programs. It is equally important that implementation of agency activities resulting from these plans be monitored closely and that the subcommittees\u2019 decisions be enforced.", "Another governmentwide issue that needs to be addressed is the availability of information technology personnel. In their February 1998 quarterly reports, several agencies reported that they or their contractors had problems obtaining and/or retaining information technology personnel. Currently, no governmentwide strategy exists to address recruiting and retaining information technology personnel with the appropriate skills for Year 2000-related work. However, at the March 18, 1998, meeting of the CIO Council, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provided the council with information on the tools that are currently available to help agencies obtain and retain staff. In addition, OPM announced that its Director had agreed in principle that the Year 2000 problem was an \u201cemergency or unusual circumstance\u201d that would allow the Director to grant agencies waivers to allow them to rehire former federal personnel without financial penalty on a temporary basis to address the Year 2000 problem.

The department had reported expenses of about $35.9 billion in fiscal year 1997, most of it for assisted and public housing. HUD also manages more than $400 billion in mortgage insurance and $460 billion in guarantees of mortgage-backed securities. HUD relies extensively on information and financial management systems to manage its programs.", "HUD officials recognize the importance of ensuring that its systems are Year 2000 compliant; system failures could interrupt the processing of applications for mortgage insurance, the payment of mortgage insurance claims, and the payment of rental assistance. This would place a serious strain on individuals and on the nation\u2019s financial and banking community. The department has more than 200 separate systems, with a total of over 65 million lines of software code. Its assessment revealed that over 31 million lines of code will need to be repaired, costing an estimated $48 million and 570,000 staff hours. It recognizes that making its systems Year 2000 compliant will take aggressive action.", "HUD established a Year 2000 project office in June 1996. In May 1997 this office issued a readiness guide for HUD staff and contractors, dealing with all phases of a Year 2000 program. The project office also developed a strategy, endorsed by senior HUD officials, with schedules for the completion of all tasks for each system and a tracking mechanism to monitor progress. Central to this strategy was inventorying its automated systems and performing risk assessments of them. On the basis of these risk assessments, HUD officials decided what actions to take on its automated information systems; the following table summarizes the reported status of this work.", "Although HUD is relying on its plans to replace twelve of its mission-critical systems, its tracking and management systems do not contain information on the status of these systems replacements. Consequently, it does not know about and cannot respond quickly to development delays that could affect Year 2000 readiness.

It is already, however, behind schedule on 20 of these 30 mission-critical systems. While the delays on some of these systems are of only a few days, 13 of the 20 are experiencing delays of 2 months or more.

The system is now scheduled to be implemented on November 4\u2014only 58 days shy of January 1, 1999, the date that HUD has determined the current system will fail. In fiscal year 1997, this system processed, on average, a reported $354 million of lenders\u2019 claims each month for defaulted guaranteed loans. If this system fails, these lenders will not be paid on a timely basis; the economic repercussions could be widespread.", "To better ensure completion of work on mission-critical systems, HUD officials have recently decided to halt routine maintenance on five of its largest systems, beginning April 1 of this year. Further, according to Year 2000 project officials, if more delays threaten key implementation deadlines for mission-critical systems, they will stop work on nonmission-critical systems in order to focus all resources on the most important ones. We concur with HUD\u2019s plans to devote additional attention to its mission-critical systems.", "In conclusion, the change of century will initially present many difficult challenges in information technology and has the potential to cause serious disruption to the nation; however, these risks can be mitigated and disruptions minimized with proper attention and management.
