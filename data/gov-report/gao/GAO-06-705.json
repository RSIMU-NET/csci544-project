The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the federal agency responsible for overseeing states' Medicaid programs and ensuring the propriety of expenditures reported by states for federal reimbursement. In 2002, GAO reported on weaknesses in CMS's oversight of Medicaid financial management and made recommendations to CMS to strengthen its oversight process. In fiscal year 2003, CMS started receiving funds from the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program to help improve Medicaid financial management. GAO was asked to evaluate CMS's financial management activities, including following up on prior recommendations. In this report, GAO examined (1) the extent to which CMS has improved its ability to identify and address emerging issues that put federal Medicaid dollars at risk and (2) how CMS used funds for Medicaid from the HCFAC account."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS has undertaken several steps to improve its Medicaid financial management activities, including its efforts to oversee state claims for federal reimbursement and to identify payment errors. CMS hired about 90 funding specialists, thus enhancing its ability to address high-risk state funding practices that inappropriately increase federal costs. CMS also created a new unit that centralized responsibility for approving state plan amendments related to reimbursement. CMS continued to identify billions of dollars in questionable federal reimbursement through focused financial reviews. CMS also set goals aimed at reducing questionable federal reimbursement and holding financial managers accountable and enhanced its internal processes for tracking results of its financial management activities. These and other efforts, such as CMS's approach for measuring payment errors under the Improper Payments Information Act, represent improvements in the processes that CMS uses in its oversight of states. While these actions also address previously identified weaknesses and recommendations from our 2002 report, it is too soon to assess the impact they will have on improving overall financial management and addressing emerging issues that put federal Medicaid dollars at risk because some have just recently been initiated and results are not known yet. Further, there are a number of previously identified weaknesses that the agency has not yet addressed. Specifically, CMS has not instituted mechanisms to measure how the risk of inappropriate federal reimbursement has changed as a result of corrective actions taken. In addition, CMS has not incorporated the use of the Medicaid Statistical Information System database into its oversight of states' claims or other systems projects intended to improve its analysis capabilities. Further, CMS has not developed profiles to document information on state fraud and abuse controls to use in its oversight of state claims. Finally, CMS has not developed a strategic plan specific to its Medicaid financial management activities. Because these issues are important to further improving and sustaining CMS's oversight activities, we reiterate and build on our prior recommendations in these areas. During fiscal years 2003 through 2005, CMS received almost $46 million from the HCFAC account that it used to help fund programs related to its oversight of the Medicaid program, including about $12 million for the funding specialists for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The funding specialist positions have been funded on an annual basis with appropriations from the HCFAC account. There is the chance that adequate funding might not be provided through the HCFAC process in any given year for the funding specialists; therefore, creating permanent funding specialist positions is important. CMS used the other $34 million for other projects such as researching options for automating the Medicaid state plan process, and interagency agreements with the OIG to conduct audits of high-risk areas. GAO obtained documentation to support the use of HCFAC funds for these projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid\u2014the federal-state program financing health care for certain low- income children, families, and individuals who are aged or disabled\u2014 covered over 56 million people at an estimated cost of $295 billion in fiscal  year 2004.

States and CMS share  responsibility for instituting financial practices for the Medicaid program  that are in compliance with applicable rules, laws, and regulations. In  general, the federal government matches state Medicaid spending for  medical assistance according to a formula based on each state\u2019s per capita  income. The federal contribution ranged from 50 to 77 cents of every state  dollar spent on medical assistance in fiscal year 2004. For most state  Medicaid administrative costs, the federal match rate is 50 percent. For  skilled professional medical personnel, 75 percent federal matching is  available. States are responsible for providing the state share of Medicaid  funding and submitting plans, budgets, and expenditure reports to CMS  that accurately report on the administration of their Medicaid programs  and how they expend Medicaid funds. CMS is responsible for reviewing  the states\u2019 plans, budgets, expenditures, and operations to ensure  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Each state develops  its own administrative structure and establishes its own eligibility  standards, scope of covered services, and payment rates in accordance  with Medicaid statute and within broad federal guidelines. States are  required to describe the nature and scope of their programs in a  comprehensive plan submitted to CMS, with federal funding depending on  CMS\u2019s approval of the plan. State Medicaid plans specify the services to be  provided and how the state will establish the amount it will pay for those  covered services.

CMS  established DRSF to consolidate responsibility for all state Medicaid  payment policy and funding issues. A role of DRSF is to ensure that state  plan amendments for reimbursement of noninstitutional and institutional  services are consistently reviewed and that CMS policy is consistently  applied across the nation. The activities of DRSF have improved CMS\u2019s  ability to effectively deploy its resources to carry out more targeted  oversight activities.

CMS started to develop the:   (1) Transactions, Information Inquiry, and Program Performance System  project\u2014an integrated financial management tool intended to link existing  Medicaid data systems and tools; and (2) Automated Medicaid State Plans  Project\u2014a project to explore collecting electronic submission of state  plans that would provide timely access to critical program information.  CMS officials told us that due to funding constraints, these two projects  have yet to be completed. Determining the systems projects needed to  enhance CMS\u2019s analysis capabilities is important given the challenges of  evaluating state Medicaid expenditures and funding practices.", "Collecting and using information on state fraud and abuse control  activities\u2014In our 2002 report, we recommended that CMS enhance the  information that it uses in its oversight of state claims by creating profiles  that document each state\u2019s activities to oversee its Medicaid program and  prevent fraud and abuse. For example, we recommended that the profiles  include information on provider screening procedures and payment  accuracy studies. CMS currently collects some information on these and  other state program integrity efforts as part of compliance reviews that are  conducted by program integrity staff in DFM and the 10 regional offices.  These compliance reviews are to assess whether state Medicaid program  integrity efforts comply with federal requirements such as those governing  provider enrollment, claims review, and coordination with each state\u2019s  Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. However, CMS officials told us that there is  limited coordination between the staff that conduct the compliance  reviews and the financial management staff that oversee state claims.  Further, the compliance reviews have focused on state compliance and  have not evaluated the effectiveness of the states\u2019 fraud and abuse  prevention and detection activities.", "CMS is starting to develop strategies as part of the recently created  Medicaid Integrity Program that could address the weaknesses that we  have identified. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, enacted in February  2006, provided for the creation of a Medicaid Integrity Program and  required CMS to develop a comprehensive plan for how it would  implement the program. CMS officials have recently begun to develop the  plan and have included proposals for hiring contractors to assess states\u2019  program integrity activities.", "Information on states\u2019 activities to oversee their Medicaid programs and  prevent fraud and abuse is important to determine the appropriate level of  federal oversight that should be applied to each state\u2019s claims. Because  CMS is just starting to develop its plan and results are not known yet, we  are reiterating our prior recommendations in this area.", "Developing a strategic plan to guide Medicaid financial  management activities\u2014In our 2002 report, we reported that CMS was  starting several initiatives, similar to what we are currently reporting, to  bring about improvements in its financial management activities and  oversight. At the time of our 2002 review, CMS did not have a written  strategic plan that described its many oversight activities and initiatives  and the staff responsible for implementing them. Therefore, we  recommended that CMS develop a written plan and strategy for Medicaid  financial oversight. However, CMS still has not published a comprehensive  plan that describes the many aspects of its Medicaid financial management  strategy and its plans for continuing and sustaining its recent improvement  efforts.", "A strategic plan is a key management tool that can help clarify  organizational priorities and unify agency staff in the pursuit of shared  goals. Strategic plans are the starting point and basic underpinning for a  system of program goal-setting and performance measurement. In  accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA), a multiyear strategic plan articulates the fundamental mission  (or missions) of an organization, and lays out its long-term general goals  for accomplishing that mission, including the resources needed to reach  these goals. The clearer and more precise these goals are, the better able  the organization will be to maintain a consistent sense of direction,  regardless of leadership changes.", "HHS prepares a strategic plan as required by GPRA. The HHS strategic  plan contains eight broad program performance goals related to the  missions and programs of its operating divisions. However only one goal  relates to Medicaid financial management\u2014an overall goal for all HHS  programs to \u201cachieve excellence in management practices.\u201d Unlike the  Medicare program that started publishing a separate comprehensive plan  for financial management in fiscal year 2001 that outlined problems and  plans to address weaknesses in the Medicare program\u2019s internal controls,  oversight, and financial systems, the Medicaid program has not  developed its own plan for financial management that includes an  appropriate level of detail to be useful as a tool to guide its financial  managers.", "Medicaid officials told us that they have several planning documents\u2014 such as the annual financial management work plans, the FMAR, and the  Financial Issues Report that we previously discussed\u2014that they use in  managing financial management activities. While these documents provide  information on aspects of CMS\u2019s financial management activities, they do  not clearly define the mission of Medicaid financial management, lay out  the goals for continuously implementing the mission, or provide a  complete description of the operational processes, skills, technology, and  other resources required to meet CMS\u2019s financial management goals and  objectives.", "Without a strategic plan, CMS lacks an appropriate \u201croadmap\u201d to guide  activities for ensuring sound financial management of the Medicaid  program.

Congress enacted the HCFAC program as part of  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to  consolidate and strengthen ongoing efforts to combat fraud and abuse in  health care programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The  legislation required the establishment of the national HCFAC program and  it established the HCFAC account within the Medicare Federal Hospital  Insurance Trust Fund, which is funded by appropriations out of the Trust  Fund. The HCFAC program is administered by HHS and the Department of  Justice and is designed to coordinate federal, state, and local law  enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud and abuse. HHS\u2019s  OIG, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Medicare Integrity  Program receive direct appropriations from the HCFAC account, while the  Medicaid program must request funds from the HCFAC account and  compete with other HHS programs, such as the Administration on Aging  and the Office of General Counsel, for allocations from the discretionary  part of the HCFAC account. Table 4 shows the discretionary HCFAC  funds available to CMS in fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and the portion  allocated to the Medicaid program run by CMSO for Medicaid financial  management projects.", "CMSO used this money to help fund projects related to its oversight of  Medicaid. Table 5 shows the various projects for the 3 fiscal years and the  amounts allocated to those projects.", "The HCFAC account provided about $12 million to CMS for the funding  specialists for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The funding specialists have  been funded on an annual basis with appropriations from the HCFAC  account. There is the chance that adequate funding might not be provided  through the HCFAC process in any given year for the funding specialists;  thus CMS officials have told us they would like to pursue ways of making  the funding specialist positions permanent. CMS officials told us that there  was a provision in its fiscal year 2007 budget submission, but the provision  was rejected during department-level discussions, so the funding  specialists will continue to be funded on an annual basis with HCFAC  funds. CMS officials also told us that some of the turnover of funding  specialist staff was due to the uncertainty of funding and whether the  positions would become permanent. Creating permanent funding  specialist positions is important, given how CMS has been using them in  performing reviews of high-risk issues.", "Other Medicaid projects included in table 5 that CMS used HCFAC funds  for include:  interagency agreements between CMS and OIG for OIG audits of high-risk  issues such as family planning services in managed care, skilled  professional medical personnel, upper payment limits, school-based  claims, home- and community-based services, and Medicaid administrative  costs reported by state agencies other than the Medicaid single state  agency;    Medicare-Medicaid data match project developed to identify improper  billing and utilization patterns by matching Medicare and Medicaid claims  information on providers and beneficiaries;    Payment Accuracy Measurement, PERM, and SCHIP Error Rate Pilot  Projects, which allow states to test a methodology to determine improper  payment error rates in their SCHIP and/or Medicaid programs;    Transaction, Information, Inquiry and Program Performance System to  develop and enhance an integrated financial management tool linking  existing CMSO data systems and tools containing critical financial,  statistical, administrative, and other data;    an organizational study of Medicaid financial processes within CMS done  by OIG under an interagency agreement with OIG;    a project referred to as the Annuities Project, which used both qualitative  and quantitative research methods to develop a comprehensive picture of  states\u2019 experience with the use of annuities as an asset-sheltering device  by Medicaid applicants and their spouses;    a Waiver Management System Database project, which updated a current  Waiver Management System Database; and    a project to research options for automating the Medicaid state plan  process from the creation and submission of state plan amendments at the  state level through approval at the central office and regional offices.", "We obtained documentation to support the use of HCFAC funds for the  above projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since we last reported in 2002, CMS has made improvements to the  processes it uses in its efforts to oversee states and identify payment  errors. Efforts undertaken, such as the hiring of the funding specialists,  consolidating the review of reimbursement state plan amendments, and  the Medicare-Medicaid data match project have enhanced CMS\u2019s ability to  identify issues that put federal Medicaid dollars at risk. While CMS\u2019s  actions address previously identified weaknesses and recommendations  from our 2002 report related to (1) targeting resources to higher risk areas,  (2) monitoring performance, (3) establishing mechanisms for ensuring  accountability, (4) developing an approach to payment accuracy reviews  and (5) incorporating advanced control techniques, it is too soon to assess  the impact they will have on improving overall financial management and  addressing emerging issues that put federal Medicaid dollars at risk  because the results of some efforts are not known yet.", "In addition, several weaknesses remain in CMS\u2019s oversight that could be  addressed by implementing our prior recommendations that remain open.", "Specifically, CMS still lacks processes to adjust oversight activities for  changes in risk; therefore, we reiterate our prior recommendation related  to measuring whether risks have changed as a result of corrective actions  to address them. Also, because CMS has not yet addressed weaknesses we  identified in its analysis capabilities, we reiterate our prior  recommendation for CMS to incorporate using MSIS data in its analysis of  state claims. We also reiterate our prior recommendations to CMS for  collecting and using information on state fraud and abuse control  activities because this information is important to determining the  appropriate level of federal oversight of state claims.", "The absence of a strategic plan could hinder CMS in sustaining its current  efforts and addressing the weaknesses that we have identified. Therefore,  we reiterate our prior recommendation that CMS develop a strategic plan  specific to Medicaid financial management.

We  reviewed and assessed aspects of CMS\u2019s financial oversight processes,  which include identifying high-risk areas in order to develop an annual  regional office financial management workplan and conducting focused  financial reviews of high-risk areas. We reviewed 35 of the 113 focused  financial reviews conducted by CMS regional offices for fiscal years 2003  and 2004. We selected reviews of specific issues that were reviewed across  regions and fiscal years, such as disproportionate share hospital payments  and school-based administrative services. We did not select certain issues,  such as upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers, because  these issues have been well-covered in other reports and by CMS\u2019s actions.  We looked for consistency of the reviews among regions and fiscal years  and the extent to which states implemented CMS\u2019s recommendations. We  obtained and reviewed documentation showing the activities and work  performed by the new funding specialists hired by CMS during 2004 and  2005 as part of its efforts to improve its financial management of the  Medicaid program. We reviewed our prior reports and reports by the  Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General  (OIG) and others. We also reviewed interagency agreements between CMS  and OIG. We interviewed OIG staff, and CMS officials and staff at the CMS  central office in Baltimore, Maryland, and two regional offices\u2014New York  and Chicago. We selected the New York and Chicago regional offices to  visit based on the number of focused financial reviews we selected to  review that were performed by these regions.
