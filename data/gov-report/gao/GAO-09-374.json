Generally, factors other than past performance, such as technical approach or cost, were the primary factors for contract award decisions. A majority of officials told us their reluctance to rely more on past performance was due, in part, to their skepticism about the reliability of the information and difficulty assessing relevance to specific acquisitions. Contracting officials agreed that for past performance information to be useful for sharing, it must be documented, relevant, and reliable. However, GAO's review of PPIRS data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 indicates that only a small percentage of contracts had a documented performance assessment; in particular, we found little contractor performance information for orders against the General Services Administration's (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule. Other performance information that could be useful in award decisions, such as contract terminations for default and subcontract management, was not systematically captured across agencies. Some officials noted that a lack of accountability and lack of system tools and metrics made it difficult for managers to ensure timely performance reports. Variations in evaluation and rating factors have also limited the usefulness of past performance information. Finally, a lack of central oversight and management of PPIRS data has hindered efforts to address these and other shortcomings. Several efforts have been initiated to improve PPIRS, but little progress has been made. In 2005, an interagency work group established several broad goals for improving past performance information, including standardizing performance ratings used by various agencies. However, these goals have yet to be met, and no funding has been dedicated for this purpose. In April 2008, changes to federal regulations were proposed that would clarify past performance documentation requirements and require the use of PPIRS. However, as of February 2009, the proposed changes had not been finalized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, federal agencies hire thousands of contractors to help  accomplish their missions. In fiscal year 2007 alone, federal agencies  worked with over 160,000 contractors, obligating over $456 billion.  Contractors are involved in a broad array of activities, from basic  functions, such as landscaping and janitorial services, to more complex  functions, like acquisition support and security services. These contractors  often employ subcontractors to help them meet contract requirements.  This reliance on contractors makes it critical that federal agencies have  the information necessary to properly evaluate a contractor\u2019s prior history  of performance and better inform agencies\u2019 contract award decisions.", "To facilitate the sharing of such information, the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) created the Past Performance Information  Retrieval System (PPIRS)\u2014a system intended to be a repository of  performance information on federal contractors. However, more than 5  years after the implementation of PPIRS in July 2002, questions have been  raised about how well federal agencies are documenting and sharing  information on contractor past performance. Specifically, you have noted  that agencies were renewing or awarding contracts to contractors with  questionable performance records. Consequently, you asked us to review  several issues related to the use of past performance information. In  response to your request, we (1) assessed agencies\u2019 use of information on  contractors\u2019 past performances in awarding contracts; (2) identified  challenges that hinder systematic, governmentwide sharing of past  performance information; and (3) described efforts under way or planned  to improve the sharing of information on contractor performance.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed and analyzed the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) and OFPP guidance on the use of past performance  information. We also reviewed guidance from the Department of Defense  (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the  General Services Administration (GSA). We discussed this guidance and a  broad range of issues related to how agencies use past performance  information with 121 contracting officials at 11 buying offices that  represented a range of acquisition activities. Further, we selected and  analyzed 62 contract files from fiscal years 2007 and 2008\u2014focusing on  how buying offices considered past performance information relative to  other evaluation factors. We selected contracts that represent a range of  products and services, types of contracts, contract dollar values, and  contractors across the government, but our findings cannot be generalized  to all federal contracts. We also analyzed data in PPIRS, past performance  information that agencies feed into PPIRS, the evaluation factors and  rating scales used in the system, and met with agency officials who  administer the system. We conducted this performance audit from  February 2008 to February 2009 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. See  appendix I for a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government relies heavily on contractors to provide a range of  goods and services. In fiscal year 2007, about 160,000 contractors provided  support to federal agencies. A large portion of these contractors was  concentrated in five agencies: DOD, DHS, DOE, NASA, and GSA. Among  these five agencies, DOD accounts for 72 percent of all contract  obligations across about 77,000 contractors in fiscal year 2007 (see table  1).", "These five agencies often rely on the same contractors. Table 2 shows the  number and percentage of contractors DHS, NASA, DOE, and GSA had in  common with DOD in fiscal year 2007.", "The FAR requires agencies to consider past performance information as an  evaluation factor in certain negotiated competitive procurements\u2014along  with other evaluation factors such as price, management capability, and  technical excellence. Contractor past performance information may  include the contractor\u2019s  record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good  workmanship;  record of forecasting and controlling costs;    adherence to contract schedules; and    history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to  customer satisfaction.", "Although the FAR requires officials in selecting contractors to consider  past performance as an evaluation factor in certain negotiated  procurements, agencies have broad discretion in deciding its importance  relative to other factors in the evaluation scheme. Agencies determine  which of the contractor\u2019s past contracts are similar to the contract to be  awarded in terms of size, scope, complexity, or contract type and the  relative importance of past performance. For procurements with clearly  defined requirements and minimal risk of unsuccessful contract  performance, cost or price may play a more important role than past  performance in selecting contractors. For procurements with less clearly  defined requirements and a higher risk of unsuccessful contract  performance, it may be in the government\u2019s best interest to consider past  performance, technical capability, and other factors as more important  than cost or price. The FAR requires that solicitations disclose the  evaluation factors that will be used in selecting a contractor and their  relative importance. In evaluating past performance information, agencies  must consider, among other things, the 1) currency and relevancy, 2)  source and context, and 3) general trends in the contractor\u2019s performance.   The solicitation must also describe how offerors with no performance  history will be evaluated.", "Once a contract is awarded, the government should monitor a contractor\u2019s  performance throughout the performance period. Surveillance includes  oversight of a contractor\u2019s work to provide assurance that the contractor  is providing timely and quality goods or services and to help mitigate any  contractor performance problems. An agency\u2019s monitoring of a  contractor\u2019s performance may serve as a basis for past performance  evaluations. The FAR requires agencies to prepare an evaluation of  contractor performance for each contract that exceeds the simplified  acquisition threshold at the time the work is completed and gives agencies  discretion to include interim evaluations for contracts with a performance  period exceeding one year. The DOD has generally higher thresholds  based on business sectors.", "A number of systems across the government are used to capture  contractor performance information, which is eventually passed on to  PPIRS. DOD maintains three systems for its military departments and  agencies\u2014Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System  (ACASS), Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS),  and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  NASA has its own system, the Past Performance Database (PPDB). DHS  and DOE are transitioning to using DOD\u2019s CPARS. Other civilian  departments use the Contractor Performance System (CPS) managed by  the National Institutes of Health. Effective July 1, 2002, all federal  contractor past performance information currently captured through these  disparate systems was to be centrally available for use by all federal  agency contracting officials through PPIRS\u2014a Web-enabled,  governmentwide application for consolidating federal contractor  performance information.", "Since its implementation, concerns have been raised about the  completeness of the information in PPIRS. In February 2008, a DOD  Inspector General report noted that the information in CPARS, which  feeds information into PPIRS, was incomplete and questioned whether or  not acquisition officials had access to all the information they needed to  make business decisions. Specifically, in reviewing performance  assessment reports in CPARS, the Inspector General reported that for  DOD contracts valued at more than $5 million, 82 percent did not contain  detailed narratives sufficient to establish that ratings were credible and  justifiable; 68 percent had performance reports that were overdue; and 39  percent were registered more than a year late. In addition, the report  identified material internal control weaknesses in the Air Force, Army, and  Navy procedures for documenting and reporting contractor performance  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Other Than Past Performance Generally Drive Contract Award Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies considered past performance information in evaluating  contractors for the contract solicitations we reviewed, but many of the  officials we spoke with noted that past performance rarely, if ever, was the  deciding factor in their contract award decisions. Their reluctance to base  award decisions on past performance was due, in part, to their skepticism  about the comprehensiveness and reliability of past performance  information and difficulty assessing its relevance to specific acquisitions.", "For the 62 contract solicitations we reviewed, the ranking of past  performance as an evaluation factor relative to other non-cost factors  varied. The company\u2019s technical approach was the non-cost factor  considered most important for most solicitations. Past performance as an  evaluation factor was ranked first in order of importance in about 38  percent of solicitations (appendix I provides more details on the  methodology for selecting and reviewing contract solicitations).  Contracting officials who viewed past performance as an important  evaluation factor noted that basing contract award decisions, in part, on  past performance encourages companies to achieve better acquisition  outcomes over the long term. For example, according to officials at one  Air Force location, an incumbent contractor was not awarded a follow-on  contract worth over $1 billion primarily because of poor performance on  the prior contract. As a result, the contractor implemented several  management and procedural changes to improve its performance on  future contracts.", "Despite the fact that past performance was an evaluation factor in all the  solicitations we reviewed, over 60 percent of the contracting officers we  talked with stated that past performance is rarely or never a deciding  factor in selecting a contractor.  Many contracting officers stated they  preferred to rely on other more objective factors such as technical  approach or price. Officials cited several reasons for their reluctance to  rely more on past performance in making award decisions including  difficulty obtaining objective and candid past performance information.  For example, over half of the contracting managers we met with noted  that officials who are assessing a contractor\u2019s performance have difficulty  separating problems caused by the contractor from those caused by the  government, such as changing or poorly defined government  requirements. Fear of damaging contractor relations may also influence  assessments of contractor performance, particularly in areas where there  are a limited number of contractors that can provide a particular good or  service. Some contracting officials told us there may also be a tendency to  \u201cwater down\u201d assessments if they perceive a contractor may contest a  negative rating.  Contracting officials also cited other challenges for not  relying more on past performance information including 1) difficulty  assessing relevance to the specific acquisition or offerors with no relevant  past performance information, 2) lack of documented examples of past  performance, and 3) lack of adequate time to identify, obtain, and analyze  past performance information.", "Contracting officials often rely on multiple sources of past performance  information. Most officials told us they found information from the  prospective contractor\u2019s prior government or industry customer  references\u2014gathered through interviews or questionnaires\u2014as the most  useful source of past performance information. Moreover, several  contracting officials noted that they use questionnaires to obtain past  performance information on major subcontractors. Officials noted,  however, that questionnaires are time-consuming and the performance  information collected through them is not shared governmentwide. Other  sources of past performance information include informal contacts such  as from other contracting officers who have dealt with the contractor in  the past. Most contracting officials we spoke with also used PPIRS, but  cited the absence of information in PPIRS as one reason for typically  relying on other sources along with challenges in ascertaining information  that was relevant to the specific acquisitions. Several contracting officials  stated a governmentwide system like PPIRS, if populated, could reduce  the time and effort to collect past performance information for use in  selecting contractors. Regardless of the source used, contracting officials  agreed that for past performance information to be meaningful in contract  award decisions, it must be documented, relevant, and reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Hinder Systematic, Governmentwide Sharing of Past Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["Our review of PPIRS data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 found relatively  little past performance information available for sharing and potential use  in contract award decisions. One reason is that agencies are not  documenting contractor performance information that feeds into PPIRS to  include, in some cases, contract actions involving task or delivery orders  placed against GSA\u2019s MAS. Other information that could provide key  insights into a contractor\u2019s performance, such as information on contract  terminations for default and a prime contractor\u2019s management of  subcontractors, was also not systematically documented. Contracting  managers also lack tools and metrics to monitor the completeness of past  performance data in the systems agencies use to record past performance  information. Further, the lack of standardized evaluation factors and  rating scales in the systems that collect past performance information has  limited the system\u2019s usefulness in providing an aggregate level picture of  how contractors are performing.

While the FAR definition of a contract can be read to include orders  placed against GSA\u2019s Multiple Award Schedule (MAS),  the FAR does not  specifically state whether this requirement applies to contracts or task or  delivery order contracts awarded by another agency.  While DOD and  many agencies we reviewed have issued supplemental guidance reiterating  the FAR requirement to evaluate and document contractor  performance\u2014information that ultimately should be fed into PPIRS\u2014the  agencies generally did not comply with the requirement.", "We estimated that the number of contracts that required a performance  assessment in fiscal year 2007 for agencies we reviewed would have  totaled about 23,000. For the same period, we found about 7,000  assessments in PPIRS\u2014about 31 percent of those contracts requiring an  assessment (see table 3). About 75 percent of all past performance  reports in PPIRS were from DOD, with the Air Force accounting for the  highest percent of completed assessments; however, there were relatively  few for some military services\u2014a finding consistent with the DOD IG\u2019s  February 2008 report. For the civilian agencies we reviewed, there were  relatively few performance reports in PPIRS compared to the number we  estimated. For example, for fiscal year 2007, an estimated 13 percent of  DHS contracts that would potentially require a performance assessment  were documented in PPIRS.", "For specific types of contract actions, such as task and delivery orders  placed against GSA\u2019s MAS, we found little contractor performance  information in PPIRS.  Between fiscal years 1998 and 2008, purchases  made against MAS have grown from over $7 billion to $37 billion.  Similarly, the number of MAS contracts has increased from 5,200 in the  mid-1990s to 18,000 in fiscal year 2008. Despite this significant growth, the  number of performance reports in PPIRS for orders placed against MAS  contracts is minimal. For example, about 5 percent of the DHS orders and  none of NASA\u2019s were assessed in fiscal year 2007. Contracting officials we  spoke with confirmed that these assessments were generally not being  done; some told us that they believed GSA was collecting this information.  According to GSA officials, however, agencies are responsible for  documenting and reporting MAS contractor performance, and GSA does  not generally request feedback on performance for MAS contractors.  Without this information, GSA is in no position to know how a contractor  is performing when deciding whether or not to continue doing business  with that contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Information for Insight into a Contractor\u2019s Past Performance Is Not Systematically Documented", "paragraphs": ["Currently, there is no governmentwide requirement for agencies to  document in PPIRS when a contract has been terminated because the  contractor defaulted on the terms of the contract. Consequently,  contracting officers may not have access to all information on a  contractor\u2019s past performance that could factor into a contract award  decision. The recent awarding of contracts to defaulted contractors  highlights the need for information on contract terminations when making  contracting decisions. For example, a $280-million Army munitions  contract was awarded to a contractor that had previously been terminated  for default on several different contracts. The contracting officer told us  that this information, if available, would have factored into the contract  award decision. Subsequently, this same contractor defaulted under that  contract.  Similarly, an October 2008 report issued by the Office of the  Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction documented that at  least eight contractors that had one or more of their projects terminated  for default received new contracts and purchase orders. As part of this  audit, the office examined whether the agencies had evaluated the  contractors\u2019 prior performance before awarding contracts and whether  they had considered suspending or debarring the poor performing  contractors. Although the report found that the awards to defaulted  contractors were within the authority provided by the FAR, it raised  questions about the degree to which the contractors\u2019 prior performance  was considered. In June 2008, the FAR Council opened a case to address  termination for default reporting. In addition, DOD issued policy in July  2008 on the need for departmentwide centralized knowledge of all  contracts that have been terminated regardless of dollar amount.", "At the subcontractor level, apart from evaluating a prime contractor\u2019s  management of its subcontractors, historically, the federal government has  had limited visibility into subcontractor performance despite the increased  use in subcontractors. In January 2008, we reported that total subcontract  awards from DOD contracts had increased by 27 percent over a 4-year  period\u2014from $86.5 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $109.5 billion in fiscal year  2006. As we reported, federal contractors must manage contract  performance, including planning and administering subcontracts as  necessary, to ensure the lowest overall cost and minimize technical risk to  the government. The FAR provides that the agency\u2019s past performance  evaluation should take into account past performance information  regarding a prospective contractor\u2019s subcontractors that will perform  major or critical aspects of a requirement when such information is  relevant to an acquisition.", "Agency contracting officials informed us that they do not assess the  performance of these subcontractors. Rather, if they collect any  information, it is in their assessments of the prime contractor\u2019s  subcontract management. However, not all collection systems used by  agencies allow for systematic capturing of subcontract management  information, if it was applicable in a procurement. DOD\u2019s CPARS system  has a separate rating factor for subcontract management for systems  contracts whereas systems used by NASA and other civilian agencies do  not have a separate factor. DOD guidance states assessments must not be  done on subcontractors, but CPARS allows the assessing official to  address the prime contractor\u2019s ability to manage and coordinate  subcontractor efforts.  Beyond this information on subcontractors, no  additional information is routinely collected on subcontractors.", "In addition, the FAR was recently revised to explain that information on  contractor ethics can be considered past performance information.  The  FAR now states that a contractor\u2019s history of reasonable and cooperative  behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction may be considered  part of a contractor\u2019s past performance.

CPARS and CPS\u2014assessment  reporting systems used by DOD and DHS\u2014do not have readily accessible  system tools and metrics on completeness for managers to track  compliance. According to officials who manage CPARS, a team is  developing requirements for system tools and metrics but has been  challenged to develop useful measures because of a lack of complete and  reliable contract information from FPDS. OFPP officials similarly  acknowledged there was a lack of tools and metrics for agency contracting  officials to monitor and manage the process of documenting contractor  performance. For example, managers currently do not have the ability to  readily identify contracts that require an assessment, how many are due  and past due, and who is responsible for completing assessments.", "According to these officials, holding managers accountable for outcomes  without adequate tools to manage the assessment process would be  difficult.", "However, a few contracting managers we spoke with placed a high priority  on documenting contractor performance, noting that doing so tended to  improve communication with contractors and encourage good  performance. One Air Force Commander issued guidance reiterating that  CPARS is a key component in selecting contractors; that Commander  personally oversees the performance reporting system, requiring a meeting  with responsible officials when a CPARS report is overdue. DHS officials  recognized that more emphasis is needed on documenting performance  assessments and told us they have included a past performance review as  part of their chief procurement officer oversight program for fiscal year  2009. Other indicators that some management officials placed a high  priority on documenting performance include the following:    Assigning past performance focal points\u2014some activities assigned focal  points, individuals with specific responsibilities that included providing  training and oversight. At two Air Force locations, focal points also  reviewed performance narratives for quality.", "Designating assessing officials\u2014some activities designated managers as  the official assessor of contractor performance rather than contracting  officers or program office officials.", "Who to assign accountability to is another challenge. OFPP generally  views the completion of contractor performance assessments as a  contracting officer function. However, many contracting officials we  talked with stated they often do not have the required information to  complete an assessment and have to rely on program officials to provide  the information. Some contracting offices delegated responsibility for  completing assessments to the program office but acknowledged program  office officials have little incentive to complete assessments because they  often did not see the value in them.

Therefore, we stand by our methodology and data, which as we stated in  the report, presents a conservative estimate of the contracts that required  an assessment.  Also, we assessed the reliability of data we used and found  it to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analyses.  As a result,  we are not revising the figures in table 3.  As noted in our report,  improvements are needed across agencies for the management and  accountability of timely documenting contractor past performance  information.  In its response, DHS agreed that significant strides need to  be made in this area.", "In written comments to the draft of this report, GSA stated that our  recommendation should be changed to show that the FAR Council in lieu  of agency chief acquisition officers would be involved in developing and  disseminating governmentwide acquisition policy through the FAR.   According to an OFPP policy official, while the FAR Council would be  involved in evaluating policy and making changes to the FAR, OFPP is  responsible for overall policy concerning past performance and can make  policy changes without involving the FAR Council.  In line with our  recommendations, this would include standards for evaluating past  performance and policies for collecting and maintaining the information.   As we state in the report, the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, through  an OFPP interagency work group, has already established several broad  goals for documenting, sharing, and using past performance information.   Our recommendations to OFPP, in coordination with this Council, are in  part aimed at actions necessary to address these goals.  These  recommendations could be implemented through an OFPP policy  memorandum and could result in changes to the FAR, which we recognize  would need to be coordinated through the FAR Council as appropriate. As  a result, we are not making changes to the recommendation.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the date of this report.

We also reviewed source selection  guidance for the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy  (DOE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA), and the General Services  Administration (GSA)\u2014agencies accounting for a large percentage of  federal contractors. To obtain agency contracting officials\u2019 views on using  past performance, we used FPDS-NG data to select 11 buying offices  across the agencies to provide a cross-section of buying activities. At these  locations, we interviewed 121 contracting officials including supervisory  contract personnel to include division/branch contracting managers,  contracting officers, and contract specialists to discuss 1) how past  performance factored into the contract award decision, 2) sources upon  which they rely for the information, 3) completing contractor performance  assessments, and 4) challenge in using and sharing past performance  information. To identify the importance of past performance relative to  other non-cost factors in specific solicitations, we used FPDS-NG data  from fiscal year 2007 and the first eight months of fiscal year 2008, to  identify 62 competitively awarded contracts\u201449 definitive contracts and  13 orders placed against indefinite delivery vehicle contracts. We selected  these contracts to represent a range of contracts across different buying  activities and\u2014though not generalized to all contract actions within these  agencies\u2014 represented a range of products and services, types of  contracts, and dollar values as shown in appendix II. We obtained contract  documents to verify the fields used in FPDS-NG to select the contracts,  including type of contract and product service code, and found the data  reliable enough for the purpose of selecting the contracts. For these  contracts, we obtained source selection documents including sections M  of the request for proposals, which described the evaluation factors for  award, and the source selection decision document that described how  past performance was evaluated for each offeror. We reviewed the  evaluation factors for each solicitation to identify how past performance  ranked in order of importance relative to other non-cost factors in the  evaluation scheme and summarized the results.", "To assess the extent to which selected agencies in our review complied  with requirements for documenting contractor performance, we analyzed  FPDS-NG and PPIRS data and used information provided by the DOD  CPARS program office. In estimating the number of contracts requiring an  assessment for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for civilian agencies in our  review, we aggregated contract actions in FPDS-NG for each year to  identify the number of contracts that exceeded the reporting thresholds of  $550,000 for construction contracts (FAR \u00a7 36.201), $30,000 for architect  and engineering (FAR \u00a7 36.604), and generally $100,000 for most other  contracts (FAR \u00a7 2.101).  We excluded contracts that are exempt from  performance assessments under FAR subpart 8.7\u2014acquisitions from non  profit agencies employing people who are blind or severely disabled.  For  indefinite delivery contracts, including GSA\u2019s multiple award schedule,  orders were accumulated against the base contract for each agency and  counted as one contract if the cumulative orders exceeded the reporting  thresholds. This analysis provides a conservative estimate of the number  of contracts that require an assessment because it does not include  individual orders that may exceed the threshold or contract actions that  span fiscal years. For this analysis, we used contract number and dollar  obligation fields from FPDS-NG and found them reliable enough for the  purpose of this analysis. Because DOD uses different reporting thresholds  based on business sectors\u2014information that is not available in FPDS- NG\u2014we obtained compliance reports from the CPARS program office for  fiscal years 2006 and 2007, which included estimates of the number of  performance assessments that would have been required for DOD  components and the number of those contracts with completed  assessments. To determine the number of fiscal year 2006 and 2007  contracts with performance assessments for civilian agencies, we obtained  and analyzed data from the PPIRS program office on contracts with  assessments, including the number of assessments against GSA MAS  contracts, as of February 26, 2009.  To assess the reliability of data  provided, we accessed the PPIRS system and compared the number of  contracts with assessments with those provided by the CPARS and PPIRS  program offices, and found the data sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  our analysis.", "To assess the usefulness of PPIRS for governmentwide sharing of past  performance information, we compared information in each of the three  systems used to document contractor performance information including  rating factors and rating scales. In addition, we met with agency officials  who have responsibilities for managing the various systems\u2014including the  Naval Sea Logistics Center Detachment, Portsmouth, which administers  CPARS and PPIRS, and officials at NASA who administer the Past  Performance Database. To identify challenges that may hinder the  systematic governmentwide sharing of past performance information, we  interviewed contracting officials from 11 buying offices regarding a  number of issues to include 1) roles in the assessment process, 2)  challenges in completing assessments, 3) performance information not  currently captured that might be useful for selecting contractors, 4) and  use of metrics for managing and monitoring compliance with reporting  requirements. Finally, we met with OFPP, GSA, and DOD to discuss the  extent of oversight of PPIRS data and roles and responsibilities as  applicable.", "To assess efforts under way or planned to improve the sharing of  information on contractor performance, we obtained and reviewed  memorandums, plans, and other documents produced by OFPP including  proposed FAR changes and any proposed past performance guidelines. We  met with officials from these offices to discuss challenges already  identified in sharing and using past performance information, goals they  may have established for improving the system, and status of efforts to  address them.", "Our work was conducted at the following locations: OFPP, Washington  D.C.; GSA, Arlington, Va; the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center,  El Segundo, Ca; Hill Air Force Base, Ogden, Utah; the Army  Communications and Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth, N.J.; the  Army Sustainment Command, Rock Island, Ill.; the Army Contracting  Command, Fort Belvoir, Va.; the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent  River, M.d.; the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.; the  Defense Contract Management Agency located in Arlington, Va.; DHS  including the Customs and Border Protection, Washington, D.C., and the  Transportation Security Administration, Arlington, Va.; NASA including  the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, M.d. and the Johnson Space  Center, Houston, Tex.; DOE including the National Nuclear Security  Administration Service Center located in Albuquerque, N.M.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2008 to February  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
