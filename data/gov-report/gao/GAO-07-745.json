The Navy took responsibility for correcting the boat's deficiencies while continuing to pay the costs and fees of the prime contractor under cost reimbursable contracts to execute the corrections. Before accepting the boat, the Navy went to sources other than the prime contractor to obtain better designs for the propeller and battery and then paid the prime contractor to install them. When the Navy accepted the ASDS in 2003 in an \"as is\" condition, it relieved the contractor from having to take any additional actions to correct known problems. Since then, the U.S. Special Operations Command has continued to invest millions of dollars to fix existing problems and address new ones in an attempt to make the boat operational. In making this additional investment, the Navy entered into contracts with the prime contractor that provided little incentive to control costs, authorized work before reaching agreement on the scope and price of the work to be performed, and failed to finalize the terms of the work within required time frames. Meanwhile, the contractor's performance continued to be poor, often exceeding initial estimates for the time and cost required to perform the work. ASDS officials took actions over the past 2 years to address these issues, but acknowledge that it is too early to determine the effectiveness of more recent actions to incentivize the contractor's performance. Continuing problems with the existing ASDS led to the Department of Defense's (DOD) April 2006 decision to cancel plans to buy additional ASDS boats, establish an improvement program for the in-service ASDS, and conduct an assessment of alternative material solutions to fulfill remaining operational requirements. The problems have seriously degraded the boat's reliability and performance, and the boat is only available for limited operational use. The results of these improvement and assessment efforts are expected to provide DOD the knowledge needed to determine whether ASDS's reliability can be improved cost-effectively to make ASDS an operational asset and whether an alternative development program is needed to meet the remaining operational requirements. A program decision is planned in mid-2008, after the ASDS improvement program and assessment of alternate material solutions are completed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), a hybrid combatant  submersible, is one of the U.S. Special Operations Command\u2019s (SOCOM)  largest investments.

Over the years, the ASDS acquisition milestone  decision authority has resided at various levels within DOD.", "In 1994, the Navy awarded a $70 million cost-plus incentive fee contract to  Westinghouse Electric Corporation\u2019s Oceanic Division in Annapolis,  Maryland, for detailed design, construction, testing, documentation,  refurbishment, and delivery of the first ASDS with the option to build one  or two more systems. In 1996, Northrop Grumman bought this division and  assumed responsibility for the Annapolis division\u2019s performance on the  ASDS contract.

However, numerous technical problems with key subsystems  contributed to performance shortfalls, schedule delays, and cost increases.  In August 2001, the Navy program office took what it called \u201cconditional\u201d  preliminary acceptance of the first boat from Northrop Grumman under an  agreement that all requirements needed for final acceptance would be  completed within 1 year, requirements that the contractor was unable to  accomplish. On June 26, 2003, the Navy elected to accept the ASDS boat in  an \u201cas is\u201d condition, and incorporated additional waivers, deviations, and  engineering change proposals into the contract. As a result, acceptance of  the ASDS boat did not require any additional actions on the part of the  contractor. Further, the Navy did not seek any consideration from the  contractor because Navy officials believed at the time that the ASDS met  virtually all of its requirements. By that time, the total costs for the ASDS  development contract had already increased from $70 million to more than  $340 million.", "In October 2003, following the Navy\u2019s acceptance of ASDS, the Navy  negotiated and signed a basic ordering agreement (BOA) with Northrop  Grumman to provide a range of goods and services to support the ASDS  program. For example, the BOA enabled the Navy to order engineering  and design services; overhaul, repair, and inspection services; logistical  support; and spare parts and materials for a 3-year period. The BOA was  extended an additional year in 2006. To expedite the contracting process,  the BOA established specific labor rates for different types of service, such  as program office, technical, engineering, operations, and quality support.  Through March 2007, the Navy issued 26 delivery orders with an estimated  value of over $84 million. The duration of the current BOA extends  through September 2007, and the Navy anticipates awarding a new BOA  for another 2 years while overall ASDS performance is reevaluated. Under  another BOA, Northrop Grumman is also providing ASDS engineering  services, such as engineering changes and drawing updates, for  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.", "In assessing the ASDS program we drew heavily from our previous work  on best practices in defense acquisitions. This work has shown that both a  sound business case and effective contracting strategy are essential for  success. A sound business case involves firm requirements and mature  technologies, a knowledge-based acquisition strategy, realistic cost and  schedule estimates, and sufficient funding. An effective contracting  strategy involves selecting a contractor with proper expertise, choosing  contracting approaches that effectively balance risk, and effectively  managing and assessing contractor performance; all of which are intended  to promote accountability for outcomes and protect the taxpayers\u2019  interests.", "Critical flaws in the Navy\u2019s initial business case contributed to ASDS\u2019s  acquisition challenges and increased the government\u2019s risk. We have  previously reported that the capabilities required of the boat outstripped  the contractor\u2019s resources in terms of technical knowledge, time, and  money. The Navy\u2019s overly optimistic assumptions about the contractor\u2019s  ability to readily incorporate existing submersible and commercial  technology into the ASDS resulted in a mismatch between technologies  and needed capabilities and an ill-advised decision to combine  developmental and operational testing.

The  government can choose from a range of contract types available to it that  gives it flexibility to acquire goods and services. The selection of contract  type is generally a matter of risk allocation: fixed-price contracts place the  risks associated with performing the contract on the contractor; cost-type  contracts share the risk between the contractor and the government. The  risk associated with performance shifts between the parties depending on  the type of cost contract selected. In selecting the contract type, the  government must consider the difficulty of providing the goods and  services in the time allocated for contract performance. For example,  when the risks are minimal or can be predicted with an acceptable degree  of certainty, such as when the government and the contractor have  sufficient knowledge of the effort required, then the government uses a  fixed-price contract, and the contractor has full responsibility for the  performance costs and the resulting profit or loss. In contrast, when the  extent of product knowledge is more limited, the government uses a cost- reimbursable contract; the government assumes more risk and may try to  motivate the contractor\u2019s performance by using various incentive or award  fee provisions.", "Our review found that nearly all of the $84 million in design, integration,  and reliability improvement work authorized under the Navy\u2019s October  2003 BOA with Northrop Grumman used some form of a cost-reimbursable  contract. About 6 percent were conducted under a fixed-price type  arrangement. Of the first 18 delivery orders issued through early May 2005,  14 were either cost-plus fixed fee or labor-hour orders. Cost-plus fixed fee  arrangements negotiate the fee at the inception of the contract and do not  vary with the actual costs incurred by the contractor. Labor-hour contracts  provide for direct labor hours at specified fixed rates that include wages,  overhead, general, and administrative expenses. As profit and other  expenses are already included in the rates charged to the government, the  orders provided no profit incentive for the contractor to control costs or  work efficiently. Correspondingly, our analysis found that the ASDS  contractor often exceeded the initial estimates of the time and cost  required to complete the work: 12 of the 26 delivery orders issued under  the BOA exceeded the initial cost estimates, while the delivery schedule  was extended on 20 of the 26 orders. Figure 1 shows the value of all  delivery orders and subsequent modifications by contract type through  March 2007, based on the year the order was initially issued.", "Navy officials told us that they chose cost-plus fixed fee or labor-hour  orders, in part, because ASDS relied on many new and highly technical  subsystems that were inherently risky. The ASDS contracting officer told  us that the choice of cost-plus fixed fee or labor-hour orders reflected the  perceived risk in the efforts, that is, the technical requirements and the  work that needed to be done were not always well-defined or known in  advance. Navy officials reported, however, that to get the contractor to  more actively manage and be accountable for success, the Navy has  increased the use of award and incentive fee provisions on its cost-type  orders, placing at least some of the contractor\u2019s potential fee at risk. For  example, Navy officials noted that two of the three delivery orders issued  in 2006\u2014representing about 80 percent of the value of ASDS work ordered  under new delivery orders during the year\u2014contained award or incentive  fee provisions. While the Navy officials acknowledged that it was too early  to quantify the results of these approaches, preliminary indications are  that the contractor\u2019s performance has improved and that the arrangements  are providing sufficient risk sharing and monetary incentives to motivate  contractor performance.

For example, in September 2006 we reported on how DOD addressed  issues raised by the Defense Contract Audit Agency in audits of Iraq- related contract costs. We found that DOD contracting officials were less  likely to remove costs questioned by auditors if the contractor had already  incurred those costs while the contract action was undefinitized.", "Our analysis found that 10 of the 26 ASDS delivery orders\u2014accounting for  about 14 percent of the work\u2014were initiated as undefinitized contract  actions.

For 7 of these 10 orders, the Navy failed to  definitize the orders within the 180-day time frame required under defense  acquisition regulations, taking instead from 228 to 509 days.

Two  days later, the contractor reported that the projected cost of the work had  almost doubled to more than $1.85 million. In a letter to the contractor, the  Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, noted that at no time during  negotiations had the contractor identified the potential cost growth.

The propeller assembly and stern  plane designs were improved and maintenance procedures were changed.  In June 2004 testing of repairs, however, the ASDS propeller stator broke  off and damaged the propeller. The investigation found that the stator had  been improperly manufactured by a subcontractor. The tail damage was  repaired by Northrop Grumman at the Navy\u2019s expense. During follow-on  test and evaluation in October 2005, ASDS experienced a propulsion  system failure that was attributed to improper assembly/installation of the  new titanium tail.", "Because of the investigations of the December 2003 and June 2004 ASDS  tail casualties, the Navy re-evaluated the effects of unsteady hydrodynamic  loads on the boat. Although neither casualty was attributed to this type of  load, the Navy determined that, due to fatigue stresses, the aluminum tail  was not structurally adequate to last the life of the ASDS. The tail was  replaced with a titanium and composite-based tail, but the replacement  has not resolved all the tail assembly design deficiencies. To minimize the  potential for damage to the tail, the Navy has imposed operating  restrictions that limit the speed of the host submarine while transporting  ASDS, which will remain in effect until this issue has been resolved.", "In September 2005, the Navy and SOCOM chartered the ASDS Reliability  Action Panel (ARAP)\u2014consisting of technical experts from government  and industry\u2014to conduct an independent assessment of reliability.

Further, the contractor must have the  technical and managerial capacity to effectively execute the contract,  while the government must be able to provide effective program and  management oversight. On the ASDS program, however, these conditions  were not present at the start of or effectively applied during the  development effort, undermining the ability to successfully design and  deliver an operational ASDS boat."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technology Assumptions Optimistic", "paragraphs": ["A key to promoting successful acquisition outcomes is matching available  resources with the requirements for the proposed system. Specifically, the  government must match its needs with technology that has been proven to  work in a realistic environment before committing to production. In this  case, the Navy assumed that the conceptual design was technically sound  and that the design would incorporate a large amount of fully developed  submersible or commercially available technology. The Navy\u2019s September  1993 acquisition strategy concluded that the low risk of integrating  technologies already in use on existing submarines and submersible  vehicles eliminated the need for an advanced development model or a  demonstration/validation phase with developmental and operational  testing. Further, the Navy determined that by concurrently addressing  manufacturing and test issues during the design process, lengthy redesign  periods would be avoided. Consequently, in September 1994, the Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (the  designated program decision authority) approved Milestone II  (development) and replaced a sequential test program (development tests,  operational tests, technical evaluations, and operational test and  evaluation) with a consolidated and integrated test program. At the same  time, the ASDS program\u2019s Milestone III (production decision) was waived  because of the limited number of procurement quantities.", "The Navy\u2019s confidence in the maturity of technology also played a large  role in its assessment of proposed designs for the ASDS, and in turn, in its  selection of the contractor. The Navy concluded that the contractor\u2019s  conceptual design exceeded various requirements, and, based on its  maturity, the proposed design approach was low risk. From the outset,  the Navy\u2019s assessments of the contractor\u2019s design solution, experience,  and management capabilities proved incorrect. Incorporating commercial  off the shelf components into the ASDS was more challenging than  expected. For example, the contractor had difficulty understanding  underwater shock performance requirements and eventually  subcontracted the shock design efforts to a specialty firm.", "During the course of ASDS\u2019s development, the Navy gradually assumed  responsibility for addressing ASDS\u2019s technical problems by awarding  separate contracts to other organizations to develop key components. The  contractor\u2019s lack of expertise in key technologies, such as the propeller  and battery, contributed to the Navy\u2019s decision to seek outside expertise to  develop alternative solutions. In turn, the Navy provided these  components to Northrop Grumman as government-furnished equipment,  accepting both the cost and the risk for their performance and paid  Northrop Grumman millions of dollars to integrate the components onto  the ASDS boat. These actions include the following examples:    The ASDS program has invested over $26 million since 2000 to design,  develop, and integrate a new lithium-ion battery to replace the  inadequate silver-zinc battery provided by the prime contractor. In  October 2000, the Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $2.1 million  contract modification to design, develop, test, and incorporate a  lithium-ion polymer battery. By September 2003, a series of contract  modifications had increased the cost of the prototype battery effort to  $5.9 million and had extended delivery until February 28, 2004. The  Navy sought other experts to identify and test an alternative lithium-ion  battery that could be housed in the existing ASDS titanium battery  bottles. In May 2004, after evaluating three proposals, the Navy  awarded Yardney Technical Products a $9.3 million contract for a  complete ASDS shipset battery that was delivered in 2005. To date, the  Navy has provided Northrop Grumman more than $6 million to  integrate the lithium ion battery.", "The Navy invested over $1.5 million to redesign the first ASDS  propeller, which was a major source of noise during testing. Rather  than task Northrop Grumman to redesign the propeller, the Navy  awarded a $1.5 million contract in 2002 to Pennsylvania State  University\u2019s Applied Research Laboratory to design and build a new  composite propeller. Northrop Grumman installed this propeller in  April 2003 at a cost of about $140,000. Pennsylvania State University  has since provided two additional propellers at a cost of about  $576,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Cost Projections Harbingers of Difficulties to Come", "paragraphs": ["Another key to successful acquisition outcomes is to accurately estimate  the resources needed to develop and produce a system. The Navy had  information before awarding the ASDS contract indicating, however, that  the contractor\u2019s proposed price might not be realistic. Specifically, the  contract\u2019s negotiated price was about 60 percent less than the Navy\u2019s  November 1993 cost and operational effectiveness analyses. The Navy\u2019s  price evaluation team concluded that the contractor\u2019s proposed amounts  for ASDS development and production were underestimated and that  overruns were likely. Among the lessons learned cited by two independent  review teams in 1997 and 1999 were that the program was underfunded, in  part because the Navy did not give sufficient weight to concerns raised by  cost analysts, and that the contractor \u201cbid to the budget.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government and Contractor Management Was Ineffective", "paragraphs": ["The government\u2019s and contractor\u2019s capacity to effectively manage a  program is another key determinant in promoting successful outcomes.  The Navy concluded in 1994 that overall, the contractor\u2019s design,  management capabilities, and cost control capabilities were equal to or  better than the two other competitors for the ASDS program and that the  contractor had adequate experience in submersible design, construction,  and certification. This assessment, as well as the government\u2019s capacity to  provide effective management and oversight of the ASDS program, soon  proved incorrect.", "The Navy\u2019s 1997 and the joint Navy/SOCOM 1999 independent review  teams identified weaknesses in the contractor\u2019s capacity to effectively  address technical issues and manage the ASDS program. One team noted  that the contractor had considerable difficulty in interpreting the  underwater shock portion of the ASDS performance requirements. The  teams attributed these difficulties, in part, to the contractor\u2019s lack of  experience in submarine design, in contrast to the initial business case  assumption. Further, the reviews noted that the Navy\u2019s review of the  contractor\u2019s design products revealed that substandard design  methodology was used, resulting in unacceptable system design. The  review teams also found that this lack of experience had a detrimental  effect on the contractor\u2019s overall ability to understand technical nuances  and may have prevented the contractor from applying appropriate  management attention when needed. For example, the contractor used  two different systems for reporting and managing the program; the  contractor\u2019s cost reports contained errors; and its estimates to complete  the effort were updated only every 6 months, resulting in unanticipated  and sudden cost increases being reported to the Navy. Additionally, the  contractor constrained its estimates by imposing \u201cmanagement  challenges,\u201d which the team concluded were in reality artificial reductions  imposed by the contractor to obscure the contractor\u2019s problems and  mislead attempts to analyze its projected costs.", "Further, the review teams concluded that lapses in effective management  by both the government and the contractor contributed to the program\u2019s  challenges. The teams identified several causes for these lapses, including    a lack of contractor experience in submarine design and construction;  the government\u2019s lack of influence or visibility into problems between  the contractor and the subcontractors;    a focus on technical rather than management aspects of the program  by both the program office and the contractor;  ineffective oversight by the program office and little attention to the  financial performance of the contractor; and  frequent changes in the contractor\u2019s project management team.", "The Navy program office and Northrop Grumman have taken steps to  improve the program\u2019s management. In 2005, the Naval Sea Systems  Command reorganized the program office for a greater emphasis on  special operations programs. In December 2005, Northrop Grumman  reassigned the ASDS program\u2019s management lead to its Newport News  division, which has greater management and technical experience in  submarines. Northrop Grumman Newport News is leading the Phase 1  ASDS critical systems review, and Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems  is assisting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
