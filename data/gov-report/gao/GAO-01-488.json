INS does not know how to maximize the deployment of staff to process applications in a timely fashion because it lacks a systematically developed staff resource allocation model. Such a model could help INS determine the right number and types of staff it needs, efficiently distribute staff to the right locations, and ensure that resources are deployed commensurate with the workload to minimize backlogs and processing times. INS could reduce the need to revoke employment authorization documents by providing guidance and training on application screening to its district staff and taking steps to ascertain whether improvements could be made to the application screening process.

In response, INS implemented quality improvement measures in 1997 and 1998 to enhance and monitor the quality of its naturalization process. These efforts, however, contributed to further backlogs that reached a high of 1.8 million naturalization applications by the end of fiscal year 1998.

INS charges aliens fees for processing their applications and deposits the fees into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account (IEFA). This account was established in 1988 to reimburse any INS appropriation for expenses incurred in providing adjudications and naturalization services. In 1990, Congress authorized INS to set adjudications and naturalization fees at a level that would ensure recovery of the full costs of providing services.From fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 1996, the Adjudications and Naturalization budget was almost entirely funded by IEFA. Beginning in fiscal year 1997 and continuing through fiscal year 2000, Adjudications and Naturalization program funding included direct appropriations, in addition to IEFA funds, to reduce application caseloads.", "INS carries out its service function through a network of field offices consisting of 4 service centers, 33 districts, and 75 application support centers (ASCs).

They were created in 1990 to help reduce application backlogs in the district offices. Service centers process 35 types of applications, including petitions for permanent and temporary workers, petitions for admission of spouses, and applications for employment-based adjustment of status to permanent residence. Since February 1996, the service centers have shared responsibility with the districts for processing naturalization applications. Naturalization applications are received by the service centers and processed up to the point of interview, at which time responsibility for processing the case is shifted to the cognizant district so that the applicant can be interviewed and the case decided. INS\u2019 33 districts, consisting of a district office and in many cases suboffices, are located throughout the nation. The districts process 42 types of applications, most of which require interviews with the applicant or verification of an applicant\u2019s identity. In addition to naturalization applications, districts process petitions for alien relatives and family-based adjustment of status applications, among others. INS\u2019 75 application support centers are under the jurisdiction of districts and are located throughout the nation. They were established in fiscal year 1998 to serve as INS\u2019 designated fingerprint locations.In June 2000, INS shifted responsibility for processing applications for renewal of permanent resident cards (i.e., green cards) from the districts to ASCs.", "INS\u2019 application processing procedures vary by application type and by office. In general, the following tasks are involved in processing an application: (1) collect and deposit the application fee and issue a receipt to the alien; (2) create an alien file, or request an existing alien file; (3) enter data on the applicant into an automated system (if available); (4) take applicant\u2019s fingerprints and send them to the FBI for a criminal history check (if needed); (5) review the application, and other supporting documents, such as FBI fingerprint check results, marriage certificate, or court disposition of an arrest; (6) interview the applicant (if needed); (7) administer naturalization test (if needed); (8) approve or deny the case; (9) notify applicant of INS\u2019 decision; and (10) update INS\u2019 automated systems (if available). (App. III contains flowcharts depicting INS\u2019 process for adjudicating naturalization and adjustment of status applications.)", "While INS processes about 50 different types of immigration applications, two types\u2014naturalization and adjustment of status applications accounted for more than 46 percent of INS\u2019 application backlog in fiscal year 2000. The number of these applications increased dramatically during the 1990s due, in part, to two pieces of legislation. First, under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, INS created a program to legalize the status of certain illegal aliens who had resided in the United States continuously since January 1, 1982. As a result, nearly 3 million illegal immigrants became legal permanent residents, and by February 1995, they were eligible to apply for citizenship. Second, under Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, certain illegal aliens residing in the United States (e.g., non-immigrants with expired visas) were allowed to adjust their status to legal permanent residence without returning overseas. This provision, which was enacted in 1994, resulted in a surge of adjustment of status applications during fiscal years 1995 through 1997.(Statistics on the number of applications received by INS in each of fiscal years 1994 through 2000 are provided in table 3 on p. 13.)", "To address the surge in naturalization applications, in August 1995 INS launched the Citizenship USA (CUSA) initiative. INS had projected that without a serious effort to reduce the backlog of naturalization applications, by the summer of 1996 an eligible applicant would have to wait 3 years to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen. The stated goal of CUSA was to reduce the naturalization application backlog to the point where eligible applicants would be naturalized within 6 months of their submitting naturalization applications. The CUSA initiative was found to be fraught with quality and integrity problems that resulted in ineligible applicants receiving citizenship. According to a recent Department of Justice report, INS made the timely completion of naturalization cases its guiding principle during its citizenship initiative at the expense of accuracy and integrity in the determination of eligibility. In response to the problems that arose, INS implemented naturalization quality procedures in November 1996, which were designed to achieve consistent and complete processing through revised fingerprint check procedures, the use of work sheets and standardized documentation for each file, enhanced supervisory review, and a standardized quality assurance program.", "In 1997, INS established the Office of Naturalization Operations, now named the Immigration Services Division (ISD). The role of the office is to help restore integrity and credibility to naturalization processing procedures, and to reduce naturalization backlogs. The office contracted with PricewaterhouseCoopers for a plan to reengineer the naturalization process and, in September 1997, the contractor issued its proposed plan, which INS is in the process of implementing. Improvements that have been made include performing a complete file review of cases before applicants are scheduled for interviews, developing a National Customer Service Center with a 1-800 phone line for information, and creating and distributing a \u201cGuide to Naturalization\u201d for use by applicants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As agreed with your offices, this report addresses the following: (1) Since 1994, to what extent have INS\u2019 adjudications budget, staffing, and workload changed?

We interviewed INS field and headquarters staff regarding the collection and analysis of the workload data. We also reviewed Inspector General reports regarding the reliability of INS workload data and held discussions with Justice Inspector General staff regarding their reports. Questions have been raised about the reliability of INS\u2019 data on applications received, completed, and pending. However, INS officials maintain that they are the only data currently available and are useful for discerning trends in application workload. We rounded the numbers to the nearest thousand when presenting workload data in order to reduce the impression that the data are precise.", "To answer question 3, regarding how long it takes INS to process applications, we reviewed the methods INS has used to estimate and report processing times. We interviewed field and headquarters staff about how these data were being collected, monitored, and disseminated. We reviewed and analyzed INS\u2019 application inventory valuation study, which estimated the age of INS\u2019 pending workload for selected types of applications as of September 30, 2000. We also interviewed representatives of community-based organizations to obtain information about their experiences with INS and how INS\u2019 processing delays have impacted their clients. In this review, we focused on the amount of time that elapsed between INS receiving and completing the processing of an application, not on the amount of staff time expended by INS to process individual applications.", "To address the last two questions\u2014factors that affect INS\u2019 application backlogs and processing times and actions that INS has taken or planned to improve application processing\u2014we interviewed INS officials in headquarters, as well as in six field offices\u2014the California Service Center in Laguna Niguel; the Vermont Service Center in St. Albans; and district offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Houston. We chose these locations because they were identified as offices handling a large volume of applications and backlogs. Together, these two service centers and four districts accounted for 47 percent of all applications received by INS in fiscal year 2000. We reviewed planning documents, including reports regarding improvements to INS processes.  In this review, we focused on application backlogs and processing times and did not conduct analyses of the integrity of INS\u2019 processing efforts.", "We conducted our work from February 2000 through March 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As shown in table 1, the majority of funding has been from fees INS charged applicants for processing their applications and deposited into the IEFA. Beginning in fiscal year 1997, INS\u2019 IEFA funds were supplemented with direct appropriations. For fiscal years 1997 and 1998, INS received appropriated funds to support backlog reduction and improve the integrity of the naturalization process. For fiscal years 1999 and 2000, these appropriated funds were generally used to reduce application backlogs.", "Overall, the total number of onboard program staff more than doubled between fiscal years 1995 and 2000.

The number of officers in permanent positions increased 53 percent (from 1,273 to 1,954 officers) between fiscal years 1995 and 2000. The number of officers and INS support staff in temporary positions grew primarily in fiscal year 1996 due to additional funding to process application backlogs. Of about 6,100 program staff who were onboard in fiscal year 2000, about half were in temporary or contractor positions.", "INS officials told us that by using temporary adjudications staff, INS can more easily reassign temporary positions from one field office to another based on application processing needs. In addition to the INS support staff, INS contracted for clerical support for its service centers beginning in fiscal year 1996, and for its districts beginning in fiscal year 1998. At the end of fiscal year 2000, INS had 341 contract clerical support staff in the districts and 1,813 in service centers. Contract clerical personnel were to support the processing of naturalization and adjustment of status applications.

As discussed on page 21 and 22, lengthy adjustment of status processing times can contribute to the number of employment authorization applications that aliens submit to INS. This can occur because INS provides employment authorization for 1 year but may take longer than a year to adjudicate an adjustment of status application, prompting the alien to submit a new application for employment authorization.", "According to INS officials and community-based organization representatives with whom we spoke, the increase in naturalization applications between fiscal years 1994 and 1997 was due, in part, to three factors. First, approximately 3 million aliens who had been granted amnesty through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 were eligible to apply for naturalization by February 1995. Second, INS instituted a requirement that by March 1996, permanent resident aliens had to replace their existing alien registration card with another card with increased security features. Since the cost difference between the replacement card and the naturalization application was small, many aliens may have decided at that time to apply for naturalization. Third, a number of congressional proposals and a California ballot proposition making certain governmental health, welfare, and educational benefits contingent on U.S. citizenship may have provided an incentive to aliens to apply for naturalization.", "Some community-based organization representatives expressed the view that the decline in the number of new naturalization applications since fiscal year 1997 may have been due to publicity about the long waiting periods aliens faced before INS adjudicated their applications.

INS officials cited changes to section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (see p. 6 for further discussion) as a major reason for the adjustment of status application backlog in the years before INS\u2019 naturalization initiatives.

For adjustment of status applications based on employment, an employer must file a petition for an alien worker (form I-140) before the alien files an adjustment of status application. In addition, a relative may file a petition for alien relative (form I-130) at the same time that the alien applies for adjustment of status (form I-485). INS officials expect that as INS reduces the backlog of adjustment of status applications, these related application backlogs should also decrease. Figure 3 shows how the backlogs of these three types of associated applications have changed for fiscal years 1994 through 2000.", "An alien may also submit an application for an employment authorization document (form I-765) if the alien wants to work while the adjustment of status to permanent residence application (form I-485) is pending, or for a travel document (form I-131) if the alien wants to travel outside the U.S. while the application is pending. Backlogs for these types of applications have also increased. INS officials told us that the length of time aliens have to wait for INS to make a decision on their adjustment of status applications has a direct impact on the number of applications that they submit for employment authorization documents and travel documents.", "This is because employment and travel documents are valid for limited periods of time. For example, if INS takes more than 24 months to complete an adjustment of status application, an alien may have to apply for employment authorization 3 times during the waiting period, since the employment authorization is only valid for a period of 1 year.", "While INS worked on the backlogs for naturalization and adjustment of status applications, backlogs for other application types increased.

Since INS had set processing time goals of 6 months and 24 months, respectively, for processing naturalization and adjustment of status applications during fiscal year 2000, INS determined that it had met or exceeded its goals for the year.", "The usefulness of INS\u2019 estimates is limited by two major factors. First, the estimates of projected processing time fluctuate in relation to the number of applications INS receives and completes, which in turn is a function of both available resources and productivity during that time. If any of these variables change, then INS\u2019 prior performance will not accurately predict its future performance. For example, at the end of September 2000, INS was estimating that its processing time for naturalization applications was 6 months. By the end of December 2000, however, the estimated processing time had increased to 13 months. According to an INS official, this occurred because at the end of fiscal year 2000, INS was dedicating its resources to meeting its production goal of completing 1.3 million naturalization applications, and once the goals were met, INS redirected some resources to processing other types of applications.", "Second, the usefulness of INS\u2019 processing time estimate is limited by the lack of reliable data on the number of pending applications. As evidence of the reliability problems with its data on pending workload, INS had to revise its projected time for processing naturalization applications as of the end of fiscal year 1999. INS\u2019 inventory of pending naturalization applications as of September 30, 1999, revealed that the actual number of pending naturalization cases was about 160,000 higher than the number reflected in INS\u2019 workload data, according to the ISD director. As a result, INS recalculated the projected processing time to be 12 months as of September 30, 1999. The original figure had been 9 months.", "According to the ISD director, INS recognizes that its method for projecting processing times does not provide an accurate picture of how long applicants must wait for INS to process applications, and he would prefer to report actual processing times.

This information is conveyed to applicants who visit an INS field office, or inquire about their case by telephoning the National Customer Service Center (NCSC). In general, the information disseminated by the field offices and NCSC is understated because cases that are continued for additional evidence (e.g., because supporting documents are missing) tend to take longer than cases that are approved or denied when being reviewed for the first time, and continued cases are not considered when the offices calculate the age of their pending cases. In addition, the field office\u2019s determination of the age of its pending cases is not based on a statistical sample. Therefore, it can only be used as a guide for INS staff to manage case inquiries.", "Officials from the community-based organizations that we contacted consistently stated that information provided by INS field offices was often incorrect and misleading. For instance, according to one official, officers in an INS district had told applicants that, based on the age of their pending cases, the applicants would receive their alien registration card in about 90 days in one case and 6 months in another. After 6 months had passed, the applicants had not received an alien registration card and returned to the district office, only to be told that it would take another 3 months to process their applications due to backlogs.

Prior to issuing the employment authorization document, INS is to screen the adjustment of status application for basic eligibility. If INS accepts the adjustment of status application, the applicant is granted employment authorization for one year. INS\u2019 initial decision on whether to grant employment authorization to adjustment of status applicants is based on a brief screening of the application to determine if the applicant meets basic eligibility requirements. According to field office officials, this screening consists of an application clerk checking the application to ensure that it is complete, that an underlying petition based on a family or business relationship is pending or was approved by INS, and if needed, that a visa number is available.

This does not occur at service centers because personal interviews with applicants do not occur at service centers. INS officials acknowledged that many aliens fail to return the employment authorization document.

INS data indicate that from June 1999 through March 2000, INS resent 228,356 fingerprints to the FBI because INS had not received FBI responses for them. In many of these cases, according to a senior INS official, INS had to take new fingerprints from the applicant because the fingerprint card could not be found or had already been destroyed by the FBI, and INS incurred the additional costs of retaking the fingerprints and paying for the FBI analysis.", "Beginning in November 1999, the FBI replaced the tape system with the one currently in use: the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Information System. This system involves electronic submission of fingerprints to the FBI and electronic transmission of the FBI fingerprint results to the requesting agency. Both field office and headquarters officials indicated that the new system, based on its performance in fiscal year 2000, seems to have corrected the problem of missing FBI fingerprint results. Most FBI responses are received within 24 hours of submission, including electronic rap sheets on persons identified as having an arrest record. INS\u2019 performance measure for fiscal year 2000 was to reduce the average amount of time between fingerprinting the alien and receiving the FBI results from 3 weeks to 1 week. With implementation of the new system, the processing time was reduced to 1 day in the final quarter of fiscal year 2000.", "INS is considering exploring whether to electronically store fingerprints, according to the ISD director. Storage of electronic fingerprints would avert the need to retake fingerprints should the FBI results expire. Stored fingerprints would also allow INS to avoid the time and cost of retaking fingerprints for the same applicant applying for subsequent immigration benefits, such as adjustment of status applicants who become eligible to apply for citizenship."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Other Actions Taken or Planned to Improve Application Processing", "paragraphs": ["In addition to actions taken by INS in response to specific identified problems\u2014such as hiring temporary staff to address staff shortages and changing the point in the application process that fingerprints are taken in order to reduce the incidence of expired results\u2014INS has taken or is considering other actions to better manage application processing.

The reengineering study found that INS lacked standardized processes, the integrity of INS processes could be strengthened, and opportunities existed to better utilize technology. With regard to processes, the study found that applications were not consistently adjudicated because the procedures used to process applications varied by office, most field offices allowed their adjudicators to review cases using minimal guidelines, and standard quality controls were lacking. In addition, productivity and processing times varied across field offices, and a lot of time was spent locating and moving alien files.
