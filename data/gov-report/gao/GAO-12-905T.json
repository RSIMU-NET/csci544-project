At $13 billion, 2010 was the costliest census in U.S. history. Without changes, future enumerations could be fiscally unsustainable. GAO\u0092s past work noted that early planning, leading management practices, and strong congressional oversight, can help reduce the costs and risks of the enumeration. GAO also identified four key lessons learned from 2010 that could help secure a more cost-effective 2020 Census. The Bureau agreed and is taking steps to address them. As requested, this testimony focuses on the Bureau\u0092s progress on these lessons learned and what remains to be done going forward. It is based on GAO\u0092s completed work, including an analysis of Bureau documents, interviews with Bureau officials, and field observations of census operations in urban and rural locations across the country."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the U.S. Census Bureau\u0092s (Bureau) planning efforts for 2020 are off to a good start, as the Bureau made noteworthy progress within each of the four lessons learned from the 2010 Census. Still, additional steps will be needed within each of the lessons learned in order to sustain those reforms.", "1. Reexamine the nation\u0092s approach to taking the Census. The Bureau has used a similar approach to count most of the population for decades. However, the approach has not kept pace with changes to society. Moving forward, the Bureau has begun to rethink its approach to planning, testing, implementing, and monitoring the census. For example, the Bureau is researching how it can use administrative records, such as data from other government agencies, to locate and count people including nonrespondents. Use of administrative records could help reduce the cost of field operations, but data quality and access issues must first be resolved.", "2. Assess and refine existing operations focusing on tailoring them to specific locations and population groups. The 2010 Census had several operations tailored to specific population groups or locales. For example, the Bureau mailed bilingual English/Spanish forms to some areas and sent a second questionnaire to areas with historically lower response rates. Preliminary evaluations show these targeted efforts contributed to an increased awareness of the census and higher mail-back response rates. For 2020, the Bureau is considering expanding these efforts. Designing future studies to better isolate the return on investment of key census operations would help the Bureau further target its operations to specific population groups and locations and potentially gain significant cost savings.", "3. Institutionalize efforts to address high-risk areas. Focus areas for the Bureau include improving its ability to manage information technology (IT) investments and develop a reliable cost estimates. In January 2012, GAO reported that the Bureau did not have policies and procedures for developing the 2020 Census cost estimate. In moving forward, it will be important for the Bureau to improve its IT acquisition management policies and develop better guidance to produce more reliable cost estimates.", "4. Ensure that the Bureau\u0092s management, culture, and business practices align with a cost-effective enumeration. In May 2012, GAO reported that the Bureau\u0092s early planning efforts for the 2020 Census were consistent with most leading practices for organizational transformation, long term planning, and strategic workforce planning. Nevertheless, GAO found that additional steps could be taken to build on these early efforts. For example, the Bureau\u0092s schedule does not include milestones for key decisions to support the transition between planning phases. These milestones are important and could help with later downstream planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations in this testimony, but past reports recommended that the Bureau strengthen its testing of key IT systems, develop policies and procedures for its cost estimates, and take actions to make 2020 Census planning more consistent with leading management practices. The Bureau generally agreed with GAO\u0092s findings and recommendations and is taking steps to implement them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to provide a progress report on the U.S.  Census Bureau\u2019s (Bureau) planning and reform initiatives for the 2020  Census. As you well know, the nation\u2019s population has been growing  steadily larger, more diverse, increasingly difficult to count, and less  willing to participate in the census. The bottom line is that securing an  accurate count in the face of these trends has greatly raised the difficulty  and cost of the enumeration. Unless changes to the census are made  going forward, future headcounts could be fiscally unsustainable.", "With a life-cycle cost of around $13 billion, the 2010 Census was the most  expensive population count in U.S. history, costing over 50 percent more  than the $8.1 billion 2000 Census (in constant 2010 dollars). While some  cost growth is to be expected, in part because there are more people to  count with each decennial, enumeration costs grew more than three times  faster than the workload between 2000 and 2010 with a 39 percent  increase in costs to count each housing unit compared to a 12 percent  increase in workload. These trends do not bode well for future costs.  Indeed, the Bureau estimates that if it used the same approach to count  people in 2020 as it did in 2010, it would cost $151 to count each housing  unit compared to 2010\u2019s $97 (assuming real costs grow at the same rate  they did between 1990 and 2010).", "Moreover, as shown in figure 1, while census costs have steadily  increased since 1970, the mail response rate\u2014a key performance  measure because of its implications for both cost and accuracy\u2014declined  over this same period from 78 percent in 1970 to around 63 percent in  2010.", "In terms of quality, a post-census Bureau evaluation found that the 2010  Census generally accurately counted the total population of the country  as well as each state. As in past enumerations, renters, young children,  young adult males, Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians on  reservations were more likely to be undercounted, while home owners,  older persons, females, and White non-Hispanics were more likely to be  included more than once in the census. Moreover, despite some  significant initial setbacks that raised the cost of the enumeration, the  Bureau eventually developed workarounds to the challenges facing the  2010 Census and it was ultimately an operational success as the Bureau  generally completed its peak census data collection activities consistent  with its plans and released the state population counts used to apportion  Congress on December 21, 2010, several days ahead of the legally  mandated end-of-year deadline.", "Mr. Chairman, these trends, facts, and figures all point to one simple fact:  the basic design of the decennial census\u2014mail-out and mail-back of the  census form with in-person follow-up for nonrespondents (the same  general approach the Bureau has used since 1970)\u2014is no longer capable  of a cost-effective enumeration. Thus, going forward, the singular  challenge for Bureau officials will be balancing the need to control the  cost of future enumerations with the need to assure their accuracy.", "The Bureau is well aware of the need for reforms, and its business plan\u2014 which describes its efforts for the early research and testing phase of the  2020 Census\u2014notes that the Bureau is committed to conducting a  census that costs no more than the approximately $100 per housing unit  that was spent on the 2010 Census, and has already developed six broad  design alternatives for 2020. This is a noteworthy goal. However, fulfilling  it will be an ambitious task as the Bureau\u2019s research and planning efforts  over the next few years will take place in an uncertain environment owing  to the extent and magnitude of the reforms being considered, budget  constraints, and the planned August 2012 resignation of the current  Bureau Director with the likelihood that it may be a number of months  before a permanent replacement takes office.", "When we last testified before this Subcommittee in April 2011, we  discussed four lessons learned from the 2010 and earlier decennials that  could help secure a more cost-effective enumeration in 2020.included:  1.  reexamining the nation\u2019s approach to taking the census;  2.  assessing and refining existing operations, tailoring them to specific  locations and population groups;  3.  institutionalizing efforts to address high-risk areas; and  4.  ensuring that the Bureau\u2019s management, culture, and business  practices align with a cost-effective enumeration.", "The Bureau generally agreed with these lessons and is taking steps to  address them. As requested, in my remarks today, I will focus on the  Bureau\u2019s progress in each area and what remains to be done going  forward. In summary, while the Bureau\u2019s preparations are off to a good  start\u2014as evidenced, for example, by its use of leading practices in such  key management areas as organizational transformation, long-term  project planning, and strategic workforce planning, moving forward,  sustaining those efforts, focusing on priorities, winnowing down design  options, and keeping the entire enterprise on-track\u2014all within tight  timeframes\u2014will be a tremendous challenge. Furthermore, it will be  important for Congress to hold the Bureau accountable for results through  strong and continuing involvement in preparations for the 2020 Census,  including weighing in on key Bureau decisions and providing the  necessary funding.", "My testimony today is based on our completed work related to key 2010  Census operations, on 2010 Census cost drivers and the 2020 life-cycle  cost estimate, and the Bureau\u2019s planning efforts for 2020. For this body  of work, we analyzed key documents\u2014such as budgets, plans,  procedures, and guidance\u2014for selected decennial activities; interviewed  cognizant Bureau officials; reviewed existing leading practices for  organizational transformation, long-term project planning, and workforce  planning that we and other organizations have previously developed; and  identified leading practices that are most relevant to the Bureau\u2019s early  planning for the 2020 Census.", "Additionally, for our work on 2010 operations, we made on-site  observations of key census-taking activities across the country including  such urban locations as Los Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia;  Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; New Orleans,  Louisiana; and Washington, D.C.; as well as such less populated areas  as Meridian, Mississippi, and New Castle, Delaware. We selected these  locations because of their geographic and demographic diversity, among  other factors. More detail on our scope and methodology is provided in  each of our issued products.", "On June 29, 2012, we provided the Bureau with a statement of facts  related to the information included in this statement, and Bureau officials  provided technical comments, which we included as appropriate. The  work on which this statement is based was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

However, our reviews of the 1990, 2000, and the 2010  Censuses have shown that early planning, the use of leading  management practices, and strong congressional oversight can help  reduce the costs and risks of the national headcount. Indeed, the  characteristics of the decennial census\u2014long-term, large-scale, complex,  high-risk, and politically sensitive\u2014together make a cost-effective  enumeration of the nation\u2019s population and housing a monumental  project-planning and management challenge.", "Despite the complexity, cost, and importance of the census, however,  recent enumerations were not planned well. Indeed, shortcomings with  managing and planning the 2000 and 2010 enumerations led to  acquisition problems, cost overruns, and other issues, and, as a result,  we placed both enumerations on our list of high-risk programs.", "For example, leading up to the 2010 Census, we found that additional  costs and risks associated with the data capture technologies used in the  2010 Census were related to a failure to adequately link specifications for  key information technology systems to requirements.  Additionally, the  lack of skilled cost estimators for the 2010 Census led to unreliable life- cycle cost estimates, and some key operations were not tested under  census-like conditions.", "GAO, Information Technology: Census Bureau Needs to Improve Its Risk Management  of Decennial Systems, GAO-08-79 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 5, 2007). program difficult and hampered accountability, succession planning, and  staff development.", "Since then, we and other organizations\u2014including the Bureau itself\u2014 have stated that fundamental changes to the design, implementation, and  management of the census must be made in order to address these  operational and organizational challenges. For its part, the Bureau has  stated that to contain costs and maintain quality, bold innovations in both  planning and design of the 2020 Census will be required, and has  launched a number of change initiatives. Some of these efforts are  directed at transforming the Bureau\u2019s organization, while others focus on  reexamining the fundamental approach to the 2020 Census.", "Although bold reform plans are critical steps in the right direction, the  Bureau\u2019s past experience has shown that the more difficult challenge will  be sustaining those efforts throughout the course of the decade. Indeed,  preparations for both the 2000 and 2010 Censuses started with ambitious  plans that gave reason for optimism that major improvements were on the  way. However, in the subsequent ramp-up to those enumerations, the  Bureau had difficulty identifying and implementing promising innovations,  progress on reforms slowed, and as Census Day drew closer, the  success of those head-counts became an open question."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lesson Learned 1: Reexamine the Nation\u2019s Approach to Taking the Census", "paragraphs": ["In our April 2011 testimony, we noted that based on the results of prior  enumerations, simply refining current methods\u2014some of which have  been in place for decades\u2014will not bring about the reforms needed to  control costs while maintaining accuracy given ongoing and newly  emerging societal trends such as concerns over personal privacy and an  increasingly diverse population.reconsider the nation\u2019s approach to the census including rethinking such  activities as how it plans, tests, implements, monitors, and evaluates  enumeration activities. The Bureau concurred and its 2020 Census  business plan states that the Bureau needs substantial innovation to  achieve its cost and quality targets and to meet its strategic goals.", "Consequently, the Bureau will need to  As one example, with respect to its research and testing efforts, the  Bureau plans to use the American Community Survey\u2014an ongoing  Bureau survey of population and housing characteristics that is  administered monthly throughout the decade\u2014as a vehicle to test certain  decennial census processes and information technology (IT) systems.  According to the Bureau, this approach will enable it to conduct many  small tests throughout the decade in a production environment instead of  relying on a small number of large, expensive tests as was the case in  past decennial planning cycles. According to the Bureau, refining systems  in the American Community Survey reduces the risk of building one-use  systems for the decennial that need to operate flawlessly the first time  they are put into production.", "With respect to implementing the census, among other activities, the  Bureau is researching potential electronic methods of promoting the  census and collecting data, including with the Internet via social  networking sites, e-mail, and text messages, as well as with automated  phone systems. For the 2010 Census, the Bureau initially investigated the  use of an Internet response option but dropped plans based on concerns  over information technology security, and after completing a cost-benefit  analysis that led the Bureau to conclude that Internet data collection  would not significantly improve the overall response rate or reduce field  data collection.", "The Bureau is also researching how it can use administrative records to  reduce the cost of certain decennial activities. Administrative records from  government agencies, including driver licenses and school records, can  be used to identify persons associated with a particular household  address. Administrative records could save the Bureau money because  they could help reduce the need for certain costly and labor-intensive  door-to-door visits by Bureau employees to collect data in-person from  non-respondents. During the 2010 Census, the Bureau made only limited  use of administrative records. Expanding their use to supplement  respondent data on a national level will present a certain degree of risk,  and issues concerning data quality and access to records must first be  resolved.", "With so many innovations underway at the Bureau, strong and continuing  stewardship at the senior level will be critical for ensuring they stay on  track moving forward. However, the announced resignation of the Director  coming up this August could mean that it will be a number of months  before an agency head appointed by the President and confirmed by the  Senate will be in place.", "As with the heads of all federal agencies, it will be important for the  Bureau Director to possess the requisite leadership and management  skills and background to successfully address the challenges facing the  Bureau in the years ahead. On the basis of our knowledge of past and  present census operations and a review of readily available literature,  certain general stewardship roles that the Director, as a senior executive,  will play in managing the institution, and their related qualifications, merit  particular attention in this regard. These roles and qualifications are not  necessarily unique to the Bureau, and it is unlikely that any one person  will excel in all of these areas. That said, based on our knowledge of past  and present census operations and review of available literature on  leadership\u2014particularly of federal agencies\u2014we identified the following  characteristics of a successful leader:", "Strategic leader. As the head of the Census Bureau, the Director is  responsible for, among other activities, (1) leading change and (2)  leading people. In leading change, the Director will be expected to  build a shared vision or long-term view for the organization among its  stakeholders, as well as be a catalyst for developing and  implementing the Bureau\u2019s mission statement and strategic goals, and  be cognizant of the forces affecting the Bureau. Moreover, in addition  to the decennial census, the Bureau is also responsible for a number  of other vital national data gathering and statistical programs such as  the American Community Survey. As a result, it will be important for  the Director to ensure the Bureau\u2019s information products continue to  meet the current and emerging needs of its numerous and diverse  customers, including Congress, state, local and federal government  organizations, and a wide array of other public and private  organizations.", "In leading people, the Director should ensure that human resource  strategies, including recruitment, retention, training, incentive, and  accountability initiatives are designed and implemented in a manner  that supports the achievement of the organization\u2019s mission and goals  and addresses any mission critical skill gaps. In particular, it will be  important for the Director to motivate headquarters, field, and  temporary staff to ensure they function as an integrated team rather  than a stovepiped bureaucracy.", "Technical professional. It is logical to expect that the Director would  have at least a general background in statistics or a related field.  Although no one person will have the full range of knowledge needed  to answer the many methodological and technical questions that the  Director may face, it is important that he or she have sufficient  technical knowledge to direct the Bureau\u2019s statistical activities. In  addition, the Director should manage for results by developing and  using performance measures to assess and improve the Bureau\u2019s  operations.", "Administrator. Like other agency heads, the Director is responsible for  acquiring and using the human, financial, and information technology  resources needed to achieve its goals and mission. The Director  should, for example, be capable of setting priorities based on funding  levels. Further, because the Bureau\u2019s product is information, the  Director should ensure that the Bureau leverages technology, such as  the Internet, to improve the collection, processing, and dissemination  of census information.", "Collaborator. It will be important for the Director to continually expand  and develop working relationships and partnerships with those in  governmental, political and professional circles to obtain their input,  support, and participation in the Bureau\u2019s activities.

For example, some neighborhoods might require a greater  level of effort to achieve acceptable results while in other areas those  same results might be accomplished with fewer resources.", "The 2010 Census had several census-taking activities tailored to specific  population groups. As one example, the Bureau budgeted around $297  million on paid media to raise awareness and encourage public  participation in the census. To determine where paid media efforts might  have the greatest impact, the Bureau developed predictive models based  on 2000 Census data and other sources. Other efforts included mailing a  bilingual English/Spanish questionnaire in some areas, and sending a  second \u201creplacement\u201d census questionnaire to about 53 million  households in areas with historically lower response rates. Preliminary  Bureau evaluations suggest that some of these targeted efforts  contributed to an increased awareness of the census and were  associated with higher questionnaire mail-back response rates.", "For the 2020 Census, the Bureau is considering expanding its targeting  efforts to activities such as address canvassing, an operation where  Bureau employees go door-to-door across the country verifying street  addresses and identifying possible additions or deletions to its address  list. This operation is important for building an accurate address list. In the  2010 Census, address canvassing was conducted at the vast majority of  housing units. For the 2020 Census, the Bureau believes it might be able  to generate cost savings by using existing address records for those  neighborhoods that have been stable, and only canvass those areas  where significant changes have occurred.", "We previously found that studying the value added of a particular  operation, such as the extent to which it reduced costs and/or enhanced  data quality, could help the Bureau make more cost-effective use of its  resources. As one example, in addition to address canvassing, the  Bureau has several other operations to help it build a complete and  accurate address list. This is to help ensure that housing units missed in  one operation get included in a subsequent operation. However, the  extent to which each individual operation contributes to the overall  accuracy of the address list is uncertain. This in turn makes it difficult for  the Bureau to fully assess the extent to which potential reforms such as  targeted address canvassing or other operations might affect the quality  of the address list. Indeed, the Bureau\u2019s formal program of assessing and  evaluating various 2010 Census operations and activities, with which it  expects to have completed over 100 studies by early in 2013, has only a  few studies designed to produce information describing the return on  investment. Designing future studies to better isolate the return on  investment would help the Bureau further tailor its operations to specific  population groups and locations and potentially generate substantial cost  savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lesson Learned 3: Institutionalize Efforts to Address High-Risk Areas", "paragraphs": ["A key priority for the Bureau will be to continue to address those  shortcomings that led us to designate the 2010 Census a high-risk area in  2008, including strengthening its ability to develop reliable life-cycle cost  estimates and following key practices important for managing information  technology (IT) so that they do not recur in 2020. In February 2011, we  removed the high-risk designation from the 2010 Census because of the  Bureau\u2019s progress and strong commitment to and top leadership support  for addressing problems, among other actions. The Bureau has made  progress in these areas. However, additional efforts are needed.", "Processes for developing a life-cycle cost estimate. In our January  2012 report, we found that the Bureau had not yet established  policies, procedures, or guidance for developing the 2020 Census life  cycle cost estimate and is at risk of not following related best  practices. A reliable cost estimating process, according to our Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, is necessary to ensure that cost  estimates are comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and  credible. The Bureau intends to use our cost guide as it develops  cost estimates for 2020 and follow best practices wherever  practicable; however, as we reported, the Bureau has not yet  documented how it plans to conduct its cost estimates and could not  provide a specific time when such documentation would be finalized.  Developing this necessary guidance will help ensure the Bureau has a  reliable life-cycle cost estimate, which in turn will help ensure that  Congress, the administration, and the Bureau itself can have reliable  information on which to base decisions.  IT management issues. As the Bureau prepares for 2020, it will be  important for it to continue to improve its ability to manage its IT  investments. Leading up to the 2010 Census, we made numerous  recommendations to the Bureau to improve its IT management  procedures by implementing best practices in risk management,  requirements development, and testing.many of our recommendations, but not our broader recommendation  to institutionalize these practices at the organizational level. The  challenges experienced by the Bureau in acquiring and developing IT  systems during the 2010 Census further demonstrate the importance  of establishing and enforcing a rigorous IT systems development and  management policy Bureau-wide. In addition, it will be important for  the Bureau to improve its ability to consistently perform key IT  management practices, such as IT investment management, system  development and management, and enterprise architecture  management. The effective use of these practices can better ensure  that future IT investments will be pursued in a way that optimizes  mission performance.

The Bureau also  created a high-level schedule of program management activities for the  remaining phases, documented key elements such as the Bureau\u2019s  decennial mission, vision, and guiding principles, and produced a  business plan to support budget requests, which is being updated  annually. These are important steps forward that, if continued, could help  the Bureau\u2019s planning stay on track for 2020. However, the Bureau\u2019s  schedule does not include milestones or deadlines for key decisions  needed to support transition between the planning phases which could  result in later downstream planning activity not being based on evidence  from such sources as early research and testing.", "Also in the area of long-term planning, to help incorporate lessons  learned, in 2011 the Bureau created a recommendation follow-up  process, built around a database it created containing various oversight  and internal Bureau recommendations. Not having a formal process for  recommendation follow-up for prior censuses made it difficult to ensure  that recommendations were considered by those at the Bureau best able  to act on them. The Bureau has provided these recommendations to  relevant Bureau research and testing teams and is beginning to take  steps to hold the teams accountable for reporting on how they are  considering them.", "The Bureau is also taking steps consistent with leading practices for  strategic workforce planning, including identifying current and future  critical occupations with a pilot assessment of the competencies of  selected information technology 2020 Census positions.
