Since 1970, the Census Bureau has used essentially the same methodology  to count the vast majority of the population during the decennial census.  The bureau develops an address list of the nation\u2019s households and mails  census forms (questionnaires) to those households asking the occupants to  mail back the completed forms. The bureau hires temporary census takers,  known as enumerators, by the hundreds of thousands to gather the  requested information for each nonresponding household.", "For the 2000 census, the bureau planned to augment the traditional census  methodology with statistical estimation to develop a unified census count.  In November 1997, in the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for 1998, the Congress questioned the constitutionality  of using statistical sampling and directed the bureau to plan to implement a  census in 2000 without using statistical methods. The Census Bureau  reported to the Congress on possible components in a traditional census  plan in April 1998. However, the bureau did not begin detailed budgeting for  a nonsampling-based census until after the Supreme Court ruled that the  Census Actprohibited the use of statistical sampling for purposes of  determining the population count used to apportion the House of  Representatives.", "As recently as August 1997, the bureau estimated that without sampling,  the cost of the 2000 census would increase by $675 million to $800 million  and would be less accurate than the 1990 census.

This original budget request  reflected the bureau\u2019s plan to gather information based in part on using  statistical estimation for nonresponding households and to adjust for  undercounting and other coverage errors. However, on January 25, 1999,  the Supreme Court ruled that the Census Act prohibits the bureau from  using sampling for purposes of congressional apportionment. According to  the bureau, it must therefore enumerate an estimated 12 million additional  nonresponding households and expand programs designed to address  undercounting and limit other coverage errors. The bureau also plans to  visit 4 million additional addresses for which the Postal Service has  returned the questionnaire because it believes that the housing unit is  vacant or nonexistent.", "In light of the need for the additional enumeration, the bureau requested a  substantial increase to its original budget request for fiscal year 2000\u2014 approximately $1.7 billion\u2014for a total budget of approximately $4.5 billion.  Thus, for purposes of apportionment, the 2000 census will be done  similarly to those for the last several decades in which questionnaires are  mailed to the majority of the nation\u2019s households asking the occupants to  mail back the completed questionnaires. In addition, for the 2000 census,  the bureau plans to incorporate statistical estimation for other purposes,  such as providing states with information for redistricting. As part of the  2000 census, the bureau will allow the public to respond in a variety of new  ways, such as through a toll-free telephone number, the Internet, and  unaddressed questionnaires made available at public locations.", "When compared to the 1970 census, the projected full-cycle cost per  housing unit of the 2000 census will quadruple (in constant fiscal year 1998  dollars). As shown in figure 1, the cost will nearly double from the previous  census (1990).", "The accuracy of the 1990 census decreased compared to the 1980 census.  Specifically, the net undercount for the 1990 census was estimated at 1.6  percent of the population (about 4 million persons) compared to 1.2  percent for the 1980 census. The bureau estimated that about 4.4 million  persons were counted twice, and other improper inclusions, in 1990, while  8.4 million were missed. Moreover, the sum of these numbers\u2014 12.8 million\u2014represents a minimum tally of gross errors since it does not  include other errors, such as persons assigned to the wrong locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We interviewed bureau officials who provided us with an overview of the  budget formulation process for developing the $4.5 billion amended budget  request. Bureau officials provided us with copies of the cost models used to  develop the original and amended budget requests.

Therefore, to ensure that the difference between  the original and amended budget requests was supported by the two  models, we reviewed the summarized output and structure of each model  and verified the mathematical accuracy of the difference. We reconciled  the output from these models to the budget request amounts to determine  whether they mathematically agree with the original and amended budget  requests.", "We then isolated the differences in the models by the bureau\u2019s eight  program activities or frameworks.

The following  sections discuss the changes in these key assumptions between the original  and amended budget requests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Assumption\u2014Increased Workload", "paragraphs": ["An assumed increase in workload substantially increased costs in the fiscal  year 2000 amended budget request for enumerator and support salaries,  benefits, travel, data capture requirements, infrastructure, and supplies.  The primary reason for the increase in workload is the bureau\u2019s plan to visit  an additional 16 million households using a traditional census approach  instead of sampling to estimate these housing units. Also adding to the  workload are additional programs intended to improve the coverage and  quality of the census.", "The bureau\u2019s amended budget request assumes that it will enumerate the 12 million nonresponding housing units that under the original budget  request would have been statistically estimated. The bureau also estimated  that the Postal Service would determine that of the 119 million total  estimated housing units, about 6 million would be vacant or nonexistent.  The purpose of visiting these 6 million housing units is to confirm that the  Postal Service was correct in concluding that a housing unit was vacant or  nonexistent. In 1990, the bureau found that about 20 to 30 percent of the  housing units identified as vacant or nonexistent were actually occupied.  As shown in figure 2, under the original budget request, the bureau  assumed that it would visit only 2 million of the 6 million housing units and  that the remaining 4 million housing units would be accounted for through  statistical estimation. Under the amended budget request, the bureau  assumes that it will visit all 6 million housing units.", "Also contributing to the workload increase are a number of programs  intended to improve the coverage and quality of the census that were not in  the original budget request. According to the bureau, these programs were  added to improve the accuracy of the 2000 census since the bureau would  be using a traditional approach and attempting to obtain information  directly from all 119 million estimated households. In the bureau\u2019s original  budget request, statistical estimation was intended to improve the accuracy  of the 2000 census by adjusting census counts for undercounting and other  coverage errors.", "An example of an additional program includes reinterviewing a sample of  housing units for which enumerators had previously completed census  questionnaires. This program, which is budgeted to cost $22.7 million,  involves sampling housing units with questionnaires completed by  enumerators, reinterviewing to confirm responses, and adjusting the  responses to the census questionnaires to correct any errors found.  Another program, budgeted at $25.2 million, involves attempting to  redeliver certain census questionnaires that are returned by the Postal  Service. This program is targeted at housing units that have a change in  address or zip code between the fall of 1999, when the bureau delivers its  address files to its printing vendors, and March 2000, when questionnaires  are to be delivered. According to the bureau, the improved coverage and  accuracy resulting from these programs would have been accounted for in  the original plan through statistical estimation techniques. Although the  programs the bureau added in the amended budget request are intended to  improve the accuracy of the 2000 census, it is unclear whether these  additional programs will result in a 2000 census that is more accurate than  the 1990 census.", "It is important to note that another key assumption\u2014the average mail  response rate for all questionnaire types\u2014remained constant between the  original and amended budget requests at 61 percent. Given an estimated  119 million households in the census population, a 1-percent change in the  response rate increases or decreases the number of households that must  be enumerated by about 1.2 million. The mail response rate has decreased  substantially in recent years, dropping from 78 percent in 1970 to 65  percent in 1990. If the response rate is substantially different from the 61  percent that the bureau projects, assuming that all other assumptions  prove to be accurate, the bureau\u2019s fiscal year 2000 amended budget request  could differ substantially from the bureau\u2019s needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Assumption\u2014Reduced Productivity", "paragraphs": ["A significant factor increasing the bureau\u2019s budget request is a 20-percent  reduction in the assumed productivity rate for temporary employee  enumerators following up on nonresponding housing units. In the original  budget request, the bureau used an average productivity rate of about 1.28  households per hour, which was reduced in the amended budget request to  about 1.03. This revised productivity rate was applied to all temporary  enumerator employees for nonresponse follow-up\u2014both those to be hired  to visit the 30 million housing units under the original budget request as  well as those for the additional 16 million housing units added after the use  of sampling for nonresponse follow-up was prohibited by the Census Act.", "The bureau provided several explanations for reducing the assumed  enumerator productivity rate from 1.28 in the original budget request to  1.03 in the amended budget request. For example, the bureau believes that  given the low unemployment rate in the United States, hiring temporary  employees to fill hundreds of thousands of new positions is expected to  result in the hiring of less productive workers. In addition, the bureau  believes enumerators will work slower in order to avoid mistakes knowing  that they are being reviewed in a more thorough and formal manner as part  of the additional quality control programs. Also, the bureau assumed an  increase in rework resulting from added quality control programs.", "The bureau did not provide any documented internal or external  quantitative analysis or other analysis that supported the original or the  revised productivity rate. Consequently, the 20-percent reduction in  productivity is based on senior management judgments, which the bureau  acknowledges are very conservative.", "Because of the increased workload and reduced productivity, the bureau  increased the total number of temporary field positions from the 780,000  estimated in the original budget to 1,350,000. This increase in positions  does not necessarily mean that the bureau is hiring 570,000 additional  people. Many positions exist for only a few weeks; thus some individuals  can be, and are, hired for more than one position. Of the 570,000 increase,  about 200,000 positions (35 percent) are for nonresponse follow-up and  120,000 (21 percent) are for enumeration-related activities such as counting  people at homeless shelters; 220,000 positions (38 percent) are for added  coverage improvement and quality control programs. (The remaining 6  percent includes various other positions.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Assumption\u2014 Additional Advertising", "paragraphs": ["The bureau included nearly $72 million for advertising intended to increase  questionnaire responses, including advertising that will be targeted at hard- to-enumerate communities.

The bureau intends to use the  additional $72 million for motivational programs intended to increase the  mail-in response rate and for an expanded \u201cCensus in the Schools\u201d  program. An example of how the bureau plans to spend this money  includes a planned educational message, delivered several weeks before  the data collection period, reminding residents in the hard-to-enumerate  communities about the benefits of participating in the census process.  Also, advertising is to be targeted to run concurrent with the follow-up  visits to nonresponding households so that enumerators have a better  chance of successfully gaining access to households and completing  census forms.", "The bureau has no data available to support how much, if any, the  increased advertising will increase the response rate. As a result, the  bureau\u2019s assumed average questionnaire response rate of 61 percent in the  original budget request did not increase in the amended budget request.

Examples of items unrelated to the decision include the following: $29 million for leasing of common space, $23 million for long-distance telephone service, $16 million for improving address lists and delivering questionnaires, $10 million for copier paper and map supplies.", "We did not conclude whether the bureau properly categorized components  of the $1.7 billion requested increase as related and unrelated.

Both the original and amended budget requests were  developed with this cost model, with each estimate being developed  independently using different versions of the cost model. The process the  bureau used to develop the amended budget request involved (1) revising  key assumptions in the cost model supporting the original budget request  that were based on the statistical estimation approach for nonresponse  follow-up to improve accuracy and (2) incorporating new assumptions  based on a traditional census approach. As shown in table 1, the bureau  derived the $1.7 billion requested increase by calculating the net difference  between the original budget request of $2.8 billion and the amended budget  request of $4.5 billion. The output from the bureau\u2019s models mathematically  agrees with the original and amended budget requests.", "The bureau\u2019s budget estimation model is a set of 16 spreadsheets with  thousands of separate formulas that generate estimates for specific census  program activities. The formulas generate outputs for items such as  salaries and benefits, travel, and advertising based on hundreds of different  assumptions. The model serves as a collection point for field costs as well  as headquarters and other costs estimated outside the model. Of the $4.5 billion amended budget request, about $1.05 billion (23 percent) was  calculated outside the model. This $1.05 billion includes costs for  headquarters activities and contracts. The assumptions are developed by  program managers and are generally based on either third party evidence,  such as independent studies, or senior management\u2019s judgment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Commerce for  comment. As requested, the Director of the Bureau of the Census provided  written comments on behalf of the department in 2 days. (See appendix II.)  We appreciate the bureau\u2019s rapid response to the draft and its overall  cooperation and timely responses to our data requests. In commenting on a  draft of this report, the bureau concurred with the facts as presented in the  report and provided its perspective on four matters, which we address  below.", "First, the bureau stated that in addition to serving primarily as the provider  of apportionment counts, the 2000 census has three other major  components of unique usefulness to the American public- providing data to  be used for legislative redistricting, federal housing surveys, and  distribution of federal funds. We agree with the bureau that these other  components of the 2000 census are important. However, the purpose of our  report was to analyze the bureau\u2019s overall amended budget request with a  focus on the $1.7 billion requested increase. Given that objective, our  report focused on activities that resulted in the substantial increase in the  bureau\u2019s original fiscal year 2000 budget request. As our analysis shows, the  net $1.7 billion requested increase was primarily related to the bureau\u2019s  assumptions of increased workload, reduced employee productivity, and  increased advertising. We did not see any substantial cost increases related  to redistricting, federal housing surveys, and distribution of federal funds.", "Second, the bureau noted that the current plan for the 2000 census contains  components of both a traditional and a sampling methodology. In addition,  the bureau noted that beginning in November 1997, it devoted a substantial  effort in planning (on a dual track basis) for a census based entirely on a  traditional methodology. Based on our review of the bureau\u2019s fiscal year  2000 amended budget request, we agree that the 2000 census includes  components of both traditional and sampling methodologies. However, the  increase in the estimated cost of the 2000 census is driven primarily by  factors relating to a traditional census. The $1.7 billion requested increase  in the bureau\u2019s fiscal year 2000 budget is net of a decrease of over $200 million related to the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (ACE)  program. The purpose of ACE in the amended budget request is primarily  to estimate the population for purposes such as redistricting by sampling  households from an address list developed independently from the list used  to perform the census. Under the bureau\u2019s original budget request, the  results of ACE (formerly Integrated Coverage Measurement) were to have  been statistically combined with the results of enumeration to provide a  single, integrated set of population counts. Evaluating the bureau\u2019s  planning for a \u201cdual track\u201d census was beyond the scope of our work.", "Third, the bureau provided its perspective on the reasons why the full-cycle  cost per housing unit of the 2000 census is projected to nearly double when  compared to the 1990 census. The bureau pointed to such factors as normal  inflationary increases, infrastructure, federal wage increases, declining  response rate, paid advertising, postage, and information technology. It is  important to note that our analysis eliminates the impact of general  inflation and the growth in housing units over the last 4 decades. Thus, our  comparison of full-cycle cost per housing unit is an \u201capples to apples\u201d  comparison. The purpose of showing this comparison is to provide a  historical perspective on the real increase in the full-cycle cost per housing  unit of the decennial census. Providing an analysis of the reasons for the  substantial increase of the projected cost of the 2000 census was beyond  the scope of our review. We agree with the bureau that factors such as a  declining mail response rate would increase the relative costs of the  census. However, it is important to point out that the bureau was unable to  demonstrate whether the benefits of certain activities, such as increased  advertising and additional programs, justify their cost. In addition, the  bureau could not say whether a 2000 census costing an estimated $56 per  housing unit (in constant 1998 dollars) will result in a census that is more  accurate than 1990.", "Finally, the bureau stated that it believes it is prudent to assume a  temporary enumerator employee productivity rate of 1.03 housing units per  hour. The bureau cited the immovable calendar and the need to hire a large  temporary labor force, the size of which is a direct result of assumed lower  productivity. The bureau believes our use of \u201cvery conservative\u201d leaves an  unwarranted impression of management choices made at one end of a  spectrum, which could be shifted to the other end of the spectrum without  risk. Based on our analysis, we continue to conclude that the bureau\u2019s  productivity assumption of 1.03 is based on senior management\u2019s \u201cvery  conservative\u201d judgment as was represented to us by bureau staff during our  review. What we mean by \u201cvery conservative\u201d is that the bureau is planning  for a worst case scenario. As we reported, the bureau did not provide any  documented internal or external quantitative analysis or other analysis to  support the initial or revised productivity rates. As such, our only possible  conclusion is that the 1.03 was developed based on management\u2019s  judgment, which is what bureau staff represented to us during our review.  Because the reported productivity rate from the 1990 census was 1.56 and  the assumption used in the original budget was 1.28, we conclude that the  1.03 assumption used in the amended budget request, which covers not  only the additional 16 million housing units now planned to be enumerated  but also the 30 million housing units to be enumerated in the original  budget, is very conservative\u2014or a \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d Should the  bureau\u2019s productivity assumption prove to be more or less than 1.03  housing units per hour, the bureau\u2019s fiscal year 2000 amended budget  request could differ substantially from the bureau\u2019s needs.", "We are sending copies of this report to Senator Fred Thompson, Senator  Joseph Lieberman, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator Ernest Hollings,  Representative Carolyn Maloney, Representative Dan Burton,  Representative Henry Waxman, Representative Harold Rogers, and  Representative Jos\u00e9 Serrano in their capacities as Chairs or Ranking  Minority Members of Senate and House Committees and Subcommittees.
