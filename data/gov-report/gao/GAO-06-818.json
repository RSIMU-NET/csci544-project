The campaign aimed to prevent the initiation of or curtail the use of drugs among the nation's youth. In 2005, Westat, Inc., completed a multiyear national evaluation of the campaign. GAO has been mandated to review various aspects of the campaign, including Westat's evaluation which is the subject of this report. Applying generally accepted social science research standards, GAO assessed (1) how Westat provided credible support for its findings and Westat's findings about (2) attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of youth and parents toward drug use and (3) youth self-reported drug use."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's review of Westat's evaluation reports and associated documentation leads to the conclusion that the evaluation provides credible evidence that the campaign was not effective in reducing youth drug use, either during the entire period of the campaign or during the period from 2002 to 2004 when the campaign was redirected and focused on marijuana use. By collecting longitudinal data--i.e., multiple observations on the same persons over time--using generally accepted and appropriate sampling and analytic techniques, and establishing reliable methods for measuring campaign exposure, Westat was able to produce credible evidence to support its findings about the relationship between exposure to campaign advertisements and both drug use and intermediate outcomes. In particular, Westat was able to demonstrate that its sample was not biased despite sample coverage losses, maintained high follow-up response rates of sampled individuals to provide for robust longitudinal analysis, established measures of exposure that could detect changes in outcomes on the order of magnitude that ONDCP expected for the campaign and that could reliably measure outcomes, and used sophisticated statistical methods to isolate causal effects of the campaign. Westat's findings on the effects of exposure on intermediate outcomes--theorized precursors of drug use--were mixed. Specifically, although sampled youth and parents' recall of campaign advertisements increased over time, they had good impressions of the advertisements, and they could identify the specific campaign messages, exposure to the advertisements generally did not lead youth to disapprove of using drugs and may have promoted perceptions among exposed youth that others' drug use was normal. Parents' exposure to the campaign led to changes in beliefs about talking about drug use with their children and the extent to which they had these conversations with their children. However, exposure did not appear to lead to increased monitoring of youth. Moreover, the evaluation was unable to demonstrate that changes in parental attitudes led to changes in youth attitudes or behaviors toward drug use. Westat's evaluation indicates that exposure to the campaign did not prevent initiation of marijuana use and had no effect on curtailing current users' marijuana use, despite youth recall of and favorable assessments of advertisements. Although general trend data derived from the Monitoring the Future survey and the Westat study show declines in the percentage of youth reportedly using marijuana from 2002 to 2004, the trend data do not explicitly take into account exposure to the campaign, and therefore, by themselves, cannot be used as evidence of effectiveness. In Westat's evaluation of relationships between exposure and marijuana initiation the only significant finding was of small unfavorable effects of the campaign exposure on marijuana initiation during some periods of data collection and in some subgroups."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congressionally mandated under the Treasury and General Government  Appropriations Act of 1998, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media  Campaign had the primary goals of preventing the initiation of drug use\u2014 particularly the use of entry-level drugs marijuana and inhalants\u2014among  the nation\u2019s youth and stopping youth that have begun using drugs from  continuing their use. Administered through the Office of National Drug  Control Policy (ONDCP) and implemented in three phases, the campaign  featured as its centerpiece a paid advertising effort in which campaign  funds were used to purchase media time and space for advertisements that  delivered anti-drug messages to the campaign\u2019s target audience\u2014youth  aged 9 to 18 and their parents\u2014through strategic placement of anti-drug  advertisements on television and radio and in print media. In addition to  the advertising, the campaign included community outreach, work with  the entertainment industry to encourage the accurate depiction of the  consequences of drug use, outreach to faith-based organizations, and work  with youth organizations. The campaign\u2019s first two phases, which ran from  January 1998 through the summer of 1999, were pilot phases that focused  primarily on informing the planning and development for phase III and  included a 12-city pilot (phase I) and nationwide advertising (phase II).  Phases I and II aimed to increase public awareness of anti-drug messages.  Phase III of the campaign, which began in mid-1999, continued the  nationwide advertising campaign begun during phase II and integrated the  advertising with outreach efforts. From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year  2006, Congress appropriated over $1.4 billion to support the campaign. For  fiscal year 2007, the President\u2019s budget requested $120 million for the  campaign, an increase over the fiscal year 2006 appropriation, to purchase  additional media time and space to increase the reach and frequency of  the campaign\u2019s messages, which would restore appropriations to their  fiscal year 2005 level.", "Congress first authorized funding for the campaign in fiscal year 1998 with  the expectation that demonstrable changes in youth drug behaviors would  be apparent within 3 years, and Congress required ONDCP to assess  whether the campaign\u2019s efforts have been effective in changing the drug  use behaviors of America\u2019s youth. ONDCP also indicated that it  anticipated that it would take 2 to 3 years for the campaign to affect drug  use behavior, although ONDCP also indicated that it was with the  implementation of phase III of the campaign, beginning in mid-1999, that  ONDCP expected to see improvements in anti-drug attitudes that would  lead to decreases in youth drug use within 3 years. We previously reported  that ONDCP\u2019s evaluations of the first two phases of the campaign  produced inconclusive results because of various evaluation  implementation problems and limitations of the analyses used to support  findings about effects during these pilot phases. In particular, we noted  that the impact evaluations of phases I and II did not adequately gauge the  overall level of anti-drug awareness generated by the campaign\u2014the  principal outcome measure for these two phases\u2014and we identified site  selection problems, unknown parent response rates, low school response  rates, and data analysis issues contributing to the inconclusive results.", "To implement the phase III evaluation, ONDCP entered into an  interagency agreement with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),  which in turn awarded contracts to Westat, Inc., through June 2005 for  $42.7 million to conduct the evaluation. Westat subcontracted with the  Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania,  and staff from Westat and Annenberg were coprincipal investigators for  the study. Westat\u2019s phase III evaluation covered the period from  September 1999 through June 2004 and studied the impact of the  effectiveness of the nationwide campaign in reaching its target audience;  affecting youth beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors with regard to  drug use; and affecting their parents\u2019 beliefs and attitudes toward drug use  and affecting parents\u2019 behaviors associated with interacting with their  children and monitoring their activities.", "Westat evaluated the campaign using a longitudinal panel survey\u2014the  National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY)\u2014that aimed to measure the  campaign\u2019s effectiveness by assessing changes in various outcomes within  individuals over time in relation to their exposure to campaign messages.  Westat\u2019s evaluation assessed the effect of exposure to the campaign on  youth drug use and on several key intermediate outcomes\u2014such as youth  and parent attitudes toward and beliefs about drug use and parental  involvement with their children\u2014that were believed to influence youth  drug use. In conducting the evaluation, Westat submitted several interim  reports that were used in part to inform decisions about the direction of  the campaign. Westat submitted a draft of the final evaluation report to  NIDA in February 2005.", "Both Congress and ONDCP recognized the need for a separate evaluation  of the campaign, because of limitations associated with existing national  surveys of drug use. Congressional conferees acknowledged their  intention to rely on the evaluation to gauge the impact of the campaign,  and also indicated that if the campaign failed to show its effectiveness,  they would be compelled to reevaluate the use of taxpayer money to  support it. ONDCP acknowledged that existing national surveys of drug  use would not be able to answer the critical question of whether changes  in drug use behavior and attitudes were the result of the campaign. These  surveys do not ask respondents about their exposure and reactions to the  messages of the campaign that can then be linked to their drug-related  attitudes and behavior. For example, in a 2001 report on youth drug use  and the campaign, ONDCP officials noted that while national surveys of  youth drug use showed flattening or declining youth marijuana use in 1999  and 2000 and these trends suggested that the campaign may be having the  desired impact, it was necessary to await the results of the campaign\u2019s  independent evaluation before drawing any definitive conclusions  regarding the campaign\u2019s contribution to changes in youth drug use.", "In a committee report for the fiscal year 2004 appropriations cycle, the  Senate Appropriations Committee directed us to review how consultants  were used in support of the media campaign. This is the second of two  reports responding to this mandate. The first report provided information  concerning ONDCP\u2019s use of consultants in the campaign. This second  report addresses three questions related to Westat\u2019s evaluation of phase III  of the media campaign: (1) How did Westat ensure that it could report  credible results in its evaluation of the campaign? (2) What did the  evaluation find about the effect of exposure to the campaign on key  intermediate outcomes that were intended to lower youth drug use?   (3) What did the evaluation find about the effect of exposure to the  campaign on youth drug use?", "In addressing our objectives, a team of GAO social scientists reviewed and  assessed materials related to Westat\u2019s phase III evaluation, applying  generally accepted social science research standards, including such  elements as when and how the sample data were collected, adjustments  made to the sample to address nonresponse, how program effects were  isolated (i.e., the use of statistical controls), and the appropriateness of  outcome measures. The materials reviewed included interim and final  evaluation reports, documentation and analyses provided by Westat to us  in response to several sets of questions that we submitted about the details  of its methodology, documentation pertaining to meetings of scientific  panels that provided guidance on the evaluation, and documentation  prepared by ONDCP about the design and implementation of the  campaign. We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards from October 2005 through June 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The National Youth Anti- Drug Media Campaign", "paragraphs": ["As part of the Treasury and General Government Appropriation Act of  1998, the Drug Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 required, among other  things, the Office of National Drug Control Policy to conduct a national  media campaign for the purpose of reducing and preventing drug abuse  among young people in the United States. The National Youth Anti-Drug  Media Campaign may be the most visible federal effort devoted to  preventing drug use among the nation\u2019s youth. It aims to educate and  enable America\u2019s youth to reject illegal drugs; to prevent youth from  initiating use of drugs, especially marijuana and inhalants; and to convince  occasional users of these and other drugs to stop using drugs.  Administered by ONDCP, and implemented in three phases, the campaign  has as its centerpiece a paid advertising effort in which campaign funds  were used to purchase media time and space for advertisements that  delivered anti-drug messages to the campaign\u2019s target audiences\u2014youth  aged 9 to 18 and their parents and adult caregivers\u2014through strategic  placement of anti-drug advertisements on television and radio and in   print media.", "The campaign\u2019s first two phases were pilot phases that had as their  objectives developing advertising concepts, creating limited  advertisements, testing public awareness of the advertisements in   12 metropolitan areas, and eventually extending the pilot program  nationwide. Phase III of the campaign, which began in mid-1999, continued  the nationwide advertising campaign begun during phase II and integrated  the advertising with outreach efforts. In addition to the advertising, the  fully integrated phase III campaign included community outreach, work  with the entertainment and media industries to encourage the accurate  depiction of the consequences of drug use, outreach to faith-based  organizations, and work with youth organizations.", "During phase III, ONDCP had overall responsibility for developing and  implementing the campaign, and to do so, it enlisted the support of  nonprofit organizations, trade associations, private businesses, and federal  agencies. Appropriated media campaign funds were to be used to cover  the costs of actually making the advertisements as well as the costs for  planning of purchase of media time and space. The campaign also  included public outreach and specialized communications efforts. The  purpose of public outreach and communications was to extend the reach  and influence of the campaign through nonadvertising forms of marketing  communications. Examples of these nonadvertising forms of  communication included submitting articles related to key campaign  messages such as effective parenting or the effects of marijuana on teen  health to newspapers and magazines; building partnerships and alliances,  for example, coordinating positive activities for teens with local schools  and community groups; creating Web sites and exploring alternative media  approaches; and entertainment industry outreach.", "According to the campaign\u2019s communications strategy, youth aged 9 to   18 were segmented into three school and age risk-level categories: late  elementary school adolescents, aged 9 to 11; middle school children, aged  11 to 13; high school youth, ages 14 to 18. The campaign originally targeted  youth aged 9 to 18 with a focus on middle school age adolescents (roughly  11-to 13-year-olds); its secondary focus was on high school-aged youth  (approximately 14 to 18 years of age). In 2001, the campaign shifted its  creative focus to 11- to 14-year-olds in order to more effectively reach  youth at the time they are most at risk for trying drugs. In 2002, the  campaign altered its target age group to focus primarily on 14- to   16-year-olds. For all age groups, the communications strategy identified  the primary focus of the campaign as at-risk nonusers and occasional  users of drugs. For all groups, it was designed to give consideration to  differences arising from gender, race, ethnicity, and regional and  population density factors.", "From fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2004, Congress appropriated  $1.225 billion to support the campaign (table 1).", "For fiscal year 2007, the President\u2019s budget requested $120 million for  campaign activities. The 2007 request represents an increase of $21 million  above the fiscal year 2006 budget authority. The additional resources were  requested to help to purchase additional media time and space to increase  the reach and frequency of the campaign\u2019s messages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning and the Underlying Logic of the Campaign", "paragraphs": ["According to ONDCP, its planning for the campaign\u2019s communications  strategy included reviews of published studies on the etiology and  prevention of adolescent drug use, drug prevention campaigns, other  public health campaigns, and general consumer marketing campaigns  targeting youth and their parents. ONDCP also supplemented its research  evidence with an extensive expert consultation process that included  input from over 200 experts in academia, civic and community  organizations, government agencies, and the private sector. A campaign  design expert panel that included experts in the fields of drug use and  prevention, public health communication, advertising, market research,  consumer marketing, and public policy met over a 4-day period during the  fall of 1997 and played a key role in integrating diverse sources of  information and guiding the development of the communications strategy  for the campaign.", "The planning process resulted in a statement of ONDCP\u2019s communications  strategy for the campaign, which described the premises of the campaign.  Among these were the following: First, that the media can influence  people in a variety of ways, such as informing and alerting them to  important developments and shaping subsequent actions; satisfying leisure  time needs, thereby influencing individuals\u2019 views and beliefs about the  world; and stimulating interest in commercial goods and services, thereby  influencing where and how people shop. Second, that media messages  have more potential to reinforce rather than to alter existing attitudes and  beliefs. Third, to the extent that youth attitudes, beliefs, and intentions  toward drug use vary with their age, the potential of a media campaign to  influence drug use may be directly related to the age of the youth. Fourth,  the campaign had to be sustained over time and to have a significant  media presence, and its central messages have to be repeated often and in  a variety of ways. Citing research showing that attitudinal and behavioral  change took time to occur, ONDCP reported that it expected to observe  \u201cimprovements in anti-drug attitudes that would lead to decreases in youth  drug use within three years\u201d of the implementation of phase III of the  campaign. Fifth, as parents and adult caregivers play a vital role in youth  drug use behaviors, and by also targeting parents, the campaign would aim  to affect the nature of their interaction with their children, thereby  strengthening their children\u2019s capacity to resist using illicit drugs.", "The campaign focused on primary prevention\u2014that is, preventing those  who did not use drugs from starting to use drugs. According to ONDCP, a  media campaign that focused on primary prevention targets the underlying  causes of drug use and therefore has the greatest potential to reduce the  scope of the problem over the long term. Further, a primary prevention  campaign also has greater potential to affirm and reinforce anti-drug  attitudes of nonusers than to persuade experienced users to change their  behaviors, and a primary prevention campaign would also, over time,  lessen the need for drug treatment services. With a focus on young, non- drug-using adolescents, an expectation underlying the campaign\u2019s  potential success was that as these young, non-drug-using adolescents  aged, the campaign\u2019s messages would intervene, retard the development of  more pro-drug attitudes, and enable adolescents to continue to maintain  their preexisting anti-drug attitudes. By maintaining these attitudes, or  preventing the development of pro-drug sentiments, the campaign would  affect drug use rates by lowering the rate at which youth initiated drug  use, particularly the use of marijuana or inhalants.", "The campaign was designed to have a significant and sustained media  presence. During planning, ONDCP acknowledged that the campaign  would have to be sustained for a period of time sufficient to bring about a  measurable change in the beliefs and behaviors of youth in the target  audience. On the basis of the experiences of successful social marketing  campaigns, ONDCP reported that it expected that changes in awareness or  recall of the campaign would be detectable within a few months of the  start of the campaign, that changes in perceptions and attitudes would be  detectable within 1 to 2 years of the start of the campaign, and that  changes in behavior would be detectable within 2 to 3 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Campaign Activities during Phase III", "paragraphs": ["From mid-1999, the start of phase III, through June 2004, the end of the  phase III evaluation, campaign activities included extensive media  dissemination of campaign messages to a national audience of youth and  parents; an interactive media component, which involved using content- based Web sites and Internet advertising; use of experienced individuals  and organizations with expertise in marketing to teens, advertising and  communications, behavior change, and drug prevention to inform the  campaign strategy and implementation; use of multicultural initiatives that  focused on sufficiently exposing campaign messages to African  Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Hispanic Americans,  American Indians, and Alaskan Natives; and the implementation of the  integrated social marketing and public health communications campaign  through the creation of partnerships with civic, professional, and  community groups and outreach to media, entertainment, and sports  industries. Through the partner organizations, the campaign attempted to  strengthen local anti-drug efforts, and through outreach, it encouraged the  news media to run articles that conveyed campaign messages. Youth and  parent exposure to campaign messages could come from the direct, paid  and donated advertising or from content delivered by news media and  entertainment industries through the outreach efforts. Additional  opportunities for exposure to anti-drug messages could be enhanced  through personal involvement with organizations that became partners as  a result of campaign outreach or by interaction with the campaign\u2019s Web  site. Further, youth exposure to anti-drug messages could also occur  through interactions with friends, peers, parents, or other adults that  occurred directly from either campaign ads or outreach efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Campaign Themes and Messages", "paragraphs": ["Campaign messages for both youth and their parents and caregivers were  to focus on common transitions\u2014such as the transition from elementary  to secondary school\u2014and common situations\u2014such as the amount of  time spent in settings without adult supervision\u2014that were believed to  heighten adolescents\u2019 vulnerability to drug use initiation. In addition,  messages were to focus on altering mediating variables\u2014such as beliefs  and intentions\u2014that were known to have a significant impact on  adolescent drug use. Finally, campaign messages were designed to create  a \u201cbrand identity\u201d in the minds of target audience members and through  brand identity position campaign messages as credible and important.  Throughout phase III, themes such as parents as \u201cThe Anti-Drug\u201d and the  \u201cMy Anti-Drug\u201d theme for youth were designed to promote identification  and positive associations with the campaign\u2019s messages.", "While they evolved throughout the campaign, the central strategic  messages or themes for youth focused on resistance skills and self-efficacy  to refuse drugs, normative education and positive messages, negative  consequences of drug use, and early intervention. Resistance skills and  self-efficacy advertisements were designed to enhance the personal and  social skills of youth that promote lifestyle choices and to help build  youth\u2019s confidence that they could resist drugs. Normative education  themes attempted to instill the beliefs that most young people do not use  drugs or convey messages that \u201ccool people don\u2019t use drugs,\u201d while  positive message themes reinforced the idea of positive uses of time as  alternatives to illicit drugs. Negative consequences themes aimed to  enhance youth perceptions that drug use is likely to lead to a variety of  negatively valued consequences, such as loss of parental approval,  reduced performance in school, and negative social, aspirational, and  health effects. Negative consequences themes were the primary focus of  the Marijuana Initiative, which was introduced during 2002. An early  intervention theme sought to motivate youth to intervene with friends who  they perceived as having problems with drugs or alcohol and tried to  convince youth of their ability to take action and to give them the tools  and skills they needed to intervene.", "For parents, the campaign\u2019s themes included messages that every child,  including their own, was at risk of doing drugs; that they can learn  parenting skills to help them help their children avoid drugs; that they  need to be aware of the harmful effects of drugs including marijuana and  inhalants; and, as part of the Early Intervention Initiative, that it was  important that they intervene at the earliest possible opportunity in their  child\u2019s life if their child was using drugs or alcohol."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Design of the Evaluation, Interim Evaluation Reports, and Redirection of the Campaign", "paragraphs": ["ONDCP recognized the need for a separate evaluation of the campaign and  for ongoing reporting of evaluation results. The need for a separate  evaluation stemmed in part from the limitations of existing national  surveys that monitor drug use, such as Monitoring the Future, which  provides data on drug use by high school students, the National Household  Survey on Drug Abuse, and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which  addresses health risk behaviors including drug use. These recurring  surveys provide very little information with which to evaluate the impact  of the campaign, because they were not designed to evaluate it. As ONDCP  has written, these surveys contain no questions about target audience  exposure and response to the campaign, and as a result, any changes in  attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors toward drug use could not be associated  directly with the campaign. By comparison, ONDCP acknowledged that it  was using the Westat evaluation to assess the extent to which changes in  anti-drug attitudes and beliefs or drug-using behavior can be attributed to  the campaign, as opposed to other socioeconomic factors. In addition,  ONDCP indicated that for the campaign, data from Westat\u2019s evaluation  would enable ONDCP to assess whether the campaign is working.", "The primary tool of the Westat evaluation was the National Survey of  Parents and Youth. The NSPY is a longitudinal panel study of children and  their parents\u2019 exposure and response to the campaign. The NSPY was  designed to collect initial and follow-up data from nationally  representative samples of youth aged 9 to 18 and from the parents of these  youth. The sample was designed to represent youth living in homes in the  United States and their parents. Data collection began in November 1999  and was conducted over four rounds\u2014each of which was about 1 year  apart from the next round\u2014in nine waves of interviews. An interview  wave refers to the fielding of a survey round to a specific subsample in the  NSPY. An interview round refers to the completion of interviews with the  entire sample. Data for each of the nine waves were collected using a  laptop computer and a combination of computer-assisted interview  technologies. To collect sensitive data, audio computer-assisted self- interview technology was used, allowing respondents to self-administer  the questionnaire in total privacy. The final wave of data collection was  completed in June 2004 (fig. 1). Eligible youth and parents were to be  interviewed four times.", "The evaluation aimed to assess whether exposure to the campaign  affected the self-reported knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and drug use of  youth. Because the campaign reached out to all youth nationwide, the  evaluators could not assess its effects using experimental methods, in  which some subjects are randomly assigned to the intervention and others  are randomly assigned to control groups that were not exposed to the  intervention. Westat\u2019s evaluation was designed to take into account the  variation in self-reported exposure to the campaign messages and to  assess how this variation in exposure was correlated with outcomes that  the campaign intended to affect. To attribute changes in drug use attitudes  and behaviors to the campaign, the evaluation was designed to assess  exposure to the campaign and to compare differences in outcomes for  groups of persons that were exposed to varying levels of the campaign\u2019s  messages, and to use statistical controls to account for individual-level  differences among survey respondents.", "Westat\u2019s evaluation assessed youth self-reported drug use and  intermediate outcomes\u2014such as youth and parent attitudes and beliefs  toward drug use and parental involvement with their children\u2014that were  believed to influence youth drug use. The evaluation of phase III  addressed issues related to (1) whether the campaign was reaching its  target populations, (2) whether the desired outcomes moved in favorable  or unfavorable directions, (3) whether the campaign was influencing  changes in the desired outcomes, and (4) what could be learned from the  overall evaluation to support ongoing decision making for the campaign.  These issues led to the five major objectives for the evaluation:  to measure changes in drug-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and  behavior in youth and their parents;  to assess the relationship between changes in drug-related knowledge,  attitudes, beliefs, and behavior and self-reported measures of media  exposure, including the salience of the measures;  to assess the association between parents\u2019 drug-related knowledge,  attitudes, beliefs, and behavior and those of their children;  to assess changes in the association between parents\u2019 drug-related  knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behavior and those of their children  that may be related to the campaign; and  to compare groups of people with high exposure to other groups with  low exposure.", "Westat submitted semiannual and special topic reports to NIDA, as the  findings from these interim evaluation reports were to be used to support  ongoing decision making for the campaign. Westat submitted the first  semiannual report in November 2000. By December 2003, Westat had  submitted six additional reports, four of which were labeled as semiannual  reports, and the other two included a special report on historical trends in  drug use and a 2003 report of findings. Westat submitted its first draft of  its final report to NIDA in February 2005.", "In addition to Westat\u2019s evaluation of the relationship between exposure  and outcomes, Westat also prepared a report on the environmental  context of the campaign. In May 2002, Westat reported findings from this  qualitative study of views of representatives from major national  organizations and state prevention coordinators about the messages  conveyed by the campaign and the role of the campaign as an organizing  partner in helping to bolster local substance abuse prevention efforts.  According to Westat, representatives felt that the campaign\u2019s messages  reinforced their own messages that encouraged youth to find healthy  alternatives to drug use and to raise public awareness of the issue of illicit  drugs among youth. Westat also reported that representatives were less  enthusiastic about the role of the campaign as an organizational partner in  helping with local substance abuse prevention efforts. \u201cThere is little evidence of direct favorable Campaign effects on youth. There is no  statistically significant decline in marijuana use to date, and some evidence for an  increase in use from 2000 to 2001. Nor are there improvements in beliefs and  attitudes about marijuana use between 2000 and the first half of 2002. Contrarily,  there are some unfavorable trends in youth anti-marijuana beliefs. Also there is no  tendency for those reporting more exposure to Campaign messages to hold more  desirable beliefs.\u201d", "Westat further reported that there were unfavorable delayed effects of  campaign exposure on subsequent intentions to use marijuana and on  other beliefs. By delayed effects, Westat referred to the relationship  between exposure to the campaign measured in one survey round having  an effect on intentions or beliefs outcomes at a subsequent survey round.  For parents, Westat reported that the evidence was consistent with  favorable campaign effects, as it found that there were favorable changes  for three of five parents\u2019 belief and behavior outcome measures. However,  Westat also reported that it found no evidence for favorable indirect  effects on youth behavior as the result of their parents\u2019 exposure to the  campaign.", "Congressional appropriators expressed concerns about the findings of  Westat\u2019s fifth semiannual report. In the conference report for fiscal year  2003 omnibus appropriations, the conferees reported that they were  \u201cdeeply disturbed by the lack of evidence that the National Youth Anti- Drug Media Campaign has had any appreciable impact on youth drug  use.\u201d The conferees further acknowledged that while the evaluation  conducted under NIDA\u2019s auspices showed \u201cslight and sporadic impact on  the attitudes of parents, it has had no significant impact on youth  behavior.\u201d The conferees further acknowledged that while other surveys  of youth drug use\u2014such as Monitoring the Future, a survey of high school  youth\u2014showed recent declines in drug use, \u201cthe NIDA study was  undertaken to measure the specific impact of the Media Campaign, not  simply to gauge general trends,\u201d and the conferees stated that they \u201cintend  to rely on the scientifically rigorous NIDA study to gauge the ultimate  impact of the campaign\u201d and to reevaluate the use of taxpayer money to  support the campaign if the campaign continued to fail to demonstrate its  effectiveness.", "In 2002, the strategy for the campaign was redirected. In the spring, the  target age group of the campaign became 14- to 16-year-olds\u2014youth who  have higher rates of marijuana initiation than younger youth\u2014from its  original targeting of 11- to 13-year-olds. The shift to teens in the 14- to   16-year-old range aimed to allow the campaign to more effectively reach  youth during the time at which they are most at risk for trying drugs.  ONDCP also required more rigorous copy test procedures of all television  advertisements before they were aired, and ONDCP increased its oversight  in guiding the development and production of advertisements. In October  2002, ONDCP launched a new initiative called the Marijuana Initiative.  This initiative contained more focused advertising to address youth  marijuana use. In a hearing before the House Committee on Government  Reform, ONDCP announced that it would reverse the ratio of campaign  advertising expenditures directed to adults and youth, respectively.

All schools were exposed to the  campaign during the fall of 1999 and spring of 2000. This permitted the  researchers to test for a synergistic effect between exposure to the  campaign\u2019s anti-drug messages and participation in the school-based drug  prevention curriculum. The sample of about 4,100 youth were asked how  often they had seen anti-drug advertisements in recent months in five  media outlets that were used by the campaign, and the researchers  measured exposure to the campaign that indicated whether or not the  adolescents reported seeing ads at least one to three times per week in any  of the five media outlets. Consistent with Westat\u2019s fifth interim report, the  evaluation of the South Dakota drug prevention curriculum found no  direct effects of exposure to the campaign on its sample of adolescents\u2019  use of illegal drugs. However, the evaluation also found that marijuana use  in the past month was significantly less likely among adolescents who  received both the curriculum with booster lessons and weekly exposure to  the campaign\u2019s messages. In other words, neither the enhanced curriculum  nor the campaign alone had a substantial effect on marijuana use in the  absence of the other.

The consensus of a scientific panel convened by NIDA in  August 2002 to review the evaluation was that Westat\u2019s use of a national  probability sample to study change arising from the campaign was  preferable as the \u201cgold standard\u201d to a study based on other alternatives,  such as in-depth community-based studies of the mechanisms of change  and campaign effects. Additionally, the theoretical underpinnings of  behavioral change through advertising, along with statistically significant  outcomes in some but not all groups, suggest that the absence of baseline  data and introduction of new campaign initiatives did not invalidate the  evaluation\u2019s findings. Finally, despite the introduction of new campaign  initiatives that were not timed with data collection cycles, Westat was able  to assess change in the NSPY data and generate statistically significant  findings using these data.", "Westat\u2019s longitudinal panel design was based on the premise that effects of  exposure to the campaign on outcomes could be measured and detected  within individuals over time, after controlling for various other factors that  could have influenced outcomes. The design called for measuring the  same respondents up to four times to assess how the natural variation in  exposure to the campaign correlated with campaign outcomes. Westat\u2019s  approach\u2014an exposure (or dose)-response model\u2014is based upon a  premise that respondents\u2019 recall of advertisements (exposure or dose) is  related to outcomes (response). In two recent studies of the effects of the  campaign on specific groups of youth in local areas, an exposure-response  approach has been shown to be an effective method for detecting effects  of the campaign in reducing youth drug use in local settings. One of the  studies reported a synergistic effect of exposure to the campaign and a  classroom-based drug prevention curriculum among 9th grade students in  45 South Dakota high schools. The other study reported reductions in drug  use during the period of the redirected campaign among high-sensation- seeking youth in schools in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Lexington,  Kentucky. To assess the possibility of preexisting differences between  groups of exposed youth and parents that might explain both the variation  in exposure to the campaign and variation in outcomes, Westat included in  the NSPY structured interview many questions on personal and family  history, and it used the responses to control statistically for differences in  attributes of respondents in order to attempt to isolate the relationship  between exposure to the campaign and outcomes.", "The absence of baseline data\u2014that is, precampaign data on outcomes\u2014 was beyond Westat\u2019s control, as phase III of the campaign began before  the first wave of data collection for the phase III evaluation began. The lag  between the start of phase III of the campaign in mid-1999 and the  completion of the evaluation\u2019s first round of data collection\u2014around mid- 2001\u2014leaves open the possibility that there were effects of the campaign  that occurred very early on in the campaign, prior to when Westat began  data collection. Several factors suggest that the absence of pre-phase III  baseline data was not fatal to the evaluation\u2019s findings. First, if there were  effects of the campaign that could not be detected because of the absence  pre-phase III baseline data, those effects must have occurred very rapidly  and then endured throughout the remainder of the campaign, from 1999  through 2004. However, rapid changes in youth drug use were not  observed in MTF data; rather, the overall trend in MTF past year drug use  was flat between 1998 and 1999. Second, rapidly occurring effects were  not expected by ONDCP in designing the campaign. As we reported in  2000, and as ONDCP wrote in 2001, ONDCP believed that it would take   2 to 3 years for changes in drug use to be evident as a result of the  campaign.", "Another campaign design factor that affected Westat\u2019s evaluation was the  implementation of new campaign initiatives, such as the Marijuana  Initiative, which were implemented at times that officials at ONDCP  considered to be important, and therefore they may not have coincided  with planned data collection for the evaluation, nor should they  necessarily have done so. For example, the Marijuana Initiative was  implemented in October 2002, and the NSPY data available to evaluate  outcomes during it were limited to three complete survey waves. For its  longitudinal analysis of change during the Marijuana Initiative, Westat was  limited to data from two survey waves. Despite these limitations, the  evaluation produced data that enabled Westat to detect effects during the  period of the Marijuana Initiative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sample Coverage Issues Did Not Invalidate Westat\u2019s Assessment of the Effectiveness of Exposure to the Campaign on Intermediate and Drug Use Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["During the enrollment phase of the NSPY, Westat experienced sample  coverage problems, in that it enrolled\u2014or rostered\u2014a smaller percentage  of households with youth in the targeted age range than would be  expected based on comparable Current Population Survey (CPS)  estimates\u2014the data that Westat used to develop its expectations about the  percentage of households having youth in the targeted age ranges.  Coverage refers to the extent to which a sample is representative of the  intended population on specified characteristics, and it is important  because the omission of segments of the intended population from a  sample\u2014or undercoverage\u2014can lead to biased results, in that omitted  segments may differ in some important respect from those segments  included. Westat estimated the extent of undercoverage in the NSPY to be  about 30 percent as compared to the CPS estimates, and according to  Westat and NIDA, the undercoverage arose during the stage of sampling in  which Westat was developing rosters of households that were believed to  contain youth in the target age range. At this stage, the survey rostering  process required entry into the household, which may have led  respondents in potentially eligible households to refuse to participate.", "Our review of Westat\u2019s documentation leads us to conclude that there was  no evidence of biased results due to undercoverage and that the sample  was sufficiently reliable both for the purposes of estimating changes over  time in individual outcomes and for assessing the effectiveness of  exposure to the campaign on outcomes. Westat\u2019s comparisons of the  estimated population characteristics of the NSPY\u2014such as race and  ethnicity of head of household and race and ethnicity of youth in  households\u2014with the estimated population characteristics from the CPS  show that they are generally similar. That is, the distributions of  characteristics of eligible households with youth included in the NSPY  were broadly consistent with a variety of corresponding distributions from  the 1999 CPS. These comparisons suggest that the NSPY estimated  population by race and ethnicity was similar to that of CPS. Westat also  used multivariate modeling techniques to develop weighting adjustments,  and it developed weights to adjust its sample for nonresponse that were  reasonably effective in reducing nonresponse bias.", "An additional test for bias in a sample is to compare estimates derived  from it with estimates on the same variable derived from another sample.  If the NSPY results were biased, then one would expect that estimates  derived from it would differ from estimates derived from unbiased  samples. For example, if eligible households refused to participate in the  NSPY because they contained teens with drug issues and as a result  avoided participation at a higher rate than did households containing teens  without drug issues, then these higher refusal rates by households  containing teens with drug issues would lead to NSPY estimates of the  percentage of youth reporting that they used drugs that were lower than  those obtained from other, comparable national surveys. According to  data provided by NIDA officials and our review of Westat\u2019s final report,  estimated self-reported drug use rates from the NSPY are comparable to  estimates derived from other major surveys of drug use, such as the  National Survey on Drug Use and Health. For example, in the NSPY, rates  of past-month marijuana use among 12- to 18-year-olds were 7.2 percent in  2000, 8 percent in 2001, 8.9 percent in 2002, and 7.9 percent in 2003. These  rates were similar to those reported for 12- to 17-year-olds in the National  Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) of 7.2 percent in 2000, 8 percent  in 2001, 8.2 percent in 2002, and 7.9 percent in 2003. If youth with known  drug use problems consistently opted out of both the NSPY and the  NSDUH\u2014a hypothesis that is not testable with the available data\u2014then  the estimates from both the NSPY and the NSDUH of the true prevalence  of youth drug use would be biased underestimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sample Attrition across NSPY Interview Rounds Was Sufficiently Low to Allow for Reliable Assessments of the Effect of Campaign Exposure on Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["As the NSPY was a longitudinal survey\u2014in which eligible sample  respondents were re-interviewed up to three times after their enrollment  interviews\u2014attrition was a concern with which Westat had to contend. If  comparatively large numbers of sample respondents were not retained  across successive rounds of the survey, the capacity of the NSPY to  provide data to assess changes in outcomes in response to exposure over  time would be greatly diminished. Further, if attrition was specific to  certain groups, then the NSPY estimates would also be biased.", "For the purpose of estimating within-respondent changes in outcomes in  response to changes in exposure across sample periods\u2014the main use of  the NSPY data\u2014Westat achieved follow-up longitudinal response rates of  between 82 percent and 94 percent for waves 4 through 9, the follow-up  waves to the first three enrollment waves. The longitudinal response rate  consists of two elements: (1) the percentage of prior survey respondents  that are tracked and for whom eligibility is determined and (2) the  percentage of those eligible that actually complete an interview. Across  the three follow-up survey rounds, Westat tracked and determined the  eligibility to participate in a follow-up survey of between 92 percent and   96 percent of the youth and parents who completed a survey in the prior  round.

In early meetings on the design of the evaluation of the media  campaign, ONDCP officials reported that it had a specific Performance  Measures of Effectiveness system and that the campaign was embodied  within the first goal of the National Drug Strategy, which was to \u201ceducate  and enable America\u2019s youth to reject illegal drugs as well as the use of  alcohol and tobacco.\u201d Under this goal, ONDCP\u2019s proposed targets for  reducing the prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs and alcohol  among youth from a 1996 base year\u2014by 2002, reduce this prevalence by   20 percent, and by 2007, reduce it by 50 percent. ONDCP officials  identified other specific targets, again from the base year 1996\u2014by 2002,  increase to 80 percent the proportion of youth who perceive that regular  use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco is harmful; and by 2002, increase  to 95 percent the proportion of youth who disapprove of illicit drug,  alcohol, and tobacco use. To achieve a goal of 80 percent of 12th grade  youth who perceive that regular use of marijuana is harmful would require  increasing the 1996 baseline percentage of youth perceiving marijuana as  harmful from 60 percent, as measured by MTF, or by about 3.3 percentage  points per year from 1996 to 2002. Westat\u2019s sample could be used to detect  this amount of annual change in youth attitudes.", "In order to detect changes in outcomes due to exposure to the campaign,  it also was necessary that Westat accurately measure and characterize  exposure to the campaign. Westat provided evidence for the validity of its  measures of self-reported exposure, and the evidence suggests that the  measure of exposure was both valid and reliable. To measure exposure to  the campaign for both youth and parents, NSPY interviewers asked  respondents about their recall of anti-drug advertisements (general  exposure) and their recognition of specific current or very recent  television and radio advertisements (specific exposure). To facilitate  measures of recall, respondents viewed television and radio  advertisements on laptop computers. Youth and parents were only shown  or listened only to advertisements targeted to their respective groups. In  addition, both youth and parents were asked some general questions about  their recall of advertisements seen or heard in various media, including  television, radio, newspapers, magazines, movie theaters, billboards, and  the Internet.", "Westat\u2019s assessments of the validity of its measure of exposure to  campaign advertisements confirm that the NSPY data were able to  measure exposure. First, Westat examined respondents\u2019 recall of  campaign advertisements using \u201cringer\u201d television advertisements\u2014 advertisements that never had appeared. According to Westat\u2019s analysis of  ringer advertisements, youth were more likely to recognize an  advertisement as a campaign advertisement when presented with an  actual campaign advertisement than a bogus one. For example, a far lower  percentage of respondents (11 percent) claimed to have seen a ringer, or  bogus, advertisement than the percentage who claimed to have seen the  broadcast advertisements (45 percent), particularly the advertisements  that were delivered with high frequency. The result held for youth and for  parents.", "Second, comparing data on advertisement time purchases with self- reported exposure to these advertisements in the NSPY, Westat found a  high correlation between advertising and exposure. Specifically, on the  basis of analysis of individual advertisements\u2019 gross rating points (GRP)\u2014  a measure of the underlying reach and frequency of each advertisement\u2014 and self-reported exposures by respondents, Westat found a high  correlation between GRPs purchased by the campaign and self-reported  exposure to advertisements among youth. The correlation for parents was  somewhat smaller, but was also significant. Third, Westat also compared  self-reported exposure with recall of the correct brand phrase and found a  strong association between self-reported exposure and correct recognition  of the brand phrase. This is further evidence for the validity of its  measures of self-reported exposure.", "Westat measured a variety of outcomes for youth and parents and took  steps to ensure that the measures were consistent with existing research.  The youth questionnaires included numerous questions that were designed  to measure exposure to the campaign advertisements and other anti-drug  messages. The youth question areas included exposure propensity to  media; current and past use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, inhalants, and  Ecstasy; past discussions with and communication of anti-drug messages  from parents and friends; expectations of others about respondent\u2019s drug  use; knowledge and beliefs about the positive and negative consequences  of drug use; exposure to campaign messages; family and peer factors;  personal factors; and demographic information. Westat used separate  questionnaires for youth of different ages; one questionnaire was used for  children (aged 9 to 11) and another one was used for teens (aged 12 to 18)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Westat\u2019s Analytic Methods Aimed to Isolate Causal Effects of the Campaign and Did So Using Sophisticated Techniques That Enhanced the Strength of Its Findings", "paragraphs": ["In it analysis, Westat used three types of evidence to draw inferences  about the effects of the campaign: (1) trend data\u2014data that describe  increases or decreases in drug use and other outcomes over time;   (2) cross-section analysis\u2014measures of association between exposure to  campaign messages and individual drug use beliefs, intentions, and  behaviors, at the time data were collected; and (3) longitudinal analysis\u2014 measures of association, for youth and parents who were observed at two  points in time, between exposure to campaign messages at the earlier time  on outcomes at the later time. Westat indicated that trends over time, by  themselves, could not be used to provide definitive support for campaign  effects. Rather, the trends needed to be supported by measures of  association. Westat also indicated that measures of association, whether  cross-sectional or longitudinal, needed to control for variables that could  influence outcomes independently of the campaign or otherwise confound  the association between exposure and outcomes. Cross-section  association between exposure and outcomes measured at the same time  would provide stronger evidence of campaign effects than would trend  data alone, provided that controls for other variables were introduced into  the associational analyses. However, even if cross-section associations  between exposure and outcomes hold after controlling for the effects of  other variables, as Westat pointed out, there may remain an alternative  explanation for cross-section associations: For example, an outcome\u2014like  perceptions of others\u2019 use of drugs\u2014may be the cause of exposure rather  than an effect of it. Westat\u2019s longitudinal analysis attempts to address the  ambiguities that exist with cross-sectional associations. With longitudinal  data, if, after controlling for other confounding variables, exposure  measured at an earlier time is associated with an outcome at a later time,  the inference made is that the causal direction is from exposure to  outcome, since an effect cannot precede a cause in time.", "As the campaign was implemented nationally and it was therefore not  possible to assign youth and their parents randomly to treatment and  control groups, a major threat to the validity of the conclusions from the  evaluation is that the observed correlations between exposure to the  campaign and self-reported attitudes and behaviors could reflect  preexisting differences among individuals in their underlying susceptibility  to campaign messages. The evaluation\u2019s associations between exposure to  the campaign and self-reported initiation of marijuana use took into  account statistically the individual differences in attributes among youth  who were exposed to various levels of campaign messages, and they  adjusted for the influence of other variables that could determine  marijuana initiation\u2014called confounder variables. As such, Westat\u2019s  evaluation of the associations between campaign exposure and marijuana  initiation have accounted for individual differences among youth and can  be viewed as comparisons of outcomes for statistically similar individuals.  Further, the statistical test Westat used in assessing the relationship  between exposure and initiation did not rely upon assumptions of linearity  between levels of exposure and initiation. Instead, it tests for an ordered  relationship between exposure and an outcome such as marijuana use  initiation.", "Westat used statistical methods to address the possibility that preexisting  differences between individuals could have caused both reported levels of  exposure and respondent outcomes, and its use of these methods  contributed to the validity of its findings about the effects of the campaign  on outcomes. If, independently of the campaign, individuals differed in  their underlying tendencies to accept and recall campaign messages, and if  the individuals who were more likely to recall advertisements also were  those who were more likely to respond to advertisements, then, absent  efforts to address this confounding factor, the findings about the  evaluation would be questionable. This type of bias is often called a  selection effect. If selection effects occurred in the campaign, then both  exposure and reported changes in attitudes and behaviors could reflect  underlying beliefs that were not affected by the campaign, despite the  presence of statistical correlations between self-reported exposure and  changes in attitudes and behaviors.", "To control for selection effects and the many factors that could have  influenced both exposure and outcomes independently of, or in  conjunction with, the campaign, Westat used propensity scoring methods.  These methods limit the influence of preexisting differences among  exposed groups by controlling for a wide range of possible confounding  variables. Propensity score methods are used to create comparison groups  that are similar on measured and potentially confounding variables but  that differ on their levels of treatment. In the evaluation of the campaign,  the comparison groups were similar on confounding variables but differed  on their level of exposure to campaign messages. Propensity score  methods replace a set of confounding variables with a single function of  these variables, which is called the propensity score. In Westat\u2019s analysis,  an individual\u2019s propensity score is considered to represent an individual\u2019s  probability of being assigned to a particular level of exposure to the  campaign, conditional upon the individual\u2019s values of the confounding  variables. By including relevant, potentially confounding variables and  matching individuals on their propensity scores, Westat was able to  minimize bias due to selection effects. The comparison groups that Westat  created by using propensity score methods can be considered as statistical  analogues to randomly assigning individuals to different levels of  exposure. After creating these groups, Westat then analyzed outcomes  among the groups having different propensities to be exposed to campaign  messages.", "Our assessment of Westat\u2019s methods leads us to conclude that Westat took  reasonable steps to develop valid propensity models, and as a result of its  models, its analysis identified the effects of the campaign, net of other  factors included in its propensity score models. First, rather than simply  compare individuals who were exposed to campaign messages with those  who were not exposed, Westat estimated and compared groups of  individuals with different levels of exposure, where the number of  exposure groups was measured alternatively as a three- or four-level  variable\u2014e.g., low, medium, or high exposure. Second, for the results of  propensity methods to be valid, it is important that the propensity scoring  models include all relevant variables that could otherwise explain  differences in both exposure and outcomes, as evaluators can adjust only  for confounding variables that are observed and measured. If an important  variable is omitted from the propensity model, the results of analyses may  be affected. Westat\u2019s models included many relevant and potentially  confounding variables. For example, in the youth models, the propensity  score models included measures of demographic attributes, educational  attainment and educational aspiration, family and parent background,  parental consumption of television and other media, income and  employment, reading habits, Internet usage, location of residence in an  urban area, among other variables. Third, for propensity models to remove  the effects of confounding variables from the association between  exposure and response, it is necessary that the population means of the  confounder variables not vary across exposure levels. If a confounder is  successfully balanced, then it will have the same theoretical effect across  all exposure levels. After estimating models, Westat also assessed and  demonstrated the balance of variables in its propensity models."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Phase III Evaluation Provided Mixed Evidence of the Campaign\u2019s Effectiveness on Intermediate Outcomes, but It Found No Effect of the Campaign on Parental Monitoring of Youth", "paragraphs": ["Westat reported mixed evidence about the effectiveness of the campaign  on intermediate outcome measures\u2014such as recall and identification of  campaign messages, youth anti-drug attitudes, and parents\u2019 beliefs and  behaviors\u2014that were thought to be causal factors influencing youth drug  use, the ultimate target of the campaign.

Westat\u2019s estimates include campaign advertisements intended for either all  youth or all parents, but they do not include exposure of youth to parent  advertisements or parents to youth advertisements, nor do they account  for separate advertising targeted to specific race- or ethnicity-defined  audiences.", "Using exposure indexes, Westat measured trends in general and specific  exposure to campaign advertisements. The general exposure index was  based on questions that asked about exposure to anti-drug messages in  recent months through a variety of channels, including movies, television,  radio, and billboards, and was not limited to campaign advertisements.  The specific exposure index was based on recall of specific  advertisements broadcast during the 60 days prior to the respondent\u2019s  interview, and was limited to advertisements that targeted the respondent.  For example, for youth, only youth advertisements were sampled to  measure specific exposure. Youth aged 12\u00bd to 18 and their parents  reported increasing levels of recall of specific but not general exposure to  campaign advertisements over time. For both parents and youth, there was  a sharp increase over time in the recall of specific exposure of television  ads across the campaign. Westat speculated that the increase in specific  recall may have arisen from better-placed, more memorable, or longer- aired advertisements rather than only to an overall increase in television  advertisements. However, recall of all general anti-drug advertising was  fairly stable over time, as there was no overall detectable change in  reported general exposure over the course of the campaign.", "Beginning in 2001, when the evaluation started to measure brand phrase  recall, and continuing through 2004, the evidence indicates that youth, in  particular, exhibited increases in brand phrase recall. Advertising  campaigns may use a brand phrase to provide a recognizable element, and  to the extent that the brand is recognized and positively regarded, its  familiarity may lead to a positive response to a new advertisement or  increase the perception that each advertisement is part of a larger  campaign. The campaign included both a parent and a youth brand. Brand  messages may have involved a series of phrases or the portrayal of an  activity or lifestyle as positive (e.g., participating in team sports) to set up  the brand phrase of \u201cThe Anti-Drug.\u201d Westat reported that the evidence  from the NSPY shows that the greater the exposure to media campaign  advertising, the more likely respondents were to recall the brand phrase.  In addition, the more that respondents recalled specific ads, the more  likely they were to recognize the brand phrase, although over time even  those with less exposure had learned the brand phrase.", "Overall, youth reported favorable impressions of the subset of campaign  television advertisements that they were asked to evaluate, and their  favorable impressions increased over time. Responses to the  advertisements\u2014whether they were attention getting, convincing, or said  something important to the respondent\u2014were positive among both youth  and their parents. Parents\u2019 evaluations of the advertisements were  generally more positive than those of youth, and parents\u2019 positive views  also increased over time.", "In addition to distributing messages directly in media advertisements, the  campaign aimed to reach its target audiences indirectly through other  institutions and routes, such as community groups, in-school and out-of- school anti-drug education, and discussions among youth and parents, and  youth and friends, concerning drug use and the drug advertisements. The  NSPY data indicated that the campaign\u2019s messages were not accompanied  by similar increases in exposure to messages from other sources. Both  youth and parents reported receiving anti-drug messages from other  sources, but they did not consistently report increases in exposure to  messages from these sources.

Nor  should its results be construed to mean that in some locations, for some  groups of youth, the campaign did not have an effect on drug use.

The Westat national findings do not preclude the findings  of positive results for some subpopulations of youth. The Palmgreen study,  for example found a positive effect for the media campaign on high- sensation-seeking youth, but did not find an effect on non-high-sensation- seeking youth in the two moderate size communities in which the study  was conducted. The distribution of these youth in the nationwide  population could be consistent with both studies being correct. Our  objective was to assess the Westat study as a national evaluation of the  impact of the national campaign. In the Slater study, after being trained in  the use of campaign media materials, leaders in each of eight communities  that received a media campaign were allowed to develop their own media  strategies and were able to use whatever materials they chose or  developed on their own.

ONDCP also faults our  report for not discussing other potential competing explanations for the  substantial downturn in teen drug use and increase in anti-drug attitudes.  Although this is beyond the objectives of this report, we note that multiple  other indicators of youth responsibility also seem to be trending in a  positive direction at the same time that MTF reports declines in youth drug  use. For example, from 1991 through 1999, the teen pregnancy rate  declined by 27 percent and from 1991 through 2002, the teen birth rate fell  30 percent. Similarly, the number of juvenile homicides declined by   44 percent from 1993 to 2002, and the juvenile violent crime arrest rate fell  by more than 40 percent from 1994 to 2003. All of these trends\u2014including  declines in drug use\u2014could be related to broader environmental, familial,  or other influences.

Westat used a dual-frame sampling frame\u2014or list of the  members of the population from which the sample was ultimately  selected. One frame\u2014the area frame\u2014consisted of housing units that had  been built by late 1991; the second frame\u2014the building permit frame\u2014 consisted of building permits issued between January 1990 and December  1998 for new housing. Combined, these frames constituted an estimated  98 percent of dwelling units nationwide that existed by the end of 1998.", "A household had to meet two criteria in order to be eligible to be included  in the NSPY sample: It had to (1) contain children within a specified age  group and (2) be a housing unit that was built before April 1, 1990, was a  mobile home, or was selected from a roster of building permits for new  housing units issued between January 1990 and December 1998. To  identify households that met these conditions, Westat drew a sample of  dwelling units and from this sample it screened households to determine  their eligibility for inclusion in the NSPY, that is, whether a household  contained children in a specified age group, where the specified age  groups were children aged 9 through 13, 12 and 13, or 9 through 18.", "According to estimates provided by Westat, after completing enrollment in  the NSPY\u2014which occurred during waves 1 through 3\u2014the NSPY sample  covered more than an estimated 95 percent of occupied dwelling units  (households) nationwide. From its sample of occupied dwelling units,  Westat developed rosters of households that were believed to contain  youth in the target age range. At this second stage of sample enumeration,  Westat experienced a drop-off in the coverage of households that were  believed to be eligible for inclusion in the sample. The number of eligible  households enumerated in the NSPY was 30 percent smaller than the  number expected from the 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS) data.", "According to Westat, coverage losses in the NSPY could have occurred for  several reasons: (1) because an interviewer may have decided to classify a  household as an ineligible household rather than as a nonresponding  household, (2) because the household respondent took cues from the  screening questions to avoid selection into the sample by giving an  incorrect answer, or (3) because the doorstep enumeration process was  considered to be intrusive. Westat reported that it could not conclusively  rule out the first explanation for coverage losses. However, it undertook  sample validation procedures that examined whether ineligible  households in the recruitment waves were misclassified, and it found  none. Neither Westat nor the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported  that undercoverage was primarily due to respondents avoiding selection  into the sample by taking cues from the screening questions and giving  incorrect answers as a way to avoid selection into the sample. Overall,  Westat reported that the main reason for undercoverage was the rostering  component of the survey, which required actual entry into the home, and  led to \u201ca great many respondents\u201d asking the interviewer to come back at a  later date, only to repeat the request when the interviewer reappeared.  Westat inferred that this represented passive refusal to participate.  Therefore, according to Westat, most of the coverage losses occurred  during the doorstep screening process in which simple, focused screening  questions about the composition of the household were used to identify  households from which to sample eligible youth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NSPY and CPS Comparisons of Distributions on Analyzed Variables", "paragraphs": ["In response to questions from us, Westat provided data that indicated that  the coverage losses in the NSPY did not result in differences in the  estimated distributions of population characteristics from the NSPY as  compared with those estimated from the CPS data.

These weights were calculated prior to Westat\u2019s  poststratification calibration techniques, which brought the estimated  NSPY population totals into line with the estimated CPS population totals.  Hence, if upon using the weights based only on the probability of selection  and nonresponse adjustments, the population characteristics in the NSPY  differed widely from those derived from the CPS, this would constitute  evidence of potential bias in the NSPY sample due to undercoverage.", "Westat compared NSPY and CPS distributions for each of the three  enrollment waves of the NSPY (waves 1 through 3) on several variables,  including the race/ethnicity of the householder and the presence of males  28 years of age or older, the distribution of eligible households by the age  of the youth in the household, the age and gender distributions of youth,  and the age distributions of youth by race and ethnicity. Each of these  comparisons involved discrete subgroups within the focused  subpopulation of the NSPY. The largest differences between the NSPY and  CPS estimates arose in the comparison of the distributions by  race/ethnicity of household and the presence of a male 28 years of age or  older in the household. Some of these differences could also arise from  sampling variance, as both the NSPY and CPS estimates are based on  samples that are subject to sampling errors.

The response rates achieved for  the first three survey waves\u2014the enrollment waves\u2014were generally  similar.

Follow-up  required that respondents be tracked over time and across places, as  persons enrolled in the sample could move, and their eligibility for a  follow-up interview had to be determined. For example, youth who turned  19 years of age between survey rounds would no longer be eligible for  reinterview, as they were beyond the target age of the campaign. Efforts to  track individuals prior to the second survey round included verifying  address change information with the U.S. Postal Service and obtaining  location information from a national database company. Westat obtained  updated location information from these sources, and telephone  interviewers placed calls to these households to verify the identity of  respondents. According to Westat, a high proportion of the households  that moved were contacted and respondents verified their new addresses.  During the third and fourth survey rounds, Westat used procedures to  track and verify addresses that were similar to those used to track  respondents from the first to second survey rounds, although Westat  modified these procedures as necessary. The key eligibility requirement  for youth for a follow-up interview was the youth had to be 18 years of age  or younger at the time of the interview.", "For the first follow-up round\u2014waves 4 and 5\u2014Westat located individuals  and determined eligibility for 92 percent of the youth and 92 percent of the  parents who completed an initial interview during the first round of the  survey\u2014that is, in waves 1, 2, and 3, and of these youth who were still  eligible, 94 percent completed an interview. Among parents from the first  round who were tracked and determined to be eligible in the second  round, 92 percent completed a second round interview.

Nonrespondents were compared to respondents  on gender, age at interview, whether both parents were in the household,  the number of youth in the household, the type of household dwelling, and  the type of area in which the household was located. For example, apart  from the three differences below, nonrespondents and respondents were  similar in characteristics across survey waves: In the three enrollment  waves, nonrespondents were proportionately older youth than  respondents; in waves 2 and 3, there were proportionately more youth  living in cities among nonrespondents than respondents; and in wave 1,  there were proportionately more youth in the building permit sample  among nonrespondents than respondents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Sampling Methodologies between NSPY and MTF", "paragraphs": ["Westat compared estimates of drug-use prevalence from the NSPY data  with those obtained from other national surveys such as Monitoring the  Future (MTF).

Specifically, MTF showed a  decline in marijuana use for some teenage groups during the 2000 to 2002  period, while the NSPY showed the increases reported above. However,  the difference in drug use rates reported from the two surveys could  plausibly arise from differences in the sampling frames. The MTF sampling  frame covers only youth who are in school and not those who drop out of  school, who are truant on the survey day, or who are 17- and 18-year-olds  who have graduated from high school. To the extent that high school  dropouts and truants have more involvement with drugs than those who  stay in school, the MTF estimates of drug use may underrepresent drug  use among all youth of high school age. By comparison, the NSPY  household survey includes youth who are not enrolled in school in its  sampling frame. To the extent that dropping out of high school is  correlated with drug use, and given that dropouts are excluded from the  MTF sampling frame, differences in drug use between MTF and NSPY  could reflect the fact that youth enrolled in high school reported drug use  at different rates from all youth in the general population covered by the  NSPY, which would include dropouts who may be at higher risk of using  drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Capacity of the NSPY to Detect Reasonably Small Effects", "paragraphs": ["One challenge in designing surveys to evaluate changes in outcomes as the  result of an intervention lies in selecting a sample with sufficient power to  detect differences between groups\u2014including the same individuals at two  points in time\u2014or significant associations among variables, such as  between levels of exposure to the campaign and outcomes. Sample size is  a major factor determining a study\u2019s power to detect differences, and  while larger sample sizes will generally allow researchers to detect smaller  differences over time, as the size and power of a sample to detect changes  increases, so too generally does its cost.", "In consultation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Westat  chose to compute power for analyses of annual change in a prevalence  statistic\u2014that is, change in the percentage of a population that reported an  outcome. For purposes of its power analysis, Westat chose to assume  different baseline prevalences for parents and for youth of all ages and to  assume that the study should be able to detect reliably declines of  specified sizes. For example, for youth of all ages, Westat assumed a  baseline prevalence of 10 percent and determined the power of its sample  for detecting a minimum downswing in an outcome\u2014such as past-month  drug use\u2014of 2.3 percentage points over a year. The power of the sample  to detect this difference was well within conventional power criteria.", "As reported above, the sizes of differences that Westat\u2019s sample could  detect were consistent with the Office of National Drug Control Policy\u2019s  (ONDCP) goals for the campaign. In early meetings on the design of the  evaluation of the media campaign, ONDCP officials reported that ONDCP  had a specific Performance Measures of Effectiveness (PME) system and  that the campaign was embodied within the first goal of the National Drug  Strategy, which was to \u201ceducate and enable America\u2019s youth to reject  illegal drugs as well as the use of alcohol and tobacco.\u201d Under this goal,  ONDCP\u2019s PME proposed targets for reducing the prevalence of past-month  use of illicit drugs and alcohol among youth from a 1996 base year: by  2002, reduce this prevalence by 20 percent, and by 2007, reduce it by   50 percent. ONDCP officials further identified specific targets for the  media campaign, again with respect to a base year of 1996: by 2002,  increase to 80 the percentage of youth who perceive that regular use of  illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco is harmful; and by 2002, increase to   95 the percentage of youth who disapprove of illicit drug, alcohol, and  tobacco use. To achieve a goal of 80 percent of youth who perceive that  regular use of marijuana is harmful would require increasing the 1996  baseline percentage of youth perceiving marijuana as harmful from   60 percent, as measured by MTF, or by about 3.3 percentage points per  year from 1996 to 2002. Westat\u2019s sample had sufficient power to detect this  amount of annual change in youth attitudes.", "The power of the NSPY to detect changes in outcomes due to exposure to  the campaign also presumes that it was possible to accurately measure  and characterize exposure to the campaign by the reported number of  advertisements recalled by respondents. While the general question of  how exposure to advertisements affected respondents was beyond the  scope of the evaluation, if by exposure is meant a recognition-based  task\u2014or encoded exposure\u2014then the NSPY measures of exposure can be  viewed as valid. According to communications researchers, often what is  of interest to campaign planners and evaluators is whether the  presentation of campaign content generates at least a memory trace in  individuals. At this point, a potential audience member can be said to have  engaged the campaign\u2019s presentation in a meaningful sense, and this is  what is meant by encoded exposure. To measure exposure to the  campaign for both youth and parents, NSPY interviewers asked  respondents about their recall of specific current or very recent television  and radio advertisements.", "There was variation in recall of advertisements by both youth and parent  respondents, and this type of variation is needed in order to examine  associations between levels of exposure and outcomes. For example, for  the entire campaign, youth reported a median of 12 exposures per month,  and 76.7 percent reported 4 or more exposures per month. Comparatively  few youth\u2014about 6 percent\u2014reported less than 1 exposure per month.  Youth recall of specific exposure also varied, as 41.2 percent of youth  reported 12 or more television exposures per month throughout the  campaign while reporting a median of 4.4 exposures to television  advertisements. Additionally, Westat\u2019s measures of exposure and  outcomes have demonstrated sensitivity to detect favorable campaign  effects among parents.", "Westat\u2019s test for associations between exposure and outcomes\u2014the  gamma coefficient\u2014was an ordinal test statistic for whether two variables  (e.g., exposure and marijuana use initiation) have a montonic, but not  necessarily a linear, relationship. Therefore, were there nonlinear  relationships, its test would have allowed for them. Finally, nonrandom  measurement error in the measure of exposure is unlikely to have biased  estimates of campaign effects, as if the nonrandom measurement error  were constant, it would not affect measures of association, and if it was  not constant, it would be addressed by Westat\u2019s statistical methods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Westat Methods to Measure Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Westat measured a variety of outcomes for youth and parents and took  steps to ensure that the measures were consistent with existing research.

The youth question domains included exposure propensity to  media; current and past use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, inhalants, and  Ecstasy; past discussions with and communication of anti-drug messages  from parents and friends; expectations of others about respondent\u2019s drug  use; knowledge and beliefs about the positive and negative consequences  of drug use; exposure to campaign messages; family and peer factors;  personal factors; and demographic information. Westat used two separate  questionnaires for youth of different ages; one questionnaire was used for  children (aged 9 to 11) and another one was used for teens (aged 12 to 18).", "The NSPY parent questionnaire also included numerous questions that  were intended to measure parents\u2019 exposure to the campaign\u2019s messages  and other anti-drug messages. The question domains for parents included  media consumption; past discussions with child about drug attitudes and  avoidance strategies; past child monitoring behaviors; self-efficacy of  discussing drugs with child and monitoring of child\u2019s actions; belief that  the child is at risk of drug use; belief that drug use has bad consequences;  exposure to the campaign\u2019s advertising, including brand recognition;  parent\u2019s own current and past use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs; and  demographic information.", "Westat followed generally accepted procedures in developing the survey  instruments for the NSPY by using information from a prototype prepared  by NIDA and using information from other surveys that addressed youth  drug use and prevention. Prior to the phase III evaluation, and in  preparation for the NSPY, NIDA convened an expert panel to assist in the  development of the youth and parent questionnaires. The panel, which  consisted of experts in adolescent drug use prevention and parenting  behaviors, drafted NSPY survey questionnaires for children, teens, and  parents, and NIDA shared these prototypes with Westat at the beginning of  Westat\u2019s evaluation contract. In developing the final questionnaire for the  NSPY, Westat created a questionnaire development team consisting of  evaluation experts. In developing the final NSPY questionnaires, the  Westat team reviewed NIDA\u2019s prototype and other surveys.", "Westat measured youth drug use by self-reported data on use. We have  previously cautioned about limitations associated with self-reported data  on youth drug use. Additionally, the National Research Council (NRC) of  the National Academy of Sciences also has pointed out limitations  associated with self-reported drug use in national surveys such as the  National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and MTF. As NRC has  pointed out, while self-reported data on drug use may have limitations for  estimating the actual levels of use at a particular point in time, they may  not suffer from these same limitations when they are used to assess  changes in use over time, unless there is reason to believe that attitudes  about drug use change in ways that affect respondents\u2019 willingness to  honestly report drug use, or stigma.", "Specifically, if there is a stigma associated with self-reporting drug use,  that stigma may affect the levels of use reported, as some have argued that  the propensity of respondents to give valid responses may be affected by  social pressures. In particular, the incentive to give false negative reports  may increase over time if drug use becomes increasingly perceived as  harmful or socially unacceptable. Using data from NSDUH and MTF, NRC  showed an inverse relationship between the percentages of respondents  who either disapproved of illegal drug consumption or perceived it to be  harmful. Thus, as stigma increased, self-reported drug use decreased. As  NRC cautioned, one could interpret this relationship as indicating that  changes in stigma are associated with changes in invalid reporting, or as  stigma increases, false negative reports increase, rather than necessarily  indicating that as stigma increases, drug use decreases.", "The NRC analysis leads to two inferences: First, if social stigma remains  constant over time, changes in the propensity to give valid responses  would be unaffected and estimates of change in self-reported drug use  would not be biased by social stigma. For the evaluation results, this  would imply that its measures of changes in self-reported drug use would  provide valid measures of changes in use, so long as factors other than  stigma did not affect the propensity to self-report use. Second, if the social  stigma associated with reporting drug use is inversely related to  disapproval of illicit drug use or increased perceptions that it is harmful,  then the estimates of self-reported drug use are likely to decrease as a  result of the stigma. According to results from the evaluation, trends in  youth attitudes and beliefs about illicit drugs changed significantly over  the entire campaign in a direction that was favorable to the campaign.  Specifically, the trends in youth attitudes and beliefs about illicit drug use  meant that youth were more likely to believe, as the campaign went on,  that use of illicit drugs was likely to have negative consequences.  Alternatively, the social stigma associated with drug use increased over  time. If the relationship between stigma and reporting that NRC found  held and applied to the data in the evaluation of the campaign, this would  imply that the increased stigma associated with drug use would lead to  decreases in self-reports of drug use over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Westat\u2019s Analytic Methods", "paragraphs": ["To control for the many factors that could have influenced both exposure  and outcomes independently of, or in conjunction with, the campaign,  Westat used propensity scoring methods to match individuals based on  numerous measured attributes and to create groups of individuals who  differed on their underlying propensity to be exposed to different levels of  campaign advertisements. A propensity score is a weighted sum of the  individual effects of variables in a model that predicts the likelihood of  exposure to campaign messages. Westat\u2019s propensity scoring methods  resulted in the creation of groups of individuals who were statistically  similar on exposure propensities. These groups can be considered as  statistical analogues to randomly assigning individuals to different levels  of exposure. After creating these groups, Westat then analyzed outcomes  between the groups having different propensities to be exposed to  campaign messages.", "Westat used ordinal logit models to estimate the chances of being  exposed, where exposure was measured alternatively as a three- or four- level variable\u2014e.g., low, medium, or high exposure. Westat used a myriad  of variables to predict exposure levels in both the youth and parent  models. For example, in the youth models, the propensity score models  included measures of demographic attributes, educational attainment and  educational aspiration, family and parent background, parent consumption  of television and other media, income and employment, reading habits,  Internet usage, location of residence in urban areas, among other  variables. After estimating models, Westat also assessed the balance of  variables in its propensity models. For propensity models to remove the  effects of confounding variables from the association between exposure  and response, it is necessary that the population means of the confounder  variables not vary across exposure levels. If a confounder is successfully  balanced, then it will have the same theoretical effect across all exposure  levels.", "The net result of the propensity scoring models is to provide each  individual with a score that reflects the individual\u2019s propensity to recall  advertisements based upon a weighted sum of all of the variables in the  model. Therefore, while two individuals may differ on the likelihood that a  particular variable affects their chances of being exposed to messages or  on their levels of a certain variable\u2014such as age or education\u2014they could  be similar in their overall propensity to be exposed to campaign messages  if the differential effects of any individual variables sum to the same total  propensity.", "In order for the results of propensity methods to be valid, it is important  that the propensity scoring models include all relevant variables that could  otherwise explain differences in both exposure and outcomes. Propensity  score models can adjust only for confounding variables that are observed  and measured. In other words, they are built upon the assumption that all  relevant variables are measured and controlled for. If an important  variable is omitted from the propensity model, the results of analyses may  be affected. Westat made reasonable attempts to identify and control for a  variety of confounding variables, include them in its models, and reduce  bias."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Office of National Drug Control Policy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, contributors to this report  included David P.
