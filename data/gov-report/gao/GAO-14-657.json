In 2014, for both those exchanges serving the individual market and those serving the small-group market, in more than two-thirds of states the issuer with the largest share of the 2012 market participated in the 2014 exchange. In addition, in most states, other larger issuers with a 5 percent or more share of the 2012 market participated in the 2014 exchanges. Most smaller issuers with less than 5 percent of the 2012 market did not participate in the 2014 exchanges, although in many states more than one of these smaller issuers did participate. In addition, some issuers that participated in a 2014 individual or small-business exchange had not offered coverage in the respective 2012 market, although they may have offered coverage in other markets within the same state.

Specifically, it directed states to establish exchanges for  individuals and small businesses by January 1, 2014. In states electing  not to establish and operate either type of exchange, PPACA required the  federal government to establish and operate the exchange. For 2014,  about one-third of the states chose to operate their individual and small- business exchanges, known as state-based exchanges. Specifically, in  17 states, the state chose to operate both the individual exchange and  the small-business exchange, known as the Small Business Health  Options Program, or SHOP. In 32 states, the federal government  operated both the individual and small-business exchanges, known as  federally facilitated exchanges. In the remaining 2 states, the individual  exchange was federally facilitated, while the small-business exchange  was state-based. (See fig. 1.)", "All individual and small-business health plans, whether offered through an  exchange or outside of an exchange, must comply with new insurance  market reforms enacted under PPACA. These include, for example, a  requirement to cover certain categories of benefits at standardized levels  of coverage, which are categorized by \u201cmetal level\u201d as catastrophic,  bronze, silver, gold, or platinum, depending on the portion of health care  costs expected to be paid by the health plan. They also include  prohibitions on annual and lifetime limits on the dollar value of required  benefits and on the denial of coverage or charging of higher premiums  due to preexisting conditions. Some of these reforms were in effect in  2012, while others did not take effect until 2014.", "To be certified to offer coverage through an exchange, issuers must meet  additional requirements, including offering a minimum of one silver and  one gold plan in any area in which it participates in an exchange.  Catastrophic plans may be offered only in the individual exchanges, and  not on the small-business exchanges, and may be offered only to certain  individuals. Issuers can offer plans statewide or within different  geographic regions, typically defined by rating areas. States could define  their rating areas using counties, Metropolitan Statistical Areas,codes, or a combination of those options.", "PPACA also requires that the federal government establish multi-state  plans to be offered through each of the individual and small-business  exchanges. Specifically, multi-state plans are those that issuers offer  under a contract with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  PPACA requires the contracted issuers to offer at least two multi-state  plans through each exchange and requires that at least one of the issuers  with which OPM contracts be not-for-profit. Issuers of multi-state plans  are allowed to phase in coverage, but must offer coverage in 60 percent  of states in the first contract year and in all states by the third contract  year. During the first two contract years, OPM indicated that it would not  direct issuers to participate in particular states. For 2014, OPM entered  into a contract with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to offer  coverage in 31 states through the individual and small-business  exchanges.", "PPACA also established a program to foster the creation of consumer- governed, not-for-profit issuers of health coverage\u2014referred to as  Consumer Oriented and Operated Plans (CO-OP)\u2014that would provide  additional coverage options in the individual and small-business  exchanges. As required by PPACA, CMS established a loan program  through which qualified not-for-profit issuers could apply for federal  funding to help cover startup costs associated with establishing a CO-OP  and to help meet states\u2019 solvency and reserve requirements for licensure.  A CO-OP issuer may operate within specific areas of a state, statewide,  or in multiple states. For 2014, 22 CO-OPs receiving federal loans  offered coverage through the exchanges.", "The federal government and states instituted other provisions that relate  to issuer participation in the exchanges. For example, for federally  facilitated exchanges, CMS requires that issuers with more than   20 percent market share in the small-group market participate in the  small-business exchange as a condition of participation in the individual   In adopting this requirement, CMS indicated that the purpose  exchange. of this requirement is to promote robust participation in the small-business  exchanges and expand plan choice.operated their own exchanges enacted statutory, regulatory, or other  requirements governing issuer participation in exchanges. Seven states   In addition, some states that  reported requiring issuers participating in exchanges to offer a minimum  number of health plans, while four states set maximum limits. Three  states also reported requiring participation in individual and small- business exchanges. For example, in Maryland, certain issuers that  offered plans outside of the exchanges were also required to offer plans  through the exchange. Further, four states reported establishing waiting  periods related to exchange participation in future plan years for issuers  that chose not to participate in the 2014 exchange. For example,  Connecticut prohibited an issuer from re-entering the exchange for   2 years if the issuer voluntarily ceased to participate in the exchange.

The number of  such issuers in each individual exchange ranged from 1 to 11, for a  nationwide total of 99 (out of the 291 total issuers that participated in the  individual exchanges). Of these, 23 were newly established through the  federally funded CO-OP program. Some of the other issuers, however,  had previously provided coverage in other markets. For example, in Iowa,  we identified 3 issuers that were new to the 2014 individual market. While  one of these was a newly established CO-OP, the other two had  previously participated in the small-group market in that state. There were  also several new issuers that had previously issued coverage in the  Medicaid managed care market.
