The DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan requires project managers to submit a final report when a project is complete, and submit a follow-on report within two years after the military department implements the technology. As of November 2012, GAO found that project managers had not submitted final reports for 50 of the 80 projects (63 percent) funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2010. Also, project managers had not submitted follow-on reports for 15 of the 41 projects (37 percent) funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2007. GAO found that the Corrosion Office\u0092s tracking system lacks key information to help ensure that project managers meet reporting requirements. Furthermore, the Corrosion Office is not fully exercising its authority to identify and implement options or incentives to address funding and other reasons given for not meeting reporting milestones. Also, GAO found inconsistency among the military departments\u0092 Corrosion Control and Prevention Executives\u0092 (Corrosion Executives) in holding project managers accountable for submitting the required reports.

GAO found that the Corrosion Office\u0092s records showed updates to the initial estimates for the proposed projects, but the office has not consistently updated its records to show the reassessed estimates included in the follow-on reports. Specifically, GAO found that the Corrosion Office did not update data in its records for 5 of 25 projects (20 percent) with completed follow-on reports. Federal internal control standards require agencies to use internal controls to provide assurance that they have reliable financial and other reports for internal and external use. Without accurate and timely data, Congress and DOD managers may not have reliable information on the estimated return on investment as they oversee corrosion projects.", "DOD\u0092s Corrosion Executives use mechanisms, such as briefings and site visits, to collect and disseminate information on corrosion-control activities in their departments; however, GAO found that slightly more than half of public works officials interviewed at 32 installations were unaware of DOD\u0092s corrosion-related offices and resources. Under federal statute, Corrosion Executives are tasked with coordinating corrosion activities in their departments. GAO found that many relevant service officials interviewed did not receive key corrosion-control information because their Corrosion Executives do not have targeted communication strategies and accompanying action plans.

We also provide information on the results of the Corrosion  Office-sponsored cost-of-corrosion studies of DOD facilities and other  infrastructure (see app. I).", "To address our first objective, we obtained project information on 80  infrastructure-related corrosion projects proposed by the military  departments and approved for funding by the Corrosion Office for fiscal  years 2005 through 2010. We reviewed project documentation\u2014project plans, bimonthly or quarterly status reports, final project reports, and  project follow-on reports\u2014to determine if reports were submitted and the  data met the Corrosion Office\u2019s reporting requirements. To assess the  reliability of the data, we met with Corrosion Office officials to identify the  process by which DOD generated and tracked project data, and we  reviewed the documents for any missing data, outliers, or other errors.  If the military departments did not provide the required information, we  interviewed the Corrosion Executives and the military departments\u2019  research and development officials (project managers)\u2014who were the  principal authors and points of contact for the facilities and other  infrastructure projects\u2014to determine their rationale for not completing the  required reports. According to the DOD Corrosion Prevention and  Mitigation Strategic Plan, a final report must be submitted when each  demonstration project is completed. According to Corrosion Office  officials, each demonstration project typically is completed within two  years after the receipt of funding. For the purposes of our work in  reviewing projects funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2010, we  considered a final report to be submitted if the Corrosion Office had a  copy of the report in its records system. We did not consider the  timeliness of the submitted reports. Additionally, the DOD strategic plan  requires that follow-on reports be submitted for completed projects within  two years after the projects have been completed and transitioned to use  within the military departments According to Corrosion Office officials, the  transition period to implement the demonstrated technology in a military  department can be up to one year. As a result, for follow-on reports, we  could assess only the projects funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2007  (41 of the 80 projects). For completed projects, we documented the initial  return-on-investment estimates shown in the project plans and the  resulting change, if any, shown in the follow-on reports. We determined  that the project reporting data was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  determining the extent to which the military departments met the  Corrosion Office\u2019s reporting requirements, but we did not determine the  timeliness of the reports or assess elements of reports.", "The DOD strategic plan uses the phrase \u201creturn-on-investment validation\u201d  to describe how project managers recompute the return-on-investment  estimate included in a project\u2019s follow-on report.

When we found inconsistencies between the return-on-investment  estimates in the project plans and the Corrosion Office\u2019s records, we  asked the Corrosion Office to explain the inconsistencies and provide  additional information to help reconcile the differences in the estimates.  Further, we compared the return-on-investment estimates maintained in  the Corrosion Office\u2019s records for projects funded in fiscal years 2005  through 2007 with the return-on-investment estimates contained in the  military departments\u2019 follow-on reports to check for any differences  between the two sets of records.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed related guidance, documents,  policies, and procedures regarding the management of DOD\u2019s corrosion  prevention and mitigation program.

We selected a nonprobability sample of  32 installations; conducted site visits with 6 of these 32 military  installations and completed semistructured interviews via conference  calls with the other 26 military installations to collect information and  views from facility and infrastructure management officials about their  corrosion management efforts. In selecting the 32 installations for our  nonprobability sample, we limited the installations for selection to those  active-duty installations with at least 25 buildings owned by the federal  government and ensured a range of locations were selected from each of  the four military services and across the geographic regions of the United  States. Our selection criteria also included the selection of installations  with different environmental conditions, some joint bases, and  installations that participated in the Corrosion Office\u2019s corrosion  technologies demonstration projects.

The Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government require federal managers to establish internal  control activities, such as controls over information processing,  segregation of duties, and accurate and timely recording of transactions  and events\u2014including pertinent information to determine whether they  are meeting their goals\u2014to help ensure that management\u2019s directives are  carried out and managers achieve desired results through effective  stewardship of public resources.", "Specifically, the Corrosion Office employs a contractor to maintain  electronic records about all corrosion projects. Corrosion Office officials  stated that project managers submit copies of their reports to the  Corrosion Office and to the respective Corrosion Executive. On a monthly  basis, the contractor checks each project\u2019s records to determine if the  project managers have submitted the required reports. If a project  manager has not submitted a required report, the contractor notifies the  Corrosion Office and that office contacts the relevant project manager  and that manager\u2019s Corrosion Executive. At that point, a Corrosion Office  official encourages project managers to submit the report as soon as  possible, but the Corrosion Office does not record a reason for late  reporting and does not set a new reporting deadline. Also, the Corrosion  Office officials stated that they elevate discussions about late filers in the  three forums held each year that include meetings between Corrosion  Office officials and Corrosion Executives. However, the Corrosion Office\u2019s  tracking system does not require that the project managers include  certain information, such as stating reasons for missing a reporting  deadline and identifying a revised deadline for submitting their reports.  Additionally, the format developed by the Corrosion Office for completing  the follow-on reports does not include a data field that would document  when the project managers submitted their follow-on reports to the office.  By not adopting an enhanced tracking system that includes revised  deadlines, among other things, the Corrosion Office is unable to  effectively monitor whether project managers are working toward new  timeframes to complete overdue reports. Without effective tracking, the  Corrosion Office will allow a number of project managers to continue the  practice of not submitting the required reports and project managers will  not fully inform decision makers of the latest outcomes of the corrosion- control projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrosion Office Uses Routine Communication Methods to Encourage Project Management Offices to Submit Required Reports, but Has Not Employed Other Options", "paragraphs": ["Section 2228 of Title 10 of the United States Code requires the Secretary  of Defense to develop and implement a long-term corrosion strategy that  should include, among other things, implementation of programs to  ensure a focused and coordinated approach to collect, review, validate,  and distribute information on proven corrosion prevention methods and  products. In response to this requirement, the Corrosion Office oversees  corrosion projects and uses routine communication methods and follow- up to encourage the project management offices to submit the required  reports, but the office is not employing other options that would hold  project management offices accountable for reporting milestones. For  example, Corrosion Office officials stated that they have initiated  telephone conversations and e-mails to project managers to reemphasize  reporting requirements and have had limited success in obtaining some of  the outstanding reports. However, there are other options beyond routine  communications that the Corrosion Office could take to make project  managers accountable for submitting timely reports, such as using  funding incentives or changing evaluation criteria for project selection.  Corrosion Office officials told us that they considered holding back  funding for future projects from project management organizations that  missed reporting deadlines, but they chose not to implement this action  because it could delay progress in addressing corrosion control within the  department. Although the Corrosion Office in 2011 offered the military  departments additional funding to complete and submit follow-on reports,  Corrosion Office officials stated that they would not set aside a portion of  its annual funds in the future to assist project management offices in the  completion of outstanding reports due to uncertainty in annual funding.", "Further, a senior Corrosion Office official stated that the office has  considered but not adopted criteria for new projects that would include a  project management office\u2019s past reporting performance as an indicator  for assessing corrosion project plans. DOD\u2019s strategic plan refers to  factors that are used by the evaluation panel to assess project plans and  determine which to approve and fund. The evaluation factors, among  other things, include whether the proposed project can be completed  within a two-year timeframe, the risk associated with the project, and the  estimated return on investment. The senior Corrosion Office official told  us that the office has considered including a factor that would assess a  project management office\u2019s history of reporting performance as a  criterion for deciding whether to approve and fund the office\u2019s future  projects; however, the office decided not to do so. The official stated that  a successful project is one that reduces the impact of corrosion on  weapon systems and/or infrastructure, and a project\u2019s report in and of  itself does not contribute to the success of the project. However, late  submissions of reports could delay communication of project outcomes as  planners are considering funding new projects, as well as limit key  information that should be included in the annual corrosion-control budget  report to Congress. The Corrosion Office has not implemented other  options to better ensure that project managers consistently submit  required reports. Internal control standards emphasize the importance of  performance-based management to ensure program effectiveness,  efficiency, and good stewardship of government resources. Without using  its existing authorities for oversight and coordination to identify and  implement possible options or incentives for addressing the various  funding, personnel, or other reasons cited by project management offices  for not meeting reporting milestones, the Corrosion Office may be missing  opportunities to effectively reduce the number of outstanding reports,  enforce requirements, and ensure that the valuable information in past  projects is known and appropriately documented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrosion Executives Have Not Taken Consistent Actions to Ensure Timely Submission of Required Reports", "paragraphs": ["The three military departments\u2019 Corrosion Executives work with project  managers for the infrastructure-related corrosion projects to ensure that  the reporting requirements are being met; however, they have not taken  effective actions to ensure that all project managers submit their required  reports on a timely basis.

During our discussions with the military departments\u2019  Corrosion Executives, we found that each executive varied in describing  the extent of his work with corrosion project managers to ensure that the  required reports are completed. For example, officials within the office of  the Army\u2019s Corrosion Executive told us that they are involved in all  aspects of the corrosion demonstration project and receive updates and  reports from the Army\u2019s project managers. Also, these officials stated that  they are in the process of developing additional policy on facilities and  other infrastructure to improve the corrosion project process and provide  an Army funding mechanism to cover costs of reporting after expiration of  initial project funding. However, for the infrastructure-related corrosion  projects, the other two military departments have not been as involved as  the Army in ensuring that project managers submit required reports. For  example, the Air Force\u2019s Corrosion Executive stated that he coordinates  with the Corrosion Office to track outstanding reports and can task the  project managers to complete the required reports by going through the  appropriate chain of command. Also, the Navy\u2019s Corrosion Executive told  us that he maintains a level of awareness on the status of projects\u2019  reports, but does not play an active role in the submission of project  reports because project managers have the responsibility to submit  reports to the Corrosion Office.", "DOD\u2019s strategic plan and instruction assign specific responsibilities to the  Corrosion Executives; however, these documents do not clearly define a  role for the Corrosion Executives in ensuring that all project managers  submit mandatory reports.

The  Corrosion Office provided reasons for correcting data. Specifically,  according to the Corrosion Office officials, there were two main reasons  for these differences:(1) funding-level changes between the estimate  included in initial project plan and funding provided when the project was  approved; and (2) incorrect computations of the estimated returns on  investment by the project managers that required the Corrosion Office to  recalculate the estimate to ensure consistency and accuracy. However,  when comparing the reassessed return-on-investment estimates included  in the projects\u2019 follow-on reports with the reassessed estimates in the  Corrosion Office\u2019s records, we found that the Corrosion Office had not  updated all of its records with the return-on-investment estimates from the  follow-on reports. Specifically, we found that for 5 of 25 projects  (20 percent) funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2007, the Corrosion  Office had not updated its records to reflect the reassessed return-on- investment estimates included in the projects\u2019 follow-on reports. The  return-on-investment estimates for these 5 projects were from outdated  sources, such as project plans and final reports.

Additionally, the officials explained that  they communicate key information on corrosion of Army facilities and  other infrastructure through the relevant Army offices in the chain of  command for installations, using data calls. However, one Corrosion  Executive official stated that the Army does not have a formal process to  communicate directly to officials in the field about lessons learned or best  practices for addressing corrosion of facilities and other infrastructure.

These studies are  conducted by LMI using a method approved by the Corrosion Office\u2019s  Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team. According to  LMI, its estimation methodology includes construction costs and actual  maintenance expenditures for sustainment, restoration, and  modernization that are known or can be identified, and focuses on  tangible, direct material and labor costs as well as some indirect costs,  such as research and development and training. In its studies, LMI noted  that although corrosion maintenance costs are a subset of sustainment,  restoration, and modernization costs, the tools and analysis methods  used by planners to estimate sustainment, restoration, and modernization  requirements do not specifically identify corrosion.", "In its first report in May 2007, LMI determined that spending on corrosion  prevention and control for DOD facilities and other infrastructure for fiscal  year 2005 was $1.8 billion.  In its second report in July 2010 report, LMI  found that spending on corrosion at DOD facilities and other infrastructure  decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.6 billion between fiscal years 2005 and  2007, and then increased to $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2008. In its 2010  report, LMI reported that spending on corrosion as a percent of spending  on maintenance dropped from 15.1 percent in fiscal year 2005 to  10.7 percent in fiscal year 2007 and increased to 11.7 percent in fiscal  year 2008.", "Further, in its 2010 report, LMI reported that DOD spent more on  corrosion-related maintenance for facilities and other infrastructure than it  did on corrosion work related to military construction. Specifically, LMI  reported that spending on corrosion for maintenance is three to four times  higher than corrosion spending associated with construction, even though  overall construction expenditures were nearly double that of overall  maintenance expenditures. LMI provided two main reasons for this  occurrence: (1) corrosion is rarely identified as a justification for the  construction of a new facility; and (2) if estimated construction costs need  to be reduced to obtain funding of the project, measures to prevent  corrosion are among the first costs to be removed from the estimated  costs. Additionally, LMI reported that DOD spent almost twice as much on  corrective measures to address corrosion ($1,263 million) as it did on  preventive measures to avoid corrosion ($640 million).", "LMI\u2019s 2010 report shows installations\u2019 estimated expenditures in eight  categories of corrective and preventive maintenance for facilities and  other infrastructure. Table 4 shows information from that 2010 report  about the estimated expenditures for facilities and other infrastructure by  maintenance category for fiscal year 2008.", "In August 2012, LMI began its third study of the cost of corrosion at DOD  facilities and other infrastructure to analyze corrosion-related spending for  fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2011. For this report, the LMI official  told us that the methodology for classifying the environmental conditions  of the installations that are included in their cost-of-corrosion studies  would be the major difference between the 2012 assessment and the  prior reports. LMI also acknowledged that there are some challenges and  limitations to the methodology and data used in its analysis. These  challenges and limitations include, but are not limited to: (1) limited quality  controls in the services\u2019 facilities and other infrastructure work order data  in which approximately 25 percent of the records obtained from the  military services\u2019 maintenance systems could not be used due to missing  key data elements that could not be recreated; (2) the lack of tracking and  maintaining of asset availability data for facilities and other infrastructure;  and (3) the three-year period between the cost of corrosion studies, which  means there will be a significant period before data can be updated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our first objective to determine the extent that project  managers submitted required reports to the DOD Office of Corrosion  Policy and Oversight (hereafter referred to as Corrosion Office), we  reviewed the February 2011 DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation  Strategic Plan and used the reporting milestones outlined in the plan to  identify types of reports required for each project. We obtained project  information for the 80 infrastructure-related corrosion demonstration  projects funded by the Corrosion Office for fiscal years 2005 through  2010. We requested and reviewed the project documentation\u2014 project  plans, bimonthly or quarterly reports, final reports and follow-on reports\u2014 to determine if the data and related reports met the Corrosion Office\u2019s  reporting requirements. We reviewed the corrosion project documentation  for these projects for missing data, outliers, or other errors, and  documented where we found incomplete data and computation errors.  For the purposes of our work in reviewing projects funded in fiscal years  2005 through 2010, we considered a final report to be submitted as  required if the Corrosion Office had a copy of the report in its records  system. We did not consider the timeliness of the submitted reports.  Additionally, for follow-on reports, we could assess only the projects  funded in fiscal years 2005 through 2007 (41 of the 80 projects) because  the DOD strategic plan\u2019s milestone requires that follow-on reports be  submitted for completed projects within two years after the projects have  been completed and transitioned to use within the military departments.  For completed projects, we documented the initial return-on-investment  estimates shown in the project plans and the resulting change, if any,  shown in the follow-on reports. We determined that the project reporting  data was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of determining the extent to  which the military departments met the Corrosion Office\u2019s reporting  requirements, but we did not determine the timeliness of the report or  assess elements of the actual report.", "After identifying the projects that required further review because the  project managers had not completed and submitted the required reports,  we interviewed and obtained documentation from the Corrosion Office,  the military departments\u2019 Corrosion Control and Prevention Executives  (hereafter referred to as Corrosion Executives) and the respective project  managers to determine why the required reports were not submitted at  the prescribed deadlines. Also, we determined what actions, if any, they  planned to take to complete the reports. Specifically, to complete this  task, we met with corrosion-control officials from the following  organizations: the Corrosion Office, Army Corrosion Executive, Navy  Corrosion Executive, Air Force Corrosion Executive, Army Engineering  Research Development Center, Construction Engineering Research  Laboratory, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (Engineering Support  Center), Office of the Air Force Logistics, Installations and Mission  Support, and the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency. We also  reviewed prior GAO work on DOD\u2019s corrosion prevention and control  program.", "To address our second objective to assess the extent to which the return- on-investment data submitted by the military departments is accurately  reflected in records maintained by the Corrosion Office, for the  105 infrastructure-related corrosion demonstration projects funded from  fiscal years 2005 through 2012, we reviewed the return-on-investment  estimates found in the project plans and the return-on-investment  estimates maintained in the Corrosion Office\u2019s records. We then  compared the data from these two sources to determine if any differences  existed in the estimated return on investment. Upon completion of this  comparison, we provided a list of projects with discrepancies in the  estimated return on investment to the Corrosion Office and asked the  officials to explain why the inconsistencies existed and requested that  they provide additional information to reconcile the differences in the two  estimates. Further, we compared the return-on-investment estimates  maintained in the Corrosion Office\u2019s records for projects funded in fiscal  years 2005 through 2007 with the return-on-investment estimates  contained in the military departments\u2019 follow-on reports to check for any  differences between the two sets of records.", "To address our third objective to assess the extent to which DOD\u2019s  corrosion-control officials have fully informed all relevant officials within  each department about efforts to prevent and mitigate corrosion of  facilities and other infrastructure, we reviewed relevant legislation and  guidance, DOD policies and publications, and the DOD and the military  departments\u2019 strategic plans to obtain information on the management of  DOD\u2019s corrosion prevention and control program. In addition, we  interviewed officials at all levels within DOD\u2014Corrosion Office officials,  Corrosion Executives, the military services\u2019 management commands for  installations, and facility and infrastructure managers within the  services\u2014to discuss their corrosion prevention and control efforts,  including challenges and successes in implementing new corrosion  technologies. We interviewed officials across each of the military services  and reviewed relevant service documentation to gather information about  corrosion prevention and control programs within the services. We spoke  with each military department\u2019s designated Corrosion Executive as well  as officials in the Corrosion Executives\u2019 offices to discuss corrosion  control and prevention activities for facilities and other infrastructure  across the departments. We also interviewed officials from the installation  management commands of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, including  the Office of the Army Chief of Staff for Installations Management, the  U.S. Army Installations Management Command, the Commander of Navy  Installations Command, and the U. S. Marine Corps Installations  Command. We also interviewed officials within the civil engineering or  facilities branches at two Air Force major commands\u2014Air Mobility  Command and Air Combat Command. We reviewed relevant service  documentation, including each military department\u2019s strategic plan for  corrosion control and prevention, to identify efforts related to facilities and  other infrastructure. During our review, we also met with the manager of a  Defense Logistics Agency program for cathodic protection and corrosion  control of submerged or underground steel structures. Other defense  agencies were not evaluated as part of our work.", "We used data obtained from Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Installations and Environment to identify all DOD facilities and  other infrastructure by military service and geographic location. Using a  nonprobability sample, we limited the installations for selection to those  active-duty installations with at least 25 buildings owned by the federal  government and ensured that a range of locations were selected from  each of the four military services and across geographic regions of the  United States. From the 390 installations that met these criteria, we   some joint  selected installations with different environmental conditions,military installations, and installations that did or did not participate in the  Corrosion Office\u2019s corrosion-technology demonstration projects. We  determined that the data used to select the installations for our review  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of selecting our nonprobability  sample.", "From April to October 2012, we conducted semistructured interviews with  management officials of facilities and other infrastructure from 32 DOD  installations to gather information and views about their corrosion control  and management efforts.  Figure 3 identifies the 32 selected installations  where GAO interviewed officials for this review. The purpose of the  semistructured interviews was to understand how the installation officials  (1) use policies, plans, and procedures to identify and address corrosion;  (2) address corrosion prevention and mitigation; (3) determine their  maintenance and sustainment priorities; and (4) receive and disseminate  information on relevant corrosion topics. We visited and interviewed   and conducted audio  officials at 6 of the 32 military installations,conference calls with officials at 26 of the 32 military installations.  Although our findings from the interviews of officials of the 32 installations  are not generalizable to the entire universe of installations, we feel our  findings provide a range of issues related to corrosion that are  experienced at installations.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 to May 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Returns on Investment for DOD\u2019s Infrastructure-Related Corrosion Technology Demonstration Projects", "paragraphs": ["As defined by DOD for its corrosion technology demonstration projects,  the estimated return on investment is the ratio of the present value of  benefits to the present value of the project\u2019s total cost. In our December  2010 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), in  coordination with the Corrosion Executives, develop and implement a  plan to ensure that return-on-investment reassessments are completed  as scheduled.information on the timeframe and source of funding required to complete  the return-on-investment reassessments. DOD concurred with our  recommendation and stated that plans were underway to address this  requirement. As of July 2012, DOD had not developed or implemented a  formal plan that addresses this requirement.", "Specifically, we recommended that this plan include  During our review, we found that the Corrosion Office required project  managers of 41 projects to submit follow-on reports, and reports were  completed and submitted for 25 of the 41 projects funded for fiscal years  2005 through 2007. Of the 25 follow-on reports, 23 contained return-on- investment estimates. We found that although follow-on reports were  completed and submitted for the remaining 2 projects, return-on- investment estimates were not calculated for the projects because the  respective Army and Navy reports noted that such a calculation was not  required. For the 23 projects that have completed and submitted the  required follow-on reports, Table 5 provides the military departments\u2019  return-on-investment estimates included in the original project plans and  the resulting change, if any, included in the follow-on reports.
