In 2008, Congress made annual CSB meetings a requirement for all of the military departments' major defense acquisition programs. In response to the Senate report accompanying the bill for the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, GAO assessed (1) the extent to which DOD has complied with the statutory requirements for CSBs, and (2) the extent to which CSBs have been effective in controlling requirements and mitigating cost and schedule risks. To conduct this work, GAO surveyed DOD's major defense acquisition programs, reviewed CSB documentation, and interviewed relevant military service and program officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The military departments varied in their compliance with the CSB requirements in statute. The Air Force and Navy did not fully comply with the requirement to hold annual CSB meetings for all major defense acquisition programs in 2010, while the Army did. In total, the military departments held an annual CSB meeting for 74 of 96 major defense acquisition programs they managed in 2010. According to GAO's survey results, when the military departments held CSB meetings, 19 programs endorsed requirements or configuration changes. In most of these cases, strategies were developed to mitigate the effects of these changes--a key provision in the statute and DOD policy. However, key acquisition and requirements personnel were often absent from Air Force and Navy CSB meetings when these issues were discussed. Two major defense acquisition programs--the Ballistic Missile Defense System and the Chemical Demilitarization-Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives programs--are not subject to the CSB provisions in statute because the statute only applies to programs overseen by military departments; the programs are managed by other DOD components. These programs are subject to DOD's CSB policy, which differs from the statute in that it only requires major defense acquisition programs that are in development to hold annual CSB reviews. Individual programs varied in the extent to which they utilized CSBs to control requirements and mitigate cost and schedule risks. According to GAO's survey results, the majority of CSB meetings neither reviewed requirement changes nor discussed options to moderate requirements or reduce the scope of programs. There were a number of specific instances where CSB meetings were effective in mitigating the effect of necessary changes, rejecting other changes, facilitating discussion of requirements, and endorsing \"descoping\" options with the potential to improve or preserve cost or schedule. However, in response to a survey, program officials cast some doubts about the effectiveness of CSBs, and in interviews, acquisition officials indicated that program managers may be reluctant to recommend descoping options due to cultural biases that encourage meeting warfighters' stated needs rather than achieving cost savings, a preference not to elevate decisions to higher levels of review, and concerns that future funding may be cut if potential savings are identified. In response, the Army and Air Force have issued additional descoping guidance and set savings or budget targets. The types of discussions for which CSBs were useful changed based on whether programs were in development or production. Development programs found them more useful to consider requirements changes and descoping options, and production programs found CSBs more useful to prevent changes. In an effort to further increase effectiveness and efficiency of CSBs, some of the military departments have taken steps to coordinate CSB meetings among programs that provide similar capabilities and align CSB meetings with other significant reviews. Among GAO's recommendations for DOD components are that they amend their CSB policies to be consistent with statute and align CSBs with other reviews when possible. In comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred or partially concurred with all seven of GAO's recommendations and agreed to take action to address six of them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) major defense acquisition programs  have historically cost more and taken longer to field capabilities to the  warfighter than initially planned. The total acquisition cost of DOD\u2019s  portfolio of major programs has increased by $135 billion since 2008, and  the average delay in delivering initial capability is now 22 months. We  have previously reported that requirements changes and the inability of  program managers to defer requirements that could not be completed  under existing cost and schedule targets are factors in poor acquisition  program outcomes. To address this issue, the Under Secretary of  Defense (USD) for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L)  introduced Configuration Steering Boards (CSBs) in 2007 to review  requirement and configuration changes that could adversely affect cost  and schedule for major programs in development.

Generally, the principal military deputy acts as chair in the  place of the service acquisition executive and does not attend those  meetings that the service acquisition executive chairs. According to the  attendee lists provided by the Air Force, only 2 of the 18 CSB meetings  held were attended and chaired by the service acquisition executive. At  one of those meetings neither the principal military deputy nor a  representative of the comptroller was in attendance although officials  report that both had been invited. The CSB meetings the service  acquisition executive did not attend included numerous discussions of  changes that could affect programs\u2019 costs and schedules, including  requirements and configuration changes or descoping opportunities.

However,  most of the program officials who held CSB meetings and responded to  our survey reported that CSB meetings were not useful for preventing  changes to requirements or configuration, mitigating the potential effects  on cost and schedule when changes were endorsed, or recommending  ways to improve a program\u2019s cost and schedule by moderating  requirements. In interviews with program officials, some explained that  they did not utilize the CSB meetings to control requirements because  they addressed requirement issues as they arose within the program  rather than waiting for their program\u2019s scheduled CSB meeting to occur.  Others stated that their program was stable and that there were no  requirement changes or descoping options to discuss. According to our  survey results, reviews of CSB documentation, and interviews:  \uf0b7  26 percent of the programs in our survey with CSB meetings reported  that these meetings were useful forums to prevent changes to  requirements. Moreover, 35 percent reported that the meetings were  useful to make necessary changes to requirements. In an interview,  several program officials stated that the mere suggestion of convening  a CSB meeting to discuss a new requirement was enough to deter  changes.  \uf0b7  25 percent of the programs in our survey with CSB meetings reported  that these meetings were useful forums to prevent changes to  technical configuration. Conversely, 23 percent reported that the  meetings were useful to make necessary changes to technical  configurations. Our review of minutes and presentations also show at  least one CSB meeting that rejected a change that had the potential to  adversely affect program cost; the August 2010 CSB review for the  LPD 17 amphibious ship program rejected a proposed configuration  change that would have added new equipment to the ship at an  estimated cost of $26 million.  \uf0b7  Some CSB meetings also included discussions of how to prioritize  requirements. For example, according to officials, the Air Force used a  June 2010 CSB meeting for the Global Hawk\u2014an unmanned  surveillance aircraft\u2014to prioritize joint urgent operational needs.  According to program officials, the Global Hawk program has received  numerous requests to add new capabilities to the platform due to its  use in current operations. The program manager stated that the CSB  meeting provided the opportunity to present the costs and benefits of  those requests to decision makers and receive guidance from them on  which ones to pursue or defer.  \uf0b7  28 percent of the programs in our survey with CSB meetings reported  that these meetings were useful forums to mitigate the potential cost  and schedule effects of changes brought to the CSB for consideration.  Moreover, 18 percent of programs reported CSB meetings were useful  forums to mitigate the potential cost and schedule effects of changes  made as a result of the CSB. The Vertical Take Off and Landing  Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle program used a CSB meeting to  discuss ways to restructure the program in response to cost growth. At  the meeting, the members of the CSB encouraged the program  manager to go beyond his proposals and investigate changes to  program quantities, contract strategy, and operational plans when  restructuring the program, in order to reduce cost.  \uf0b7  CSB meetings seem to have been effective in mitigating the cost and  schedule effects of changes or only endorsing changes that would not  affect costs and schedules. Of the 19 programs in our survey in which  a CSB meeting endorsed changes to requirements or technical  configuration, 1 reported an increase in program cost and 2 reported a  delay in the delivery of an initial operational capability.  \uf0b7  30 percent of programs in our survey with CSB meetings reported that  these meetings were useful forums to offer options to lower costs and  field systems faster. Survey results show that descoping options were  presented for 19 programs and those options were endorsed for 8 of  them. For example, at the December 2009 CSB meeting for the Air  Force\u2019s Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, the program office  recommended adopting the extended range version\u2019s lower reliability  requirement for the baseline missile. The program office stated the  existing baseline requirement, which was 5 percent higher, had the  potential to become a cost driver in testing for the program. The CSB  endorsed the program office\u2019s recommendation.  \uf0b7  Program officials also reported that the exercise of formulating  descoping options, regardless of whether or not they were endorsed,  helped their office identify and develop mitigation strategies in the  event costs increased.", "Table 3 provides examples of programs across the military departments  that used CSB meetings to endorse requirement, configuration, or other  programmatic changes to improve or preserve cost or schedule.", "Program managers may be reluctant to recommend descoping options to  moderate requirements during a CSB meeting because of cultural biases  about the role of a program manager, a preference not to elevate  decisions to higher levels of review, and concerns that future funding will  be cut. According to several acquisition officials, there is a cultural bias  throughout DOD that the role of the program manager is to meet the  requirements handed to them, not to seek to reduce them to achieve cost  savings. In this context, if a program manager recommends reducing  requirements, it may suggest the person is not managing the program or  serving the warfighter well. Still others preferred to reduce requirements  that were within their span of control through their program\u2019s internal  change-management process rather than waiting for a CSB meeting to  ask permission. For example, the DDG-51 program office proposed  changes to the ships\u2019 configuration to reduce cost by removing or  relocating equipment and the CH-53K program avoided cost by relaxing a  requirement for self-sealing fuel tanks.

Table 4 presents our survey results of  program officials\u2019 opinions on the usefulness of CSB meetings.", "Programs in development also proposed changes to requirements or  configuration, presented options for reducing scope, and had those  options endorsed at a higher rate than those in production. Even so, an  official for one program in development stated that its CSB meeting was  not effective because the program was meeting cost and schedule targets  and its requirements were narrowly defined, which decreased  opportunities for reducing scope.", "According to our survey results, a higher percentage of programs in  production reported that CSBs were useful in preventing changes  compared to programs in development. We have previously reported that  stabilizing a program\u2019s requirements and design well before production is  important because changes have increasingly negative effects on cost  and schedule the further a program progresses. Program officials were  wary about using CSB meetings to try to reduce costs for programs in  production either through requirements changes or reductions in scope  because the configuration should be locked, the available trade space is  probably limited, and potential changes could be disruptive. For instance,  the E-2D program reported in its April 2010 CSB meeting that its  configuration was extremely stable and, with development and  demonstration almost complete, reducing the scope of the programs  could prove detrimental because it could lead to redesigns or decreases  in capability. Changes at this stage of a program can still have a positive  effect on cost if they do not require extensive design changes. For  example, the program manager for the Family of Medium Tactical  Vehicles\u2014which is well into production with over 40,000 vehicles  fielded\u2014recommended removing the self-recovery winch from some  vehicles, resulting in savings of $9,535 per vehicle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broad Senior Level Participation in CSB Meetings Facilitates Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["CSBs provide a unique opportunity for program managers to address  programmatic issues in front of a broad group of high-level decision  makers that includes the acquisition, requirements, and funding  communities. In some cases, the makeup of the CSB helped to  accelerate the resolution of issues and facilitate decision making. For  example, the Grey Eagle program utilized its CSB meeting to endorse an  increase in the number of active units from 13 to 17. The program office  reported that this decision, which otherwise may have taken years to  approve and fund, was made and implemented quickly by the CSB  because of the senior leadership present. Other program offices stated  that the broad membership on CSBs, which includes key stakeholders  and other interested parties, helps to create institutional buy-in for  programmatic changes. CSB meetings also raised stakeholders\u2019  awareness of cost increases. Specifically, CSB meetings provided the  Joint Staff with its first knowledge of cost growth on at least four programs  and triggered separate reviews by the Joint Requirements Oversight  Council.", "When critical stakeholders are absent, the decision-making ability of the  CSB may be limited. In particular, some programs with users from across  the military services and organizations external to DOD reported that the  utility of CSBs was limited when those users were not represented. For  example, the primary users of the Air Force\u2019s Global Positioning System  IIIA program include the Army, Navy, and other organizations external to  DOD. The September 2010 CSB meeting for the system did not include  these stakeholders, and program officials stated that as a result, the CSB  was not empowered to make significant changes to the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aligning CSB Meetings with Other Reviews May Increase Effectiveness and Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["The decisions made at CSB meetings can affect complementary  programs, as well as the funding required for programs. As a result,  acquisition and program officials told us there is value in aligning CSB  meetings so they are held together with reviews of similar programs or  sequencing them to occur before key funding decisions are made. For  example, in 2010, the Army grouped programs into capability portfolios,  such as aviation or precision fires capabilities, and held one CSB meeting  to discuss requirement changes and descoping options for all the  programs. These CSB meetings generally occurred after the Army\u2019s  capability portfolio reviews\u2014which revalidate, modify, or terminate  requirements and ensure the proper allocation of funds across  programs\u2014and reviewed, endorsed, and implemented the  recommendations coming from them. Holding CSB meetings for  capability portfolios can facilitate discussions about interoperability and  interdependency and promote an examination of requirements and  capabilities across programs, including potential redundancies. Officials  also stated that if two well-executed, high-performing programs within the  same portfolio were reviewed independently, those discussions might not  take place. For example, the Army\u2019s Excalibur\u2014a precision-guided  munition\u2014and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System were both  relatively stable programs in production. However, according to officials,  during a capability portfolio review, the Army identified an overlap in the  two programs\u2019 capabilities and missions and recommended reducing the  number of Excalibur munitions to be procured. At the subsequent April  2010 CSB meeting, the Army reviewed and implemented the proposal,  which reduced the cost of the Excalibur program by $893.5 million.  According to acquisition officials, grouping programs in this manner can  also ease the difficulty of scheduling a large number of meetings that  require senior leadership participation.", "According to program officials, when CSB meetings were aligned with  budget deliberations, it enabled an informed discussion of funding issues  and rapid changes to program budgets. USD (AT&L)\u2019s 2007  memorandum establishing CSBs stressed the importance of making  necessary budget adjustments, especially those involving expected  increases in program costs, at the earliest opportunity. In one example,  the Army\u2019s November 2009 CSB for the Patriot and Medium Extended Air  Defense System programs corresponded with the service\u2019s fiscal-year- 2011 budget-formulation process. Program officials stated that this helped  facilitate the transfer of funds and efforts among the two programs, which  had been endorsed by senior leaders from the acquisition and funding  communities at the CSB. However, it may be functionally challenging to  align CSB meetings with the budget formulation process in all cases, as  CSB meetings in some cases must be event driven while the budget  process is calendar driven."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the prospect of slowly growing or flat defense budgets for years to  come, DOD must get better returns on its weapon system investments  than it has in the past. CSBs, which are intended to ensure that a  program delivers as much planned capability as possible at or below the  expected cost, can be a key tool in furthering this goal. They represent a  unique forum that brings together a broad range of high-level decision  makers from the acquisition, requirements, and funding communities, who  can make and implement decisions quickly.", "DOD\u2019s experience with CSBs to date has already demonstrated their  potential value\u2014costly new requirements have been rejected, and  options to moderate requirements and reduce program costs by millions  of dollars have been endorsed. However, the efficiency and effectiveness  of CSBs can still be improved. Ensuring key CSB members from the  acquisition and requirements community are present at meetings could  help build consensus more quickly and make decisions more efficiently.  Similarly, while the law is silent on whether paper CSB meetings may be  used to meet the annual requirement, holding in-person meetings may be  more effective because a paper meeting may not provide the opportunity  for in-depth discussion or proper oversight. Holding CSBs in conjunction  with capability portfolio reviews and other similar meetings has the  potential to expand opportunities to review and rationalize requirements  across programs. Improving the connection between CSBs and the  budget process and other reviews can help further efforts to match  weapon system requirements with funding resources. Reviewing  programs at CSBs on a case-by-case basis well into production would  help decision makers identify cost savings and shift funding as warfighter  needs and funding priorities change.

Production generally begins with the  decision to enter low-rate initial production.
