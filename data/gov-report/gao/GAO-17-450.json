These efforts to upgrade the air-traffic control system included the  installation of a semi-automated air-traffic control system beginning in the  mid-1960s and an air traffic control modernization program beginning in  1981. The 1981 modernization program was intended to replace and  upgrade the equipment and facilities of the NAS to meet an expected  increase in traffic volume, enhance the margin of air safety, and increase  the efficiency of the air-traffic control system. The centerpiece of the  program was the Advanced Automation System, which would replace  computer hardware and software and controller work stations at tower,  terminal, and en-route facilities.", "FAA restructured the automation program in 1994 after the estimated cost  to deploy it had tripled, capabilities were shown to be significantly less  than promised, and delays were expected to run nearly a decade. In  1995, we placed FAA\u2019s air traffic control modernization efforts on our  watch list of high-risk federal programs due to the cost, complexity,  criticality to FAA\u2019s mission, and problematic history. By 2003, the  estimated cost of FAA\u2019s air-traffic control modernization efforts had grown  from $12 billion to $51 billion.", "In the early 2000s, the U.S airspace system was experiencing significant  congestion and delays, with about one in every four flights delayed.  Additionally, forecasts called for a possible tripling of air traffic by 2025,  which raised concerns about the air-traffic control system\u2019s ability to  handle demand. In December 2003, Congress passed the Vision 100\u2014 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which created the JPDO within  FAA to plan for and coordinate a transition to NextGen by 2025.  Congress\u2019s goals for NextGen were to improve the level of safety,  security, efficiency, quality, and affordability of the NAS and aviation  services; take advantage of data from emerging technologies and  integrate data streams from multiple sources; and accommodate and  encourage substantial growth in domestic and international  transportation, among other things. Congress assigned the JPDO the  responsibility to develop an integrated plan for NextGen and facilitate  collaboration between FAA and other federal agencies on NextGen  efforts. Since passage of the Vision 100 Act, NextGen has evolved from a  high-level vision developed by the JPDO to detailed plans currently being  implemented by FAA.

NextGen includes a variety  of programs that deliver specific improvements to the NAS. See figure 1  below for some of the improvements to the phases of flight that NextGen  is expected to deliver. For example, under enhanced-surface-traffic  operations, a service provided by FAA\u2019s Data Communications program  allows an air traffic controller to send flight-departure clearance  instructions to aircraft electronically, which can expedite clearances and  reduce communication errors. Under an improvement to streamline arrival  management, performance-based navigation allows aircraft equipped  with appropriate technology to fly precise paths at reduced power, which  saves time, conserves fuel, and reduces exhaust emissions. In addition,  FAA is deploying some programs that are necessary to implement  NextGen programs.

In contrast to  previous modernization efforts, in which FAA sought to build highly  complex software-intensive systems all at once, FAA adopted a phased  approach to modernization that allowed FAA to make mid-course  corrections and avoid costly late-stage changes. JPDO later adopted this  approach for developing and refining its enterprise architecture\u2014a  technical description of the NextGen system that was designed to provide  a common tool for planning the complex, interrelated systems that would  make up NextGen. According to FAA officials we interviewed, the  development and implementation of NextGen is an iterative and  evolutionary process. However, some stakeholders told us that FAA had  originally described NextGen as a transformative initiative. A report from a  2015 National Academy of Sciences study commented that NextGen  meant different things to different people, from a wide-ranging  transformational vision to a much more concrete set of phased  incremental changes to various parts of the NAS, and recommended  resetting expectations. The study committee concluded that NextGen  today is primarily an incremental modernization effort. The report also  noted that given the continuing rapid pace of technological evolution and  ongoing changes in what is demanded of the NAS, the NextGen effort is  properly seen as an ongoing process, punctuated by particular efforts  focused on particular capabilities. According to FAA officials, NextGen  can be both incremental and result in a transformation.", "FAA has begun developing and deploying elements of many NextGen  communications, automation, navigation, surveillance, and weather  programs, as well as foundational programs on which NextGen  improvements depend.

For  example, more efficient air traffic control routes may provide limited  benefits if air traffic controllers do not have access to tools to better  manage airborne traffic. To help manage the implementation of NextGen  improvements across programs, FAA has organized the operational  improvements\u2014specific operational changes to the NAS, such as the  implementation of improved air traffic control procedures\u2014into portfolios.

Some of these stakeholders expressed concern that  their input was not included in the development of planning documents  and other products, and that issues were not addressed or incorporated  in NextGen plans. This participation is critical to NextGen\u2019s  implementation because NextGen depends heavily on airlines\u2019 and other  stakeholders\u2019 investments in NextGen technology and training.", "The need for stakeholder buy-in and investment led FAA in 2009 to  request RTCA to form a task force of government and industry  stakeholders. This task force \u2014called the NextGen Mid-Term  Implementation Task Force\u2014was asked to recommend NextGen  improvements that could be implemented with existing technologies in the  \u201cmidterm,\u201d which was defined as lasting through 2018. In 2009, this task  force issued its recommendations to FAA; they prioritized operational  capabilities in six areas: surface, runway access, metroplex, cruise,  access to the NAS, and cross-cutting\u2014recommendations that cut across  the previous five areas (see table 2). FAA accepted the Task Force  recommendations and incorporated them into its annual NextGen  implementation plans.", "In response to the task force recommendations, FAA has focused its  operational improvement efforts on key airports and metropolitan areas.  Specifically, through the Optimization of Airspace and Procedures in the  Metroplex (Metroplex) initiative, which began in fiscal year 2010, FAA has  focused on airspace redesign and deploying PBN procedures\u2014 procedures that primarily use satellite-based navigation and equipment  on aircraft to navigate with greater precision\u2014in metroplexes. These  metroplexes have a large effect on the overall efficiency of the NAS,  because congestion or delays at one metroplex can affect NAS  operations in other parts of the country. These metroplexes are shown in  figure 2.", "In fiscal year 2013, FAA planned to complete projects at 10 metroplexes  by fiscal year 2016, but as of March 2017 FAA had completed projects at  only 4 metroplexes. FAA considers a metroplex \u201ccompleted\u201d when,  among other things, it deploys new PBN procedures and when all air  traffic controllers are trained on the new procedures. According to FAA,  several factors caused the delay. FAA decided to implement ERAM  before addressing metroplexes because ERAM is required for some  NextGen operations. As a result, some Metroplex projects were delayed  until ERAM was implemented. For example, the Charlotte and Atlanta  metroplexes were delayed from April 2014 until August 2015 while the  Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center implemented ERAM. In addition,  FAA changed the Metroplex program in 2015 to include enhanced  community involvement and outreach activities in Metroplex projects. This  change further contributed to delays. For example, according to FAA, the  introduction of the community involvement initiative caused a 15 month  delay in the Cleveland/Detroit Metroplex project. Under FAA\u2019s current  community involvement strategy, a new Metroplex project would take  about 7 months longer to complete because of community involvement  activities. Further, according to FAA, sequestration and the 2013  government shutdown caused some delays due to employee furloughs  and travel restrictions. In addition to the 4 completed projects, 8 other  Metroplex projects are in various stages. While FAA plans to complete  the current set of 12 Metroplex projects by fiscal year 2019, FAA \u201cpaused\u201d  work at one metroplex\u2014Phoenix\u2014in October 2015, due to legal action  brought by the City of Phoenix over noise created by new PBN  procedures. As of March 2017, FAA did not have plans to resume that  work.", "At completed metroplexes, not all aircraft are flying PBN procedures.  Although PBN procedures generally provide more efficient flight routes,  controllers may continue to route air traffic on conventional routes for a  number of reasons. For example, some aircraft may not have the proper  equipment to use the new procedure. Further, some airline officials we  interviewed reported receiving fewer benefits than expected from FAA\u2019s  implementation of PBN. For example, officials at one airline told us that,  at one metroplex, FAA\u2019s changes have led to that airline\u2019s flying a less  efficient route into one airport, a route that requires its aircraft to use more  fuel and time to land at that airport.", "Some stakeholders have called on FAA to include New York in its  Metroplex plans, due to its congestion and impact\u2014such as flight  delays\u2014on the rest of the NAS, as we have previously reported. In  2013, we reported that FAA chose to exclude the New York/Philadelphia  metroplex because FAA did not want to initiate a new environmental  review process. FAA told us in 2017 that the agency plans to focus on the  northeast in the future, but does not have a current plan to implement  Metroplex improvements there.", "At FAA\u2019s request, RTCA established the NAC to provide advice on  NextGen implementation issues. FAA designated the NAC to develop  aviation stakeholder priorities for NextGen implementation. These  priorities included both the national implementation of NextGen as well as  specific locations (such as airports) for NextGen improvements. In 2012,  the Integrated Capabilities Work Group of the NAC developed priority  operational improvements for major airports and metroplexes in the  midterm. These priority improvements included capabilities such as  deploying PBN procedures that allow aircraft to take a more direct route  into and out of airports, which FAA expects will save both time and fuel.", "In 2014, FAA and the NAC issued a Joint Implementation Plan in which  FAA and industry described a set of activities that FAA and the aviation  community were committed to accomplishing within the next 3 years.  These activities covered four focus areas: data communications, multiple  runway operations, PBN, and surface operations and data sharing.  According to FAA, by the end of 2016, FAA had implemented 124 of 128  NextGen commitments it made for 2014 through 2016. For example, FAA  had deployed the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Surface  Visualization Tool at five terminal radar-approach control facilities. This  tool provides air traffic controllers\u2014who are not located in the airport  tower\u2014with a real-time picture of airport surface traffic. FAA and the  NAC have agreed to update the Joint Implementation plan annually and  develop rolling plans every 2 years to re-examine the needs of the NAS  and its users and to add milestones. FAA had an additional 57  commitments for 2017 through 2019 as of the beginning of 2017, and  industry had an additional 17 commitments for the same time period.

At that time, we recommended that FAA  develop an action plan to agree with stakeholders on a list of specific  goals and outcome-based performance metrics for NextGen. FAA  developed a set of performance metrics, which were used as a starting  point with industry collaboration, and aligned them with NextGen and  agency-wide goals.", "Additionally, FAA launched the NextGen Performance Snapshots (NPS)  website to compare key NextGen initiatives with performance outcomes  at locations where NextGen technologies have been deployed.

The agency  plans to continue to update the NPS with additional metrics as they  mature. Further, the NAC created a Joint Analysis Team which has  developed outcome measures for deploying certain NextGen capabilities.  For example, the team has measured the effect of efforts to update  standards for separation between and among aircraft on the efficiency of  operations at airports in Charlotte, Chicago, Indianapolis, and  Philadelphia. The objective of this capability is to decrease the separation  between and among aircraft and thereby allow more takeoffs and  landings and greater efficiency and capacity for airports.

Specifically, the analysis of the impact of new Metroplex  procedures in the Houston Metroplex projected an annual benefit of $5.3  million in fuel savings to operators at two airports in Houston; however,  the analysis also noted that these benefits were lower than the predicted  savings of $8.3 million annually. Similarly, June 2016 and February  2017 assessments of the effect of revised wake separation standards by  the Joint Analysis Team showed positive results. These standards specify  the required distance between aircraft due to the turbulence created by  the air behind aircraft. The Joint Analysis Team\u2019s assessments found cost  savings at four of five airports. Specifically, the studies found savings for  flights on congested runways, and airports could increase the frequency  of takeoffs and landings. The studies found a decrease in separation for  arrivals at all five locations, and a decrease in separation for departures  at four of the five locations, leading to increased capacity and projected  cost savings of over $4.3 million annually. However, the studies also found that the effects at individual airports would depend on the type and  number of aircraft at each airport.", "According to FAA, some airlines and shipping companies have also  reported benefits from revised wake-separation standards. FAA reports  that Delta Air Lines estimated that revised separation standards at Atlanta  increased Delta\u2019s average daily operations by 6.8 percent, among other  benefits, resulting in $13.9 to $18.7 million in annual savings.

Of the $20.6 billion in estimated costs, FAA indicated that the  agency had already expended $5.8 billion through fiscal year 2014\u2014  approximately 28 percent of the estimated cost of NextGen\u2014and  projected NextGen costs of $14.8 billion from fiscal year 2015 to 2030.", "Assessing prior NextGen cost estimates against current estimates is  difficult because the NextGen program has changed since 2007. As  previously discussed, six NextGen activities were removed for reasons  such as costs outweighing benefits or insufficient air traffic to justify  implementation (see appendix V). Other programs, such as PBN, were  added to the NextGen program after 2007. As a result, FAA officials  stated that it is somewhat coincidental that the 2016 estimate is within the  range of the 2007 estimate.", "We recently found that NextGen cost estimates have evolved, but not  increased markedly since 2004. According to FAA, NextGen cost  estimates have changed in part because earlier estimates considered the  cost of upgrades and enhancements, but over time estimates have also  considered the cost of sustaining systems, PBN procedures, and recently,  the costs associated with integrating unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)  (commonly known as \u201cdrones\u201d) into the NAS. FAA officials explained  that FAA\u2019s current estimated total cost for the aviation industry to equip  for NextGen-capable avionics\u2014electronic equipment found in modern  aircraft\u2014is lower than earlier estimates in part because smaller aircraft  are being replaced by new, larger, and better equipped aircraft, reducing  the number of aircraft in the commercial fleet. According to MITRE  representatives, several factors have contributed to the lower aviation  industry\u2019s cost estimates, including changes in assumptions for the  expected volume of commercial traffic, modifications to the cost of  equipage, and reduction in uncertainty about what equipment aircraft  would need.", "Based on an analysis of FAA budget documents and data, we recently  found that FAA received approximately $7.4 billion for NextGen from  fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2016. According to FAA officials,  operational costs of fully implemented NextGen programs are not  included in these funds. Congress appropriates most of the funding to  FAA from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which receives revenues  from a series of excise taxes on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and cargo  shipments paid by users of the national airspace system. See figure 3  for an overview of federal funds FAA has received for NextGen programs  and activities.", "In addition to funds for NextGen, FAA has also invested in other  programs on which aspects of NextGen are dependent. For example,  according to FAA, the deployment of the core ERAM program cost $2.58  billion when completed in 2015, and FAA estimates that all completed  and current TAMR programs will cost $3.082 billion."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FAA Faces Various Challenges to Implementing NextGen", "paragraphs": ["FAA faces several remaining challenges as it continues to implement  NextGen, such as uncertainties regarding future funding, leadership  stability, aircraft equipage, and cybersecurity issues.

FAA officials told us that sequestration and \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d have had an impact on FAA\u2019s ability to plan and  implement NextGen. Uncertain funding includes not knowing the  amount of funding that will be appropriated to NextGen or when the  funding will become available. From fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year  2016, Congress has passed 25 continuing resolutions that impacted  funding for FAA, ranging from 1 day to 365 days, with an average of  approximately 46 days. In 2014, we reported that some stakeholders told  us that stops and starts associated with continuing resolutions make it  difficult for FAA to carry out long-term planning and strategic development  of future technologies. We found that operating under continuing  resolutions can also complicate agency operations and cause  inefficiencies, such as leading to repetitive work, limiting agencies\u2019  decision-making options, and making trade-offs more difficult. Uncertain  funding was also cited by some stakeholders as a major reason for  Congress to consider restructuring the FAA, which is discussed later in  this report.", "FAA has taken steps to mitigate challenges resulting from uncertain  funding. Specifically, it has prioritized NextGen improvements in  collaboration with the NAC and has segmented some NextGen programs  into smaller pieces that each requires less funding. In 2012, we found that  FAA broke large, complex programs, such as SWIM, into smaller  segments to reduce risk. We previously found that this approach can  improve program management by positioning FAA to make any necessary corrections earlier in development, and thus help FAA avoid  costly late-stage changes. However, we also found that this approach can  increase the duration and possibly the total cost of the program. For  example, in 2015 we found that FAA had divided capital investments for  Data Communications into small segments, raising questions from the  aviation industry about when FAA will fully implement Data  Communications.", "A related funding challenge is the need for FAA to have funding sufficient  to support both existing legacy system maintenance and the  implementation of NextGen capabilities. As we reported in November  2015, according to FAA officials, NextGen implementation in future years  is dependent on the timing and amount of future appropriations.  Specifically, any funding delay in one NextGen program can lead to  increased costs for FAA, even if the delay does not result in a direct cost  increase to a program. These cost increases occur because FAA staff  must continue to manage program implementation and maintain any  legacy system that the program is replacing. In addition, NextGen  programs are interdependent, so a schedule delay in one program can  also affect how and when other programs will be implemented. In  response to the challenge of maintaining the legacy system while also  implementing new systems and capabilities, FAA officials told us that  funding has been allocated to account for the \u201ctechnical refresh\u201d of  existing systems and other maintenance related issues, and that FAA will  continue to monitor and prioritize the delivery of NextGen capabilities  while maintaining existing systems. According to FAA officials,  approximately 55 percent of FAA\u2019s current budget is used to maintain the  current air traffic control system. The longer that legacy systems are  maintained, there is a greater likelihood that they will continue to require  increasingly large shares of the FAA budget and reduce the amount of  funds available to implement NextGen. In 2011, we concluded that FAA  will have to balance its priorities to ensure that NextGen implementation  stays on course while also maintaining the current infrastructure that is  needed to ensure the safety and reliability of the NAS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Leadership Stability", "paragraphs": ["NextGen program leadership has undergone significant changes that are  likely to continue. Specifically, while the FAA administrator is appointed to  a 5-year term, there have been four administrators since a previous  administrator\u2019s term ended in September 2007, including no confirmed  administrator for all of 2008 and 2012. The Deputy Administrator-Chief  NextGen Officer left the position in June 2016 after 3 years in the  position, and a new Deputy Administrator was sworn in in June 2017.  Furthermore, since the position of Assistant Administrator for NextGen  was created, in late 2011, three assistant administrators and one interim  assistant administrator have filled the position. Additionally, a new  Secretary of Transportation was sworn in in January 2017, and the  current FAA administrator\u2019s term expires in January 2018. We previously  found that programs benefit from having experienced program managers  who provide consistent leadership through major phases of a program.  Additionally, we found that leading practices of successful organizations  indicate that programs can be implemented most efficiently and  effectively when managers are empowered to make critical decisions and  can be held accountable for results. Conversely, the absence of stable  and consistent leadership may have the opposite effect on project  implementation. For example, continued uncertainty about the FAA\u2019s  leadership of NextGen could affect FAA\u2019s ability to manage the various  efforts needed to achieve full implementation of NextGen.

However, other  challenges could develop. In October 2016, we reported that subject area  experts, aviation stakeholders, and FAA officials identified issues that will  need to be considered if such a transition were to occur. Some of those  issues directly affect NextGen implementation. Specifically, stakeholders  told us that one issue would be the amount of time and costs required to  complete a transition from FAA to another ATC operator. This transition  time would include the time it could take to terminate or revise current  contracts between FAA and companies that produce NextGen  technologies. Another issue that stakeholders identified is how  management and workforce roles and responsibilities would be defined  within the new entity and FAA. For example, selected experts identified  the importance of clearly delineating each organization\u2019s roles and  responsibilities to ensure a smooth transition. According to FAA, the  transition could create some uncertainty among some employees over  future workforce or organizational changes. While it is uncertain how a  transition would affect NextGen implementation, the legislation includes a  requirement for FAA to prioritize and track progress on some NextGen  programs before the transition occurs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Equipage", "paragraphs": ["To achieve desired benefits, NextGen requires system users such as  aircraft owners and operators to equip their aircraft with new avionics that  provide aircraft capabilities needed for the planned NextGen operational  capabilities and services to be used effectively. For example, ADS-B uses  Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to determine an aircraft\u2019s  location, speed, and other data, rather than traditional radar. ADS-B Out  uses avionics installed in an aircraft to broadcast the aircraft\u2019s position, air  speed, and altitude to other aircraft equipped with ADS-B and to ground  stations, which transmit the data to air traffic control facilities. FAA has  mandated that, starting January 1, 2020, aircraft must be equipped with  ADS-B Out to fly in most controlled airspace. This deadline applies to all  aircraft in the applicable airspace, including commercial aircraft, general  aviation, and military aircraft. In discussing challenges to implementing  NextGen, 27 of the 34 aviation stakeholders we interviewed told us that  factors related to equipage are a challenge for NextGen implementation.  For example, officials from an aviation association told us that the primary  barrier to installation of ADS-B Out when the Equip 2020 working group  was created in 2014 was the cost of purchasing and installing the  equipment. These officials said that the price of ADS-B Out was too  costly for general aviation and that the cost to equip was not declining as  the deadline approached. Additionally, representatives from two airlines  and two aircraft manufacturers told us that they are hesitant to equip due  to concerns that FAA could change equipage standards. FAA has worked  with industry and academia through the Equip 2020 working group to  identify and mitigate barriers to owners equipping their aircraft and,  according to FAA, has not changed equipage standards for 7 years. FAA  estimates that more than 100,000 aircraft still need to equip with ADS-B  Out before the January 1, 2020 deadline.", "As of December 2016, FAA reported that 787 U.S. air carrier aircraft were  equipped with ADS-B Out, representing between 13.1 percent and 15.7  percent of all U.S. air carrier aircraft. However, FAA reported that it has  received equipage plans for meeting the 2020 requirement from airlines  that account for 88 percent of the projected fleet. According to FAA, it  continues to work with airlines to address the remaining aircraft, which  include new deliveries, additional retrofits, and aircraft that may be shifted  outside the U.S. market. FAA also reported that 18,292 U.S. general  aviation aircraft were equipped with ADS-B Out, which represents  between 11 percent and 18 percent of all U.S. general aviation aircraft.  To encourage aircraft owners and operators to equip with ADS-B Out,  prior to the January 1, 2020, deadline, FAA announced a $500 rebate in September 2016 for 20,000 general aviation aircraft owners and  operators who equip with ADS-B Out. According to FAA, a minimal rule- compliant system costs approximately $2,000, plus installation costs. The  Equip 2020 working group performed a survey of aircraft owners and  found that getting costs below $2,000 would encourage many price- sensitive owners to equip. As such, the FAA chose $500 as an amount  that would get the price down to that more-attractive range, and according  to FAA, this amount also maximized the total number of rebates the  agency could distribute, based on total funding approved for the program.  FAA officials said it could be a problem if owners wait until 2019 to get  equipped since there are a limited number of facilities and technicians  available to equip airplanes. Additionally, once aircraft are equipped with  new avionics technology, FAA must ensure that the avionics were  properly installed and meeting performance standards.", "Similar to ADS-B, before aircraft owners and operators can benefit from  the capabilities of Data Communications, their aircraft must be equipped  with Data Communications avionics equipment. FAA has achieved its  2019 goal for equipping 1,900 domestic air carrier aircraft with Data  Communications avionics. For example, according to FAA, as of August  2017, more than 3,150 domestic air carrier aircraft were equipped for  Data Communications.

Integrating new entrants  could have both budget and program implications. When the original  planning for NextGen was developed, UAS were not generally included in  the planning. In June 2016, FAA finalized the first set of federal aviation  regulations that established the regulatory framework for small UAS  operations and allowed routine commercial use of small UAS at 400 feet  and below and within the operator\u2019s line-of-sight. This regulation went into effect in August 2016. FAA statistics indicate that there are more  than 770,000 registered drone operators in the United States. Applying  lessons learned about the importance of early and continued involvement  of stakeholders, FAA established the Drone Advisory Committee (DAC).  The DAC consists of government officials and predominantly industry  stakeholders and advises FAA as it works to expand small UAS  operations in the NAS. This expansion could include operations over  people, at night, and beyond the visual line-of-sight of the operator, and  the transportation of persons and property. The increased use of drones  has resulted in an increase in the number of UAS sightings, which occur  when pilots, law enforcement, and others report a possible encounter with  a UAS, many of which FAA is concerned pose a safety hazard to manned  aircraft. The number of reported sightings increased about five-fold from  233 in 2014 to 1,218 in 2015 and increased by about another 50 percent  in 2016 to 1,837 (see fig. 4).", "FAA must also integrate commercial space launches into the NAS.

According  to FAA data, the first licensed reentry occurred in October 2014, and FAA  has licensed a total of seven entries through June 2017. During this same  time period, FAA has licensed 33 commercial space launches. As  companies develop the capability to conduct other types of launches,  such as delivering crew for the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration\u2019s commercial space programs and conducting space  tourism, the number of launches and reentries affecting U.S. airspace is  expected to grow.

This  new noise can also be more prevalent for some parts of a community as  airplanes fly a more direct and predictable path into or out of an airport  and are therefore overhead more frequently. Consequently, aircraft noise  has resulted in some public opposition to NextGen.", "FAA officials have acknowledged that, in some locations, there is  significant public resistance to redesigning airport arrival and departure  routes to take advantage of PBN. FAA has enhanced community  outreach efforts to help address concerns about aircraft-related noise. For  example, in February 2016, FAA completed the development of its  Community Involvement Manual to give FAA staff an understanding of the  value of community involvement. The manual also describes practices  and effective techniques for engaging in dialogue and collaboration with  communities affected by FAA actions. Additionally, in June 2016, a NAC task group made recommendations to FAA for community outreach to  assist FAA and industry with the growing environmental challenges  associated with PBN implementation.
