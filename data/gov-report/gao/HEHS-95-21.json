An increase in the number of infants and toddlers living in such families during the same period suggests that this trend will continue. These disadvantaged children often live in environments that undermine their development and impair their ability to benefit from elementary school.Already lagging behind their peers when they enter school, many of these children fail to catch up. Consequently, disadvantaged children, more than other children, are placed in special education classes, repeat one or more grades, or drop out before completing high school.", "A recent Carnegie Corporation report characterizes the condition of some of the nation\u2019s youngest children, including the disadvantaged, as a \u201cquiet crisis.\u201d The report documents the importance of environmental factors on children\u2019s development and concludes that \u201cthe quality of young children\u2019s environment and social experience has a decisive, long-lasting impact on their well-being and ability to learn.\u201d According to the report, less than half of the nation\u2019s youngest children receive adequate cognitive stimulation, such as being read to by their parents.", "To prepare for school, disadvantaged children can benefit from programs that offer specific features of child development services, promote parent services, and provide adequate health care and nutrition services. Such services may be found in early childhood centers, such as preschools, nursery schools, child care centers, or early learning centers. Such services also may be found in other settings, including family child care, or provided by parents themselves. If disadvantaged children do not receive these services, their future success in both school and life may be jeopardized.", "The Congress\u2019 inclusion of a school readiness goal as part of the 1994 Goals 2000: Educate America Act suggests the need for and importance of helping young children prepare for school. The act establishes eight national education goals, the first of which states that \u201cBy the year 2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn.\u201d The goal also articulates the fundamental elements needed to foster the development of all children, including the disadvantaged, and to prepare them for school. These elements include high-quality, developmentally appropriatepreschool programs (in this report, centers), parents who are involved in their child\u2019s learning, and adequate health and nutrition services. However, accomplishing this goal may become an elusive pursuit as schools receive a continuing stream of disadvantaged children whose early experiences do not include these fundamental elements needed to prepare them for school.", "The Congress has also enacted other legislation that addresses the need for preparing children for school: the Head Start Amendments Act of 1994, a part of the Human Services Amendments of 1994, P.L. 103-252; and the Improving America\u2019s Schools Act, P.L. 103-382, which amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). The Head Start Amendments of 1994 reauthorized and expanded Head Start, a program that provides some disadvantaged children\u2014mostly those who are categorized as poor\u2014with all services needed to prepare for school. The Improving America\u2019s Schools Act provides, among other educational programs, early childhood services in some schools with large numbers of disadvantaged children.", "The provision of early childhood services is also likely to be a key issue in the debate over welfare reform.

However, the early childhood experiences of many disadvantaged children do not include these experiences.", "Family income is an important predictor of children\u2019s success or failure in school; disadvantaged children are more likely to experience difficulties. Their early childhood experiences often hinder their development, leaving them unprepared for school. Recent research on infants and toddlers provides compelling evidence of the environmental deficits\u2014such as too little cognitive stimulation and inadequate health care\u2014that undermine disadvantaged children\u2019s development. It also documents the effects of these deficits on children\u2019s school performance and later lives.", "A 1991 study of children whose families were recipients of AFDC, the federal welfare assistance program, found that the conditions under which the nation\u2019s most disadvantaged children live are detrimental to these children\u2019s development and undermine their chances for success in school. Researchers found that children who were from families receiving AFDC were twice as likely as children of more economically advantaged families to do poorly in school, repeat a grade, and become classroom disciplinary problems. Two-thirds of these children lived in home environments that did not stimulate their cognitive growth and where they received insufficient emotional support from their parents. The study revealed similar findings for the children of low-income families that were not receiving AFDC.", "Disadvantaged children have less access to health care and nutrition, especially preventative health care, than children whose families have higher incomes. The same 1991 study of AFDC children found that children from low-income families were less likely to have visited a doctor within the last year than children in families with higher incomes. Twenty-one percent of the children in low-income families had not visited a doctor within the last year compared with 14 percent of children in families with higher incomes. Also, children in low-income families were more likely to receive care in a hospital emergency room, which is not an adequate source of preventative care. Forty percent of the children in low-income families\u2014compared with 7 percent of children in families with higher incomes\u2014received regular care through a hospital emergency room or clinic. Poor health can negatively affect children\u2019s ability to perform well in school.", "Other factors associated with low-income families\u2014low parent educational attainment, single-parenting, and linguistic isolation\u2014also increase children\u2019s risk of doing poorly in school.

The recent reauthorization of Head Start permits the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand these grants from the 22 states currently participating to all states. In addition, the Advisory Committee for Head Start Quality and Expansion recommended that a study of federal child care be undertaken to provide direction for increasing the consistency between program requirements and procedures to facilitate coordination between programs.", "The Congress has also taken steps to address concerns that have been raised about the quality of services funded by the array of federal early childhood programs. In response to concerns about the quality of Head Start services, the Congress allows HHS to set aside for quality improvements 25 percent of the amount of the current-year Head Start appropriations that exceed appropriations of the preceding year, including staff salary increases.

In Michigan, the state per-child allocation for its school-sponsored program is too low to support the full range of services that the program is intended to provide, a state official said.", "The Head Start centers we visited also faced resource scarcity, even though their mandate is to meet all needs of children served. Head Start grantees\u2019 inability to offer competitive salaries and benefits packages, particularly in urban areas, is in part responsible for high rates of staff turnover, according to a 1993 review by the HHS Inspector General.Furthermore, because communities were under greater economic distress, several center directors said, centers were unable to draw upon the community-based medical providers and social service agencies they had depended on in the past. Results of our recent survey of Head Start grantees and delegates showed that Head Start administrators viewed the limited availability of community resources as a major challenge.", "Head Start centers sometimes had coordinators who referred families to providers within the surrounding community when the center could not offer a needed service. In general, we found that other kinds of centers, faced with resource scarcity or with a narrow view of their mission, did not allocate resources to hire coordinators. Two Maryland school-sponsored centers that we visited, however, made efforts to link up with community-based services that enabled each center to provide additional health services to its children, even though these centers did not have coordinators.", "The scarcity of resources can also lead to competition between different kinds of centers for facilities, staff, funding, and children, according to Head Start-State Collaboration Grant administrators. For example, as states increase funding for their own early childhood programs, school districts are taking back space that was once given to Head Start programs. All kinds of centers compete with each other for trained staff, with the school-sponsored centers having the greatest advantage in the salaries and benefits offered. There is competition for funding, for example, as Head Start looks to sources of funding, such as CCDBG, traditionally used by child care centers. Different kinds of centers may also compete for state funding in order to deliver services. Particularly as states expand their early childhood programs, centers may compete with each other because they target the same children. Several collaboration grant administrators said there was competition for children among early childhood programs in their states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Programs That Reflect Narrow Missions Are Barriers to Collaboration Between Centers", "paragraphs": ["Differences in early childhood programs that reflect their narrow missions create barriers for one center trying to establish a collaborative relationship with another in order to broaden the range of services each provides. Collaboration refers to combining centers, services, or programs in innovative ways that provide children access to additional services.", "For example, several Maine Head Start centers have faced difficulty providing full-day programs for children of parents participating in the AFDC Child Care program. In order to extend the center day for these children, funding from Head Start and the AFDC Child Care program were combined. Thus, the children were provided full-day care by Head Start teachers in Head Start centers. However, this was difficult because Head Start teachers were paid at a rate that reflected their teacher qualifications, but the level of funding for AFDC Child Care was not sufficient to cover their salaries. Additional state and local funds had to be raised in order to pay these teachers at the Head Start salary.", "Oregon has faced difficulties in its efforts to bring the full range of services to disadvantaged children in nonprofit and for-profit centers. On an experimental basis, the state is allowing parents of children eligible for the Oregon Prekindergarten Program\u2014which is modeled after Head Start\u2014to place their children in any center convenient to their home or work, and the state ensures the children receive Head Start-like services.", "Visiting staff from the Oregon Prekindergarten Program help the center meet standards for child development equivalent to Head Start so that all children in the center benefit. Through home visits, Oregon Prekindergarten Program staff provide health and other services to only those children participating in the experimental program. But the rate centers charge for each child\u2014that is, the center\u2019s standard rate\u2014has been inadequate to support the higher level of child development services, according to the administrator of the state\u2019s Head Start collaboration grant. As a result, some centers have experienced difficulties meeting program standards. In response, the state may restrict participating centers in the future to those that are already offering better child development services based on a school district evaluation of the center through the Oregon Prekindergarten Program.", "In our case study work in Louisiana, we found that administrators of school-sponsored centers encountered difficulties simply trying, in a given center, to provide services in one classroom to children funded under different programs so that more children could be served. For example, if a child dropped out of a classroom, according to a state administrator, the budget had to be revised unless a new child was found who met the same eligibility requirements of the program under which the original child was funded.", "Even when centers successfully develop collaborative relationships, the collaboration is difficult and burdensome to administer. Rigidity of funding streams and regulations inhibit the development and ongoing management of programs attempting to meet the needs of parents and communities, concluded New York State\u2019s subcommittee on collaboration, part of the state\u2019s Interagency Committee on Early Childhood Programs. The subcommittee based its findings on interviews with administrators who led initiatives attempting to link different programs. Among the barriers identified were disparity in per-child funding provided to school-sponsored, Head Start, and child care programs; marked differences in salaries and benefits between teachers with equal credentials; and variations in programs and missions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and Local Initiatives Expand the Range of Services Provided", "paragraphs": ["Some state and local initiatives have expanded program missions in order to provide the full range of services.

In some cases, resources invested in these initiatives included private funding.", "California\u2019s State Preschool Program and General Child Care and Development Program, for example, require centers all to offer a wide range of services and to establish links with health and social service agencies. California has long recognized the importance of helping children prepare for school while allowing parents to work or get an education, as reflected in the California Child Development Act of 1972. This act brought all state early childhood programs together under the Department of Education. With both the State Preschool and General Child Care and Development Programs, agencies other than school districts are eligible for state funding to operate centers as long as state standards are met. California has also encouraged school-sponsored centers to colocate with Head Start centers; in two colocated centers we visited, all children received Head Start services. To support the State Preschool Program and the General Child Care Program, the state invested over $300 million in fiscal year 1993 alone.", "Other states have invested state money to expand Head Start or modeled their programs after the Head Start program. For example, Ohio, which already provides state support to expand the Head Start program, will double its allocation from $40 million to $97 million for the period 1993 through 1995. Also in 1995, Ohio will follow Head Start performance standards so that state funds will support programs that meet children\u2019s developmental needs. The Oregon Prekindergarten Program already follows Head Start performance standards, and centers participating in either Head Start or this state-funded program are jointly monitored by a team of Head Start and Oregon Prekindergarten Program staff. As of 1992, 14 states invest directly in Head Start so that more children can be provided the full range of services.", "Some states and localities have launched initiatives that assist centers in overcoming barriers that prevent them from collaborating in order to broaden the range of services centers provide. These collaborative initiatives include locating centers, services, and children together although they are funded by different programs. Other collaborative initiatives include delivering additional services to disadvantaged children in centers in which these services are typically unavailable.", "In Maryland, several counties combine Head Start and child care services. In Baltimore City, a child care resource and referral agency coordinates an initiative in which Head Start classrooms are created within child care centers. This enables (1) Head Start-eligible children to receive full-day care and (2) the child care center to benefit from the teacher training and other resources it shares with Head Start. Both Frederick and Charles counties also provide Head Start and child care services on-site together.", "In other states, standards and professional development are the centerpiece of collaborative efforts.

For example, several centers were created in Kansas City, Missouri, to provide the full range of services to children funded under different early childhood programs, including Head Start and federal and state child care programs. Private donations and local community moneys help to supplement the cost of care.", "In Kentucky, a partnership joining the state and local governments and private agencies funds a statewide education reform effort that was launched in 1990. The reform effort includes an early childhood initiative in which state officials have arranged for Head Start to provide \u201cenhanced\u201d services\u2014such as health and social services\u2014to Head Start-eligible children enrolled in school-sponsored programs.
