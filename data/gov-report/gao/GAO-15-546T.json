For  example, this September, the Bureau plans to announce its preliminary  design for the 2020 Census, and in October 2018 the Bureau plans to  have all systems and processes for the 2020 Census developed and  ready for end-to-end testing.

For example,  at about $13 billion, the 2010 Census was the costliest U.S. census in  history and was 56 percent more costly than the $8.1 billion 2000 Census  (in constant 2010 dollars). If that growth rate continues, the 2020 Census  could cost approximately $25 billion in 2020.", "Given these trends, the fundamental management challenge facing the  Bureau is how to control the cost of the next enumeration while  maintaining its accuracy.

This includes conducting several major field tests that are intended to  inform the September 2015 preliminary design decision. For example, in  2014 the Bureau tested new methods for conducting self-response and  non-response follow-up (referred to as the 2014 Census Test) in the  Maryland and Washington, D.C., area. The Bureau is also conducting  tests in 2015 that are expected to inform the design decision, including  the Address Validation Test, which was completed in early 2015 and  was used to examine new methods for updating the Bureau\u2019s address  list; the 2015 Census Test, which is currently being conducted in Arizona  to test, among other things, reengineered non-response follow-up field  operations, as well as enabling enumerators to use their personally  owned mobile devices to collect census data; and the Optimizing Self Response Test, which is currently being  conducted in Savannah, Georgia, and the surrounding area and is  intended to further explore methods of encouraging households to  respond using the Internet, such as using advertizing and outreach to  motivate respondents, and enabling households to respond without a  Bureau-issued identification number.", "Following its design decision, the Bureau plans to conduct additional  research and testing and further refine the design through 2018.

In addition to being  costly, such follow-up can also affect the accuracy of the count, because  when census enumerators cannot contact a household, they may turn to  a neighbor or some other person knowledgeable about the household to  obtain the data. However, this information may be less reliable than  information provided by a household member. In addition, many  residences are subsequently found to be vacant or nonexistent. For  example, in one operation in 2010 with the purpose of verifying whether  some housing units were vacant or should be deleted from the Bureau\u2019s  address list, the Bureau visited nearly 9 million housing units at a cost of  about $280 million in labor and other expenses.", "To reduce the need for these costly operations and to increase accuracy,  the Bureau is testing how it might be able to expand its use of information  the government already has from the administration of other programs\u2014 administrative records.

The Bureau is  exploring questions about the quality of other records and their  completeness. Information contained in those records was collected  for other purposes, so it may not always provide exactly what the  Bureau needs. For example, while race and ethnicity data are  collected in the census, the records available to the Bureau may not  record this information. Likewise, while the Bureau needs the location  of a residence for apportionment and other purposes, available  records may only provide locations where people receive mail such as  a post office box.", "To what extent does the Bureau have access to these records for  operational purposes? Some of the data the Bureau may want to  use is personally identifiable information collected for other specific  purposes. In some cases, the Bureau may need to enter into  agreements with other agencies or levels of government to obtain  access. In other cases, legislative changes may be needed to provide  the Bureau with the necessary access authority.

The Bureau also found that  enterprise-level competency gaps existed in program and project  management, budget and cost estimation, systems development, data  analytics, and shared services. The Bureau\u2019s efforts to monitor the status  of its efforts to close these competency gaps will be critical to ensuring  the Bureau has the skills it needs to effectively deliver IT solutions for the  2020 Census.", "GAO, 2020 Census: Key Challenges Need to Be Addressed to Successfully Enable  Internet Response, GAO-15-225 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 5, 2015)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Assurance That Information Systems Are Adequately Secured", "paragraphs": ["Critical to the Bureau\u2019s ability to perform its data collection and analysis  duties are its information systems and the protection of the information  they contain. A data breach could result in the public\u2019s loss of confidence  in the Bureau, thus affecting its ability to collect census data. To ensure  the reliability of their computerized information, agencies should design  and implement controls to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access  to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities.  Inadequate design or implementation of access controls increases the  risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, and destruction of sensitive  information and disruption of service.", "In January 2013, we reported on the Bureau\u2019s implementation of  information security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of the information and systems that support its mission. We  concluded that the Bureau had a number of weaknesses in controls  intended to limit access to its systems and information, as well as those  related to managing system configurations and unplanned events. We  attributed these weaknesses to the fact that the Bureau had not fully  implemented a comprehensive information security program, and made   The  115 recommendations aimed at addressing these deficiencies.Bureau expressed broad agreement with the report and said it would  work to find the best ways to address our recommendations.", "However, to date, the Bureau has fully addressed only 19 of the 115  recommendations, and while it is making progress on others, significant  work remains. For example, the Bureau has implemented elements of a  comprehensive information security program, such as establishing  appropriate policies and procedures, providing security awareness  training, and addressing incident response weaknesses; however, among  many other things, it is not yet comprehensively assessing risk.", "Given that the Bureau is considering using IT systems to collect the  public\u2019s personal information for the 2020 Census in ways that it has not  in previous censuses (e.g., web-based surveys, cloud computing, and  enabling enumerators to use their personally owned mobile devices to  collect census data), implementing our security recommendations from  over 2 years ago must be a high priority. Until then, the Bureau will have  limited assurance that its information and systems, including those  needed for the 2020 Census, are being adequately protected against  unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, disruption, or loss.", "In summary, the Bureau is pursuing initiatives to significantly reform its  outdated and inefficient methods of conducting decennial censuses.  However, with only 3-and-a-half years remaining until the Bureau plans to  have all systems and processes for the 2020 Census developed and  ready for end-to-end system testing, the magnitude of the planned  changes, the Bureau\u2019s prior track record, and existing challenges, the  2020 Census program faces significant risk. As the Bureau approaches  the September 2015 preliminary decision deadline, it needs to ensure that  it only commits to what its capacity can truly accommodate. In addition,  the Bureau will need to ensure that quality and information security are  effectively managed in a census design that may entail significant  change. Moreover, the Bureau needs to take action to address the  specific challenges we have highlighted in prior reports. If these actions  are not taken, cost overruns, schedules delays, and performance  shortfalls may diminish the potentially significant cost savings that the  Bureau estimates will result from redesigning the census for 2020.", "Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and Members of the  Committee, this completes our prepared statement.
