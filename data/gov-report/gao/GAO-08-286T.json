First, FSI and senior GAO management decide on a case-by-case basis whether engagements requiring covert tests are within the scope of GAO's authority. Next, FSI identifies the aspects of the security system or the government program that are particularly vulnerable to terrorist threats or fraudulent activities and relies on the experience of its investigators to develop a written investigative plan. This plan typically includes the creation of fictitious identities and counterfeit documentation. All counterfeit documents that FSI uses are manufactured using hardware, software, and materials that are available to the general public--this allows FSI to demonstrate that any security vulnerabilities it finds could be exploited by a criminal or terrorist with moderate means and resources and would not require sophisticated insider knowledge. FSI's investigators are the only GAO staff allowed to participate in the execution phase of testing, although audit and analyst staff are often involved in planning and operational support. Importantly, if investigators discover vulnerabilities that pose a significant and immediate threat to public safety, FSI immediately will discontinue its investigation and alert the appropriate government law enforcement agency. Once the operation is complete, FSI conducts a \"corrective action briefing\" with officials at the tested entity to report that they have been the subject of a covert operation, share the results of the testing and, if necessary, suggest potential remedies for any identified control weaknesses or security vulnerabilities. The following summarize recent FSI red team operations. These operations provided the Congress with irrefutable evidence about the actual ability of federal agencies under \"live\" conditions to deal with security threats and to protect government assets from fraudsters. Using counterfeit documents and posing as employees of a company with a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license, FSI investigators successfully crossed the U.S. northern and southern borders with the type of radioactive materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb. Posing as private citizens, FSI investigators purchased sensitive military equipment--including ceramic body armor inserts, guided missile radar test sets, and microcircuits used in F-14 fighter aircraft--on the Internet from the Department of Defense's liquidation sales contractor. Using bogus driver's licenses, FSI investigators successfully gained entry to all 24 Department of Transportation regulated urine collection sites that FSI tested, which are responsible for providing drug testing of commercial truck drivers in safety sensitive transportation positions. Using false documents and an erroneous IRS taxpayer identification number, FSI pretended to be a charity and successfully applied to three of the Combined Financial Campaign's local 2006 campaigns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss covert testing activities  conducted by the Forensic Audits and Special Investigations (FSI) unit of  the GAO. FSI, which was created in 2005 as an interdisciplinary team  consisting of investigators, auditors, and analysts, conducts covert tests at  the request of the Congress. The objectives of these tests are to identify  security vulnerabilities and internal control weaknesses at executive  branch agencies, including those that could compromise national or  homeland security, affect public safety, or have a financial impact on  taxpayer\u2019s dollars. In brief, my remarks today relate to the processes and  procedures FSI uses to conduct this work and the results of some of our  operations.", "FSI\u2019s covert testing operations are typically part of a broader security  vulnerability assessment or a forensic audit designed to identify fraud,  waste, and abuse related to federal programs. FSI conducts covert tests as  \u201cred team\u201d operations, meaning that for these operations, FSI does not  notify agencies in advance about our testing. As an example, in 2002 we  conducted a red team operation to evaluate the security of federal  buildings in Atlanta, Georgia. In this case, we obtained genuine security  badges through deception and then counterfeited the badges, allowing  several investigators to access the buildings without the knowledge of  security personnel or agency officials. In contrast, \u201cblue team\u201d operations  involve notifying affected agencies in advance about testing; GAO  information technology specialists test executive branch agencies\u2019  computer systems using a blue team approach. Although both types of  operations uncover valuable information, we are confident that the red  team approach provides the Congress with dependable, irrefutable  evidence about the actual ability of federal agencies under \u201clive\u201d  conditions to deal with security threats and to protect government assets  and programs from fraudsters.", "Recently, concerns have arisen as to whether top management at the U.S.  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) were negatively impacting  the results of red team operations by notifying security screeners at the  nation\u2019s airports in advance of covert testing operations.

FSI plans and conducts all investigations in accordance with  the standards established by the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and  Efficiency (PCIE). These standards are relevant to the full range of  government investigations, including fraud, corruption, white-collar crime,  security inquiries, whistleblower issues, and other special investigations.  With regard to covert operations specifically, FSI has developed our own  internal procedures detailing the requirements related to the planning,  execution, and reporting phases of the operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Planning a Covert Test", "paragraphs": ["FSI, in conjunction with senior-level GAO management, decides on a case- by-case basis whether to accept written congressional requests requiring  covert operations or whether to incorporate covert testing into existing  engagements. In making these decisions, a number of factors are  considered, including, but not limited to, whether the proposed operations  are within the scope of GAO\u2019s authority; whether the operations may be  performed more appropriately by agency Inspectors General; and whether  the requested work presents significant risk of personal injury to  individuals or other harm to persons, businesses, or public safety. We also  identify the specific aspects of the security system or the government  program that are particularly vulnerable to terrorist threats or fraudulent  activities. Once the use of covert operations is accepted, the first step in  FSI\u2019s process involves using the training and experience of our  investigators to develop a written investigative plan. Because the average  FSI investigator has over 20 years of law enforcement experience, they are  uniquely positioned to develop a blueprint for performing the work, while  minimizing disruption to the day-to-day operations of the agency being  tested and seeking to ensure the safety of all involved.", "In general, FSI investigative plans contain the following elements: a  statement regarding the investigation\u2019s overall objectives; a description of  the legal issues involved; and a summary of the allegations that merit  investigation or the processes, systems, and controls that will be tested.  When covert operations are involved, the plan must also contain a detailed  outline of the steps that would be necessary to effectively conduct the  operation. In most cases, this step-by-step process will include the  creation of fictitious identities and counterfeit documentation, including  items such as birth certificates, driver\u2019s licenses, credit cards, billing  records, and social security cards. All counterfeit documents that FSI uses  are manufactured by FSI using hardware, software, and materials that are  available to the general public\u2014this allows us to demonstrate that any  security vulnerabilities we find could be exploited by a criminal or  terrorist with moderate means and resources and would not require  sophisticated insider knowledge or access to sophisticated equipment. In  order to obtain the best possible evidence, the plan may also request that  GAO management authorize FSI to obtain photographs or video or audio  recordings. The investigative plan must be reviewed and approved by an  FSI Assistant Director for Investigations, FSI\u2019s Managing Director, and two  members from GAO\u2019s top management team."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Executing a Covert Test", "paragraphs": ["Once the investigative plan has been approved, FSI proceeds with the  covert operation. In general, FSI\u2019s investigators are the only staff allowed  to participate in actual testing activities, although audit and analyst staff  are often involved in planning and operational support. Furthermore, if the  covert testing is conducted outside GAO headquarters (e.g., the testing of  U.S. border security), FSI policy requires that investigators acting in a  covert capacity have a \u201ccover team\u201d of investigators to ensure safety.  These agents are usually placed strategically about the test site to monitor  the situation and to alert the investigators conducting the tests if anything  seems out of place. The responsible Assistant Director for Investigations is  also present during all covert operations conducted outside of the GAO  headquarters building. Before any testing begins, the Managing Director  generally receives an itinerary sheet with all the names of the investigators  involved and pertinent contact numbers.", "During the execution phase, investigators are required to protect  investigative information from unauthorized disclosure, protect the rights  of all individuals involved, and avoid any action that may give the  appearance of coercion or intimidation. In addition, investigators must  safeguard any counterfeit documentation against theft or damage.  Investigators must document all evidence obtained in accordance with  PCIE standards and applicable FSI and GAO policies.", "Investigators routinely make dry runs of covert operations tests to  determine whether new or enhanced security procedures have been  implemented after the development of our testing plan. Because FSI only  uses publicly available information to develop our covert tests and does  not consult with agency insiders, the specifics of our operations are not  leaked to agency officials. Our belief is that by using only publicly  available information, our tests reveal what an actual terrorist or criminal  might do during a real security breach or fraud scheme.", "Furthermore, our policy is that if an FSI covert operation is uncovered  during one of our tests, the backup investigators immediately will identify  themselves and alert the proper law enforcement authorities that a test is  being conducted and identify all participants as being FSI investigators  with the proper authority. Importantly, if investigators discover  vulnerabilities that pose a significant and immediate threat to public  safety, FSI immediately discontinues its investigation and alert the  appropriate government law enforcement agency.

Because the  covert testing is sometimes part of a broader forensic audit, parts of the  product may also adhere to U.S. generally accepted government auditing  standards. These products contain our findings, the results of the  corrective action briefing with the tested entity, and sometimes contain  recommendations to agency management. FSI does not usually reveal all  details about its covert methodologies in public products. For example, we  typically do not reveal the name of any bogus companies that we create or  the fictitious identities that we use. Moreover, if our findings relate to  issues of national or homeland security, FSI submits a draft product to the  agency for a sensitivity review prior to issuance.
