However, from fiscal year 2005 to 2011, some agencies decreased their fleets, and the change in fleet size from agency to agency varied considerably. For example, one-third of the agencies (8 of 24) with the largest number of vehicles decreased their fleets by at least 2 percent during this period. Of the 4 agencies GAO selected for review, the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Veterans Affairs (VA) increased their fleets 5 and 49 percent, respectively since fiscal year 2005; the U.S. Air Force and Department of the Interior (Interior) decreased their fleets 7 and 9 percent, respectively. Overall, federal agencies increased the portion of their fleets made up of alternative fuel vehicles (e.g., vehicles that operate using ethanol or batteries) from about 14 percent to 33 percent from fiscal years 2005 to 2011. In addition, GAO found that 8 agencies accounted for almost 80 percent of total federal vehicles in fiscal year 2011, while 35 other agencies held the remaining vehicles.", "Fleet managers at the four selected agencies stated that various factors can influence changes in fleet size. USDA and VA reportedly acquired more vehicles from fiscal years 2005 to 2011 to accommodate expanded programs and services, among other factors. For example, VA acquired 5,367 additional vehicles in part to provide transportation to and from VA health care facilities for veterans who require health care services but are not able to drive themselves.

For  example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires that 75 percent of all  light duty vehicles (e.g., sedans and light trucks) acquired for federal  fleets be alternative fuel vehicles. In 2002, the Office of Management  and Budget sent a memorandum to the heads of executive branch  agencies encouraging them to examine the size of their vehicle fleets and  requiring agencies to report the size, composition, and cost of their fleets  as part of their budget submission process.

You also asked about the General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) role in helping agencies manage their  vehicle fleets. GSA\u2019s responsibilities include acquiring and in some cases  disposing of vehicles for agencies and producing an annual report about  fleet inventory size and fuel consumption as reported by federal agencies.  We found that GSA has provided services to assist agencies in managing  their fleets, including developing guidance to help determine vehicle  needs and creating tools to help agencies track vehicles. According to  GSA officials, it has the authority to promulgate regulations and issue  guidance to agencies related to fleet management, but it lacks  enforcement authority. We provide more complete information about the  role GSA plays with respect to helping agencies mange their fleets in  appendix I.

GSA prepares the federal fleet reports based on data provided  annually by federal agencies through its Web-based Federal Automotive  Statistical Tool (FAST), which GSA and the Department of Energy  established in 2000. To determine whether the federal fleet report data  were of sufficient reliability for our analysis, we reviewed the program- reporting documentation and quality assurance tests, and discussed the  various data elements with knowledgeable agency officials. We learned  that the process for reporting data is mainly dependent on the reporting  agency. We further learned, based on discussions with GSA and other  selected agency officials, that the data reported in more recent years  were of better quality than the data provided earlier. To ensure  consistency and accuracy in our analysis, we limited our data analysis to  2005 to 2011 and eliminated 21 civilian agencies from our analysis  because of missing data, consolidation, or removal from the FAST system  in later years. As a result of our review and discussions, we determined  that the data included in our analysis were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of describing fleet sizes and composition of the 43 agencies for  fiscal years 2005 to 2011.

Instead, each federal executive agency is responsible for its  own fleet. Furthermore, although some federal agencies may have a  single, centralized fleet of vehicles, others\u2019 fleets are decentralized and  dispersed among multiple sub-agencies, bureaus, or divisions. In fact, the  fleets at all of our four selected agencies consist of smaller fleets of  vehicles that belong to various bureaus and divisions.

Specifically, federal agencies are responsible for acquiring,  maintaining, and managing their vehicles. GSA\u2019s role is to develop  guidance to help agencies manage their fleets, help agencies procure  affordable vehicles, and provide reports on the federal fleet. In particular,  GSA establishes policies and issues guidance to help agencies manage  their fleets effectively and meet other federal requirements. GSA  manages both the vehicle-purchasing and vehicle-leasing programs,  thereby offering federal agencies an array of automotive products,  including alternative fuel vehicles, sedans, light trucks, buses, and heavy  trucks. In addition, GSA and the Department of Energy co-sponsor a  Web-based data- reporting portal, in which agencies annually report  information about the size and composition of vehicles, fuel consumption,  and vehicle mileage.

In fiscal year 2011, the fleets of 8 federal agencies made  up almost 80 percent of total federal vehicles, while 35 agencies made up  the remaining 21 percent (fig. 2).", "In addition to the size of their fleets, federal agencies\u2019 changed fleet  composition as well. Overall, federal agencies increased the proportion of  their fleets made up of alternative fuel vehicles (i.e., vehicles that operate  using an ethanol blended fuel, compressed natural gas, and batteries,  among others) as opposed to conventional fuel vehicles (i.e., vehicles  that operate on gasoline and diesel fuel) from about 14 percent to 33  percent from fiscal years 2005 to 2011.

The increase in the  proportion of alternative fuel vehicles should not be surprising given that  the Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires that federal agencies move toward  acquiring mostly alternative fuel sedans and trucks.", "One characteristic that did not change substantially over the period is the  extent to which federal agencies owned or leased vehicles. In fiscal year  2011, federal agencies owned about 54 percent of their vehicles, leased  about 44 percent from GSA, and leased about 2 percent from commercial  vendors.

Officials also identified fleet changes in subordinate  bureaus and divisions, but in the two cases we learned of, they were not  substantive enough to influence the direction of the agency\u2019s overall fleet  changes over the 7-year period. Further, agency officials stated that fleets  did not increase as a result of vehicles procured using Recovery Act  funds, because higher fuel-efficient vehicles replaced older, less fuel- efficient ones on a one-for-one basis.", "USDA officials we interviewed told us that additional workload and  program responsibilities contributed to the increase in USDA\u2019s fleet size.  From fiscal years 2008 to 2010, USDA\u2019s Forest Service gained nine job  corps centers from Interior Department bureaus: three from the National  Park Service in 2008 and six from the Bureau of Reclamation from fiscal  years 2009 to 2010.acquisition of additional vehicles ranging from sedans, vans, buses, and a  variety of trucks to provide the approximately 200 new employees with  the transportation and resources to accomplish additional program  responsibilities. Since the job corps centers were located in or near  national forests, they required vehicles, including buses that could  evacuate staff and students in a short period of time in the event of a  forest fire. Pick-up trucks were also acquired to take equipment to  construction job sites as part of the vocational training. USDA officials  also told us that specific subordinate agencies within USDA like the  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) also acquired  additional vehicles to accommodate an increase in the number of APHIS  personnel and drivers to complete mission requirements.", "Each of these job corps centers required the  Similarly, VA officials told us that growth in veteran services has  contributed to a significant increase in VA\u2019s fleet size. According to VA  officials, although the number of veterans declined overall, VA increased  its program services to accommodate the increasing number of veteran  health care recipients, including veterans with service-connected  disabilities from fiscal years 2000 to 2011. (See fig. 6.) Further, VA  officials indicated the agency has expanded a number of veteran services  including: mental health care and counseling services, health care  services to veterans returning from recent wars, home-based services to  disabled and elderly veterans, and rural health care services in remote  areas of the nation. According to VA officials, the increase in programs  and services to veterans and service members and resulting workload  placed pressure on the agency to increase its fleet size. For example, VA  recently acquired more vehicles to provide transportation to and from VA  health care facilities\u2014including medical centers and community-based  outpatient clinics\u2014for veterans who require health care services but are  not able to drive themselves.", "Vehicles donated by veteran service organizations have also played a  role\u2014albeit a marginal one\u2014in increasing VA\u2019s fleet, according to VA  officials. From fiscal years 2007 to 2011, the number of donated  vehicles increased from 899 to 1,451. (See fig. 7.) Although the number  of donated vehicles is small compared to the overall fleet, as of April 2012  there were 1,683 active donated vehicles, most of which belong to the  Veterans Health Administration.", "According to Air Force officials, the agency has had various fleet  downsizing policies in place and has implemented some recent efforts to  eliminate vehicles that are not mission critical. Officials also noted that the  agency has often targeted unnecessary vehicles for cost cutting.", "The Air Force has a zero growth policy prohibiting new vehicle  purchases except when a change in mission occurs (i.e., additional  aircraft assigned, new weapon systems deployed, new units assigned  to a base, etc.). Air Force officials also told us that senior fleet  management staff closely monitors any request to increase fleet size  and determines if existing vehicles can be re-assigned to cover new  mission needs.", "The Air Force takes steps to ensure that the agency is authorizing the  minimum number of vehicles necessary to support current mission  requirements by conducting in-person visits to major commands and  installations. The agency uses these in-person visits to monitor  requests to not only acquire new but also retain existing vehicles; then  it uses the information to identify and eliminate unnecessary  vehicles.", "In March 2007, the Air Force issued guidance limiting midsize to large  sedans and sport utility vehicles to only four star officers in an effort to  reduce overall vehicle ownership costs.", "In January 2011, the Air Force audited various installations and found  that 379 vehicles were utilized less than 30 percent of agency vehicle  utilization goals. The agency subsequently removed these under- utilized vehicles, a move that, according to Air Force officials, resulted  in a one-time savings to the Air Force of about $1.8 million. Officials  reported that they will continue these efforts.", "In August 2011, the agency identified over 6,000 underutilized  vehicles that, if eliminated, could save the Air Force an estimated half  a billion dollars or more in procurement and leasing costs. Since  August 2011, the Air Force has eliminated approximately 739  vehicles, comprised of a mix of GSA-leased and agency-owned  vehicles, according to Air Force officials.", "Similarly, according to Interior officials, specific bureaus within the agency  have implemented fleet downsizing efforts by identifying under-utilized  vehicles and either disposing or re-locating vehicles across the bureau.", "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM)\u2014a bureau within Interior that  administers federal lands\u2014has implemented downsizing efforts by  identifying non-essential GSA-leased vehicles for removal and  transferring under-utilized agency-owned vehicles to other bureau  offices. According to Interior officials, BLM requires its fleet managers  to monitor the utilization of its vehicles within the past 12 months to  ensure each vehicle is justified and properly utilized. As a result of  these fleet downsizing efforts, from fiscal years 2003 to 2008, BLM  reduced miles traveled by more than 5-million miles and saved almost  $3.4 million, according to Interior officials.", "Interior\u2019s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fleet personnel also regularly  examines vehicle utilization rates\u2014such as vehicle miles driven per  hour\u2014to ensure vehicles are meeting agency goals. The bureau also  identifies old and least-utilized vehicles annually. According to U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service officials, the bureau removed 451 vehicles  from its vehicle fleet from fiscal years 2007 to 2010.", "In addition to fleet downsizing efforts, two agencies expect current cost- savings measures will play a role in reducing the number of vehicles in  the future. Both Air Force and Interior anticipate decreasing their fleet size  and realizing immediate cost savings by returning GSA-leased vehicles.", "For example, although the Air Force has returned some vehicles back to  GSA, thus decreasing the Air Force\u2019s fleet size, the agency continues to  implement further reductions to its GSA-leased fleet in order to meet a  $10-million cut in vehicle-leasing funds in the agency\u2019s planned 2013  defense budget. Similarly, in a department-wide campaign to cut waste,  Interior\u2019s National Park Service plans to return approximately 300 GSA- leased vehicles and save approximately $3.4 million in fleet-related costs.  According to a GSA official, agencies that need to cut fleet-related costs  often realize immediate cash savings by turning in their GSA leased  vehicles.", "Improved fleet data management also may have helped the Air Force  decrease fleet size by identifying and cutting unnecessary vehicles,  according to Air Force fleet managers. As part of its effort to establish a  property management information system, the Air Force needed to  aggregate and validate vehicle operations data to produce an accurate,  agencywide view of its worldwide fleet, which required conducting a full  inventory of its 90,000 tactical and non-tactical vehicles around the world.

For example, in response to the May 2011 presidential  memorandum on fleet performance, USDA\u2019s Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS) prohibited new vehicle acquisitions and  made concerted efforts to reduce the size of its fleet through the disposal  of older, under-utilized, high emission vehicles. (See fig. 8.) NRCS also  decreased its fleet when the agency closed several offices and  terminated programs in response to a $30-million budget cut. According  to USDA officials, these fleet downsizing efforts helped NRCS reduce its  fleet by over 1,200 vehicles. Despite this, reductions in NRCS\u2019s fleet were  not substantial enough to influence the overall change in USDA\u2019s fleet,  which grew by 5 percent from fiscal years 2005 to 2011.", "Conversely, Interior\u2019s National Park Service increased its fleet size to  handle additional park management responsibilities even though Interior\u2019s  overall fleet size decreased.

A GSA Fleet representative monitors an agency\u2019s fleet and measures  the vehicles against a set of minimum standards (i.e., age and  mileage) as well as condition and repair history. If the representative  determines the vehicle is eligible for replacement, it will be replaced  with the same type of vehicle unless the agency indicates its needs  have changed and wants to acquire a different type of vehicle. In  cases where the requested replacement vehicle is an upgrade to a  more expensive vehicle, the agency must submit to GSA a written  justification certifying the vehicle is mission essential.", "Federal agencies may return leased vehicles that have not yet met  the replacement requirement to GSA. In cases where GSA can  transfer the vehicles to meet another agency\u2019s requests immediately,  the original leasing agency is no longer responsible for the leasing  fees. In cases where GSA cannot immediately transfer the vehicles,  the lessor agency may have to continue to make its payments. A GSA  official noted that this occurs infrequently because typically it places  vehicles within a month of receiving them.", "Once the GSA Fleet representative determines vehicles should be  replaced, he or she uses a nationwide network of commercial auction  firms to sell and dispose of them. GSA uses the sales\u2019 proceeds to  help purchase new vehicles.", "In addition to its procurement activities, GSA establishes policies and  issues guidance to help agencies manage their fleets effectively and meet  other federal requirements. GSA promulgates federal management  regulations governing federal fleet operations. It also issues fleet  guidance in the form of bulletins and promotes interagency collaboration  through various committees and councils. While GSA believes it has the  authority to require agencies to follow its regulations and to issue  guidance, GSA officials indicated it lacked enforcement authority. One  official stated that it relies on the federal agencies\u2019 Inspectors General to  take enforcement action when agencies do not comply with regulations.  GSA and the Department of Energy cosponsor the Federal Automotive  Statistical Tool (FAST), a Web-based reporting tool for agencies to report  fleet data. FAST is used to satisfy the reporting requirements of the  Energy Policy Act of 1992 and other statutory and regulatory mandates,  and GSA uses it to produce the annual federal fleet report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Maria Edelstein (Assistant Director), Gail  Marnik, Tina Paek, Russell Burnett, Jim Ungvarsky, Josh Ormond, and  Amy Rosewarne made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Federal Acquisition: Increased Attention to Vehicle Fleets Could Result in  Savings.
