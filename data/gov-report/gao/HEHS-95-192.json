As previously discussed, VA assumes that more than 6,856 beds will always be unavailable to VA because they were occupied at the time of VA\u2019s survey and that 215 empty beds in homes will always be unavailable to VA because the homes have occupancy rates of 95 percent or higher. VA agreed that its survey had missed homes but argues that the 580 beds would have been unavailable because the homes had an occupancy rate of 95 percent or higher. On this basis, VA determined that it could obtain only 105 beds for veterans in community nursing homes.", "VA\u2019s assertion does not appear sound given the large number of community nursing home beds in East Central Florida. At the time of its nursing home survey, VA was using about two-tenths of 1 percent of the 7,100 existing community beds. At issue is whether VA could increase its use to 3 to 4 percent (240 beds) of these beds. Our report clearly demonstrates that hundreds of beds in community nursing homes will become available during each year and that VA has a reasonable opportunity to secure needed nursing home beds for veterans. Should this demand exceed supply, our evidence suggests that it is likely that more community nursing homes will be built; thereby providing beds for veterans and nonveterans. VA assumed that it is the one responsible to build new nursing home bed capacity, rather than allowing the private sector to provide the beds as needed.", "VA agreed with us that occupied beds will turn over during a year, but VA asserts that such turnover will be infrequent. VA officials stated that patient stays in Florida nursing homes average 247 days a year. We believe that it is misleading to use an average length of stay when assessing nursing home turnover. This is because patients with long stays tend to skew the average. As previously discussed, about one-half of the patients admitted to community nursing homes stayed fewer then 83 days, according to the latest government survey of nursing homes. We used the median duration of nursing home stays because it represents one-half of all patients that used nursing homes. The study that we cited had reported an average length of stay of 401 days.", "VA stated that it excluded the 215 empty community nursing home beds because the maximum occupancy rate for efficient operation of a nursing home in VA and the private sector is 95 percent. The 60 nursing homes in East Central Florida had an average occupancy rate of 96 percent, and 50 had rates over 95 percent. Given the community nursing homes\u2019 operating practices, it seems reasonable that VA would be able to place some veterans in these beds. Therefore, VA should not exclude such beds from its consideration when planning for nursing home care. These beds seem to be a resource that can be used by VA.", "VA also stated that its methodology adequately considered future construction of new community nursing homes. For East Central Florida, VA\u2019s methodology for factoring in new community nursing home construction resulted in an increased use of 14 additional community nursing home beds. As discussed in our report, East Central Florida has 7 additional community nursing homes with a capacity of 900 beds that VA had not included in its survey. In addition, in 1994 the state of Florida approved for construction 1,546 additional community nursing home beds for East Central Florida. We do not believe that VA\u2019s addition of 14 community nursing home beds adequately considers new community nursing home beds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hospital Care", "paragraphs": ["VA disagreed that there was a lower-cost way to improve veterans\u2019 access to VA inpatient care than to construct a new hospital in Brevard.

First, VA questioned our analysis of hospital bed use at the three existing hospitals in Central Florida and its usefulness in evaluating lower-cost alternatives to meet VA\u2019s service goals in Central Florida. Second, VA questioned our use of data on unused beds in community hospitals. Third, VA questioned our assumption that unused beds in VA hospitals will increase over time.", "VA pointed out, and we agree, that providing VA hospital beds in East Central Florida would give veterans more reasonable access to VA inpatient care than now exists. VA stated that our references to unused beds in the three existing hospitals leave the impression that those hospitals are readily accessible to veterans in East Central Florida. It is not our intent to suggest that the three VA hospitals are readily accessible and we have added the distances between the hospitals and East Central Florida to the report. Rather, our analysis shows that there are beds available for East Central Florida veterans if they desire to use them.", "However, we intended to demonstrate that the former Orlando Naval hospital would give veterans more reasonable access to VA inpatient care than now exists. Moreover, our analysis shows that the availability of unused beds in the three existing VA hospitals, when used in conjunction with the former Naval Hospital, could substantially enhance the availability of inpatient care to East Central Florida veterans.", "Our assessment of veterans\u2019 use of the existing VA hospitals in Central Florida was twofold. First, we examined veterans use of existing VA hospitals in Central Florida to have a basis for assessing the adequacy of VA\u2019s projections of veterans\u2019 future demand for hospital beds in East Central Florida. Historical use data for existing VA hospitals show that VA\u2019s use of national rather than local use rates may greatly overestimate the potential use of the proposed hospital in Brevard. Second, we identified unused beds in VA\u2019s existing Central Florida hospitals to determine the potential bed capacity that could be available for (1) referrals if demand exceeds the capacity of the planned hospital in Brevard or the former Orlando Naval Hospital or (2) conversion for other uses, such as psychiatric care.", "VA stated that it was unclear why we used a work load projection methodology focusing on three existing VA hospitals in Central Florida. VA asserts that our analysis was not focused on the same planning assumptions used by VA, which focused on East Central Florida demographics. We used VA\u2019s work load projection methodology without adjustment. We did, however, apply different veteran utilization data to VA\u2019s East Central Florida demographics; that is, we used historical use rates for three existing VA hospitals in Central Florida, while VA used historical VA hospital use rates for veterans nationwide. As our report shows, the number of beds projected based on national rates is about double the number of beds projected based on local rates.", "VA stated that we have overestimated the numbers of unused beds in existing VA hospitals. VA contends that there are 158 available unused beds rather than the 535 beds we cited. VA\u2019s adjustment is based on (1) an occupancy rate of 85 percent, which it states is the maximum occupancy rate for operating an efficient hospital, and (2) 1,433 beds in-service at the three existing VA hospitals. While we recognize that using an 85-percent occupancy rate standard may provide a reasonable means of estimating unused beds, we believe that it should be applied to the hospital\u2019s total bed capacity rather than to just those beds now in-service. In this regard, VA\u2019s three hospitals had 162 beds out of service. Using VA\u2019s suggested methodology, this would result in about 300 unused beds in the three hospitals rather than the 158 VA estimated. In any case, our assessment of unused beds was intended to determine whether beds would be available for referrals from Brevard or the former Orlando Naval Hospital or for conversion to other uses, such as psychiatric care. By either VA\u2019s or our estimate, a significant number of beds appear to be available for those purposes.", "VA also questioned whether the number of unused beds will increase over time. VA stated that whether this will occur due to unresolved issues of health care and eligibility reform or VA\u2019s initiatives to improve patient privacy and increase ambulatory care activities is not known. Our position that unused beds will increase is based on VA\u2019s future bed use estimates derived from its 1994 Integrated Planning Model. We share VA\u2019s concern about the potential effects of such outside factors on the accuracy of its bed projections. As discussed in our report, such uncertainties raise concerns about the usefulness of basing VA\u2019s estimate of future bed needs solely on veterans\u2019 historical use of VA facilities.", "VA also expressed concern that our estimate of 2,300 unused beds in local community hospitals was overstated for the same reasons as previously expressed for VA\u2019s unused beds. VA also stated that these beds may not be totally suitable for its use.

Second, VA states that the psychiatry programs planned at Brevard are not comparable to care now provided at existing Florida VA hospitals.", "VA has 10 years to convert beds at its existing hospitals in order to achieve projected use of 230 psychiatric beds proposed for Brevard in the year 2005. While we agree that there are not now 230 unused beds in contiguous space at any one hospital, more beds will become available if VA\u2019s inpatient work load continues to decrease as it has over the last 4 years. We believe that VA has the flexibility to consolidate wards at each hospital to provide a portion of the 230 beds.
