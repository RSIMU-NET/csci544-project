The agency's financial system computing environment had deficiencies in several areas and the controls that were in place were not always effectively implemented to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to the agency network and systems. Specifically, FHFA did not always maintain authorization records for network and system access, enforce the most restrictive access needed by users on shared network files and directories, and enforce the most restrictive set of rights needed by users to perform their assigned duties. Further, it did not effectively implement physical protection and environmental safety controls over its facilities and information technology resources. GAO identified numerous instances in which FHFA facilities were not adequately secured and was able to obtain unauthorized access from outside agency facilities into the agency's interior space containing sensitive information and information technology equipment. FHFA officials acknowledged these shortcomings and indicated that the agency has taken steps or is planning to take steps to mitigate these deficiencies. A key reason for the control deficiencies in FHFA's financial system computing environment is that the agency has not yet fully implemented its agencywide information security program to ensure that controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively. Although FHFA made important progress in developing and documenting elements of its information security program, written policies, procedures, and technical standards do not reflect the current operating environment. Further, the agency has not yet developed, documented, and implemented sufficient policies and procedures to ensure that the activities performed by external third parties are monitored for compliance with FHFA's policies.

The risks  to these systems are well-founded for a number of reasons, including the  dramatic increase in reports of security incidents, the ease of obtaining  and using hacking tools, and steady advances in the sophistication and  effectiveness of attack technology. The Federal Bureau of Investigation  has identified multiple sources of threats, including foreign nation states  engaged in intelligence gathering and information warfare, domestic  criminals, hackers, virus writers, and disgruntled employees or  contractors working within an organization. In addition, the U.S. Secret  Service and the CERT\u00ae Coordination Center studied insider threats in the  government sector and stated in a January 2008 report that \u201cgovernment  sector insiders have the potential to pose a substantial threat by virtue of  their knowledge of, and access to, employer systems and/or databases.\u201d", "Our previous reports, and those by federal Inspectors General, describe  persistent information security weaknesses that place federal agencies at  risk of disruption, fraud, or inappropriate disclosure of sensitive  information.

Organizations accomplish this objective by designing and implementing  controls that are intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized  access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities. Such  controls include both logical access and physical access controls. Logical  access controls include requiring users to authenticate themselves and  limiting the files and other resources that authenticated users can access  and the actions that these users can execute. Physical access controls  involve restricting physical access to computer resources and protecting  these resources from intentional or unintentional loss or impairment.  Without adequate access controls, unauthorized individuals, including  external intruders and former employees, can surreptitiously read and  copy sensitive information and make undetected changes or deletions for  malicious purposes or personal gain. In addition, authorized users can  intentionally or unintentionally read, add, delete, modify, or execute  changes that are outside their span of authority.", "FHFA has multiple deficiencies in the access controls intended to restrict  logical and physical access to the agency\u2019s information and systems.

A key component of granting or denying  access rights is the concept of \u201cleast privilege\u201d which is a basic principle  for securing computer resources and information. This principle means  that users are granted only those access rights and permissions they need  to perform their official duties. To restrict legitimate users\u2019 access to only  those programs and files they need to do their work, organizations  establish access rights and permissions. \u201cUser rights\u201d are allowable  actions that can be assigned to users or to groups of users. File and  directory permissions are rules that regulate which users can access a  particular file or directory and the extent of that access. To avoid  unintentionally authorizing users\u2019 access to sensitive files and directories,  an organization must give careful consideration to its assignment of rights  and permissions. Furthermore, National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 states that system access  should be granted based on a valid access authorization and intended  system usage and the most restrictive access needed by users for  accounts, files, and directories needs to be enforced. Finally, FHFA policy  requires that information systems enforce the most restrictive set of rights  needed by users to perform their assigned duties.", "FHFA implemented numerous controls to prevent, limit, and detect logical  access to its financial systems and information. For example, it enforced  the use of (1) network user names and complex passwords, and (2) two- factor authentication for remote access to FHFA\u2019s networks. In addition,  wireless access to the network is prohibited inside the FHFA facilities  unless approved by the Chief Information Officer or the Chief Information  Security Officer.", "However, deficiencies in controlling logical access diminished the  effectiveness of these controls and placed information resources at risk.  For example, FHFA did not always maintain authorization records for  network and system access, enforce the most restrictive access needed by  users on shared network files and directories, and restrict access to  sensitive system resources. To illustrate:    FHFA did not maintain network access authorizations for every agency  network user and authorization records contained notes that indicated  records were incomplete. Specifically, the agency could not provide  authorization for 20 of 30 users reviewed. If network and system access  authorizations are not fully documented and monitored, increased risk  exists that users may be granted unauthorized and unintended network  and system access.", "FHFA established server files and directories that allowed network users  to access agency and regulated-entity confidential information even  though such users did not have a business need for this information. To  illustrate, using network accounts with access privileges normally granted  to all network end users, we were able to access sensitive and confidential  regulatory information\u2014including internal meeting notes, a mortgage  market analysis, and a liquidity report for a regulated entity\u2014on a server  which hosted a FHFA examiner support system. Additionally, we were  able to read documents labeled confidential on a shared drive. The  network accounts were also unnecessarily given the rights to access and  modify database files on a system the agency uses for financial analysis.  By not restricting access to this confidential information to only personnel  with an authorized need for access, FHFA risks the possibility that  sensitive information could be used for unintended purposes, which could  impact the ability of the agency to carry out its organizational mission.", "FHFA did not always sufficiently restrict system rights to only those  needed by users to perform their assigned duties. For example, the agency  did not sufficiently restrict user access to privileged accounts. Local user  network accounts had rights that permitted the user to create new local  workstation accounts and then escalate these accounts to have local  administrator privileges. These accounts could then be used to create  privileged accounts on other agency workstations by remotely connecting  to them. This would allow malicious insiders to grant themselves or others  access to sensitive information technology and communications  resources. Local administrator accounts could also be used to install  unauthorized software that could disrupt agency operations and capture  various user credentials, such as those used to access the agency\u2019s  financial applications. The Chief Information Officer\u2019s office stated that  this deficiency existed because users were given privileged access to their  workstations to facilitate the agency\u2019s integration of its general support  systems. It also stated the privileged access was only intended for  temporary use and the fact that the access was not removed after the  integration phase was completed was an error.", "FHFA informed us it is currently developing an access control procedure  to revalidate user access levels for network and system access. FHFA  plans to finalize this procedure as part of future phases of integrating its  general support systems. According to agency officials, this should occur  by June 2010. Officials also said that access has been restricted to (1)  administrators, (2) application users, or (3) specific agency personnel  based on input from information owners.

In addition, as part of a risk management approach to manage  information technology assets, the agency implemented comprehensive  scanning of production systems on a monthly basis to identify and correct  system vulnerabilities. During the year, the agency expanded and  improved its information security awareness training, providing a required  automated training program to all employees and contractors.", "However, policies, procedures, plans, and technical standards related to  information security did not always reflect the current agency operating  environment; and FHFA did not always effectively monitor its systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policies, Procedures, Plans, and Technical Standards Related to Information Security do not Reflect the Current Operating Environment", "paragraphs": ["A key task in developing an effective information security program is to  establish and implement policies, procedures, plans, and technical  standards that govern security over an agency\u2019s computing environment.  Developing, documenting, and implementing security policies are the  primary mechanisms by which management communicates its views and  requirements; these policies also serve as the basis for adopting specific  procedures and technical controls. According to NIST Special Publication  800-53, these policies should include separation of incompatible duties,  configuration management policies and procedures, and contingency  plans.", "Configuration management is an important control that involves the  identification and management of security features for all hardware and  software components of an information system at a given point and  systematically controls changes to that configuration during the system\u2019s  life cycle. Establishing controls over the modification of information  system components and related documentation helps to prevent  unauthorized changes and ensure that only authorized systems and related  program modifications are implemented. This is accomplished by  instituting policies, procedures, and techniques that help make sure all  hardware, software, and firmware programs and program modifications  are properly authorized, tested, and approved.", "Contingency planning is another critical component of information  protection. If normal operations are interrupted, network managers must  be able to detect, mitigate, and recover from service disruptions while  preserving access to vital information. A contingency plan is used to detail  emergency response, backup operations, and disaster recovery for  information systems. To be effective, these plans need to be clearly  documented, communicated to potentially affected staff, and updated to  reflect current operations. NIST also recommends continuity of operations  and disaster recovery plans.", "If properly implemented, policies and procedures should help reduce the  risk that could come from unauthorized access or disruption of services.

For example:    While FHFA had a separation of incompatible duties policy in place from  the former FHFB, the agency did not develop and document procedures  for enforcing separation of duties. Agency officials stated that the agency  has initiated a project to develop processes for the 18 security control  families identified by NIST and will integrate separation of duties  procedures into these processes; the expected completion date is June  2010.", "The agency did not finalize and approve configuration management policy  and procedures. FHFA is using an interim change control and  configuration process that was used at FHFB and has developed a draft  configuration management procedure; however, it has not been formalized  and approved. Agency officials stated that a plan has been developed to  train users and implement FHFA configuration management policy and  procedures by May 2010.", "Although FHFA has developed continuity of operations and disaster  recovery plans, it has not formalized and approved them.
