FHLBank officials stated nondepository CDFIs have different risks compared with depository members (for example, nondepository CDFIs are not supervised by a prudential federal or state regulator as are other FHLBank members). To address these risks, they imposed more restrictive requirements. Some of the nondepository CDFIs GAO interviewed cited limited availability of eligible collateral and steep haircuts as challenges for obtaining advances and therefore a disincentive to seeking membership. Less than half of the nondepository CDFIs that were members as of September 2014 had borrowed from the FHLBanks; the cumulative advances from October 2010 to September 2014 totaled about $307 million (less than 1 percent of the total advances outstanding as of December 2014).

All the other FHLBanks have had policies that allowed mortgage  loans as eligible collateral from nondepository CDFIs since nondepository  CDFIs became eligible for membership in 2010. Officials from FHLBanks  in Atlanta, New York, and Pittsburgh stated that due to the different risks  posed by nondepository CDFIs, they initially took conservative stances on  accepting loan collateral. The risks they cited included the lack of a clear  resolution mechanism in the case of bankruptcy and the FHLBank not  being able to obtain blanket liens on pledged collateral.", "Within the general collateral categories (such as securities and mortgage  loans), each FHLBank can impose specific collateral eligibility  requirements, such as the quality of the collateral. For example, for  nondepository CDFIs, one FHLBank disallows nonagency mortgage- backed securities, another FHLBank disallows commercial real estate  collateral, and five FHLBanks disallow home equity lines of credit or home  equity loans. At two FHLBanks, nondepository CDFIs can pledge  mortgage loan collateral only if the CDFIs have certain credit ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collateral Requirements for Nondepository CDFIs Are Comparable to Those for Higher-Risk Institutions", "paragraphs": ["The collateral requirements\u2014specifically, the pledge method and  haircuts\u2014applicable to nondepository CDFIs seeking advances are  comparable to those generally imposed on depository members  categorized as higher risk and, in some cases, to those imposed on  insurance companies. Based on our review of each FHLBank\u2019s policies,  all FHLBanks evaluate the creditworthiness and financial condition of their  members, including nondepository CDFIs. Factors included in many of  the evaluations are capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality,  earnings, and liquidity. Additionally, the FHLBanks (with the exception of  Topeka) assign credit ratings to their depository members that indicate   Of the  the creditworthiness and financial condition of these members.11 FHLBanks that assign credit ratings to depository members, 9 also  assign credit ratings to nondepository CDFIs, with 2 (Atlanta and San  Francisco) using a separate rating system specific to nondepository  CDFIs. The remaining FHLBanks (New York and Indianapolis) do not  assign credit ratings to nondepository CDFIs. While the metrics and  methodology used to evaluate members differ, policies across FHLBanks  generally reflect differential treatment between depository institutions and  nondepository CDFIs (and other nondepository institutions such as  insurance companies). For example, all FHLBanks require nondepository  members to deliver collateral but generally only depository members with  low credit ratings are required to list or deliver collateral.", "The FHLBanks differed in the extent to which they varied haircuts  (discounts) for nondepository CDFIs and depository institutions. For  securities collateral, eight FHLBanks imposed the same haircut on  nondepository CDFIs as on depository members for all eligible types of  securities collateral. In contrast, four imposed higher haircut ranges on  nondepository CDFIs. For loan collateral,  six FHLBanks generally applied the same haircuts to nondepository  CDFIs and depository institutions. One applied a higher-range haircut  for single-family mortgages to nondepository CDFIs than to depository  institutions; five FHLBanks applied higher haircut ranges to nondepository CDFIs  than to depository institutions; and another FHLBank applied the lower end of the haircut range to  nondepository CDFIs.", "FHLBanks generally varied the haircut based on the types and quality of  collateral, credit score or financial condition of the member, and pledge  method (for loans).

In general, advance terms and  conditions varied widely. For example, FHLBanks offered advances with  terms to maturity ranging from overnight to 30 years. FHLBanks may  establish an overall credit limit for their borrowers. For example, the  overall credit limit for FHLBank-Chicago was 35 percent of a member\u2019s  total assets. However, the amount a borrower can obtain is also partly  dependent upon the amount and value of qualifying collateral available to  secure the advance. FHLBanks may impose additional restrictions  depending on the financial condition of the borrower, such as restrictions  on the type of product, term of advance, and amount of credit available.  Examples of specific conditions imposed on nondepository CDFIs by the  four FHLBanks include the following:", "FHLBank-Des Moines imposed a maximum amount of borrowing  capacity and term available based on member credit ratings.

Officials from FHFA have  made themselves available for questions about and problem solving in  relation to the rules. According to FHFA and FHLBank officials as well as  nondepository CDFIs we interviewed, FHFA has been encouraging  FHLBanks to discuss ways in which they could increase nondepository  CDFI membership and access to advances in a safe and sound manner.  For example, at a speech to the FHLBank boards and executive  management in early 2014, FHFA encouraged all the FHLBanks to meet  collectively to discuss collateral practices that might facilitate advance  activity with nondepository CDFIs, and emphasized the importance of the  FHLBanks\u2019 understanding of CDFI business models and funding needs.  According to FHFA officials, as a result of that speech, the FHLBanks  held a conference in August 2014 with the nondepository CDFI  community to discuss facilitating membership and better understand the  business of nondepository CDFIs.

Specifically, FHLBank-Chicago noted that an  FHLBank likely would go through the federal bankruptcy process to settle  claims if a nondepository CDFI with FHLBank credit outstanding failed,  whereas a federal or state regulator would facilitate the process to settle  claims if a regulated institution such as a bank, credit union, or insurance  company with FHLBank credit outstanding failed. However, the purposes  of our report explicitly include discussing how nondepository CDFIs differ  from other members of the FHLBank System (in particular, depository  members) and the membership and collateral requirements for these  CDFIs. We understand that risks vary by type of institution and noted  several differences\u2014including in supervision and the liquidation of  assets\u2014between nondepository CDFIs and other types of FHLBank  members in our report. Comparing the collateral requirements for  nondepository CDFIs with those for depository institutions enabled us to  determine how the FHLBanks address the different risks posed by  nondepository CDFIs. Moreover, in terms of resolution treatments, there  is no uniform approach to settling claims even within the category of  \u201cregulated institutions.\u201d For instance, FHFA stated in one of its advisory  bulletins that \u201cFHLBanks face risks lending to insurance companies that  differ in certain respects with lending to federally-insured depository  institutions\u201d and noted that \u201claws dealing with a failed insured depository  institution are well known and uniform across the country, whereas, the  laws dealing with the failure of an insurance company are less well known  to the FHLBanks and, though similar, may vary somewhat from state to  state.\u201d Therefore, we maintain that our comparisons were fair and made  no change to the report in response to this comment.", "In another comment, FHLBank-Chicago stated that the report implies that  by loosening collateral requirements (some of which are dictated by law  or regulation), more nondepository CDFIs would be eligible or willing to  become FHLBank members. It noted that this was not necessarily the  case, as a majority of nondepository CDFIs would not qualify for  membership because of their lines of business (small business lending,  microlending, and commercial lending) and because they have  encumbered assets. We believe that these points are already adequately  addressed in our report. Specifically, in the report we note that the types  of eligible collateral are dictated by regulation. In addition, we state in the  report that FHFA officials told us that some nondepository CDFIs may not  be good candidates for FHLBank membership because the majority of  nondepository CDFIs make nonhousing loans such as microloans, small  business loans, and commercial loans.  Furthermore, we note that  several FHLBanks and nondepository CDFIs we interviewed told us that  the requirement to pledge unencumbered assets was a challenge for  nondepository CDFIs.

In  addition, we reviewed other relevant information from the FHLBanks and  CDFI industry, such as reports by the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) and the  Opportunity Finance Network. We determined that these studies were  methodologically sound and reliable for our purposes.

We assessed the reliability of data from both  systems by reviewing any relevant documentation, interviewing  knowledgeable officials, and analyzing the data for logical consistency  and completeness. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of assessing rates of membership for nondepository  CDFIs.", "To determine each FHLBank\u2019s requirements for obtaining advances and  any differences among the FHLBanks, we reviewed relevant  documentation such as each FHLBank\u2019s collateral guidelines and product  and credit policies. Using these documents, we identified the haircut  (discount) for eligible collateral types for depository and nondepository  institutions and other collateral requirements, such as the term of  advances and collateral pledging methods. Our review of FHLBank  documents showed that FHLBanks do not describe their collateral  requirements uniformly. Although we took several steps that enabled us  to present comparable categories of collateral across the FHLBanks, our  analysis did not account for differences in the eligibility criteria for  collateral that may be accepted, such as quality of collateral. As a result,  the haircuts for different FHLBanks are not comparable. First, we  excluded from our analysis the following types of collateral because they  were only mentioned in some FHLBanks\u2019 documents: U.S. Treasury  separate trading of registered interest and principal securities, agency  structured bonds, agency collateralized mortgage obligation accrual  bonds, second mortgage-backed securities, student loan asset-backed  securities, agricultural real estate loans, land loans, construction loans,  student loans, mutual funds, and municipal or state and local securities.  Second, because some FHLBanks identified specific haircuts for  securities, such as those originating from the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, while other FHLBanks listed haircuts for a general category  of agency securities, we grouped all the agency securities and provided  the range of haircuts. We included in the agency securities category any  securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, including those  originating from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National  Credit Union Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the  Federal Home Loan Banks, and the Small Business Administration. Third,  because some FHLBanks identified specific haircuts for specific  government-guaranteed loan collateral while others did not, we grouped  all government-guaranteed loan collateral together, including loans  originating from the Farm Service Agency, Department of Agriculture,  Small Business Administration, Federal Housing Administration, and  Department of Veterans Affairs. Fourth, because haircuts can vary based  on the quality of the collateral pledged, we provided the range of haircuts  for each type of collateral accepted by each FHLBank. While we were  able to review each FHLBank\u2019s collateral policies and procedures, the  confidentiality of such information limited what we could publicly disclose  in our report. Specifically, because the collateral haircut policies of the  FHLBanks generally are considered proprietary information, we were  unable to attribute specific policies to individual FHLBanks. Where  appropriate, we used randomly assigned numbers when discussing  FHLBank collateral policies to prevent disclosure of FHLBank identities.", "Additionally, we obtained data from each FHLBank on the amount of  advances secured by each nondepository CDFI member from October  2010 to September 2014 (the most recent data available at the time of  our request). We assessed the reliability of these data by obtaining  information from the six FHLBanks that provided advances to  nondepository CDFIs on the system they used to store the data and the  procedures in place for recording and ensuring the accuracy of the data.  We also reviewed the data for logical consistency and completeness. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting the amount  of advances obtained by nondepository CDFs.
