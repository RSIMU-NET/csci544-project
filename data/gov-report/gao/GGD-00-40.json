The objective of our review was to assess State\u2019s implementation of its new responsibilities for U.S. policy formulation, coordination, and oversight regarding U.S. participation in the UPU.

These requirements for consultation are new in that USPS was not subject to similar requirements prior to enactment of the law.", "Under the new law, the Department of State may, with the consent of the president, negotiate and conclude postal treaties, conventions, and amendments within the framework of UPU agreements that are binding on the United States and other UPU member countries.  USPS can also, with the consent of the president, negotiate and conclude certain postal treaties and conventions, subject to the requirements of the new law, which specifies that USPS actions shall be consistent with the policies of the Department of State.  Further, under the new law, USPS continues to have authority to set international postal rates with the consent of the President.", "In addition, the new law specified that, starting in fiscal year 1999, USPS would allocate to State such sums as may be reasonable, documented, and auditable for State to carry out its UPU-related responsibilities under 39 U.S.C. 407.  To fulfill this requirement, the Department of State and USPS signed an interagency agreement that specified that USPS would provide $160,000 to the Department of State as reimbursement for its UPU-related activities in fiscal year 1999.", "The congressional intent behind the new law was to ensure that the development of U.S. policies for UPU-related matters was fair, evenhanded, and open to all interested parties.  A \u201cSense of Congress\u201d resolution included in the legislation stated that: \u201cIt is the sense of Congress that any treaty, convention, or amendment entered into under the authority of section 407 of title 39 of the United States Code, as amended by this section, should not grant any undue or unreasonable preference to the Postal Service, a private provider of postal services, or any other person.\u201d  In 1998, we reported that private delivery companies had made allegations that USPS had gained unfair competitive advantages through its past role as the U.S. representative in the UPU.  These concerns involved USPS\u2019 dual role as the U.S. negotiator in international agreements that set the rules for the exchange of international mail and parcels by national postal administrations as well as competitor for the delivery of outbound international items, including documents and parcels. Shortly after enactment of the new law, the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Postal Service called on the Department of State to develop a U.S. policy position toward the 1999 UPU Congress that would \u201c\u2026serve the interests of all American participants in the postal and delivery sector, whether public or private.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish our objective, we reviewed applicable laws and the legislative history and obtained documentation from the Department of State regarding its activities concerning the UPU.

In addition, State did not distribute some materials discussed at the public meetings in advance, and distributed two important proposals at the public meetings after they had been submitted to the UPU.  Further, the first two public meetings were timed to occur shortly before UPU deadlines for submitting proposals for consideration by the UPU Congress.  For these reasons, stakeholders may have had limited opportunities to provide meaningful input.", "Second, the Department of State developed policy on UPU matters in a manner that resulted in little public record of agency or stakeholder positions that related to the formulation of U.S. policy.  For example, State did not maintain minutes of the public meetings and did not solicit written comments from agencies and stakeholders that would have become part of the public record.", "Third, turnover among involved Department of State staff in the period leading up to the UPU Congress made it more difficult for State to develop the institutional continuity and expertise needed to fulfill its leadership responsibilities.  Several stakeholders said that such continuity and expertise are important to understanding complex UPU issues and to work effectively with UPU stakeholders.", "We recognize that the Department of State faced a challenging time frame because it did not assume its responsibilities until October 1998, about 4 months before the first UPU deadline for  submitting proposals to the 1999 UPU Congress and less than 1 year before the UPU Congress.  To further complicate this situation, State did not assign its UPU responsibilities to its Bureau of International Organization Affairs until January 1999, or more than 2 months after the law was enacted and less than 2 months before the first UPU deadline for the submission of proposals.

As we reported last year, State uses the FACA process in the international telecommunications sector to coordinate with other federal agencies and private-sector advisory groups.  FACA was enacted to ensure that (1) valid needs exist for establishing and continuing advisory committees, (2) the committees are properly managed and their proceedings are as open as possible to the public, and (3) Congress is kept informed of the committees\u2019 activities.  FACA and its implementing regulations generally require that (1) agendas and meeting information, such as time, date, place, and purpose, be published in the Federal Register; (2) detailed minutes of each advisory committee meeting be kept; (3) an annual report be sent to the General Services Administration (GSA), which then is to report to Congress on the activities, status, and any changes in the advisory committees; and (4) the membership of the advisory committees be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations Relating to Public Meetings", "paragraphs": ["Concerning notification issues, the Department of State gave limited advance notice of public meetings in the Federal Register and conducted limited outreach to notify stakeholders of these meetings.

In November 1998, shortly after the Department of State assumed the lead role for the UPU, the Chairman of ACCA\u2019s International Committee wrote State to petition it \u201c\u2026to develop, by means of a public rulemaking, an open and progressive Statement of Position towards the 1999 Beijing Congress of the UPU.\u201d  The letter proposed that, given the February deadline for submission of proposed amendments to certain UPU acts, State issue a notice of proposed rulemaking, setting out the basic issues, not later than December 1, 1998; that the notice should indicate that all comments would be posted on the Internet as soon as they were received; that the notice should encourage the public to file specific legislative proposals with comments; and that the notice should indicate that draft portions of the U.S. Statement  of Position would be posted on the Internet and amenable to immediate public comment as they became available.  Further, the ACCA letter proposed that State should set out specific written procedures for the distribution of UPU policy documents to all interested parties, preferably on the Internet.  State did not implement these suggestions.", "In November 1999, the Chairman of ACCA\u2019s International Committee again wrote the Department of State to request that State initiate a \u201c\u2026broad review of U.S. policy towards the international exchange of documents and parcels\u201d and to urge it \u201cto adopt, as soon as possible, open and transparent procedures for developing U.S. policy toward the international exchange of documents and parcels.\u201d  ACCA stated that, to the maximum extent possible, a full record of all proposals, comments, and proceedings should be publicly available on the Internet.  Other related stakeholder comments included those from a DMA official who told us that, in his opinion, DMA should not make comments on UPU matters unless it was willing to make them part of the public record, which could include posting them to the Internet.", "A more complete and readily accessible public record would inform interested parties of matters under consideration as U.S. policy is developed.  A more readily accessible public record of stakeholder positions on U.S. policy relating to the UPU could also help interested parties understand the basis for U.S. policy as well as facilitating input as the Department of State continues to develop policies and positions on UPU matters.  Options, which are not all mutually exclusive, for State to develop a more complete and accessible public record  include the following:", "Implementing the FACA process: As we previously noted, FACA requires notification of advisory committee meetings in the Federal Register and documentation, including detailed minutes of the proceedings of committee meetings, as well as annual status reports to Congress through a formal reporting process.", "Using a notice and comment process to provide a structured process for obtaining public input: Federal agencies have used the Federal Register and the Internet to solicit comments that were to become part of the public record.  For example, USTR, a small agency that takes the lead in representing the United States in international trade negotiations in the WTO, solicited comments before the 1999 WTO Ministerial Meetings in the Federal Register and posted this solicitation on its Internet site. The Department of Commerce has also solicited comments in the Federal Register and on the Internet, and posted comments it received on the Internet.", "Making input, minutes, and/or proceedings of public meetings available in reading rooms, upon request, or on the Internet: For example, USTR made comments it received before the 1999 WTO Ministerial Meetings available to the public in a reading room.  The Department of Commerce made a transcript of some advisory committee meetings available on the Internet. Also, among other things, the Department of Commerce has used the Internet to broadcast a voice transmission of a meeting to obtain stakeholder input.", "As we noted earlier in this report, FACA was enacted to ensure that the proceedings of advisory committees to federal agencies are as open as possible to the public and that Congress is kept informed of the committees\u2019 activities.  However, several officials of agencies other than the Department of State as well as a DMA official have expressed concern that a formal process for stakeholder consultations on UPU matters, such as FACA, could be counterproductive and burdensome to the Department of State.  One official from another agency said that mandating an advisory committee under FACA could detract from the cooperation that would be desirable and that more timely meetings and more notice of meetings were needed.  Another official said that agency officials and others would be reluctant to comment at open meetings and that agency officials would be more forthcoming at closed interagency meetings.  Further, a postal official said that a more formal process would require more resources, which would be diverted from other Department of State activities.  A DMA official expressed strong concern that if State used a formal process such as FACA to build a public record, it would be bureaucratic and would generate a great deal of paper.  He said that it would be important not to make the consultation process overburdensome.", "In this regard, we reported last year that 10 of 19 agencies we surveyed that accounted for about 90 percent of federal advisory committees considered FACA requirements to be more useful than burdensome and that 13 considered the requirement to keep detailed minutes of advisory committee meetings to be useful to a great or very great extent.  Advisory committee members responding to our survey conveyed a generally shared perception that the committees were providing balanced and independent advice and recommendations.  Although the percentage differed by question, 85 to 93 percent said that their committees were balanced in membership, had access to the information necessary to make informed decisions, and were never asked by agency officials to give advice or make recommendations based on inadequate data or analysis or contrary to the general consensus among committee members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations Related to the Development of Continuity and Expertise", "paragraphs": ["Turnover among the Department of State staff in the period leading up to the UPU Congress made it more difficult for State to develop the institutional continuity and expertise needed to fulfill its leadership responsibilities.  Representatives of federal and nonfederal organizations in the U.S. delegation to the UPU Congress said that staff turnover, combined with the limited time available before the UPU Congress, affected State\u2019s ability to fully understand the implications associated with various UPU policy issues, as well as to fully understand how to build support for U.S. policies in the UPU.  They said that institutional continuity and expertise would be important to State\u2019s effectiveness on UPU matters in the future.  State officials said that they recognize that, if State intends to play a leadership role in the UPU, it will need to provide sufficient institutional continuity and expertise on UPU matters.", "After assuming its new UPU responsibilities, the Department of State assigned officials from its Bureau of International Organization Affairs to work on UPU matters.  Since October 21, 1998, at one time or another, 11 State officers and 4 clerical staff members were involved with UPU affairs, although none of them devoted all of their time to UPU matters, according to State.  However, staff turnover occurred repeatedly:", "Two Department of State staff members working on UPU matters transferred to new assignments shortly before the UPU Congress, including the staff member who worked on UPU matters before 1999.", "The Department of State assigned several staff members who had not previously worked on UPU or postal matters to work on UPU matters shortly before the UPU Congress.", "The Director of the Department of State\u2019s Office of Technical and Specialized Agencies, Bureau of International Organization Affairs, who was the second-ranking official that handled UPU matters on a day-to-day basis before the UPU Congress, retired shortly afterward.", "As a result of limited continuity and expertise, the Department of State relied on USPS for continuity and expertise on UPU matters, according to federal and nonfederal representatives in the U.S. delegation to the UPU Congress.  For example, USPS officials said that State finalized nearly all of the position papers that USPS drafted on proposals before the UPU Congress, without change.  USPS officials said that continuity at the staff level would enable the Department of State to take on more of the policy support role relating to the UPU. According to USPS officials, it takes more than a year to come up to speed on UPU issues.", "Turnover is a continuing challenge for the Department of State because while the UPU operates on a 5-year cycle, State\u2019s Foreign Service Officers usually rotate to new responsibilities every 2 or 3 years.  State reported in October 1999 that 9 of the 11 officers who had been involved with UPU affairs were career Foreign Service Officers subject to normal rotational assignments within the Foreign Service system.  State reported that rotation and reassignment of Foreign Service Officers is a common practice and ordinarily is required under long-standing departmental regulations.", "Representatives of USPS, federal agencies, DMA, and ACCA who were in the U.S. delegation to the UPU Congress said that providing sufficient institutional continuity and expertise on UPU matters should be a top priority for the Department of State.  They said that such continuity and expertise is important to understanding complex UPU issues and to work effectively with UPU stakeholders.  Specifically, they said that policy development for the UPU Congress typically takes place over a multiyear period.  Many UPU issues are complex and long-standing; staff with sufficient continuity and expertise can understand and synthesize conflicting stakeholder input, handle day-to-day oversight tasks, and develop an understanding of how to deal with developed and developing countries in the UPU; and advocacy of U.S. policy in the UPU is aided by development of personal relationships with representatives of other countries, which develop over an extended period through interaction at UPU meetings.", "Continuity and expertise in these interrelated areas would be helpful in developing U.S. policies concerning complex UPU matters and in building support for those policies among diverse stakeholders.  The UPU is continuing to discuss (1) whether to make fundamental reforms to its mission, role, and policies; (2) the structure of payments that postal administrations make to each other for the delivery of inbound international mail; and (3) the degree to which the UPU will allow interested parties to observe its deliberations and participate in discussions of UPU matters.  Further, issues of maintaining and promoting worldwide universal postal service\u2014a key purpose of the UPU\u2014are also being discussed.  Private delivery companies continue to raise the issue of unfair competition.  UPU issues have implications for USPS and the international postal and delivery services sector, which is a critical part of this nation\u2019s infrastructure for international communications and trade and is expected to become even more vital over the next decade with the continued growth of trade and electronic commerce and the globalization of postal and delivery service providers.", "Continuity and expertise will be important not only for the next UPU Congress in 2004, but also in order to ensure that the Department of State is able to participate in activities leading up to the UPU Congress.  For example, the United States is a member of the UPU\u2019s High-Level Group on the future development of the UPU, which is scheduled to produce an interim report in 2000 and a final report in 2001, when it is scheduled to recommend whether the UPU should hold a plenipotentiary meeting of all member countries in 2002.", "Options, which are not all mutually exclusive, for the Department of State to provide institutional continuity and expertise on UPU matters include the following:", "Assessing staffing needs and taking action: The Department of State has the opportunity to continue to assess its staffing resources and to take steps to provide the necessary staff continuity and expertise to handle its UPU responsibilities.  Department of State officials responsible for UPU matters have recognized the opportunity to conduct this assessment, with a view toward providing some staff resources from among career staff who are not Foreign Service Officers.  State officials have said that they may also consider other staffing options that involve working with Department of State units outside the Bureau of International Organization Affairs that possess relevant skills and experience, such as the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs.", "Assigning career staff to handle UPU matters: These staff could be assigned to handle UPU-related activities for a longer time period than Foreign Service Officers, and thus develop more continuity and expertise. One agency official said that one option would be to assign a staff member to track matters relating to the postal and distribution sectors, which may surface in the UPU, the WTO, and other international organizations.", "Committing high-level staff to UPU matters: A high-level staff member assigned to UPU matters over a long period could develop experience and expertise, as well as personal relationships with foreign and postal officials.

State\u2019s performance in implementing its new responsibilities was uneven in that we found strengths in some areas and opportunities for improvement in others.", "The Department of State made progress in providing stakeholders and the public with relevant information and giving them an opportunity to offer input.  State took steps to consult with interested parties and the public and to coordinate with USPS, other federal agencies, and other nongovernmental stakeholders involved in UPU matters through their inclusion in the U.S. delegation to the UPU Congress.  Stakeholders said that State was receptive to input and evenhanded in its consideration of views.  State also took steps to increase stakeholder access to UPU documents and UPU meetings.  State also clearly signaled key changes in U.S. policy concerning UPU reform.", "However, the Department of State has opportunities for improvement in several areas.  State gave 9 to 17 days of advance notice of the public meetings on UPU matters, did not distribute some materials discussed at the public meetings in advance, and distributed two important proposals at the public meetings after they had been submitted to the UPU.  Further, the first two public meetings were timed to occur shortly before UPU deadlines for submitting proposals for consideration by the UPU Congress. For these reasons, stakeholders may have had limited opportunities to give meaningful input.  In addition, the limited public record of agency or stakeholder positions on U.S. policy concerning UPU issues may make it difficult for Congress and other interested parties to fully understand the basis for U.S. policy positions.", "Several options exist for the Department of State to develop a more structured and open process for obtaining stakeholder input, including ensuring better and more advance notification of public meetings and more advance distribution of materials prior to these meetings.  Some stakeholders raised concerns about the potential burden of a formalized process, such as FACA, as well as whether such a process would be beneficial.  In this regard, we have reported that 10 of 19 agencies we surveyed considered FACA requirements to be more useful than burdensome, and that 13 agencies considered the requirement to keep detailed minutes of advisory committee meetings to be useful to a great or very great extent.", "Further, staff turnover made it more difficult for the Department of State to provide institutional continuity and expertise on UPU matters.  In our view, providing sufficient institutional continuity and expertise will be essential if State intends to play a leadership role in handling complex UPU issues and dealing with domestic and international stakeholders. Continuity and expertise will also be critical to evaluating conflicting positions by various stakeholders, developing U.S. policies on UPU issues, and effectively advocating them in the UPU.   State has several options to improve in this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of State take appropriate steps to (1) establish a process for developing U.S. policy on UPU matters that would be more structured, timely, open, and conducive to meaningful stakeholder input as well as develop a readily accessible public record and (2) provide sufficient staff continuity and expertise to handle its UPU responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State provided comments on a draft of this report in a letter dated January 10, 2000.

State also commented that, concerning substantive UPU issues, it was very pleased with the progress that had been made in a very short time.", "In response to our first recommendation that State establish a more structured and open process for developing U.S. policy on UPU matters, State acknowledged that it had not given sufficient advance notice of public meetings on UPU-related matters and that minutes should have been kept at those meetings to build a concrete record. State said it can achieve the intended results of FACA without establishing a formal advisory committee through open meetings, adequate public notice, and preservation of meeting minutes.  In addition, State reported that it intends to publish more UPU-related material on State\u2019s Internet site and to periodically notify stakeholders of important documents that appear on UPU\u2019s Internet site.", "We agree that these steps would be useful.  However, it is not clear to us what process State intends to use to formulate and coordinate U.S. policy on UPU matters.  For example, State did not address whether it would distribute materials in advance of public meetings, make key U.S. proposals available before they are submitted to the UPU, and schedule meetings in a manner conducive to meaningful stakeholder input.  In addition, it is not clear what UPU-related documents will be made publicly available so that Congress and other interested parties can understand the basis for U.S. policy positions.  For these reasons, it is not clear to us whether State will fully implement our recommendation concerning its process for developing policy on UPU matters.", "In regard to our second recommendation that State  provide sufficient staff continuity and expertise to handle its UPU responsibilities, it is not clear how State will respond.  State commented that its standard practice is for the vast majority of policy officer positions to be held by career Foreign Service Officers whose positions are rotated every 2 or 3 years.  State said that staff rotation will automatically generate a certain lack of continuity in the handling of UPU matters, especially in contrast with USPS, which is staffed by career officers of long tenure.  However, State noted that its career Foreign Service Officers are accustomed to short lead times in the development of new expertise, and that at least one career civil service staff member not subject to frequent rotation will be involved in UPU activities.", "We do not know whether the Department of State\u2019s staffing for UPU- related matters will be sufficient to provide institutional continuity and expertise for it to play a leadership role in handling complex UPU issues and dealing with domestic and international stakeholders.  For example, State\u2019s UPU-related responsibilities include (1) formulating U.S. policy on UPU issues, (2) participating in UPU groups that include both UPU councils and the High Level Group that is to prepare recommendations concerning UPU reform, (3) coordinating with other federal agencies and domestic stakeholders, and (4) reaching out to other UPU member countries to develop support for U.S. positions.
