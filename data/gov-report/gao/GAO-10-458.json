The 2006 Act also requires GAO to conduct a 3-year study of VA's implementation of the act. GAO evaluated (1) the extent to which VA met its prime contracting goals for VOSBs and SDVOSBs in fiscal years 2007-2009; (2) VA's progress in implementing procedures to verify the ownership, control, and status of VOSBs and SDVOSBs in its mandated database; and (3) VA's progress in establishing a review mechanism of prime contractors' subcontracts with VOSBs and SDVOSBs.

While VA was able to exceed its contracting goals for VOSBs and SDVOSBs, its contracting with women-owned small businesses and HUBZone firms fell short of its goals during this period. In addition, GAO's review of interagency agreements found that VA lacked an effective process to ensure that interagency agreements include required language that the other agency comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with VA's contracting goals and preferences for VOSBs and SDVOSBsand to monitor the extent to which agencies comply with the requirements. VA has made limited progress in implementing an effective verification program. While the 2006 Act requires VA to use the veteran preferences authorities only to award contracts to verified businesses, VA's regulation does not require that this take place until January 1, 2012. In fiscal year 2009, 25 percent of the contracts awarded using veteran preferences authorities went to verified businesses. To date, VA has verified about 2,900 businesses--approximately 14 percent of businesses in its mandated database of VOSBs and SDVOSBs. Among the weaknesses GAO identified in VA's verification program were files missing required information and explanations of how staff determined that control and ownership requirements had been met. In addition, VA's procedures call for site visits to further investigate the ownership and control of higher-risk businesses, but the agency has a large and growing backlog of businesses awaiting site visits. Furthermore, VA contracting officers awarded contracts to businesses that had been denied verification. Finally, although site visit reports indicate a high rate of misrepresentation, VA has not developed guidance for referring cases of misrepresentation for investigation and enforcement action. Such businesses would be subject to debarment under the 2006 Act. To ensure a thorough and effective verification program, VA needs robust procedures for reviewing businesses, an effective system to ensure that contracting officers do not use veteran preferences authorities with denied businesses, and clear guidance for referring businesses potentially abusing the program. VA has developed a mechanism to review prime contractors' subcontracts with VOSBs and SDVOSBs, but the agency has not yet implemented it. For the past 3 years, VA fell substantially short of achieving subcontracting goals for VOSBs and SDVOSBs. The agency acknowledged shortcomings in this area and intends to use a review mechanism to confirm all subcontracting activities by prime contractors with approved subcontracting plans for a sampling of contracts awarded in fiscal year 2010. VA expects increased performance for subcontracting goal attainment as a result. It is too soon to assess the effectiveness of VA's subcontracting efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded contracts for more than  $6.1 billion to veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB) and service- disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) from fiscal years   (FY) 2007 through 2009.

Business owners submit an application  (VA Form 0877), which asks for basic information regarding the ownership  of the company seeking verification, through VetBiz.gov and, upon  request, must provide supporting documents to CVE. When applicants  submit their VA Form 0877, they also must be able to provide, upon  request, other items for review, such as financial statements, tax returns,  articles of incorporation or organization, lease and loan agreements,  payroll records, and bank account signature cards.

In  September 2008, VA adopted a risk-based approach to conducting site  visits by implementing risk guidelines to determine which businesses  would merit site visits. Staff are required to conduct a risk assessment  for each business and assign a level of risk ranging from 1 to 4\u2013\u2013with 1  being a high-risk business and 4 being a low-risk business. When VA staff  conduct a risk assessment, they are to follow the agency\u2019s risk guidelines which include criteria such as previous government contracting dollars  awarded, business license status, annual revenue, and percentage of veteran-ownership. For example, if a business has previous VA contracts  totaling more than $5 million, staff must assign that business a risk le 1 (high). Or, if a business is missing an active or business license in goodstanding, staff must assign a risk level of 2 (elevated). VA then uses these  risk assessments to identify businesses for site visits. According to VA, it  intends to examine all businesses assigned a high- or elevated-risk level  during a site visit or other means, such as extensive document review and  telephone interviews with the businesses\u2019 key personnel.", "VA plans to refine its verification processes to address recommendations  from a contractor\u2019s review of the program and best practices identified in  federal, state, or private-sector programs. In July 2009, VA hired an outside  contractor to assess the verification program\u2019s processes, benchmark VA\u2019s  program to other similar programs, and provide recommendations to VA  on how to improve the program. VA received the contractor\u2019s report and  recommendations in November 2009. The contractor recommended that  VA require business owners to submit key documents as part of the  application for verification\u2013\u2013such as business and professional licenses,  copies of previous tax records, and lease or operating agreements. (VA  currently requires businesses to have these documents on file for a  possible review.) The contractor further recommended that VA upgrade its  data system to expand its functionality to allow business owners to submit  the documentation electronically and store electronic copies of the  information. For example, the contractor recommended that VA adopt  case-management software to better manage the flow of applications and  interface with the VetBiz.gov database. According to the contractor\u2019s  analysis of CVE\u2019s workforce and the growing application volume, CVE  would need an additional 13 full-time positions to conduct verifications\u2013\u2013 even after it made necessary improvements to reduce processing times for  applications. VA officials told us that they plan to implement the  contractor\u2019s recommendations to require business owners to submit  documentation as part of their initial application and to upgrade their data  systems. (We further discuss data systems issues later in this report.)", "However, VA did not have a plan or specific time frames for implementing  a thorough and effective verification program, including filling vacant staff  positions, providing concrete steps and milestone dates for addressing the  contractor\u2019s recommendations, and hiring additional positions to conduct  verifications. A plan, including specific time frames for completing  improvements, would help VA meet the requirements in the 2006 Act that  it maintain a database of verified businesses, and that VA contracting  officers only use the veteran preferences authorities to award contracts to  verified businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Files Supporting Verified Businesses Were Missing Information and Limited Procedures Made It Difficult to Know Whether All Eligibility Requirements Were Met", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of a random sample of the files for 112 businesses  that VA had verified by the end of FY09, an estimated 48 percent of the  files lacked the required information or documentation that CVE staff  followed key verification procedures. Specifically,    20 percent were missing some type of required information, such as  evidence that veteran status had been checked or that a quality review had  taken place;   39 percent lacked information about how staff justified determinations  that control and ownership requirements were met; and   14 percent were missing evidence that either a risk assessment had taken  place or the risk assessment that occurred did not follow the agency\u2019s risk  guidelines.", "The overall estimated 20 percent of cases missing some type of required  information included files missing evidence that veteran status was  checked, eligibility to receive federal government contracts was checked,  application forms were complete and signed, or a quality review had taken  place. According to CVE\u2019s verification procedures, staff should check the  Veteran Benefits Administration\u2019s Beneficiary Identification Records  Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) to determine veteran and service-disability  status and record that BIRLS was checked in their internal database.  Although CVE staff must check BIRLS for each applicant, we found about  16 percent of files lacked information on whether staff had checked the  system to determine veteran or service-disability eligibility. Additionally,  we found 15 percent of files lacked information on whether CVE staff had  checked the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)\u2013\u2013which is used to  determine whether the business owner is eligible to receive federal  contracts. Also, 3 percent of the files lacked a completed or signed  verification application (VA Form 0877), and 5 percent lacked  documentation that a quality review had taken place. According to the  verification procedures, staff must check each VA Form 0877 for  completeness at the beginning of the process, and each file should  undergo a quality review at the end of the process.", "Additionally, our file review found that in an estimated 39 percent of  cases, staff obtained information from a public database but failed to  record in the file what information they had reviewed to determine  whether control and ownership requirements had been met. According to  CVE\u2019s verification procedures, staff are to review publicly available,  primarily self-reported information about control and ownership for each  business. For example, staff are to check for previous federal contracts by  reviewing information available on USAspending.gov, check for  certifications by reviewing the Online Representations and Certifications  Application (ORCA), and review company history through Dun &  Bradstreet reports. In addition, staff are to review information about  each business in the following databases: VetBiz.gov, Central Contractor  Registration (CCR), and Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS)\u2013\u2013all of  which contain information self-reported by business owners. According  to the verification procedures, staff are required to record business status  or discrepancies about information obtained through each public database  searched.", "Finally, based on our file review sample, for an estimated 14 percent of  cases, the files were missing evidence that a risk assessment had taken  place, or staff incorrectly assigned a risk level lower than warranted. For  example, 4 percent of cases in this group were missing risk levels, and   8 percent of cases incorrectly were assigned a low- or moderate-risk  level\u2014they had missing business licenses, which according to the risk  guidelines warranted assigning an elevated-risk level. According to VA,  staff received on-the-job training about the risk guidelines and assigned  risk levels are checked for accuracy during the quality review, but VA  officials also have observed incorrectly assigned risk levels. VA officials  told us that the staff have been learning how to better assign the risk  levels, and errors have been reduced since the agency hired a full-time  staff person as a risk manager in February 2009. Incorrectly assigning risk  levels reduces the chance that the agency is accurately identifying  businesses for site visits, which, in turn, may lead to some businesses not  receiving a site visit when it otherwise would be warranted.", "We found that data system limitations appear to be contributing factors to  weaknesses identified in our review of files. For example, data entry into  CVE\u2019s internal database is largely done manually, which can result in  missing information or data entry errors. Furthermore, CVE\u2019s internal  database does not contain controls to ensure that only complete  applications that have received a quality review move forward. Internal  control standards for federal agencies require that agencies effectively use  information technology in a useful, reliable, and continuous way.  According to agency officials, two efforts are under way to enhance CVE\u2019s  data systems. First, CVE plans to enhance its data systems to  automatically check BIRLS for veteran status and EPLS for good  character, and to store the information obtained. According to CVE, these  changes will require outside contractor assistance. On March 18, 2010, VA  released a solicitation for a contract that closed on April 16, 2010. Once a  contract is awarded, CVE staff told us that the upgrades will be ready to  implement in about 12 months. Second, CVE plans to adopt case- management software\u2014as recommended in the contractor\u2019s report\u2014to  help manage its verification program files. According to VA officials, CVE  is considering a software application currently used by another VA  department. The new system will allow CVE to better track new and  renewal verification applications and manage the corresponding case files.  Furthermore, the new software will ensure that quality reviews take place  by not allowing an application to move forward if it contains any missing  information. However, as we have previously discussed, VA does not have  specific time frames for putting the case-management system in place.", "Furthermore, CVE\u2019s verification procedures do not provide guidance for  staff to follow in the event that they determine information is missing or  discrepancies exist after reviewing public databases. Staff do not have  specific guidance to follow about the circumstances under which they  might need to request additional information directly from business  owners. Based on our file review, we found in 79 percent of cases, staff  relied solely on information from the public databases but asked for  documentation from a business owner in the remaining cases. In these  examples, we found staff requested copies of active business licenses,  articles of incorporation, operating agreements, stock certificates, or tax  documents for further review. The verification procedures instruct staff to  \u201crequest a copy of all required documents needed to make a sound  decision\u201d but do not provide examples of conditions under which staff  should request documents as evidence to support control or ownership  determinations. Furthermore, the procedures do not require staff to  document their assessments of whether eligibility requirements had been  met. Internal control standards for federal agencies require that agencies  collect and maintain documentation to confirm information in support of  their programs. According to VA officials, staff verbally discuss  assessments during a daily meeting but do not document these  discussions.", "According to our file review, in the 21 percent of cases in which staff did  request information because they may have found a discrepancy in the  publicly available information, staff made the request directly to the  business owners, instead of using third-party sources to validate  information. Publicly available, primarily self-reported information may  not be reliable to determine whether control and ownership requirements  have been met. In October 2009, our investigators reported on the  governmentwide SDVOSB procurement program (administered by SBA,  along with federal procuring activities) and found fraud and abuse among  some SDVOSBs. For example, in 10 case studies, we showed that  SDVOSBs fraudulently received sole-source and set-aside contracts\u2013\u2013and  that 5 of the 10 businesses receiving VA contracts were found ineligible  because of issues with management and control. While CVE\u2019s process to  review publicly available, primarily self-reported information may be  consistent with SBA\u2019s process for the governmentwide SDVOSB program,  these 5 cases provide evidence that self-reported information may not  always be reliable for determining control of a business.", "Without timely improvements to CVE\u2019s data systems and controls in place  to ensure the completeness and accuracy of information, the verification  program remains at higher risk for error, lacks quality control, and makes  it difficult to know whether eligibility requirements were met.  Furthermore, the verification procedures do not include guidance that  would help staff to assess control and ownership, particularly in examples  of missing information or discrepancies among public databases or within  self-reported information. Without enhancements to its verification  procedures that include clear guidance for staff to follow when reviewing  applications and require an assessment of each eligibility requirement, it is  difficult to know whether eligibility requirements have been met and  whether verified businesses legitimately qualified as VOSBs or SDVOSBs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Faces a Growing Backlog for Site Visits, and Early Results Suggest a High Rate of Possible Misrepresentations, but VA Has Not Yet Taken Actions Based on Findings", "paragraphs": ["VA started verifying businesses in May 2008 but did not start conducting  site visits until October 2009.

Because of this delay, VA currently has a large  backlog of businesses awaiting site visits and some higher-risk businesses  have been verified months before their site visit occurred or were  scheduled to occur.

Also, according to VA officials, CVE will follow the  cancellation procedures for any business for which the site visit findings  contradict the original verification determination. Because some  businesses are verified months before their site visits occurred and  findings were developed, it is difficult to know whether the businesses  actually met control and ownership requirements when they were verified.  By not incorporating site visit findings in a timely manner and canceling  verification status as necessary, some businesses receive an unwarranted  verified status and may receive veteran preferences contracts, thereby  taking contracting opportunities away from businesses that, in fact, are  owned and controlled by veterans or service-disabled veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracting Officers Incorrectly Used Veteran Preferences Authorities to Award Contracts to Ineligible Businesses", "paragraphs": ["We also found that businesses received veteran preferences contracts  after they had been denied verification.

However, according to our analysis of FPDS-NG data, we  found that 11 (of 154) denied businesses had received veteran preferences  contracts.

According to VA officials,  contracting officers received guidance in June 2007 and received training  on the 2006 Act\u2019s authorities between January and March, 2010. While  contracting officers have been trained in the veteran preferences  authorities and are required to check the VetBiz.gov database prior to  making an award, they still have incorrectly used veteran preferences  authorities with denied businesses. According to VA, there is no function  within the agency\u2019s electronic contract management system to stop a  contracting officer from awarding veteran preferences contracts to denied  businesses.

VA  currently focuses its oversight of subcontracting activities on prime  contractors with subcontracting plans, mainly by reviewing their  electronic reports of subcontracting activity. Large businesses with federal  contracts of $550,000 or more ($1 million for construction) generally must  have subcontracting plans that include goals for subcontracting with  VOSBs, SDVOSBs, and other types of small businesses. The 2006 Act  requires that VA \u201cestablish a review mechanism to ensure that, in the case  of a subcontract of a Department contract that is counted for purposes of  meeting a goal established pursuant to this section, the subcontract was  actually awarded to a business concern that may be counted for purposes  of meeting that goal.\u201d For FY07, VA set agencywide goals for all  subcontracts awarded of 7 percent for VOSBs and 3 percent for SDVOSBs;  for FY08 and FY09, VA set goals of 10 percent for VOSBs and 7 percent for  SDVOSBs. According to SBA data, VA has not met its own goals for  subcontracts awarded to VOSBs and SDVOSBs since FY07 (see table 4).  VOSB and SDVOSB subcontractor participation did not exceed 1 percent  of all subcontracts awarded in FY08 and FY09. In July 2009, VA\u2019s top  leadership acknowledged that the agency had fallen far short of its  subcontracting goals and publicly committed to take more aggressive  measures to improve its subcontracting record with VOSBs and  SDVOSBs.", "VA has created a form\u2014VA Form 0896a\u2014that it plans to use to collect  subcontracting information from its prime contractors. OMB approved the  form on January 15, 2010. Initially, VA plans to use a hard-copy version of  VA Form 0896a and ultimately collect data from prime contractors through  the Internet. At the close of each fiscal year, VA staff will provide the form  to prime contractors with approved subcontracting plans. Once prime  contractors complete and return the form, VA staff will then review the  form and compare it with the information reported by prime contractors in  their subcontracting plans. VA staff also will contact the subcontractors  listed on the form to confirm that the subcontracting activity occurred as  well as confirm the dollar amount expended. VA staff then will determine  whether discrepancies exist and the reasons for the discrepancies.  Specifically, VA will attempt to determine instances in which valid reasons  for a discrepancy exist versus instances in which prime contractors may  not have made a good-faith effort to comply with their subcontracting  plans.", "VA plans to centralize the subcontractor review function in its OSDBU.  Although contractors self-reported information into the SBA-maintained  Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System prior to development of this  subcontracting review mechanism, VA had not collected or confirmed the  accuracy of information on the specific dollar amount or percentage of the  contract value attributable to individual subcontractors. Finally, VA\u2019s  OSDBU plans to develop standard operating procedures by September  2010 for its staff to ensure consistent implementation of the review  mechanism. According to VA, no additional regulatory action is required to  implement VA Form 0896a and the review process. According to VA, the  use of the form will improve the subcontractor data that the agency uses  to calculate its goal accomplishments. VA also expects to see increases in  performance toward subcontracting goal attainment as a result of  improved data collection. Additionally, VA will count subcontracting  accomplishments only with verified businesses starting on   January 1, 2012.", "As of March 26, 2010, VA planned to use VA Form 0896a on a sampling of  contracts resulting from solicitations issued after January 7, 2010.  According to VA, SBA will have to certify FY10 subcontracting data before  OSDBU performs an analysis of information for contracts resulting from  these solicitations. In previous years, SBA\u2019s data certification had taken  several months or up to a year to be available. VA officials have raised  concerns that certain challenges may slow implementation of the review  mechanism. These challenges include the limited staff resources that  OSDBU has to implement the program. VA estimated that more than 300  prime contractors may be required to supply data, which OSDBU must  analyze as we have previously described. In FY09, VA reported that it had  approved 198 new subcontracting plans. However, VA hired one full-time  employee to help one existing staff person working on this program.  According to an agency official, OSDBU will determine after  implementation of the new form whether additional personnel will be  required. Furthermore, VA has expressed concerns that prime contractors  and subcontractors initially may resist providing, or may not realize they  have to provide, information. According to VA officials, they have not  pretested the review mechanism with prime contractors but plan outreach  to prime contractors and subcontractors about the new program. VA also  plans to motivate prime contractors to complete the form and increase  subcontracting efforts with VOSBs and SDVOSBs by adopting a new  evaluation factor in addition to those factors VA currently uses to award  contracts. For example, VA\u2019s procurement staff plans to use prime  contractors\u2019 records in meeting goals detailed in subcontracting plans  when awarding future VA contracts. Finally, OSDBU plans to use the data  collected to annually provide findings to VA leadership.

The 2006 Act provided VA with  unique authority to award contracts to VOSBs and SDVOSBs on a priority  basis to increase contracting opportunities for these businesses. In this  regard, VA has been highly successful. Since FY07, VA has established and  exceeded its contracting goals for VOSBs and SDVOSBs, primarily by  using authorities established under the 2006 Act. However, the agency  faces continuing challenges, and diminished achievement, in meeting  other small business goals. VA also faces challenges in monitoring  interagency agreements to ensure that other agencies are making efforts to  achieve its contracting goals, to the maximum extent feasible, as required  by an amendment to the 2006 Act\u2019s provisions. VA does not have an  effective process in place to ensure that all interagency agreements  include the mandated language addressing VA\u2019s contracting goals and  preferences or to monitor the extent to which agencies comply with the  requirements. By putting such a process in place, VA could help ensure  that statutory requirements are met and that the contracting activities of  other agencies also meet VA\u2019s goals and preferences for VOSBs and  SDVOSBs, to the maximum extent feasible.", "The agency has been slow to implement a comprehensive program to  verify the veteran status, ownership, and control of small businesses and  maintain a database of such businesses, also required by the 2006 Act.  Verification is a vital control to ensure that only eligible veteran-owned  businesses benefit from the preferential contracting authorities. VA has  faced several challenges in implementing its verification program,  including a lack of leadership and a limited number of staff positions with  which to conduct verifications. VA plans to implement recommendations  that an outside contractor made to improve the program and its data  systems. However, we identified several weaknesses in the verification  program, and the agency has been slow to fill staff vacancies and enhance  its technology. By expeditiously filling its vacant leadership and staff  positions within OSDBU, VA could better ensure that the verification  program will operate effectively and planned improvements will be  achieved. Many of the weaknesses in the files we reviewed appeared to be  the result of limitations in the software and the associated extensive  reliance on manual data entry. VA has not yet put software improvements  in place. Other weaknesses stemmed from gaps in the verification  guidance and procedures. For example, VA does not have guidance  requiring staff to document their assessment that each eligibility  requirement had been met or explaining under what circumstances to  request documentation from business owners or instances in which third- party data may be necessary to validate self-reported information. By  developing a plan to address leadership and staff vacancies, hire additional  staff as necessary, achieve timely implementation of enhancements to data  systems, revise procedures to include additional guidance for staff, and  provide training to staff on the revised procedures, VA could make the  verification process more effective. Timely improvements in these areas  also would likely help the agency reduce backlogs\u2013\u2013which have continued  to grow.", "VA also faces other challenges with respect to ensuring that veteran  preferences authorities are only used to award contracts to eligible  businesses (those that have not been denied verification) and taking  action against businesses that have misrepresented themselves during the  verification process. According to the 2006 Act, VA must use the veteran  preferences authorities only with verified businesses. However, VA  contracting officers used the authorities to award contracts\u2013\u2013totaling  almost $4 million\u2013\u2013to 11 businesses that had been denied verification.  According to VA officials, contracting officers received training on the  veteran preferences authorities, but the agency does not have an effective  process in place to ensure that the authorities are used correctly. Without  such a system, VA lacks assurance that it will not continue to make awards  to ineligible businesses (those denied verification), thereby taking  contracting opportunities away from eligible businesses. Moreover,  findings from the initial site visits indicated a high rate of  misrepresentation by VOSBs and SDVOSBs, coupled with a lack of  detailed guidance about how to handle such cases (which would be the  precursor to any investigations and enforcement actions), further suggest  that the agency will be challenged to conduct effective oversight in a  program vulnerable to fraud. Specifically, 40 percent of site visits resulted  in evidence that control and ownership requirements had not been met. An  effective process to make determinations and referrals that may result in  enforcement actions against businesses misrepresenting themselves is of  vital importance for the integrity of the program. Thus, to conduct an  effective verification program, VA\u2019s processes would need to include not  only robust reviews to ensure that only eligible businesses are verified and  therefore benefit from contracting preferences, but also clear and detailed  guidance to ensure that ineligible businesses do not benefit from  contracting preferences by taking the appropriate enforcement actions.", "Finally, the 2006 Act requires VA to establish subcontracting goals for  VOSBs and SDVOSBs and to develop a mechanism to review prime  contractors\u2019 subcontracts with these businesses. While the agency has  developed a mechanism, it has not yet implemented it. VA\u2019s subcontracting  accomplishments also have fallen short of goals for the past 3 years. The  agency has acknowledged the shortcomings in this area and agency  leadership has publicly committed to take measures to improve VA\u2019s  subcontracting record.

L. No. 109-461, sections 502 and  503), which requires VA to give priority to VOSBs and SDVOSBs when it  uses veteran preferences to award contracts. Additionally, we reviewed  regulations implementing the act, including the Veterans Affairs  Acquisition Regulation, which is the final rule implementing the unique  contracting preferences, and the final rule implementing the verification  program. We interviewed VA officials within the Office of Acquisition and  Logistics (OAL); Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization  (OSDBU); Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE); and Office of Inspector  General (OIG). Finally, we obtained information from OSDBU and CVE  about authorized staffing levels and current allocations for staff working  on the verification and subcontracting review programs.", "To determine the extent to which VA met its prime contracting goals for  VOSBs and SDVOSBs and to what extent contracts awarded to VOSBs and  SDVOSBs were on a set-aside and sole-source basis, we reviewed VA\u2019s  agencywide contracting activity for which small businesses were eligible  and analyzed SBA\u2019s Goaling Reports for FY06 through FY08. Because  SBA\u2019s official Goaling Report was unavailable for FY09, we obtained and  analyzed Federal Procurement Data Systems-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  data for VA contracting activities. Additionally, to assess the extent to  which VA awarded set-aside and sole-source contracts to verified VOSBs  and SDVOSBs, we compared those that were self-certified in FY09 with a  list of businesses verified by the end of FY09 (provided by CVE). We  compared the list provided by CVE with FPDS-NG data to determine VA\u2019s  level of contracting with verified firms. Finally, we conducted  reasonableness checks on the FPDS-NG data and identified any missing,  erroneous, or outlying data and had an independent analyst review all  programming. We also obtained and reviewed VA\u2019s FY09 FPDS-NG Data  Quality Report, as submitted to the Office of Management and Budget,  which stated that VA\u2019s FPDS-NG data are 86 percent accurate and 95.8  percent complete. Based on this review, we determined the FPDS-NG data  to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine the extent to which VA agreements with other federal  agencies has language that referred to VA\u2019s contracting goals and  preferences for VOSBs and SDVOSBs as mandated by Pub. L. No. 109-461,  and amended by Pub. L. No. 110-389, we interviewed VA officials from  OAL to obtain information on any policies, procedures, responsibilities,  and oversight efforts in place to monitor compliance with the Pub. L. No.  110-389 requirement. To determine the extent to which these agencies  awarded contracts to VOSBs and SDVOSBs, we evaluated FPDS-NG data  to obtain information about contracts awarded by federal agencies on VA\u2019s  behalf and subject to Pub. L. No. 109-461 provisions. We evaluated the  accuracy and completeness of this analysis by obtaining data from VA on  contracting dollars awarded to the Department of the Interior, the General  Services Administration, the Department of the Navy\u2019s Space and Naval  Warfare Systems Center, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.", "To evaluate the challenges, if any, VA faced in meeting its prime  contracting goals for VOSBs and SDVOSBs, we reviewed previous  congressional hearing transcripts that discussed VA\u2019s challenges in  meeting its contracting goals as well as emerging challenges. We also  conducted several interviews with officials from OSDBU and members of  veteran service organizations, including representatives from the National  Veterans Business Development Corporation, Association for Service  Disabled Veterans, Disabled Veteran Americans, American Legion,  Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of America, and National  Veteran-Owned Business Association.", "To determine VA\u2019s progress in implementing procedures to verify firms in  its mandated database, we reviewed the agency\u2019s verification guidelines  and risk guidelines as well as procedures for reviewing applications and  conducting site visits. Additionally, we conducted a file review of a sample  of verified businesses to determine the extent to which VA followed  procedures and to identify any deficiencies in the verification process. The  study population for our review consisted of all 1,723 businesses that had  been verified between May 2008 and the end of FY09 (Sept. 30, 2009). We  obtained a list of these businesses from CVE and selected a probability  sample of 112 businesses, which would allow us to estimate  characteristics of all applications verified by CVE during this period. This  sample contained approximately the same proportion of SDVOSBs as did  the full study population. We conducted the file review at CVE\u2019s offices in  Washington, D.C., during the week of November 16, 2009, and reviewed  both electronic and paper files.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as 95 percent confidence internal (plus or minus 10 percentage points).  This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for   95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. All percentage estimates  from our sample have 95 percent confidence intervals within plus or minus  10 percentage points of the estimate.", "We created a data collection instrument based on requirements from  CVE\u2019s verification procedures, pretested the instrument on sample  businesses, and then reviewed each business\u2019 file according to the  finalized instrument. For example, for each business, we reviewed the  following: the verification application (VA Form 0877), quality control  form (Control Folder Signature Sheet), the business\u2019 entry within the  agency\u2019s internal Microsoft Access database (veteran status and eligibility  to receive contracts from the federal government), notes about public  databases checked for control and ownership information (Control Folder  Review Sheet), screenshots of information obtained from public databases  searched, and the approval letter. To determine risk levels assigned to  each business, CVE provided a comprehensive list of all verified  businesses and their assigned risk level. We used this list to obtain risk  levels for the 112 businesses in our random sample. Our random sample  produced estimates with margins of error of 9 percentage points or less at  the 95 percent confidence level. Based on findings from our file review  sample, we calculated percentage estimates with 95 percent confidence  intervals within plus or minus 10 percentage points of the estimated  percentage. The results of our sample are generalizable to the entire  population of applications verified by the end of FY09. We performed the  appropriate data reliability procedures for our sample. For example, to  ensure consistency in how the data collection instrument was completed,  we randomly selected 30 percent of files (34 out of 112) for which a  second independent analyst peer reviewed the information collected. We  determined, based on this 30 percent random sample, that there were very  few discrepancies in how the data collection instrument was completed,  and that the data were sufficient for the purposes of this report.", "To determine why CVE denied applications, we obtained information on  the number of businesses denied verification and the reasons for denial.  CVE provided us with information for each application denied between  May 2008 and March 4, 2010, which we summarized in this report. We also  compared the denied businesses to FPDS-NG data to determine whether  any denied business had received a VOSB or SDVOSB set-aside in FY09 or  in FY10 (through Mar. 23, 2010) from VA after it had been denied  verification by CVE. We also obtained 10 (of 45) site visit reports from  CVE that contractors had prepared. We reviewed the 10 reports to  determine whether any businesses failed to meet eligibility requirements  based on evidence prepared by the contractor that conducted the site visit.  Finally, we requested information and interviewed agency officials from  OAL, CVE, and VA\u2019s OIG to discuss any processes and procedures in place  to determine whether businesses had misrepresented themselves or to  refer businesses for a investigation or debarment.", "To determine the extent to which VA met its own subcontracting goals for  VOSBs and SDVOSBs and the governmentwide statutory goal for  SDVOSBs, we reviewed data from SBA Goaling Reports and the Electronic  Subcontracting Reporting System for FY07 through FY09. We reviewed  Pub. L. No. 109-461, section 502, to identify the statutorily mandated  requirement that VA set its own goals for VOSB and SDVOSB  subcontracting activities, and to identify the requirement that VA confirm  reported subcontracting activity. We conducted interviews with OSDBU to  assess VA\u2019s progress in establishing a review mechanism of prime  contractors\u2019 subcontracts with SDVOSBs and other VOSBs. Finally, we  obtained and reviewed VA Form 0896a\u2013\u2013which is the form that VA intends  to use to implement its subcontracting review mechanism.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 through May  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: VetBiz.gov Screenshot and Verified Logo", "paragraphs": ["The VetBiz.gov database allows business owners to submit applictions for  verification and is also a searchable database for contracting officers and  the public (see fig. 11).
