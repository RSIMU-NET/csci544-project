These strategies include a mission statement and goals, identify external factors that could affect meeting these goals, establish metrics to evaluate the performance of the programs, provide cost estimates, and cover a period of at least 5 years. Given the involvement of multiple agencies, and the expansion of the threat reduction and nonproliferation programs beyond the FSU, integration of agencies' strategies is important. The agencies' implementation of very similar programs has not always been well coordinated. While the majority of programs in DOD and DOE are distinct, GAO found three program areas that perform similar functions in the FSU. GAO found that the coordination of programs enhancing security at Russian nuclear warhead sites improved after the National Security Council (NSC) staff issued guidance. Specifically, the guidance delineates agencies' roles, interactions, and ways to resolve disputes. The biological weapons scientist employment programs in DOD, DOE, and State are well coordinated and also have NSC staff guidance addressing roles, interactions, and disputes. By contrast, there is no governmentwide guidance delineating the roles and responsibilities of agencies managing border security programs.

These programs encompass a range of projects, including removing  nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan; securing nuclear  materials and warheads in Russia; and paying former weapons of mass  destruction (WMD) scientists to engage in peaceful research. The National  Security Council (NSC) staff has the principal role in coordinating the  many U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs that are  implemented primarily through the Departments of Defense (DOD) and  Energy (DOE), although the Departments of State, Commerce, and  Homeland Security implement related programs. DOD and DOE threat  reduction and nonproliferation programs have played a key role in  addressing the threats posed by WMD in the FSU; these efforts have  expanded in size and scope beyond the FSU states. For example, the  United States recently provided assistance to dismantle WMD  infrastructure in Libya, and DOE recently announced a new program to  provide employment opportunities for Iraqi weapons scientists.  Furthermore, in November 2003, the Congress authorized DOD to allow the  Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program to spend up to $50 million  annually of its existing funding to address proliferation threats outside the  FSU. A bill pending in the Senate would allow DOD increased flexibility to  undertake nonproliferation projects outside of the FSU.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 mandated  that we assess the current management of DOD and DOE threat reduction  and nonproliferation programs. We agreed to approach this assessment in  two phases. First, this report assesses (1) DOD and DOE strategies guiding  their respective threat reduction and nonproliferation programs and how  they are integrated with those of other agencies and (2) efforts to  coordinate the implementation of DOD, DOE, and State threat reduction  and nonproliferation programs that share similar missions, goals, and  activities. We included State in assessing the coordination of threat  reduction and nonproliferation programs because it shares responsibility in  coordinating two programs. In the second phase, we plan to issue  individual reports on DOD and DOE internal controls for their threat  reduction and nonproliferation programs. A list of our prior reports  concerning DOD and DOE threat reduction and nonproliferation programs  is included at the end of this report.", "To assess DOD and DOE strategies guiding their respective threat  reduction and nonproliferation programs, we assessed the agencies\u2019  strategic plans against criteria established by the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). We also relied on our previous reviews of  the CTR program in DOD and nonproliferation programs in DOE.  Furthermore, we met with officials at DOD, DOE, and State and reviewed  documents to determine if a plan exists that integrates the implementation  strategies of DOD, DOE, and other agencies. To assess efforts to coordinate  DOD, DOE, and State threat reduction and nonproliferation programs, we  reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials. DOD  officials included the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Technology  Security Policy and Counterproliferation and other senior leaders. DOE  officials included the Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation and other senior leaders. We spoke with State  Department officials in the Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to  Europe and Eurasia and the Bureau of Nonproliferation. Although NSC  officials did not respond to our requests to meet, we were able to meet our  audit objectives by obtaining records and having discussions with DOD,  DOE, and State officials regarding the role of the NSC staff and the extent  of its participation in coordinating programs. Additionally, we provided a  draft of this report to NSC staff to obtain their comments. We performed  our review in Washington, D.C., from February 2004 to November 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia inherited the world\u2019s  largest arsenal of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. As Russia  adopted economic reforms and moved toward an open society, its economy  and central controls deteriorated, thereby making it difficult to maintain  security at its weapons sites. Recognizing these difficulties, the Congress  began authorizing funds in 1992 for programs to help destroy Russian  weapons and improve WMD security. More recently, the events of  September 11, 2001, have increased U.S. concerns that terrorists might  obtain WMD materials or weapons at poorly secured sites. While DOD and  DOE implement most of the U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs, the Departments of State, Commerce, and Homeland Security  implement related programs.", "The Congress established DOD\u2019s CTR program in 1992 to reduce the WMD  threat posed to the United States from weapons remaining in the FSU. The  program was designed to assist the FSU in securing and destroying WMD  and its means of delivery. Initial CTR assistance was provided to Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Russia, which had inherited the majority of the  Soviet Union\u2019s WMD. The program helped Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus remove nuclear weapons from their soil, eliminating the potential  emergence of three additional nuclear states. CTR also facilitated Russia\u2019s  efforts to reduce its massive nuclear weapons arsenal and address its arms  control commitments. In fiscal year 2004, CTR had 22 projects (see app. I).  One of the newest CTR projects\u2014the WMD Proliferation Prevention  Initiative\u2014is designed to strengthen the ability of non-Russian FSU states  to deter, detect, and interdict illicit trafficking of WMD and related  materials. For example, DOD is providing equipment and training to  Uzbekistan to enhance its ability to monitor its borders for illegal transport  of radioactive material. Additionally, the CTR program has expanded  outside of the FSU, as DOD will use CTR funds to help Albania eliminate its  chemical weapons stockpile. Furthermore, a bill introduced in the Senate  in November 2004 would grant DOD additional flexibility to expand the  CTR program outside the FSU. DOD implements the CTR program through  the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which receives policy  guidance from the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.", "In 1993, DOE began implementing programs funded by DOD, to help secure  weapons-usable nuclear materials in the FSU. DOE also received funding in  1994 from State to employ former Soviet weapons scientists and engineers  in cooperative research projects with U.S. laboratories and industry to  deter their employment by rogue states. In 1996, with the growth of these  programs, funding shifted directly to DOE. These programs remained  focused on the FSU and were spread throughout DOE. In October 1999,  DOE\u2019s nonproliferation programs were consolidated within the National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Since that time, NNSA\u2019s  nonproliferation mission has been implemented by the Office of Defense  Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN), which seeks to detect, prevent, and  reverse WMD proliferation. This mission has now expanded to address  proliferation threats in more than 70 countries to prevent the spread of  WMD. For example, DNN is initiating a new program to provide  employment opportunities to Iraqi scientists, technicians, and engineers. In  fiscal year 2004, DOE had 19 projects addressing nonproliferation threats  worldwide (see app. I). The threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs have evolved from a $400 million DOD program in 1992 to  approximately $1.8 billion in programs at DOD and DOE in 2004.", "The State Department also manages its own nonproliferation programs and  coordinates U.S. assistance to the FSU. In 1992, the Freedom Support Act  established the Office of the Coordinator within the State Department to  coordinate U.S. assistance to the FSU. The coordinator\u2019s responsibilities  include resolving program and policy disputes among U.S. government  agencies regarding their programs in the FSU. In 1994, State and DOD  established the International Science and Technology Center in Moscow to  fund peaceful research carried out by otherwise underpaid weapons  scientists. The center supplements the income of scientists, purchases  equipment for scientific research, and supports programs to help scientists  identify and develop commercially viable research projects. In 1996, the  Congress established State\u2019s Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining,  and Related Programs Account to fund programs addressing the spread of  WMD. For example, the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund supports  projects to prevent the proliferation of WMD, their delivery systems, and  related materials.", "NSC staff coordinates U.S. policy for threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs and conducted reviews of these programs that validated the need  to maintain them in 2001 and 2002. The Proliferation Strategy Policy  Coordinating Committee, chaired by the Special Assistant to the President  and Senior Director for Proliferation Strategy, Counterproliferation and  Homeland Defense, sets general policy for U.S. nonproliferation programs.

We found that this strategy generally  contains the elements of a strategic plan developed using GPRA criteria.  Additionally, all CTR projects develop detailed plans that also contain these  elements. Figure 1 depicts DOD offices that are involved in strategic  planning for the CTR programs.", "In accordance with GPRA, the CTR program\u2019s mission statement is  comprehensive and concise: that is, to prevent the proliferation of WMD  and related materials, technologies, and expertise from FSU states\u2014 including providing for the safe destruction of Soviet-era WMD, associated  delivery systems, and related infrastructure. The CTR program\u2019s strategy  also includes the following specific goals: (1) dismantle FSU WMD and  associated infrastructure, (2) consolidate and secure FSU WMD and  related technology and materials, (3) increase transparency and encourage  higher standards of conduct, and (4) support defense and military  cooperation with the objective of preventing proliferation. These goals  provide clear direction to the activities and desired outcomes of the CTR  program.", "The CTR strategy also cites external factors that could affect the program,  describes how performance will be measured, and states budget  requirements. For example, the level of Russian cooperation is cited as an  external factor that will affect the successful implementation of the  program. The strategy provides metrics by which performance of the  program can be measured, such as the number of missiles destroyed. DOD  and DOE performance metrics are shown in appendix II. In accordance  with GPRA criteria, the CTR plans include cost estimates and cover a  period of 5 years. For example, the overall CTR funding request for fiscal  year 2005 is $409 million, and the 5-year plan calls for an additional $1.5  billion between fiscal years 2006 and 2009.", "The CTR program has five program areas, with several projects under each  program area. Each project has a plan that details its broad mission,  specific objectives, external factors that could affect the achievement of  these objectives, metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the  project, and cost estimates. For example, the mission of the Automated  Inventory Control and Management System project, under the nuclear  weapons safety and security program area, is to enhance Russia\u2019s  capability to account for and track the strategic and tactical nuclear  weapons scheduled for dismantlement. Specific objectives include  installing hardware and software at 18 sites within Russia and providing  initial training and data entry. External factors cited for this program  include whether Russia will grant sufficient access to the sites and improve  the equipment storage conditions. The project uses milestone dates, which  range from the procurement of the software to the final certification of the  system at all sites, as one method to measure its performance. The project  is estimated to cost $50.2 million.", "Additionally, according to agency officials, DOD has not had to prioritize  CTR projects on the basis of available funds. The CTR program generally  receives the funding requested for its projects. DOD develops its budget  request for the CTR program on the basis of funding needed to continue  existing programs and implement new programs. As a result, projects have  not competed for funding.", "Furthermore, the CTR program has undergone internal performance  reviews in order to improve management practices. In 2003, the CTR Policy  Office conducted a 6-month, project-by-project review of the program that  changed the scope of several CTR projects to ensure that program  activities met threat reduction goals. The review also resulted in a decision  to stop funding activities that did not contribute directly to threat reduction  goals. For example, the CTR program no longer funds the restoration of the  environment surrounding missile sites but continues to fund the  elimination of the nuclear missiles and silos.", "The CTR program also has undergone several external reviews to identify  areas needing improvement. For example, in 1996, we recommended that  no funds should be obligated for constructing a chemical weapons  destruction facility in Russia until reliable cost estimates were completed.  (See prior GAO reports listed at the end of this report.) The DOD Inspector  General also recommended that the CTR program adopt numerous  controls to improve program management. For example, the DOD  Inspector General recommended amendments to CTR program  implementing agreements with Russia to ensure that Russia provides its  weapons systems and their components scheduled for destruction, that it  grants access rights to DOD, and that it is penalized for failure to use DOD  assistance. As a result of this recommendation, DOD required Russia to  sign an agreement specifying that all of Russia\u2019s declared nerve agents  could be destroyed at a facility under construction by the CTR program.

This plan  also describes broad goals for its nonproliferation mission. For example,  one of its goals is to secure nuclear and radiological materials at potentially  vulnerable sites overseas. DNN\u2019s plan identifies external factors that could  affect its program goals, such as delays in its program to employ weapons  scientists due to lengthy Russian government clearance procedures.", "Although DNN\u2019s strategic plan does not list performance measures for each  of its nonproliferation projects, DNN maintains a database of goals and  performance metrics for each of its six program areas. For example, to  measure performance in preventing the migration of WMD expertise, DNN  tracks the annual number of former Soviet weapons scientists, engineers,  and technicians engaged by its programs. Appendix II contains  performance metrics for DOE\u2019s nonproliferation. In accordance with GPRA  criteria, DNN plans include cost estimates and cover a period of 5 years.  For example, DNN is requesting $1.3 billion for fiscal year 2005 and is  projected to request an additional $5.7 billion between fiscal years 2006 and  2009.", "In the past, DNN generally received requested funding for its  nonproliferation programs, but as the scope of these programs expanded,  DNN began to prioritize projects within program areas, according to  agency officials. In fiscal year 2004, DOE first applied several criteria, such  as risk, availability of funding, and legal obligations, to prioritize projects.  The criteria were used to identify activities with the greatest proliferation  risk, on which DOE focused its resources. For example, in fiscal year 2004,  Russia provided access to more nuclear warhead storage sites than  originally planned. DOE diverted funds from lower priority activities, such  as converting weapons-grade uranium to uranium that cannot be used in  weapons, in order to fund security enhancements at the new nuclear  warhead storage sites.", "DNN\u2019s nonproliferation programs have undergone internal and external  reviews to identify areas needing improvement. The NNSA Under Secretary  biannually reviews each program\u2019s budget, accomplishments, and any  other concerns. DOE also uses the results of external audits to identify  areas needing improvement. For example, audits conducted by the DOE  Inspector General have recommended improvements to NNSA\u2019s process for  matching program requirements with budgetary resources and managing  the program to eliminate weapons-grade uranium in research reactors. In  addition, we have conducted numerous reviews of various aspects of  DOE\u2019s nonproliferation programs. For example, in 2001, we found  duplication between DOE\u2019s two programs to employ former weapons  scientists in Russia and recommended consolidating the programs.

The Congress found that although U.S.  nonproliferation efforts in the FSU have achieved important results in  securing WMD materials, technology, and knowledge, the effectiveness of  these efforts has suffered from a lack of coordination within and among  agencies. Recognizing the importance of integrated planning of threat  reduction and nonproliferation programs, the Congress required the  executive branch to develop three plans. To comply with the requirements  of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, as  amended, the President submitted a plan and an annual report on the  implementation of the plan covering all agency efforts to secure nuclear  weapons, material, and expertise in the FSU. This plan addressed the  specific requirements of the legislation, including identifying the goals and  objectives of the programs and strategies for terminating U.S. contributions  to the programs.", "The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 requires (1) the  State Department to provide the appropriate congressional committees  with a 3-year international arms control and nonproliferation strategy and  (2) the President to provide the Congress with a plan detailing coordination  of nonproliferation programs. State submitted the 3-year international  arms control and nonproliferation strategy to the Congress in August 2003.  The strategy focuses on the State Department\u2019s programs and activities,  discusses broad U.S. arms control and nonproliferation goals, and  describes State\u2019s efforts under way to achieve these goals. For the  coordination plan, the Congress required the establishment of an  interagency committee consisting of representatives of the Departments of  Defense, Energy, State, Commerce, Homeland Security, and the Attorney  General and other officials that the President deems necessary. This  committee will exercise responsibility for coordinating all U.S. threat  reduction efforts and enhance the U.S. government\u2019s ability to anticipate  growing nonproliferation areas of concern. This committee is required to  submit a coordination plan in May 2005.", "In past work, we found that the development of a governmentwide strategy  could strengthen the coordination of threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs.

As of November 2004, the plan had yet to  be developed.", "In addition, independent panels have also called for the development of  governmentwide plans. In 1998, the Congress established the Commission  to Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the  Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (the Deutch Commission),  which recommended coordinated and consistent governmentwide  strategies to address nonproliferation threats to the United States. In 2001,  the Baker-Cutler Commission, established by the Secretary of Energy,  recommended the development of a national strategic plan to secure all  Russian nuclear weapons-useable material and prevent WMD expertise  from leaving Russia.

DOE officials stated they  would prefer to meet more often to facilitate coordination of their  programs and reduce the amount of informal coordination, such as  telephone conversations and e-mails, which they believe is less efficient.  State Department officials acknowledged that coordination of these  programs could be better, but stated that they lack the authority to resolve  conflicts over coordination.", "In the absence of guidance for coordination, agency officials question the  other agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities. For example, both State and  DOD officials acknowledged that their border security programs conduct  similar activities, such as training border security guards and providing  equipment for detecting illicit trafficking of WMD. Furthermore, State  Department officials questioned whether some aspects of DOD\u2019s  International Counterproliferation Program were targeting countries that  may no longer require the type of assistance being provided. For example,  DOD\u2019s program provided basic level WMD courses to officials from  Bulgaria, which is beyond the need for basic level training, according to a  State Department official.", "In May 2002, we reported problems with the coordination of border  security programs. We found that portal monitors provided through the  State Department\u2019s border security program did not meet the standards  established by DOE. Since our report, the State Department has  transferred responsibility of operation and maintenance of the monitors to  DOE, and State is no longer funding the installation of portal monitors.  According to State and DOE officials, the specific problems we highlighted  have since been resolved, such as the coordination of agencies\u2019 border  security activities. We have follow-up work under way regarding this issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD and DOE develop their own strategic plans, prioritize their own  program activities, and measure their own program performance. While  this approach helps keep the departments on track to meet their own  objectives, it does not provide governmentwide guidance for U.S. threat  reduction and nonproliferation programs, which would include goals, time  frames for meeting those goals, and mechanisms for establishing priorities  across the various departments involved in program implementation. In  light of the U.S. government\u2019s elimination of nuclear infrastructure in Libya,  recent agreement to eliminate chemical weapons in Albania, and the  growing likelihood of other efforts expanding outside the FSU, overall  strategic guidance becomes increasingly important given the involvement  of multiple agencies. While NSC staff has provided guidance to agencies  implementing programs to secure Russian warheads and employ former  Soviet biological weapons scientists, there is no governmentwide strategy  for agencies implementing threat reduction and nonproliferation programs  worldwide. The requirement in the Fiscal Year 2003 Foreign Relations  Authorization Act for a Presidential report detailing the coordination of  nonproliferation programs provides an opportunity for the administration  to review its broad array of threat reduction and nonproliferation programs  to ensure that the programs and capabilities of the various departments  address all proliferation threats worldwide. As part of this effort, DOD and  DOE can draw upon lessons learned from programs in the FSU.", "In addition, while the majority of threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs do not address similar missions, it is still important for policy  makers and program managers at DOD and DOE to (1) understand how  their efforts contribute to broader U.S. goals and (2) have formal  mechanisms for sharing information and lessons learned that cut across  programmatic boundaries. In those areas where more than one department  is addressing a similar mission, interagency coordination is important to  avoid duplication and collectively meet common goals. We found that  interagency coordination of threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs appears to work best when there is clear guidance from NSC  staff regarding the roles of the various departments, regularized agency  interactions, and resolution of interagency disputes, as is the case with the  projects to employ biological weapons scientists and secure warhead sites.  However, we found that coordination is limited among the border security  projects where there is no NSC staff guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretaries of Defense and Energy, in consultation  with other agencies involved in threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs, develop an integrated plan for all U.S. threat reduction and  nonproliferation programs to ensure that the programs are effectively  coordinated and address all threats.
