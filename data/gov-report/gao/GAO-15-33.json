This report examines what is known about the types of projects, activities, and federal administrative functions and expenses supported by DOT using Highway Trust Fund monies in fiscal year 2013. To address this request, GAO obtained and analyzed fiscal year 2013 federal obligation data from DOT's operating administrations, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed FHWA, FTA, FMCSA, NHTSA, and DOT officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2013, operating administrations within the Department of Transportation (DOT) collected and reported some information on the types of activities and administrative expenses funded from the Highway Trust Fund, but did so with varying levels of detail. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) obligated about $41 billion in fiscal year 2013, most of which ($39 billion) was apportioned to states through the federal-aid highway program. FHWA tracks federal-aid highway program obligations in its Fiscal Management Information System (FMIS), for individual project segments or contracts. This process allows FHWA to collect and report information on the types of activities (such as obligations for the construction of new roads or bridges) funded with Highway Trust Fund monies.", "However, FHWA does not collect and report aggregate project-level data for the majority of projects on a routine basis. Aggregate project-level data would allow FHWA to track and report the total overall obligations of an entire project. While FHWA tracks and reports aggregate obligations for its \u201cmajor projects\u201d (projects with a total cost of $500 million or more), it does not collect and report aggregate obligations for other projects, which represented nearly 88 percent of all fiscal year 2013 spending. FHWA could collect and report aggregate obligations for all projects in FMIS, and FMIS has two existing data fields that could be used to collect this information. But according to FHWA officials, doing so would result in increased costs to FHWA and states. FHWA officials attributed increased costs to, among other things, programming costs to make changes to FMIS to track these data; however, FHWA has not completed a cost analysis to estimate what the associated costs would be. FHWA is currently in the process of modernizing its FMIS database system. Exploring the costs, feasibility, and options for collecting and reporting consistent aggregate project-level obligations could aid FHWA in its oversight efforts, including its ability to more easily draw consistent data for its compliance reviews and to report information to Congress and the public about how the majority of federal funds from the Highway Trust Fund are being used.", "The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) also collect some information on activities funded with Highway Trust Fund monies. For example, FTA collects data on activities, such as obligations for bus and rail purchases, funded with Highway Trust Fund monies each year, and NHTSA and FMCSA collect and report data by grant program. In addition, within DOT, the FHWA, FMCSA, and NHTSA used Highway Trust Fund monies for a range of administrative expenses, such as personnel salaries and benefits and rent.

Federal motor-fuel tax rates have not increased since  1993, and the 18.4 cents per-gallon tax on gasoline enacted in 1993 is  worth about 11.5 cents today. This trend is expected to continue as  demand for gasoline decreases with the introduction and adoption of  more fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles in the years ahead.

To maintain current spending levels  and cover revenue shortfalls, between 2008 and 2014, Congress has  transferred over $50 billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust  Fund.  And in August 2014, an extension of federal-aid highway programs  through May 31, 2015, was enacted and will provide $10.8 billion in  funding to the Highway Trust Fund, of which $9.8 billion will be  transferred from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury.

(See figs. 4 and 5).", "In addition, about 29 percent of FHWA federal-aid highway program  obligations from the Highway Trust Fund went toward project  development, safety, and other improvements. Project development  activities include funding for activities such as preliminary engineering  activities, construction engineering, research, and other planning  activities. Our analysis of this data showed that most of this funding went  toward construction engineering (32 percent) and preliminary engineering  (29 percent). (See fig. 6.) Safety, enhancements, and other improvements  include safety, safety education for pedestrians and bicyclists, and  highway crossing activities, among others. Our analysis of this data  showed that most of this funding went to safety activities (67 percent). An  additional 15 percent went toward facilities for pedestrians and bicycles.  (See fig. 7)", "We also analyzed FHWA FMIS data of projects funded under each of  FHWA\u2019s five core formula programs. These core programs account for  $31 billion (about 76 percent) of the $41 billion that FHWA obligated from  the Highway Trust Fund in fiscal year 2013. As discussed below, the  types of activities funded under each of these programs varied widely.  (See figs. 8-12).", "The National Highway Performance Program (about $17 billion)  provides funding for improvements on the National Highway System  such as construction, reconstruction, resurfacing, and rehabilitation of  National Highway System segments. The majority of this funding was  obligated for resurfacing and rehabilitation of roads (21 percent),  project development activities (19 percent), and reconstruction of  roads to increase capacity (18 percent).", "The Surface Transportation Program (approximately $11 billion) funds  the federal share of projects that states and localities may carry out on  federal-aid highway , including bridge projects, transit capital projects,  and bus facilities. The majority of STP funding was obligated for  resurfacing and rehabilitation of roads (26 percent), project  development activities (20 percent), and reconstruction of roads with  no added capacity (11 percent).", "The Highway Safety Improvement Program (approximately $2 billion)  provides funding for activities that reduce the number of crashes,  traffic fatalities, and serious injuries on public roads. Most of this  funding was obligated for safety improvements (62 percent) and  project development activities (20 percent).", "The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program  (about $1 billion) provides funding to state and local governments for  transportation projects and programs to help meet the requirements of  the Clean Air Act. About 21 percent of this funding was obligated to  project development activities, and 24 percent was obligated to other  activities, which included activities such as traffic management on  high-occupancy vehicle lanes.", "The Transportation Alternatives program (approximately $111 million)  provides funding for alternative transportation projects related to  surface transportation, such as pedestrian and bicycle trails,  community improvement activities, construction, planning, and design  of infrastructure related projects and systems that provide safe routes  for non-drivers. About 50 percent of this funding was obligated for  sidewalks and bicycle trail activities, with most of the remainder  obligated for project development (17 percent) and other (18 percent)  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Analysis of FHWA Major Projects by Improvement Type", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of fiscal year 2013 federal-aid highway program obligations  for \u201cmajor\u201d projects showed that over 40 percent of these funds were  used for road resurfacing and rehabilitation (24 percent) and project  development activities (19 percent).
