During this period, the OIG consisted of one full-time employee, the Inspector General (IG), who obtained additional support through contracts with auditors and others. The OIG issued six semiannual reports to the Congress and conducted 12 inspections during fiscal years 2011 through 2013.", "The OIG provided limited oversight of the Commission's major programs (energy, transportation, health facilities, and training) and operations. GAO's analysis of the 12 inspections completed by the OIG found that the OIG provided oversight for $150,000 of the $167 million in grant funds disbursed during fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The $150,000 of grant funds inspected by the OIG represented less than 1 percent of total grants awarded by the Commission during this period. The $167 million in disbursed grant funds are subject to the Single Audit Act, as applicable.

The OIG did not implement the following four quality standards that are critical for the management and operations of the OIG: planning and coordinating; maintaining quality assurance; ensuring internal control; and receiving and reviewing allegations of potential fraud, waste, and abuse. For example, the OIG did not conduct any investigations for potential criminal prosecution. Also, the OIG did not prepare an annual work or strategic plan to document the office's planned activities. Additionally, the OIG's work products were not fully consistent with applicable professional standards, its own policies and procedures for inspections, or section 5 of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act). For example, there was insufficient evidence in the OIG's inspection case files to support the conclusions and recommendations reported, and the semiannual reports prepared by the OIG did not provide information on the status of OIG recommendations as required by the act.", "If corrective actions are taken to mitigate the challenges faced by a one-person office, the current structure of the Commission OIG is one option for OIG oversight.

The CIGIE standard for ensuring internal  control states that each IG and OIG staff shall direct and control OIG  operations consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. These standards require that internal control be part of the  OIG\u2019s management infrastructure, serve as a continuous built-in  component of operations effected by people, and provide reasonable  assurance that the OIG\u2019s objectives are met. The internal control  structure includes the control environment, risk assessment, control  activities, information and communication, and monitoring. Control  activities are policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that help  ensure that the OIG\u2019s directives are carried out.", "Effective internal control also assists the OIG in managing change to  cope with shifting environments and evolving demands. An internal  control structure is continually assessed and evaluated to ensure that it is  well designed and operated, is appropriately updated to meet changing  conditions, and provides reasonable assurance that objectives are being  achieved. The OIG should design internal control activities to contribute to  its mission, goals, and objectives. Specifically, control activities include a  wide range of diverse activities, such as approvals, authorizations,  verifications, reconciliations, performance reviews, security activities, and  the production of records and documentation.", "We found that the Commission OIG lacked critical elements of an  effective internal control structure. For example, the OIG did not conduct  a risk assessment to determine which agency programs or operations to  evaluate. Instead, the IG relied on the input from Commission officials  and congressional staff to determine which programs and operations to  evaluate. The OIG also lacked policies and procedures for managing and  operating its office, which would have provided the needed guidance to  ensure that the OIG\u2019s directives were carried out efficiently and  effectively. While we acknowledge that the OIG is an office of one,  independently determining which programs or agency operations to  evaluate as well as developing policies and procedures for the OIG\u2019s  management and operations are elements of internal control that are still  achievable by a small office. Without an effective internal control  structure, it is difficult for an OIG to ensure its own effective and efficient  management and operations and safeguard its assets.", "Maintaining quality assurance. The CIGIE standard for maintaining  quality assurance states that each OIG shall establish and maintain a  quality assurance program to ensure that work performed adheres to  established OIG policies and procedures; meets applicable professional  standards; and is carried out economically, efficiently, and effectively.  Because OIGs evaluate how well agency programs and operations are  functioning, they have a special responsibility to ensure that their own  operations are as effective as possible. The OIG quality assurance  program is an evaluative effort conducted by reviewers external to the  units or personnel being reviewed to ensure that the overall work of the  OIG meets appropriate standards. The quality assurance program has an  internal and an external component. Furthermore, organizations that  perform audits are subject to a peer review at least once every 3 years.  Audits performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards  must provide reasonable assurance that the audit organization and its  personnel are consistent with professional standards and applicable legal  and regulatory requirements.", "Internal quality assurance reviews can include reviews of all aspects of  the OIG\u2019s operations and are distinct from regular management and  supervisory activities, comparisons, and other activities by OIG staff  performing their duties. External quality assurance reviews provide OIGs  with added assurance regarding their adherence to prescribed standards,  regulations, and legislation through a formal objective assessment of OIG  operations. OIGs are strongly encouraged to have external quality  assurance reviews of audits, investigations, inspections, evaluations, and  other OIG activities. While the nature and extent of an OIG\u2019s quality  assurance program depends on a number of factors\u2014such as the OIG  size, the degree of operating autonomy allowed its personnel and its  offices, the nature of its work, its organization structure, and appropriate  cost-benefit considerations\u2014CIGIE standards state that each OIG shall  establish and maintain a quality assurance program.", "The Commission OIG did not have a quality assurance program and had  not developed policies and procedures to help ensure quality assurance.  The Commission IG told us that peer reviews were only required if an  OIG had conducted audits, and because his office did not perform audits,  it was not subject to this quality assurance requirement. Conversely, the  Commission OIG inspection and semiannual reports could have been  subjected to an internal quality assurance review, an external quality  assurance review, or both. The Commission OIG provided draft  inspection and semiannual reports to the Federal Cochair and the other  commissioners, providing management an opportunity to comment on the  drafts prior to final issuance. However, the Federal Cochair and  commissioners do not qualify as external quality assurance reviewers  because they are directly involved in the activities or programs being  reviewed. In addition, they may not be familiar with applicable  professional standards that govern OIG-issued work products.", "Without documented policies and procedures for maintaining a quality  assurance program, the OIG could not ensure that its management and  operations adhered to the CIGIE standards or complied with the IG Act. In  addition, the risk is significantly increased that issued work will not meet  established standards of performance, including applicable professional  standards, or be carried out economically, efficiently, and effectively.  While we acknowledge that the Commission OIG is an office of one and  maintaining quality assurance under these circumstances presents  challenges, adherence to this quality standard is required.", "Planning and coordinating. The CIGIE standard for planning and  coordinating states that each OIG shall maintain a planning system  assessing the nature, scope, and inherent risks of agency programs and  operations. strategic and performance plans, including goals, objectives, and  performance measures to be accomplished by the OIG within a specific  time period. Some of the elements of the planning process include   (1) using a strategic planning process that carefully considers current and  emerging agency programs, operations, risks, and management  challenges; (2) developing a methodology and process for identifying and  prioritizing agency programs and operations as potential subjects for  audit, investigation, inspection, or evaluation; and (3) using an annual  performance planning process that identifies the activities to audit,  investigate, inspect, or evaluate and translates these priorities into  outcome-related goals, objectives, and performance measures. Strategic  and annual work plans are useful tools in documenting the IG\u2019s strategic  vision for providing leadership for activities designed to promote  economy, efficiency, and effectiveness for an entity\u2019s programs and  operations.", "Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, Quality Standards for  Federal Offices of Inspector General (Washington, D.C.: August 2012).", "We found that the OIG did not prepare an annual work plan or strategic  plan. Instead, an informal and undocumented planning process was used  by the IG and Federal Cochair that involved routine meetings, e-mails,  and conversations. Without an annual work plan or strategic plan, the  Commission OIG is limited in its ability to ensure that the oversight it  provided was relevant, timely, and responsive to the priorities to the  Commission. Further, without a risk-based approach for oversight that  includes identifying and prioritizing agency programs and operations as  potential subjects for audit, investigation, inspection, or evaluation, the  OIG did not have a road map to help guide the general direction and  focus of its work to ensure appropriate oversight of the Commission\u2019s  major programs.", "Communicating results of OIG activities. The CIGIE quality standard  related to communicating the results of OIG activities states that the OIG  shall keep agency management, program managers, and the Congress  fully and currently informed about appropriate aspects of OIG operations  and findings. The OIG should also assess and report to the Congress, as  appropriate, the OIG\u2019s strategic and annual performance, as well as the  performance of the agency it oversees. Furthermore, the OIG is  responsible for reporting promptly to the Attorney General whenever the  IG has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of  federal criminal law. The IG and Federal Cochair told us that they did  discuss the areas the IG planned to inspect. The OIG communicated the  results of its activities by submitting semiannual reports to the Congress,  ensuring that inspection reports were available on the OIG\u2019s website, and  meeting with congressional staff to discuss various issues.", "Managing human capital. The CIGIE quality standard for managing  human capital states that the OIG should have a process to ensure that  OIG staff possess the core competencies needed to accomplish the  OIG\u2019s mission. Because the Commission OIG consisted of the IG and no  staff, standards for managing human capital are applicable only to the  Commission IG. The IG provided documentation verifying that as a  certified public accountant and attorney in the state of Alaska, he had met  the continuing education requirements for these designations and  possessed the core competencies needed to accomplish the OIG\u2019s  mission.", "Because the Commission OIG was an office of one, the IG used the  services of others to assist with his oversight duties. As discussed earlier,  he contracted with an IPA for the agency\u2019s annual financial statement  audit and contracted with a retired investigator to assist with inspections.", "We found that the OIG had a process to ensure that these contractors  possessed the needed skills for the services they provided.", "Reviewing legislation and regulations. The CIGIE quality standard for  reviewing legislation and regulations states that the OIG shall establish  and maintain a system for reviewing and commenting on existing and  proposed legislation, regulations, and directives that affect both the  program and operations of the OIG\u2019s agency or the mission and functions  of the OIG. While the OIG had not established a documented system for  the steps it followed for reviewing legislation and regulations, we found an  assessment of relevant Commission-related legislation and regulations in  the OIG\u2019s semiannual reports to the Congress.", "Receiving and reviewing allegations. The CIGIE quality standard for  receiving and reviewing allegations states that the OIG shall establish and  follow policies and procedures for receiving and reviewing allegations.  This process should ensure that appropriate disposition, including  appropriate notification, is made for each allegation. Furthermore, the IG  Act requires each OIG to establish a direct link on the OIG website for  individuals to anonymously report fraud, waste, and abuse.", "The Commission OIG did not have an OIG hotline link on its website to  serve as a mechanism for receiving and reviewing allegations, as  appropriate. The IG provided his e-mail address and telephone number  on the Commission\u2019s OIG website. He reported that there was no OIG  hotline link on the website because the Commission only had about 15  employees and a tip through an OIG hotline was not necessarily how  employees made contact with the OIG. According to the IG, contact with  the Commission\u2019s small workforce was primarily through e-mails, phone  calls, and group teleconferences.", "OIG hotlines exist to elicit information from federal employees,  contractors, and the general public that furthers an OIG\u2019s mission to   (1) promote effectiveness, efficiency, and economy in its organization\u2019s  programs and operations and (2) prevent and detect fraud, waste, and  abuse in such programs and operations. Accordingly, hotlines play a  critical role in the work of OIGs, because an OIG can only investigate,  refer, or otherwise handle matters of which it is aware. Agency  employees, contractors, and members of the public who make reports to  an OIG via its hotline are an important resource because they can provide  the OIG with notification of or insider information about potential  problems.", "Hotlines have been used in organizations as a means for individuals  fearing retaliation to seek remedies for problems anonymously within the  organization. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the use  of OIG hotlines as the principal mechanism for reporting and detecting  fraud, waste, and abuse. Entities both within and outside the IG  community have studied OIG hotlines and their important impact on the  effectiveness of the IG community. In addition to detecting fraud, waste,  and abuse, hotlines are used by some OIGs to identify agency programs  or operations as potential subjects for audit or investigation. However, the  Commission OIG did not conduct any investigations for criminal  prosecution, and there was no supporting evidence of the disposition of  referrals or tips received.", "Without an established OIG hotline, with its protection of anonymity, it  may be difficult for agency employees, contractors, and the general public  to report insider information about potential problems at the Commission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIG Inspection and Semiannual Reports Generally Did Not Fully Adhere to Professional Standards", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed the OIG\u2019s work products, which consisted of inspection  reports and semiannual reports issued during fiscal years 2011 through  2013, and their associated policies and procedures.

Although the limitations of a single- person office can create challenges to developing and implementing  policies and procedures to ensure effective oversight, if corrective actions  are taken to address the issues identified in this report, the current DFE  OIG structure can provide a viable option for oversight of the  Commission. Nevertheless, there are alternative structures that may also  facilitate effective OIG oversight of the Commission.", "We identified examples of alternative approaches that exist in other  federal agencies that may also provide effective OIG oversight for the  Commission. Three alternative IG oversight structures and their  respective advantages and disadvantages are summarized in figure 4  and more fully described in the paragraphs that follow."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consolidation into a Larger IG Office", "paragraphs": ["The Commission OIG could be consolidated into a larger IG office.  Specifically, OIGs with presidentially appointed IGs would assume the  operational responsibilities of the Commission OIG as established under  the IG Act. This includes reporting to the Congress semiannually;  performing audits, investigations, inspections, and evaluations of program  areas; as well as conducting and overseeing the agency\u2019s annual  financial statement audit. This alternative could strengthen the quality of  work and use of resources through the implementation of best practices  usually employed at larger, presidentially appointed and Senate- confirmed IGs and their related offices.", "This oversight structure exists at the Department of State OIG. For  example, the Department of State OIG has oversight authority over the  Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which had a budget of   $712 million for fiscal year 2013. The Department of State OIG had an  average annual budget of $61 million for fiscal years 2011 through 2013  and employed approximately 270 full-time and 16 part-time employees.  The Department of State OIG conducts independent performance and  financial statement audits, inspections, and investigations that advance  the missions of the Department of State and BBG. The Department of  State OIG prepares an annual performance plan (including audits,  inspections, and evaluations) and a 5-year strategic plan for oversight of  the Department of State and BBG using Department of State  management challenges as a baseline, along with input collected from  the Department of State, BBG management, and other sources of  information. The Department of State OIG also uses a risk-based  approach to determine which posts and bureaus should be inspected  based on the most recent inspection and other data collected during the  course of its oversight work. In addition, when possible, the Department  of State OIG performs a review of BBG foreign offices during Department  of State site visits, allowing it to leverage efficiencies and resources when  performing other oversight work.", "In another example, the U.S. Agency for International Development Office  of Inspector General (USAID OIG) provides oversight to several small  entities, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation, U.S. African  Development Foundation, Inter-American Foundation, and Overseas  Private Investment Corporation, with budgets of $898 million, $30 million,  $22 million, and approximately $75 million to 100 million, respectively, for  fiscal year 2013. USAID OIG has approximately 230 employees and had  an average budget of approximately $45.6 million for fiscal years 2011  through 2013. USAID OIG prepares annual performance (i.e., audit) plans  for oversight of these entities that are aligned with its 5-year strategic plan  following consultations with stakeholders and OIG personnel. In addition  to these consultations, annual performance plans are developed based  on a risk assessment of the portfolios they monitor. USAID OIG audits  activities relating to the worldwide foreign assistance programs and  agency operations of these entities and considers several factors when  assessing agency program risk, such as inherent risk, fraud and  corruption risk, and control risk. Audit activities include performance  audits and reviews of programs and management systems, financial  statement audits, and audits related to financial accountability of grantees  and contractors. The USAID OIG also investigates allegations of fraud,  waste, and abuse relating to the foreign assistance programs and  operations.", "The quality of an OIG\u2019s work is a critical element of IG effectiveness.  Consolidation with a larger OIG could improve the quality of work at the  Commission OIG. This could be accomplished by using a strategic, risk- based approach for auditing and increasing staffing resources with the  requisite technical auditing and accounting expertise necessary to  improve program efficiency and effectiveness. As we noted earlier, audits  performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards (GAGAS) provide information used for oversight,  accountability, transparency, and improvements of government programs  and operations. When auditors comply with GAGAS in reporting the  results, their work can lead to improved management, better decision  making and oversight, effective and efficient operations, accountability,  and transparency for resources. In addition, consolidation with a larger  OIG could increase the OIG\u2019s ability to effectively plan for work, including  implementing a strategic and risk-based approach to auditing agency  programs and operations of high risk. Routine access to staff resources  with the requisite subject matter expertise, such as information  technology personnel, payroll services personnel, and a highly trained  financial management workforce, could also be an advantage of  consolidating with a larger OIG.", "However, consolidation with larger OIGs could also result in  disadvantages, such as limited contact with agency program  management officials who have the institutional knowledge pertaining to  agency missions and priorities. There may also be management  challenges in determining the appropriate amount of resources to  dedicate toward performing sufficient oversight of the Commission\u2019s  programs. For example, the Commission may not be a material entity  when compared to the larger agency; therefore, when using a risk-based  approach, the Commission may not get the necessary OIG oversight with  respect to its critical programs and operations from the larger OIG."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidation with a Regional Commission OIG", "paragraphs": ["Consolidation with a single regional commission OIG could serve as  another alternative structure.

For example, the ARC is a  regional economic development agency that represents a partnership of  federal, state, and local governments. Established by the Congress in the  Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965, the ARC was established to assist the region in promoting economic development and  establishing a framework for joint federal and state efforts to provide the  basic facilities essential to its growth on a coordinated and concerted  regional basis. The ARC is composed of the governors of the 13  Appalachian states and a Federal Cochair, who is appointed by the  President. Local participation is provided through multicounty local  development districts.", "The ARC OIG reported that it has three full-time employees, has an  annual budget of approximately $634,000, and has performed 81 audits  and inspections during fiscal years 2011 to 2013. According to the ARC  OIG website, the ARC OIG provides independent and objective audits,  inspections, and evaluations relating to agency programs and operations.  The ARC prepares a 5-year strategic plan and annual work plans to  identify grant audits that represent the most significant aspect of the  ARC\u2019s programs. The ARC OIG\u2019s grant audits are based on factors such  as the value of the grant, location, type of grant, and prior history. The  ARC OIG also provides a means for keeping the ARC Federal Cochair,  the other commissioners, and the Congress fully informed about  problems and deficiencies at the ARC.", "Consolidation of the Commission OIG with another regional commission  OIG could serve to (1) strengthen institutional knowledge regarding  agency programs and operations and (2) achieve economies of scale.  Since regional commissions are focused on building the infrastructure  and targeting economic growth to distressed areas in specific rural  geographic locations, consolidation of the Commission OIG with another  regional OIG could improve institutional knowledge at the Commission  OIG. Given the similarities in their scope and mission, efficiencies may be  achieved by leveraging resources between the two regional commissions.  In addition, consolidation could serve to increase the availability of  investigative resources to detect fraud, waste, and abuse while achieving  other efficiencies. A disadvantage to this approach could be that  resources become strained, limiting the effectiveness of the OIG to  perform its duties for both agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Divide OIG Oversight Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["The Commission IG stated that he spent approximately 25 percent of his  time overseeing the contracted auditor for the Commission annual  financial statement audit and therefore used inspections to leverage the  time he had to perform oversight. Another alternative is to divide OIG  oversight responsibilities for the agency performance audits,  investigations, and inspections and the agency financial statement audits  between two separate federal OIGs, such as a regional commission OIG  or a larger OIG. The regional commission OIG would perform the audits,  investigations, and inspections of agency programs and operations based  on its similar mission and scope. The larger OIG would conduct and  oversee the agency\u2019s annual financial statement audit. A current example  of this structure exists at the Department of Transportation (DOT) OIG.  The DOT OIG has the authority to review the financial statement audit,  property management, and business operations of the National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), including internal accounting and  administrative control systems, to determine whether they comply with  applicable laws, rules, and regulations. GAO conducts broad  management reviews on behalf of the NTSB. In addition, Amtrak is a DFE  under the IG Act and has an OIG, but Amtrak itself, rather than the OIG,  is required to engage an IPA to audit its annual financial statements. In  fiscal year 2011, the Amtrak OIG began monitoring the IPA that  performed the financial statement audit for Amtrak. Further, the DOT OIG  is required by statute to conduct certain oversight of Amtrak operations,  including an annual review of Amtrak\u2019s budget and 5-year financial plan.", "This divided approach could reduce the strain of oversight responsibilities  on one OIG by providing a shared responsibility between two OIGs while  potentially providing sufficient agency oversight. In addition, dividing  responsibilities between two OIGs would serve to leverage the OIGs\u2019  expertise (i.e., similar mission, subject matter experts, etc.) in conducting  performance audits, investigations, inspections, and evaluations for one  OIG assuming oversight responsibilities. The other OIG\u2019s expertise could  also be leveraged for conducting the annual financial statement audit.", "However, disadvantages in this approach could be a lack of effective  communication and coordination between the two OIGs. For example,  internal control deficiencies and recommendations resulting from the  financial statement audit may not be communicated in a timely manner to  the OIG with program and operational oversight responsibilities of the  agency. This could delay the implementation and preparation of  corrective action plans to address and correct deficiencies found during  the financial statement audit in a timely manner, which could also have a  programmatic or operational impact. In addition, this approach could  require the agencies to coordinate activities such as requests for financial  statement audit documents and requests for documentation for  performance audits and investigations. This could put additional stress on  the smaller OIG to fulfill requests for documentation and meetings while  still performing daily duties required at the agency.", "Figure 5 demonstrates how various responsibilities could be divided  among various IG offices.", "While there is no clear-cut option with respect to the alternative OIG  structures presented above, any specific decision concerning  consolidations of IG offices should result from dialogue among the  affected agencies, CIGIE, and the Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OIG\u2019s are responsible for coordinating audits, inspections, and  investigations.
