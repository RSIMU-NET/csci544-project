Similarly, the Air Force  cancelled or reduced participation in 32 of 48 of its large-scale  planned exercises, including two of its key multinational training  events. According to service officials, these lost opportunities limited  the number of trained individuals and units and contributed to an  expected delay in achieving the goal of restoring readiness to forces  that have been heavily deployed supporting overseas contingency  operations.", "Program officials from 15 of the 19 weapon systems we reviewed  reported experiencing delays, in part, due to the fiscal year 2013  sequestration.

For example, due to spending reductions,  the Navy cancelled the deployments of the USNS Comfort and its  supporting medical units, the USS Kauffman, and a maritime civil  affairs team to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility.  The Navy also postponed other deployments, such as delaying by  4 months the deployment of the USS Harry S Truman Carrier Strike  Group to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

Air Force officials said the shortfalls decreased their response  capability for attending to critical incidents like aircraft fires or fuel  spills, and to the air base defense program. However, officials were  unable to quantify the specific number of personnel shortfalls or risk  based on decisions to reduce funding for these base services.", "Program officials for 9 of 19 weapon systems we reviewed reported  reduced or deferred system development or procurement efforts as a  result of fiscal year 2013 sequestration reductions, which in turn  delayed the release of these enhanced systems to the warfighter. For  example, Army MQ-1C Gray Eagle unmanned aircraft system  program officials told us that a reduction in procurement funds due to  sequestration resulted in deferrals and delays for procuring a number  of upgrades to the system, including radio upgrades, new shipping  containers, and an engine lifetime extension. These deferrals could, in  turn, delay the eventual fielding of the upgraded aircraft to the  warfighter, since they increase the risk that the system may not  receive necessary certifications that it is safe and suitable for use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Sequestration Effects Were Interdependent, and Some Effects Varied among Service Components", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of DOD- and service-identified actions found that many of  the reported sequestration-related effects were interdependent and  overlapped.

As a result, one Navy command estimated that it cost an  additional $135,000 over its budgeted operating expenses for three  ships to delay their arrival to port and auxiliary steam because they  could not connect to shore power outside of the restricted port hours.", "Officials from the Navy\u2019s CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program  office told us that sequestration reductions contributed to a 2-month  delay to the program\u2019s schedule, including the start of low-rate initial  production, where small quantities of the system are produced for  testing and evaluation before producing greater quantities for fielding.  These officials told us the delays affected acquisition milestones and  the fielding of a more capable helicopter, and estimated that  sustaining the program for an additional 2 months would increase  estimated program costs by about $20 million to $30 million.", "Within our case studies, we also found that sequestration effects varied in  type among different services and their components. For a given case  study area, some components identified little to no effect overall, while  other components reported a combination of effects related to costs and  spending, time frames or cancelled activities, and to the availability of  forces. For example, some service command officials we interviewed told  us that they were not aware of any significant negative effects on base  operating support within their command or component with regard to the  availability of personnel or equipment. While some Air Force commands  did report negative effects due to sequestration, as noted earlier, four  other Air Force commands reported to us that they were able to  accomplish their missions in fiscal year 2013 without any critical  disruptions to the delivery of base support services.

These types of effects include, among others, a decline in morale, the  ability to hire and recruit a high-caliber civilian workforce, and the ability to  build and maintain partner nation trust. In addition, our prior work found  that, according to service officials, the 6-day civilian furlough during fiscal  year 2013 negatively affected morale among civilian employees as well  as service members.", "Officials from three of the military services also told us they believe the  fiscal year 2013 sequestration has continued to affect their ability to  recruit civilian and military personnel, but the effects on recruitment were  undetermined at the time of our review and may not be quantifiable. For  example, Navy officials told us they believe that the cancellation of fleet  weeks and 27 of 30 Blue Angel squadron flight demonstrations in fiscal  year 2013 could affect their future recruitment rates because those events  are critical to their recruitment strategy.", "Further, officials from the Air Force and Navy said that reducing and  cancelling exercises and deployments can negatively affect their ability to  build and maintain partner nation trust, which is difficult to quantify. For  example, Pacific Air Force documentation shows that the command  reduced or cancelled their participation across several bilateral and  multilateral training exercises. Officials said this likely affected their ability  to build trust and partner capacity in the region and moreover, could give  the appearance to other partner nations that the United States is an  unreliable or uncommitted partner. Pacific Air Forces officials said that  they would consider making different choices should sequestration occur  again, because of concerns about the United States appearing unreliable  or uncommitted to its partners, and the effect that lost trust could have on  future U.S. participation in the region. Similarly, Pacific Fleet officials said  that reductions to fuel as a result of sequestration limited participation in  exercises and foreign country port visits in Seventh Fleet, which is  assigned to support U.S. Pacific Command, and that cancelled  deployments limited participation in support of partnership events in  Fourth Fleet, which is assigned to U.S. Southern Command. Pacific Fleet  officials said that these cancelled or reduced commitments would affect  the Navy\u2019s ability to engage and build relationships with partner nations.", "The fiscal year 2013 sequestration resulted in other effects that may not  be known for years, such as the future costs associated with facilities  repair and equipment maintenance projects that were deferred during  fiscal year 2013. For example, in fiscal year 2013 the Army reduced  funding for facilities sustainment projects, including preventative  maintenance and repairs, by nearly $1 billion dollars, which represented  about 40 percent of its fiscal year 2013 base budget request. Officials told  us there may be an increased future cost to restore facilities to standards,  but were unable to determine the additional cost. Likewise, Navy  officials stated that the deferral of many non-emergency maintenance and  sustainment activities may eventually diminish facility life cycles and lead  to higher future costs for restoration or demolition, but these officials were  unable to determine the increased costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Used Available Means to Mitigate the Effects of Sequestration, but Has Not Consistently Documented and Shared Best Practices or Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the military services generally relied on previously existing  processes and funding flexibilities, such as the ability to reprogram and  transfer funds, to mitigate the effects of the fiscal year 2013  sequestration.

Guidance provided before and after  the President\u2019s sequestration order emphasized that federal agencies  should identify appropriate steps to manage budgetary uncertainty while  minimizing any adverse effects to agency missions. For example, an  Office of Management and Budget memorandum on planning for  budgetary uncertainty in fiscal year 2013 directed federal agencies to use  any available flexibility to reduce operational risks and minimize effects on  the agency\u2019s core mission. Similarly, a DOD memorandum on handling  budgetary uncertainty authorized its components to begin implementing  near-term actions, reversible if possible, to mitigate the risks caused by  the continuing resolution in place at the time, and potential  sequestration.", "In response to this guidance, DOD and the military services took various  actions to mitigate the effect of sequestration, such as establishing  processes to identify priorities and evaluate alternatives for spending  reductions. In some cases, the military services leveraged existing  approaches, such as ranking programs and functions, to manage  sequestration reductions within their commands and program offices. For  example, according to Army budget officials, the Army utilized a process  referred to as a sequestration \u201cRehearsal of Concept\u201d drill to identify  priorities Army-wide and implement reductions. According to Army  officials, a Rehearsal of Concept drill is generally used to inform  operational decisions, but this drill was used for the fiscal year 2013  sequestration to involve relevant stakeholders and establish priorities  across the range of programs and activities that would be affected by  sequestration reductions. Army Forces Command officials informed us  that in addition to the Rehearsal of Concept drill, the Army also relied on a  process referred to as a \u201cFocus Area Review Group\u201d to manage  sequestration reductions in an effort to maintain readiness and minimize  risks to the Army\u2019s forces and missions.", "Service officials also noted that broadening some of their existing  processes removed stove-pipes to planning and allowed them to integrate  requirements and plan command- or service-wide rather than by  individual functional area. For example, to implement the fiscal year 2013  sequestration reductions at the major command level, Air Combat  Command officials adapted their existing planning process by grouping all  of the command\u2019s functions and activities into three categories based on  their relative funding priority. Officials told us that considering  requirements command-wide rather than by directorate or functional area,  as they had done prior to fiscal year 2013, gave them better visibility over  the interrelationship of funding and allowed them to make more informed  decisions about what functions and services were needed to maintain  their commitment to readiness. For example, command officials said this  allowed them to consider and balance the need for base operating  support funding for utilities and building leases against other priorities  such as their flying hour program.", "Using these processes to prioritize funding, the services were able to  mitigate some effects to those activities deemed the most critical based  on DOD and service guidance, while reducing funding to lower priority  activities. Within the areas we selected for more in-depth review, we  found that the services prioritized areas, such as training and equipment  maintenance in support of deployed and next-to-deploy forces and base  services like family and warfighter support programs. For example, we  found the military services prioritized funding for base support services  over funding for facilities, sustainment, restoration, and modernization  projects because base support services fund essential functions like  family programs, civilian salaries, and utilities. According to our analysis  of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget data, the services reduced facilities,  sustainment, restoration, and modernization funds by about $2.8 billion or  almost 27 percent of the enacted funding amount, which was almost three  times as much as the approximately $1 billion, or 4 percent reduction to  base operating support services. Furthermore, the military services  prioritized funding to support training and equipment maintenance for  currently deployed and next-to-deploy forces, while cancelling or  curtailing training and maintenance for non-deploying units. For example,  all four of the military services reported being able to fulfill combatant  commanders\u2019 requests for forces in fiscal year 2013, but said that  reductions in training for non-deploying units affected the readiness of  these forces.", "DOD also used existing funding flexibilities to manage sequestration  reductions and other budgetary constraints in fiscal year 2013, such as  the ability to establish funding priorities for certain accounts, use prior  year unobligated balances to achieve some portion of the sequestration  reductions, and use reprogramming and transfer authorities to realign  funds between and within accounts. For example, with regard to the  operation and maintenance accounts, DOD officials said they had more  flexibility in allocating sequestration spending reductions than they did for  other accounts. Specifically, the program, project, and activity for  operation and maintenance was defined at the overall account level.  According to officials from DOD and some military services, this provided  the flexibility to establish funding priorities for specific activities within  accounts and reduce funding for lower priority activities. This is in contrast  to the program, project, and activity definitions for the RDT&E,  procurement, and military construction appropriation accounts. For these  accounts, DOD and the services had to apply reductions evenly across  each budget line item for their individual weapon systems or other  acquisition programs and military construction projects.", "As discussed earlier, DOD and the military services also reported using  prior year unobligated balances to help meet fiscal year 2013  sequestration reductions within their RDT&E, procurement, and military  construction accounts. According to some DOD and service officials, the  use of unobligated balances within the RDT&E and procurement  accounts helped them offset some sequestration reductions and minimize  the effect those reductions may have otherwise had. For example,  according to Air Force officials the use of prior year unobligated balances,  among other factors, allowed them to protect their top weapon systems  and other acquisition programs and avoid some schedule delays.", "DOD also used its transfer and reprogramming authorities to help mitigate  the effects of sequestration and other budgetary constraints in fiscal year  2013. DOD officials said that transfer and reprogramming flexibilities are  used annually to address funding priorities. However, the use of transfers  and reprogrammings helped them mitigate reduced resources as a result  of sequestration as well as to cover expenses related to overseas  contingency operations shortfalls and emergent operational requirements,  among other factors. Our review of DOD data found that the department  used most of its available transfer authority and realigned most of these  funds into the operation and maintenance accounts from other types of  accounts. Specifically, according to data from Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials, of the $7.5 billion in transfer  authority available to DOD for fiscal year 2013, DOD utilized $6.8 billion,  or about 91 percent of the authority in total. Using these authorities, DOD  had the flexibility to move funds between appropriations and in doing so  provided additional resources to the operation and maintenance  accounts. Our analysis also found that DOD transferred about $5.7 billion  into the operation and maintenance accounts from other appropriations,  primarily from the military personnel and procurement accounts.", "The use of transfers and reprogrammings allowed the services to mitigate  or reverse some actions that were taken initially after the March 1, 2013  sequestration order. For example, in July 2013, the Air Force resumed  flight operations for 17 active duty combat units that had initially ceased  flying in April 2013. The Navy also restored planned maintenance for  eight surface ships that had been initially deferred. Similarly, DOD used  transfer or reprogramming authorities to move funds from prior years and  cancelled projects unrelated to sequestration, to offset the $821 million  sequestration reduction within the military construction accounts. DOD  and service officials stated that as a result of this flexibility, no  construction projects were delayed, reduced in scope, or cancelled as a  result of sequestration.", "Notwithstanding the flexibility to transfer and reprogram funds, some  actions taken in response to sequestration could not be reversed, and  some of the programs we reviewed within the RDT&E and procurement  accounts also had their funding further reduced by transfer and  reprogramming actions. For example, Army training officials stated  capacity constraints at their Combat Training Centers and the timing of  funds reprogrammed later in the fiscal year affected the Army\u2019s ability to  reschedule cancelled Combat Training Center rotations. In addition, we  found that several acquisition programs for weapon systems included  within our RDT&E and procurement case study had their funding reduced  as a result of transfers or reprogrammings beyond the sequestration  reductions, including the AH-64E Apache helicopter and F-15 and F-22  aircrafts. According to Air Force F-15 officials, about $24 million in  RDT&E and procurement funding was transferred to support critical  readiness shortfalls within the Air Force\u2019s operation and maintenance  account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and the Services Have Not Consistently Documented, Assessed, and Shared Best Practices or Lessons Learned from Implementing and Managing Sequestration", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with GAO\u2019s March 2014 recommendation, the Office of  Management and Budget updated its guidance to federal agencies in  November 2014 to include a section specific to sequestration. This  guidance instructs federal agencies to record decisions about how  sequestration is implemented to maintain consistency from year to year,  inform efforts to plan for sequestration in future years, and build  institutional knowledge. Although the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s guidance was revised after the end of fiscal year 2013 and does  not explicitly require agencies to record decisions regarding the fiscal  year 2013 sequestration, federal internal control standards also highlight  the importance of documenting significant events in a timely manner.  Specifically, these standards state that agencies should identify, record,  and distribute pertinent information to the right people in sufficient detail,  in the right form, and at the appropriate time to enable them to carry out  their duties and responsibilities and ensure that communications are  relevant, reliable, and timely.", "During our review, we found that DOD and the services had taken some  steps to document decisions and actions taken in response to reduced  resources in fiscal year 2013. For example, according to officials from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), their office had  documented decisions on sequestration reductions at the program,  project, and activity level with the release of their June 2013 report, DOD  Report on the Joint Committee Sequestration for Fiscal Year 2013. These  officials also told us that throughout the implementation of sequestration  in fiscal year 2013, their office collected information from the military  services on programs, projects, and activities that were cancelled due to  sequestration and reported this information to the Office of Management  and Budget. In addition, some officials within the services\u2019 budget offices  confirmed that sequestration reductions at the program, project, and  activity level had been documented in their financial management  systems.", "Officials from all of the services also informally identified some lessons  learned from their experiences implementing sequestration. Officials told  us that prior to sequestration, they had not considered or were not fully  aware of the interdependency of certain programs and activities, the order  in which certain functions would need to have funding restored to  accomplish intended results, or the potential for unintended  consequences as a result of some funding decisions. For example, Army  officials told us that shortfalls in funding for training ranges and facilities  affected the Army\u2019s ability to conduct training for some units whose  resources had been reduced due to sequestration. Army Forces  Command officials explained that unit readiness continued to decline  through fiscal year 2014 even though funding had been restored for its  units until ammunition distribution, maintenance, transportation, and  training range services were also restored.", "Further, Air Force officials identified the need to balance reductions  between operational and individual training requirements, and noted that  both preserving funding for individual training and education requirements  and maintaining a commitment to provide ready forces for operations are  important to the long-term health of the force. Similarly, officials from the  Navy said that some actions taken, such as not exempting all shipyard  civilians from furloughs or not performing preventative maintenance, had  unintended consequences for maintenance schedules or resulted in  increased costs overall. Specifically, Navy officials told us a decision to  defer preventative maintenance repairs to a damaged landing ramp later  resulted in an approximately $600,000 cost to repair a landing craft when  loose concrete damaged its engine. While officials said it is difficult to  know which decisions may lead to higher costs, they noted the  importance of understanding the interrelationship between funding and  potential consequences from funding decisions. Further, according to a  Marine Corps budget official, planning for sequestration in fiscal year  2013 allowed the Marine Corps to better understand the potential effects  that reductions would have across their commands and within functional  areas, which informed their budgetary planning in fiscal years 2014 and  2015.", "Our review found that the Joint Staff and two of the services had  undertaken initiatives to document lessons learned or best practices from  implementing sequestration. Specifically:", "Officials from the Joint Staff Manpower and Personnel directorate said  that in June 2013 they gathered effects and lessons learned specific  to DOD\u2019s civilian furlough in fiscal year 2013. Officials told us that  these efforts were not formally documented in a report or the Joint  Staff\u2019s Lessons Learned Information System, but the lessons and  effects identified would help to inform decision-making should another  civilian furlough occur.", "Similarly, in November 2013, the Navy Warfare Development  Command completed a review of the effects and lessons learned  stemming from the civilian furlough. This review identified costs,  savings, and effects associated with furloughing civilians in fiscal year  2013, as well as lessons learned and recommendations should  civilian furloughs occur again. For example, the review found that  almost half of the savings from furloughing Fleet Forces Command  and Pacific Fleet civilians was lost due to costs from schedule delays  or lost productivity, and recommended that the Navy fully consider the  interdependencies between the reductions in civilian workforce and  the Navy\u2019s capacity to meet fleet requirements should a furlough  occur again.", "At the time of our review, the Air Staff Lessons Learned directorate  was finalizing its review of information gathered from its active and  reserve components on the Air Force\u2019s implementation of  sequestration, its effect on readiness and infrastructure, and any  lessons learned that could inform future decision-making should  sequestration occur again. Air Force officials told us that they plan to  release a final report identifying their observations and lessons  learned at the end of May 2015, which they expect to share across  the Air Force and on the Joint Staff\u2019s Lessons Learned Information  System.", "The Joint Staff, Navy, and Air Force\u2019s initiatives represent positive steps  towards documenting lessons learned and best practices from  implementing sequestration. However, the information produced through  these and other DOD efforts is limited in scope and purpose, are still  ongoing, and have not been widely shared across the services. For  example, the scope of the Joint Staff\u2019s and Navy\u2019s reviews was limited to  lessons learned from the civilian furlough and the Air Force\u2019s initiative is  still ongoing. As a result, it remains unclear whether or how applicable  either of the services\u2019 lessons learned will be in informing their future  budgetary planning and decision making. Moreover, officials from the  Army, Marine Corps, and Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) told us they were unaware of the Joint Staff, Navy, and Air  Force\u2019s initiatives, suggesting that some information on lesson learned  efforts is not being disseminated across DOD and the services.", "There are existing processes in place to share information on lessons  learned across DOD and the services. For example, three of the services\u2019  lessons learned offices told us that in addition to maintaining their own  lessons learned databases, the Joint Staff\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned  Information System can be used to document and share lessons learned  identified across the services. Further, officials from Navy Warfare  Development Command told us that they learned about the Air Force\u2019s  efforts to document sequestration-related lessons learned through a  quarterly Joint Lessons Learned Program review. According to officials  from the Navy Warfare Development Command, the services\u2019 lessons  learned offices participate in these quarterly reviews, which are led by the  Joint Staff\u2019s Lessons Learned directorate and can be used to share  lessons learned and best practices across the services.", "Although DOD and some services have independently taken some steps  to document decisions and lessons learned from sequestration, they did  not establish requirements for their commands and components to  document or assess information on best practices or lessons learned, as  identified by the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance and  federal internal control standards. According to DOD and some service  officials, as of February 2015, they were unaware of or had not taken  steps to comply with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance to  document the decisions concerning implementation of sequestration. In  February 2015, officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) told us that, in their opinion, documenting decisions on  sequestration reductions at the program, project, and activity level within  their financial management systems effectively complied with the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s guidance and that they did not plan to take  any additional steps to document lessons learned in response to the  guidance.", "Officials with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  and some of the military services also told us they did not see the value in  documenting or assessing past decisions or gathering such information  beyond the efforts they have already made. For example, officials with the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) explained that the  weekly reports provided to the Office of Management and Budget on  actions taken in response to sequestration in fiscal year 2013 have not  been used to provide a comprehensive assessment of sequestration\u2019s  effects. According to these officials, they consider each sequestration  event to be unique and said that that they would issue subsequent  guidance to the components on how to implement any future instances of  sequestration at that time, should it occur. However, these officials did  acknowledge that consolidating policy memorandums and documentation  regarding management actions taken during the fiscal year 2013  sequestration so that these decisions are easily accessible across the  department might be beneficial to planning for a possible future  sequestration.", "DOD\u2019s efforts to document sequestration decisions within their financial  accounting systems could provide some visibility over how the  department allocated sequestration reductions to inform future planning  efforts. Yet these decisions are not inclusive of the broader principles and  practices used by the department to manage sequestration reductions in  fiscal year 2013 and do not account for any lessons learned during the  implementation of sequestration. Without documenting, assessing, and  sharing DOD\u2019s and the services\u2019 best practices and lessons learned from  implementing sequestration, including, for example, strategies for  evaluating the interdependence of various funding sources subject to  budgetary reductions, DOD is missing an opportunity to gain valuable  institutional knowledge that would help facilitate future decision making  about budgetary reductions should sequestration occur again."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD received relief in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 from the spending caps  established by the Budget Control Act of 2011, but under current law,  DOD could experience sequestration again in future fiscal years,  depending on the appropriations enacted for fiscal year 2016 and beyond.  In fiscal year 2013, DOD was able to reduce the effects of sequestration  on programs that the department and the military services determined to  be high priorities. However, the reductions that did occur had a variety of  effects, including cancelled training exercises and delays in performing  equipment maintenance, contracting for military construction projects, and  developing and procuring weapon systems, among others, as well as  longer-term effects that may be hard to determine. Given that some  budget flexibilities the department used in 2013 to mitigate the size of  reductions may be unavailable in future years\u2014for example because of a  decrease in available prior year funds for transfer or reprogramming\u2014it is  all the more important that DOD be able to use the institutional knowledge  it gained when implementing sequestration in fiscal year 2013. In light of  this possibility and other ongoing budget uncertainties, the department  could benefit from a close examination of its experience with  sequestration in fiscal year 2013.

In addition, in July 2013 Headquarters Air Force reprogrammed  about $200 million, which allowed Air Combat Command to resume flying operations for  all units that had ceased flying earlier in the fiscal year. example, Army headquarters officials said that cancelling combat training  center rotations in fiscal year 2013 further limited professional  development opportunities for commanders that have had their combat  training center rotations focused on mission-specific training since 2001,  such as counter-insurgency skills. Further, Army headquarters officials  explained that cancelled combat training center rotations may also have  long-term consequences to units\u2019 training and leadership expertise for  certain skills. For example, officials noted that officers and  noncommissioned officers in senior command positions who have  received limited training across the full range of operations may not have  sufficient expertise and experience to teach these skills to the junior  officers and noncommissioned officers they are expected to lead, adding  to a gap in expertise for some service personnel.", "In addition, according to Air Combat Command documents and officials,  the Air Force stood down 17 of their 62 operational squadrons for  3 months in fiscal year 2013, and reduced flying hours for 10 other  squadrons for a period of 1 to 3 months each. Air Force officials told us  that the stand-down of the squadrons and reduced flying hours created  several effects. For example, Air Combat Command officials said that  pilots experienced deterioration in the proficiency of critical skills and  combat readiness that needed to be restored once the squadrons  resumed flying operations. Specifically, as of July 2013, an Air Combat  Command document reported a 13 percent decrease in reported combat  readiness due to reduced flying hours. In addition, pilots were unable to  execute more advanced training because they had to redo previously  completed training to regain lost proficiency. Air Combat Command  officials also told us that sequestration reductions resulted in the  cancellation of some training courses that may affect officer career  progression and the availability of these skill sets. For example, Air Force  documents show that a cancelled course for weapons instructors  prevented more than 100 weapons officers from being available for  assignment and will decrease the Air Force\u2019s ability to fill weapons  instructor positions through at least fiscal year 2016.", "Due to fiscal year 2013 sequestration reductions, the services also  cancelled some joint exercises, which led to lost opportunities to perform  training across services or combined training with other nations. For  example, officials from the Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet told us they cancelled  their biennial Northern Edge 13 joint training exercise. According to  Pacific Fleet officials, this joint exercise is designed to include Navy,  Marine Corps, and Air Force service participation and is one of two  regularly scheduled joint exercises in the U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s area of  responsibility. These officials noted that its cancellation resulted in a  four-year gap in holding the event, limiting opportunities to conduct joint  training within the command. Further, Air Combat Command officials told  us that the Air Force cancelled or reduced participation in 32 of 48 large- scale planned exercises, ultimately effecting training for 283 units and  13 partner nations. Of those exercises cancelled, two were the Air Force\u2019s  joint and multinational \u201cRed Flag\u201d exercises designed to emulate the full  spectrum of operations. Air Combat Command and Air National Guard  officials told us these lost training opportunities affected both active and  reserve units\u2019 ability to conduct combined training and build relationships  with partner nations.", "The cancellation of exercises and reduced training opportunities also  resulted in reported delays for meeting some of the services\u2019 goals to  restore readiness for units affected by a high pace of combat operations.  For example, according to DOD budget documents, the Army planned to  begin refocusing the training for brigade combat teams undergoing  combat training center rotations in fiscal year 2013 on skills necessary to  perform full spectrum operations. However, Army headquarters officials  stated that the cancellation of six training exercises, along with other  reductions to training, delayed their goal of achieving readiness for full  spectrum operations for brigade combat teams from fiscal year 2019 until  at least 2020. Similarly, an Air Force headquarters official told us that it  took squadrons that were stood down an average of 9 months to regain  pilot proficiency and recover lost readiness. As a result of being stood  down and the amount of time spent regaining proficiency, Air Combat  Command officials reported that some pilots were only able to complete  mission-specific training prior to deploying and were unable to train for  other missions across the full spectrum of operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reduced Training and Resources Limited the Availability of Forces and Equipment", "paragraphs": ["Some actions the service components took to reduce spending in fiscal  year 2013 reportedly decreased the availability of forces and equipment  to support emergent needs or for other purposes.

According to  testimony by the Chief of Staff of the Army, 85 percent of brigade combat  teams were not ready for combat in fiscal year 2013, if required. Army  Forces Command officials told us that their training plans are designed so  that half of active component brigade combat teams are ready to deploy if  required. However, these officials told us that three brigade combat teams  with the required training were available to meet surge requirements at  the end of fiscal year 2013.", "Air Force officials also reported effects on the number of units available to  respond to emergent requirements and the availability of equipment for  training. For example, Air Combat Command officials told us that from  April to July 2013 when the Air Force stood down 17 operational  squadrons and reduced flying hours for 10 more squadrons, it had  1 squadron with the required combat training available to deploy for  emergent requirements. Furthermore, according to internal summary  reports by two Air Force commands, these commands chose to limit their  supply purchases for squadrons to reduce spending, including purchases  of spare parts for equipment and weapon system repairs, to those  considered essential for fiscal 2013, and to defer any other purchases to  future years. Air Force maintenance officials told us that the reduction in  the stockpile of repair parts generally led to increased repair times in  fiscal year 2013, although the specific duration of those delays was  unknown. The officials also noted that the resulting shortfalls of available  spare parts sometimes delayed maintenance completion on equipment  and weapon systems, thereby reducing the availability of those items to  units for training and operations.", "In addition, due to reduced resources in fiscal year 2013, the Navy  postponed or cancelled some planned deployments, which resulted in a  10 percent decrease in its deployed forces worldwide. For example, as  noted above, the Navy delayed the deployment of the USS Harry S  Truman carrier strike group, which according to a Navy headquarters  official reduced the Navy\u2019s presence in the U.S. Central Command\u2019s area  of responsibility to one carrier strike group. This official told us that the  delay of the Truman also affected the deployment of a subsequent carrier  strike group, which decreased the Navy\u2019s ability to respond to  contingency operations.", "Furthermore, due to spending reductions in fiscal year 2013, officials from  the Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet told us they reduced funding for their ship fuel  program, which led to cancelled deployments and reductions to training.  According to Pacific Fleet data on fourth quarter fuel reductions, Fourth  Fleet, which is assigned to support U.S. Southern Command, received  fuel for about 55 percent of its scheduled training and operational  requirements.

Our  analysis of fiscal year 2013 Air Force flying hour data shows that, after  declining from April through June, active duty combat units began  increasing their execution of flying hours in July and August.", "DOD transferred about $135 million to the Navy\u2019s operation and  maintenance account to restore some flying hours and support  unbudgeted missions, among other things. According to an official  from the Navy\u2019s financial management office, this funding allowed the  Navy to restore tactical flying hours and fund unbudgeted ship  operations in the Middle East.", "The use of transfers and reprogrammings gave the services some  flexibility to manage reductions, but did not allow them to restore some  actions taken in response to the fiscal year 2013 sequestration.  Specifically, Army and Air Force officials told us that because some of the  transferred or reprogrammed funds did not become available until later in  the year, some cancelled exercises and training classes could not be  restored. For example, Army Forces Command officials said that because  of capacity limitations at combat training centers, they would have been  unable to reschedule cancelled exercises even if additional funds had  become available later in the year. Additionally, Air Combat Command  officials described to us the difficulty of spending reprogrammed funds  because of the interrelationship of funding sources and activities. For  example, these officials told us that when transferred or reprogrammed  funds for flight hours became available, the Air Force had to first restore  training for aircrew and maintenance personnel that had lost critical skills  before pilots were able to resume flying hours.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2013, some service officials reported taking  actions to help mitigate existing readiness shortfalls that were  exacerbated by sequestration. For example, Army Forces Command  officials told us that in response to concerns about the service\u2019s ability to  surge units during sequestration and only having three brigade combat  teams available to meet surge requirements at the end of fiscal year  2013, the Army created the \u201cArmy Contingency Force.\u201d According to DOD  and Army budget documents, the Army Contingency Force will include a  mix of fully trained brigades capable of providing an initial response and  surge capability to respond to emerging requirements. Furthermore, as  part of its ongoing efforts to address concerns about the pace of  operations, length of deployments, and overall readiness, the Navy  recently revised its operational schedule\u2014referred to as the Optimized  Fleet Response Plan\u2014for its carrier strike groups.

For example, officials from Naval Sea  Systems Command told us they frequently leveraged a pre-existing  process, which they referred to as \u201crebaselining,\u201d in fiscal year 2013 to  better align the shipyards\u2019 workforce and capacity with the top priorities  for maintenance within their workload. \u201cRebaselining\u201d is a process of  changing the cost, schedule, or performance associated with  maintenance workloads. These officials stated that they utilized the  rebaselining process more often in fiscal year 2013 than in prior years as  a way to mitigate some effects of sequestration and fiscal uncertainty on  the decreased availability of certain maintenance personnel due to hiring  freezes and restrictions on overtime work. Additionally, these Naval Sea  Systems Command officials reported that they petitioned for and received  an exemption for shipyard workers from the civilian furlough, which  protected a substantial portion of the shipyard workforce from the  disruption of furlough days. Officials believe this furlough exemption also  enabled them to maintain a substantial level of shipyard productivity.", "To reduce the effect of sequestration reductions, the Army temporarily  reduced the standard at which non-deployed units were required to  maintain their equipment, including vehicles, in fiscal year 2013, while still  ensuring those items were safe to operate. The change in standard  enabled unit commanders to reduce their expenses by delaying the  purchase of repair parts and maintenance costs. According to Army  maintenance officials, in fiscal year 2013, the Army also created the Army  Maintenance Sequestration Working Group to assess depot workload  requirements, reprioritize available funding, and make recommendations  for reprogramming actions to meet Army equipment maintenance  requirements within the budgetary constraints imposed by sequestration.

Six of eight active component Air Force commands  that we interviewed reported that they cancelled or changed the terms of  some base service contracts to reduce their fiscal year 2013 expenses for  services such as dining, custodial services, or grounds keeping, and  deferred some of those contract costs into fiscal year 2014.

For example, according to installation  management officials from the Army and internal reports, the Army  deferred a substantial amount of infrastructure-related spending from  fiscal year 2013 to future years. Specifically, our analysis of budget  justification and execution data showed that the Army reduced its fiscal  year 2013 base funding for facilities sustainment projects\u2014including  preventive maintenance and repairs\u2014by nearly $1 billion. This amount  represented about 40 percent of its base budget request for fiscal year  2013 sustainment projects. Officials from the Army\u2019s installation  management command told us that the negative effects of reduced  sustainment funding and preventive maintenance on service-wide  infrastructure conditions and their expected life spans are not immediately  apparent and will be unknown for several more years. Moreover, the  amount of future increased costs that may be needed to restore  infrastructure to required conditions was also undetermined at the time of  our review. However, officials stated that reductions to preventive  maintenance and repairs eventually necessitate increased investment to  repair or replace deteriorated infrastructure or to demolish facilities that  are no longer safe or require cost-prohibitive restoration.

In April 2008 and May 2009, we found that  deferring sustainment of DOD facilities will likely result in continued facility  deterioration and higher future costs.", "In addition, the services identified some instances of compressed time  frames for awarding operating support and infrastructure contracts that  may have led to higher contract costs. According to Army, Navy, and Air  Force officials, uncertainty about funding levels for base operating  support for much of fiscal year 2013 was exacerbated by sequestration.  The duration of this uncertainty about base operating support budgets  reduced the amount of time available for commands to award many of  their contracts relative to the available time in prior years. For example,  the Navy awarded about $570 million worth of various facilities  sustainment, restoration, and modernization contracts within the last  2 weeks of fiscal year 2013. This amount represented a 10 percent  increase over the dollar amount of contracts awarded during the same 2- week period of the prior year.

According to service installation  management officials we spoke with, the total dollar amount or quantity of  deferred infrastructure projects in any given year cannot always be  attributed specifically to one factor over another, including sequestration  reductions in fiscal year 2013. However, these officials also told us that  sequestration-related spending reductions contributed to their decisions  to defer facility maintenance and projects in fiscal year 2013, thus  exacerbating an already growing backlog of projects and repairs over the  past years. For example, Army installation management officials told us  that certain utilities modernization and upgrade projects were not  completed in fiscal year 2013 as a result of sequestration and the lower  priority assigned to those types of projects compared to others related to  health or safety, such as airfield runway repairs.

However, Army installation management officials  told us that the estimated number of unfilled work orders may understate  the value and quantity of maintenance that was not performed in 2013  because the Army conveyed informal guidance directing base personnel  to refrain from submitting non-essential work order requests that year due  to the limitations on available sustainment funding across installations.", "Similarly, officials from the eight active-component Air Force commands  that we interviewed and the Air National Guard reported various delays to  routine maintenance, repairs, or infrastructure inspections related to  reductions to sustainment funding. For example, Air Force Special  Operations Command officials told us that some recurring tasks, such as  airfield vegetation clearing and runway rubber removal and re-striping,  were delayed to fiscal year 2014 to accommodate more urgent tasks or  projects. They explained that this in turn contributed to the delayed  completion of facility repair and construction projects that were planned  for that year.

For example, across installations, port operations were  restricted to normal business hours unless a flag officer exemption was  granted to permit after-hours access. This restriction in turn led to some  increased costs associated with additional steaming time for ships that  arrived late or early to port.

While the specific reasons for these  transfers or reprogrammings for AH-64E Apache, F-15 and F-22 were not  transparent, we could determine through budget analysis that, as noted  above, the Navy\u2019s Virginia class submarine and DDG-1000 received  transferred or reprogrammed funds to mitigate shortfalls created by the  fiscal year 2013 sequestration. Also, according to F-15 officials, their  fiscal year 2013 RDT&E and procurement funding were decreased by a  transfer of $10 million and $14.0 million, respectively, to provide funding  for critical readiness shortfalls resulting from sequestration, specifically to  pay for Air Force Operation and Maintenance shortfalls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Case Study 5 - Military Construction Accounts: DOD and Military Services\u2019 Major Military Construction Projects", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and Certain Service Components Reduced Their Budgetary Resources for Military Construction Accounts by About 4 Percent", "paragraphs": ["Sequestration reductions to the military construction accounts in fiscal  year 2013 totaled about $821 million, which represented a reduction of  about 4 percent of the sequestrable base.

Accordingly, each applicable service component and the defense-wide account were given a fixed percentage by which  the funds for each project and budget activity in their military construction  accounts would be reduced.", "As shown in figure 21, about 74 percent ($604 million) of the $821 million  fiscal year 2013 sequestration reduction was applied to major military  construction projects.

Service component officials told us  that sequestration contributed to an increased number of contracts for  projects that were not awarded in the fiscal year in which they were  funded, and officials told us it is a best practice to award all contracts in  the same fiscal year in which the project is funded. For instance, the Navy  reported that 33 active component projects were not awarded contracts in  fiscal year 2013 out of 54 projects funded. By comparison, in fiscal year  2012, 17 of the active Navy\u2019s 57 funded projects were not awarded  contracts and were instead awarded in the next fiscal year.

In an effort to minimize the effect of  sequestration on military construction projects, in May 2013 the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) provided verbal direction  that available bid savings should be reprogrammed to the extent possible  for projects requiring additional funds. Further, according to DOD\u2019s verbal  guidance, each construction project should be assessed to determine if it  could absorb a sequestration reduction, could be completed with below  threshold reprogrammings, or would require prior congressional approval  for above threshold reprogrammings.", "Our analysis of DOD\u2019s reprogramming data for the military construction  accounts showed, in line with the May 2013 direction, that the source for  these reprogramming actions consisted primarily of available bid savings  from projects appropriated in fiscal years prior to 2013. DOD and  service officials stated that they were able to absorb the effect of  sequestration reductions by executing reprogrammings of bid savings  from prior year projects. Further, we found that the use of bid savings was  more frequent in fiscal year 2013 than in fiscal year 2009 through 2012.  For example, in fiscal year 2013, the Navy had 35 military construction  projects that required prior approval reprogrammings because of  sequestration reductions, whereas in fiscal years 2009 through 2012 the  Navy had only 11 total prior approval reprogrammings. DOD and service  officials partly attributed this increase in the use of reprogrammings to  sequestration.", "Bid savings constituted the primary source of funding for reprogrammings  in fiscal year 2013. However, DOD and service officials told us that they  expect bid savings to accrue at a diminished rate in the future, which  could affect their ability to mitigate future budget constraints through this  means. Based on our review of DOD data, DOD and the services accrued  about $2.4 billion in bid savings in fiscal year 2009, and in fiscal year  2014 they accrued $240 million. Some service officials told us that they  attributed the decline to, among other things, a less favorable  construction market, and they expect the downward trend in bid savings  to continue because of market conditions. In addition, based on our  review of DOD data, though the total bid savings accumulated between  fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2014 was about $8.1 billion, more than  $7.3 billion was used for a variety of purposes, including offsetting the  fiscal year 2013 sequestration reduction of about $821 million, as well as  rescissions, reductions and other expenses such as project cost  overruns. According to DOD data and officials, this has reduced DOD\u2019s  accumulated bid savings and left about $790 million that DOD plans to  use for other known expenses. As a result, DOD and service officials told  us they would likely be unable to absorb another sequestration reduction  of equal or greater size on their military construction accounts, and  without the ability to use bid savings to offset future reductions, they  would have to defer, cancel, or reduce the scope of projects."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The joint explanatory statement accompanying the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 included a provision that we review  the effects of the fiscal year 2013 sequestration.
