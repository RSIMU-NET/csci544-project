Although the majority of workers are citizens, an estimated 26 percent of them are foreign-born noncitizens. They work in hazardous conditions involving loud noise, sharp tools, and dangerous machinery. Many workers must stand for long periods of time wielding knives and hooks to slaughter or process meat on a production line that moves very quickly. Workers responsible for cleaning the plant must use strong chemicals and hot pressurized water. While, according to BLS, injuries and illnesses have declined over the past decade, the meat and poultry industry still has one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry. The most common injuries are cuts, strains, cumulative trauma, and injuries sustained from falls, but more serious injuries, such as fractures and amputation, also occur. According to BLS, the injury and illness rate for the industry has declined from an estimated 29.5 injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time workers in 1992 to 14.7 in 2001. Injury and illness rates can be affected by many factors, such as the amount and quality of training, employee turnover rates, increased mechanization, and the speed of the production line. Some evidence suggests that OSHA's efforts have had a positive impact on the injury and illness rates of workers in meat and poultry plants. However, while the criteria OSHA uses to select plants for inspection--which focus on plants with relatively high injury and illness rates--are reasonable, OSHA could improve its selection process by also considering trends in plants' injury and illness rates over time. In addition, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of OSHA's efforts because the agency does not assign a unique identifier to each plant, making it hard to compare the data it collects on specific plants' injury and illness rates with the information the agency collects on the results of its plant inspections and other programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of  Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2003, an estimated 527,000 workers were  employed in the animal slaughtering and processing industry. According  to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in 2004 there were about  5,700 meatpacking and processing plants in the United States. The modern  meatpacking and processing plant is a complex and highly organized  structure, developed for the streamlined slaughter and progressive  disassembly of animals. The industry includes plants in which animals are  slaughtered and cut into pieces, with some facilities also cooking and  packaging the meat for consumption, as well as plants in which meat  products, such as sausage and ham, are produced by adding ingredients to  the meat. The meat processed includes red meat such as beef, veal, pork,  and lamb, and poultry such as chicken and turkey.", "Because meatpacking is one of the most dangerous industries in the  United States, you asked us to (1) describe the characteristics of workers  in meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants and the conditions in  which they work; (2) identify the types of injuries and illnesses workers in  meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants incur, how the injury  and illness rates have changed over the past decade, and the factors that  may affect these rates; and (3) determine what is known about the  effectiveness of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s  (OSHA) efforts to improve safety and health at meat and poultry slaughter  and processing plants.", "To respond to your request, we reviewed literature on the industry and  interviewed officials from OSHA and other federal agencies, such as USDA  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), as well as individuals from contract cleaning  and sanitation companies, unions, advocacy groups, and key trade  associations. We obtained and analyzed    data on worker demographics from BLS\u2019s Current Population Survey    data on workplace injuries and illnesses from BLS\u2019s Survey of  Occupational Injuries and Illnesses,   data on fatalities from BLS\u2019s Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries,    data from OSHA\u2019s inspections database (the Integrated Management    worksite-specific injury and illness data that OSHA uses to target specific  worksites for inspection (the OSHA Data Initiative),   data on the number and location of meat and poultry plants from USDA\u2019s  Performance Based Inspection System, and lists of plants that participate in OSHA\u2019s cooperative programs.", "In addition, we visited six meat and poultry plants and two OSHA area  offices and interviewed inspectors at four additional area offices, selected  because the offices had performed the most inspections of meat and  poultry plants. Finally, we conducted a survey of meat and poultry plants  to obtain data on their workers, factors that affect their injury and illness  rates, plants\u2019 efforts to improve safety and health, and plants\u2019 interactions  with OSHA. See appendix I for detailed information on the scope and  methodology for our work. We performed our work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards between January 2004  and September 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to USDA, there were about 5,700 total meat and poultry plants  in the United States as of September 2004. Most of these\u2014about 4,400\u2014 had fewer than 40 employees, and about half of them are even smaller,  with fewer than 10 employees. Figure 1 shows the location of all meat and  poultry plants, regardless of size, in the United States as of September 1,  2004.", "Over the past 25 years, the meat and poultry industry has consolidated, as  today\u2019s leading firms built very large plants and some independent firms  disappeared or were bought by larger firms. While many small plants  remain, a few large companies have gained control of the lion\u2019s share of  the market. Today, the top four meatpacking companies slaughter,  process, and package about 80 percent of the beef cattle in the United  States, and the top four pork producers control nearly 70 percent of the  market. The poultry industry is nearly as concentrated, with the top five  companies maintaining a market share in excess of 50 percent.  Consolidation of the various meat industries occurred, in large part,  because of innovations in technology and the relocation of plants near the  source of livestock.", "Industry consolidation has been accompanied by significant changes in the  relations between organized labor and the management of meat and  poultry plants. According to a report by USDA\u2019s Economic Research  Service, in 1980, 46 percent of workers in the meat products industry were  union members, a figure that had remained stable since the 1970s.  However, by the end of the 1980s, union membership had fallen to 21  percent. Declining rates of unionization coincided with increases in the  use of immigrant workers, higher worker turnover, and reductions in  wages. Immigrants make up large and growing shares of the workforces at  many plants. Labor turnover in meat and poultry plants is quite high, and  in some worksites can exceed 100 percent in a year as workers move to  other employers or return to their native countries. The frequent  movement of immigrant workers among plants and communities limits the  opportunities of unions to organize meat and poultry workers.", "Most of today\u2019s facilities are designed for an orderly flow from point of  entry of the living animal into the plant to the finished food product. The  animal enters the production facility and proceeds directly to the kill floor  area, where slaughter occurs. The carcass is beheaded, eviscerated, and  chilled for several hours. It is then taken to the cutting floor, where it is  cut into smaller cuts of meat. The new processing methods\u2014breaking  down carcasses into small, vacuum-packed portions of meat that can be  shipped directly to supermarkets\u2014have transformed the work into an  assembly line operation requiring workers to perform an increased  number of repetitive motions.", "While slaughterhouses have come to rely on greater mechanization over  the last several decades, much of the work is still done by hand,  particularly when animals vary in size, shape, and weight. The main  slaughtering steps of evisceration and cutting are generally done by hand,  using knives. Figure 2 shows a typical assembly line operation at a poultry  plant.", "OSHA, established after the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health  Act in 1970, is the federal agency within the Department of Labor  responsible for protecting the safety and health of workers in meat and  poultry plants. OSHA performs a number of functions, including  establishing safety and health standards, conducting routine inspections,  and conducting investigations in response to complaints from workers and  incidents such as fatalities.", "Regional administrators in each of OSHA\u2019s 10 regional offices oversee the  enforcement of federal policies within their own regions. Each region is  composed of area offices\u2014of which there are 80 in total\u2014overseen by  area directors. The area directors oversee compliance officers, who are  responsible for conducting inspections and following up on complaints,  and compliance assistance specialists, who provide assistance to  organizations and employers that participate in OSHA\u2019s cooperative  programs. Compliance assistance specialists also help employers correct  hazards identified during inspections.", "To determine which plants to inspect, OSHA relies on BLS data on  injuries, illnesses, and fatalities by industry. BLS surveys a sample of  employers annually (182,800 worksites were surveyed for 2002) and asks  them to report information on the number of work-related injuries and  illnesses that occur at their worksites. This information comes from injury  and illness records that most private industry employers with more than  10 employees are required by OSHA to maintain. From this information,  BLS calculates industry-level injury and illness rates. BLS also identifies  fatalities from an annual census of all 50 states, the District of Columbia,  and New York City, which report on all work-related fatalities within their  jurisdictions. BLS requires the reporting entities to corroborate reports of  fatalities from multiple sources, such as death certificates, medical  examiners\u2019 reports, media reports, and workers\u2019 compensation claims.  BLS makes injury, illness, and fatality data available at the national, as well  as at the state, level.", "OSHA uses two approaches to ensure general employer compliance with  federal safety and health laws and regulations\u2014enforcement and  cooperative programs. Enforcement, which represents the preponderance  of agency activity, is carried out primarily by using compliance officers to  inspect employer worksites. Worksites and employers that fail to meet  federal safety and health standards face sanctions, such as paying  penalties for violations of health and safety standards. OSHA\u2019s cooperative  approach invites employers to collaborate with the agency through a  number of different programs and uses a variety of incentives to  encourage employers to reduce hazards and institute practices that foster  safer and healthier working conditions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OSHA\u2019s Enforcement Efforts", "paragraphs": ["OSHA selects worksites in selected industries for inspection through its  site-specific targeting (SST) program and through national and local  programs that focus on specific hazards. The SST program focuses on  employers with more than 40 employees, who are required to record all  injuries and illnesses on a log and make this information available to  OSHA. Of the almost 40,000 inspections OSHA conducted in 2003, about  2,000 were SST inspections, and about 25,000 were conducted through  national and local emphasis programs. The agency also conducts  inspections when fatalities or serious injuries occur and when workers file  complaints about serious safety and health hazards. These inspections  constitute nearly half of the total inspections OSHA conducts annually.", "For its SST program, OSHA obtains specific information\u2014such as  employer names and addresses\u2014for all worksites with 40 or more  employees, approximately 140,000 worksites each year. OSHA then selects  a portion of these worksites (approximately 80,000) in the industries with  the highest injury and illness rates, and sends them a survey form that  requires them to report (1) the average number of employees who worked  for them during the previous calendar year, (2) the total hours the  employees worked during the previous year, and (3) summary injury and  illness data from their OSHA logs. From this information, OSHA computes  the worksites\u2019 injury and illness rates and sends those with relatively high  rates a letter informing them that they may be inspected. Finally, OSHA  compiles SST inspection targeting lists containing the names of worksites  with relatively high injury and illness rates for inspection.", "OSHA also has special emphasis programs that focus on a particular safety  or health hazard or the hazards of a specific industry, selected by the  agency\u2019s headquarters office for attention. While OSHA\u2019s headquarters  provides direction to its area offices in implementing these national  emphasis programs, the area offices have considerable flexibility in  selecting actual worksites for attention. In addition, regional and area  offices use regional and local emphasis programs to highlight industries or  hazards within their jurisdictions that they believe are especially  hazardous.", "Because musculoskeletal disorders are prevalent in several industries\u2014 including the meat and poultry industry\u2014but there is no specific standard  that allows OSHA to cite employers for hazards relating to these injuries,  the agency designed a four-pronged approach to address these injuries  that focuses on industries and employers with known high injury and  illness rates. The approach includes (1) developing industry or task- specific guidelines for a number of industries based on current incidence  rates and available information about effective and feasible solutions;  (2) conducting inspections for ergonomic hazards, issuing citations under  the general duty clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and  issuing ergonomic hazard alert letters where appropriate; (3) providing  assistance to businesses, particularly small businesses, and helping them  to proactively address ergonomic issues in the workplace; and (4)  chartering an advisory committee authorized to, among other things,  identify gaps in research about the application of ergonomics and  ergonomic principles in the workplace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA\u2019s Cooperative Programs", "paragraphs": ["OSHA\u2019s cooperative programs provide incentives to employers, such as  free consultations, deferrals from SST inspections, and recognition for  exemplary safety and health management systems, for making  improvements to their safety and health management systems. OSHA has  implemented these programs incrementally to reach different employers  and worksites in various ways. OSHA has four primary programs: (1) the  On-Site Consultation Program, (2) the Voluntary Protection Programs,  (3) the Strategic Partnership Program, and (4) the Alliance Program.", "The On-Site Consultation Program is a broad network of occupational  safety and health services primarily funded by federal OSHA, but is  delivered by the states. The service, which originated in 1974, focuses on  helping small employers comply with OSHA and state occupational safety  and health standards. The program assigns priority to companies in high- hazard industries and is offered free of charge to eligible employers.  States provide consultation visits at employers\u2019 requests in order to  identify safety and health hazards and discuss techniques for their  abatement. Small employers receiving consultation services may qualify  for recognition in the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition  Program\u2014part of the On-Site Consultation Program\u2014which exempts  them from SST inspections during the period that their certification is  valid, either 1 or 2 years. Participants in this program, who are considered  models for good safety and health practices in their field, must have, at a  minimum, safety and health management systems in place to prevent and  control occupational hazards, as well as illness and injury rates below the  national average for their industry.", "The Voluntary Protection Programs, established in 1982, recognize single  worksites with exemplary safety and health management systems. In  calendar year 2003, the average participating worksite had approximately  250 employees, and about 50 percent of the participating sites had 200  employees or less. To participate in this program, employers must have  worksites that exceed OSHA standards and must commit to a process of  continual improvement. After receipt of a site\u2019s application, OSHA  conducts an onsite review of the site to verify the effectiveness of its  safety and health management system.", "The Strategic Partnership Program, established in 1998, was designed to  address specific safety and health management systems in high-hazard  workplaces by promoting collaboration between employers, employees,  other affected organizations, and OSHA. Each partnership has a written  agreement that outlines goals (such as the reduction of injuries),  strategies, and measures, and identifies how the partners will work  together to achieve their desired results. Partnerships may focus on  specific hazards or industry issues, or may aim for broader impact through  focus on safety and health management systems. OSHA verifies partner  commitment and success in achieving goals, and while the program does  not offer employers exemption from inspection, it offers other incentives,  such as limiting SST inspections to only the most serious prevailing  hazards and reducing penalties for hazards cited during inspections.", "OSHA\u2019s Alliance Program targets trade, professional, and other types of  organizations to work collaboratively with OSHA to promote workplace  safety and health issues. In contrast to OSHA\u2019s other three cooperative  programs, which typically include safety and health management systems  at specific employer worksites, alliance agreements focus on goals such as  training, outreach, and increasing awareness of workplace safety and  health issues. Alliance participants and their members are not exempt  from OSHA inspections and do not receive any enforcement-related  incentives for being part of an organization participating in an alliance.  Instead, OSHA officials informed us that trade and professional  associations have used the program to address existing and emerging  workplace safety and health issues, such as ergonomics.", "In addition to these formal programs, OSHA conducts other compliance  assistance activities, such as outreach and training activities, to aid  employers in complying with OSHA standards and to educate employers  on what constitutes a safe and healthy work environment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Meat and Poultry Workers Tend to Be Young, Male, and/or Hispanic, and Face Hazardous Working Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The meat and poultry workforce tends to be young (43 percent under age  35), male (65 percent), and/or Hispanic (42 percent).

In such areas,  employees from these immigrant groups may make up a relatively large  percentage of the workforce and population in and around meat and  poultry plants. For example, in 2000, the population of one county in  Kansas (which, according to USDA, was one of the largest meat-producing  counties in the nation) was about 43 percent Hispanic, compared with  only 7 percent of the population in the state. According to some industry  officials, the increasingly fragmented nature of the tasks in slaughtering  and processing has diminished the need for a skilled and more highly paid  workforce, a fact that supports the industry\u2019s recruitment and employment  of unskilled immigrant labor.", "While plants are distributed throughout the United States, larger plants\u2014 those with more than 500 employees\u2014tend to be concentrated in  particular regions and produce the majority of the meat. Of these larger  meat and poultry plants, about 87 percent are located in the South and the  Midwest, 54 percent and 33 percent, respectively. Another 9 percent are  located in the West and 4 percent in the Northeast.

In 2003, meat and poultry workers  earned a median salary of about $21,320 per year, while manufacturing  workers earned about $33,500 per year. In addition, the rate of employee  turnover among meat and poultry workers can be high. A plant official  with whom we spoke indicated that some workers who are hired have no  intention of staying for a long period of time and approach employment at  meat and poultry plants as a temporary arrangement. According to some  experts, high turnover may benefit plants because they save on some  costs, such as health benefits and vacation pay, while others argue that  high turnover is costly for plants because they must constantly recruit and  train new employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workers Face Several Hazardous Conditions in Meat and Poultry Slaughter and Processing Plants", "paragraphs": ["The work environment in meat and poultry plants can be risky because of  the current procedures used in the industry. Meat and poultry plants  present risks greater than those faced by workers in many other  manufacturing operations. For example, production lines can require  workers to stand close together while wielding tools necessary for cutting  pieces of meat. Final product processing involves a number of packaging  machines and conveyors that can present a wide range of safety risks to  workers. Workers are also frequently handling or in close proximity to  sources of infectious diseases, such as those carried by animal tissues and  organs. Pathogens can infect workers from open abrasions or through  inhalation. For example, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide  can be released from decomposing animal manure and waste.

Many of the injuries\u2014such as those to the  arms, hands, and wrists\u2014are due to the repetitive motions associated with  the meat production process, such as performing the same cutting motions  over time, and can become crippling. For example, carpal tunnel  syndrome, caused by repetitive motion or cumulative trauma, can severely  damage a nerve running through the wrist.", "Workers can also be cut by their own knives during the butchering and  cutting processes. For example, according to an OSHA publication, one  worker in a meatpacking plant was blinded when the knife he was using to  pick up a ham prior to boning slipped out of the ham, striking him in the  eye. The report also described an incident in which another worker\u2019s face  was permanently disfigured when his knife slipped out of a piece of meat  and struck his nose, upper lip, and chin. In another incident, according to  OSHA, a worker who attempted to replace his knife in the scabbard  hanging from his belt missed the opening and pushed the knife into his leg,  severed his femoral artery, and died. In addition, workers can be cut by  the knives wielded by coworkers. According to OSHA\u2019s report, these  \u201cneighbor cuts\u201d are usually the direct result of overcrowded working  conditions.", "Other injuries that workers can experience include respiratory irritation  and, in some instances, asphyxiation from exposure to pathogenic  respiratory substances. For example, workers have died from being  overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas and from drowning when they entered  manure waste pits or unknowingly worked near manure waste \u201clagoons\u201d  without taking the proper precautions, such as conducting an air test and  wearing a safety harness and respirator; such precautions are particularly  critical when workers are in confined spaces. According to OSHA, one  worker died from chemical exposure after being sprayed with 400 pounds  of toxic liquid ammonia while attempting to fix a pipe.", "Workers may also suffer injuries and illnesses from contact with animals.  If the animals are still dying when they are hung on the line, they may  struggle and thrash about wildly, resulting in injuries that range from  broken arms to permanent disfigurement and\u2014in the most severe cases\u2014 death. Contact with different bacteria can cause fever, headaches,  vomiting, diarrhea, and kidney damage. In addition, illnesses that can be  contracted from diseased animals continue to raise concerns. According  to USDA officials, the transmission of disease from animals to humans in  the meat and poultry industry is uncommon because of concerted efforts  in the United States and abroad. However, recent outbreaks of bovine  spongiform encephalopathy among cattle (commonly known as \u201cmad cow  disease\u201d) are related to incidences of a disease that affects humans,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While beef  consumption is recognized as a mode of infection, it is unknown whether  this disease can be transmitted in other ways, such as exposure to waste  or blood.", "Workers can also suffer back injuries or other types of injuries from  overexertion, including sprains, strains, tears, hernias, and fatigue. They  can suffer injuries, and even death, from falling or being struck by an  object. For example, workers have been killed by falling ice and forklift  parts, and falls due in part to a lack of functioning safety devices. In one  incident, an employee was killed when a rack of sausage fell from a  manual overhead conveyor system and struck him.", "Workers can be burned by heat sealant machines when they wrap meat.  Workers may also sever fingers or hands or even lose limbs on machines  that are either improperly locked or inadequately guarded.

In the late 1980s, after observing  what appeared to be underreporting of worker injuries, OSHA\u2019s offices in  region 7 focused their attention on the meatpacking industry. Beginning  with an exhaustive review and reconstruction of a large Nebraska  meatpacker\u2019s records, OSHA documented dozens of cases of  underreporting and assessed the company more than $2.5 million in  penalties. Because of OSHA\u2019s findings during this inspection and others  like it, Congress held hearings on the underreporting of occupational  injuries from March to September 1987. In 1987, after a National  Academy of Sciences review of the methods BLS used to collect  employers\u2019 injury and illness data highlighted several deficiencies, and in  response to the congressional hearings, BLS began a multi-year effort to  redesign and test an improved safety and health statistical system for  collecting these data, which was fully implemented in 1992. However, the  accuracy of employers\u2019 occupational injury and illness data remains a  concern. OSHA conducted a series of record-keeping inspections of meat  and poultry plants in region 7 throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. As a  result of these inspections, several plants were assessed penalties for  record-keeping violations, including five plants that were assessed  penalties ranging from $290,000 to $998,360. OSHA continues to find some  measure of underreporting of employers\u2019 injury and illness information  through the agency\u2019s record-keeping audits each year.", "In addition, we reported in 1998 that the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service (now the Citizenship and Immigration Services) had  often found illegal aliens employed in meatpacking plants; one agency  official estimated that up to 25 percent of workers in meatpacking plants  in Nebraska and Iowa were illegal aliens. As recently as March 2004, as the  result of an internal audit, one large meatpacking company found 350  undocumented workers employed in one of its plants in the Midwest.  Because large numbers of meat and poultry workers are immigrants\u2014and  perhaps employed illegally\u2014they may fear retaliation or loss of  employment if they are injured and cannot perform their work, and they  may be hesitant to report an injury. Furthermore, according to data from  OSHA and academic researchers published in a BLS periodical, some  plants offer employees or groups of employees incentives, such as money  or other prizes, for maintaining low injury and illness rates. According to  the report, while these incentives may improve safety, they also may  discourage workers from reporting injuries that could result in their not  winning the incentive prize or preventing an entire group of workers from  obtaining the prize. In addition, some plants judge the performance of line  supervisors based on the number of days their workers go without an  injury or illness. These supervisors, also influenced by performance  incentives, may underreport injuries or encourage workers not to report  injuries or illnesses. Several of the plant officials we interviewed told us  that they provide incentives and rewards to employees or groups of  employees who work for extended periods of time without injury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Affect Injury and Illness Rates", "paragraphs": ["Injury and illness rates may be affected by many factors, such as employer  or employee emphasis on safety, the amount and quality of training,  employee turnover rates, and the speed of the production line.", "Officials from a company, union, or trade association may take steps that  affect worker safety and health. For example, a company may form a plant  safety committee that reviews incidents of injury and illness to identify  safety issues and take steps to address weaknesses. In addition, company  officials may influence worker safety and health by showing their  commitment to safety through actions such as establishing medical safety  management programs at the plants, providing personal protective  equipment to workers, and disciplining workers who do not follow safety  procedures. Unions can also play a role in worker safety and health by  negotiating with company officials to take a more proactive approach to  addressing work conditions. Trade associations may offer training courses  and conferences on safety issues, guidance on meeting OSHA  requirements, and other assistance to companies in improving safety and  health.", "Both OSHA and industry officials noted that training is a critical factor in  worker safety and health. Companies provide employee training in a  number of forms, including classroom instruction, on-the-job training, and  written and video training materials (generally in English and Spanish).  Meat and poultry plants typically offer several days of training at the  beginning of a worker\u2019s employment covering both job-specific and  general safety training. Plants periodically offer additional training classes  or updates\u2014many of which are mandatory\u2014such as annual refreshers on  workplace safety and health. Many plants also offer or require annual  specialized training on safety issues, such as knife sharpening, which can  reduce strain on line workers, and accident prevention such as \u201clock- out/tag-out\u201d procedures that ensure that machinery is manually locked or  disconnected from a power source when not in use and tagged to note that  it has been locked or should not be used. In addition, one plant assigns  mentors, or buddies, to new workers to help them work more safely in an  introductory period.", "Turnover rates can also affect the safety and health of workers. Turnover  tends to be high in the meat and poultry industry and, according to a  report by USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service, turnover rates of 100  percent a year or more are not uncommon. High turnover can affect  safety and health at meat and poultry plants, according to one plant safety  official, because new employees are more likely to sustain an injury or  illness than more experienced workers. In the first few months of  employment, an employee may take shortcuts\u2014because of the lack of  familiarity with proper procedures\u2014that increase his or her vulnerability  to injury or illness. Plant officials often attribute high turnover to difficult  working conditions, extreme temperatures, and the fact that many of the  industry\u2019s jobs are physically demanding and stressful.", "The speed at which production employees are expected to work, often  determined by the speed of the production line, or line speed, may also be  an important factor influencing their safety and health. The faster the pace  at which the production line moves, the less able workers may be to  perform tasks needed for safety. For example, according to industry  research, at certain line speeds workers may be unable to take the seconds  required to perform certain critical tasks, such as the frequent sharpening  of knives, to ensure that their jobs can be conducted safely. Some  respondents to our survey also noted that line speed is an important factor  affecting worker safety and health. While some trade association  representatives and plant officials told us that the risks associated with  line speed can be mitigated by adding more workers to the line or rotating  workers to other jobs, advocacy group and union representatives have  discounted that argument, stating that some plants may not have either the  additional employee resources to add to the line or the additional space in  the line configuration needed to add more workers.", "Line speed is regulated by USDA to permit adequate inspection by food  safety inspectors. According to USDA, when the maximum speeds were  originally set and when they are adjusted by the agency, the safety and  health of plant production workers is not a consideration. OSHA has made  recommendations to companies to slow their line speed, as well as to  make other safety improvements when citing companies for repetitive  motion injury issues, according to an OSHA official. Research is lacking,  however, on the full effects of line speed on worker safety and health.  Industry and OSHA officials told us that the differences across slaughter  and cutting lines prevent systematic comparison, analysis, and regulation  of line speed. According to these officials, because machinery is arrayed  differently on each line, research that might isolate ergonomic limits and  improvements, or examine the incidence of other line-related injuries, is  difficult to accomplish. However, a memorandum issued in 2000 by  Nebraska\u2019s Lieutenant Governor recommended that OSHA \u201cundertake a  legitimate study of the speed of the line in meatpacking plants\u201d and that  \u201cthe industry should work cooperatively on that study.\u201d NIOSH officials  and nongovernmental ergonomic experts told us that line speed should be  further researched in order to understand its impact on worker safety and  health.", "While USDA has established regulations on line speed, the purpose of the  agency\u2019s authority is not to protect workers, but to protect consumers.  USDA sets maximum line speeds based on how quickly its inspectors can  properly inspect the carcasses to ensure the safety of the meat. According  to trade association officials we interviewed, plants set their line speeds at  a rate at or below the maximum while considering such factors as (1) the  speed at which employees can work and still produce a quality product  and (2) the number of animals that need to be processed.

USDA  does not track this information and could not verify the number of  referrals made by its inspectors to OSHA. However, we were told by USDA  officials that the department\u2019s inspectors rarely make referrals because  workplace hazards are not the focus of their inspections. In addition, we  were told that USDA inspectors are more likely to discuss observed  hazards with plant management before referring them to OSHA, since they  have established relationships with the plants and because the hazards  could affect them as well as plant employees.

As a result, OSHA does not consider all injuries  and illnesses in selecting meat and poultry plants for inspection. This is a  significant oversight because, according to OSHA officials, experts, and  researchers, these workers incur high rates of injury and illness and often  sustain more serious injuries than production workers. According to  information in OSHA\u2019s inspections database, between 1998 and 2003, at  least 34 contract cleaning and sanitation workers employed in meat and  poultry plants sustained serious injuries or were killed. However, because  these injuries were recorded as occurring in another industry, none of the  injuries were reflected in the meat and poultry industry\u2019s injury and illness  rates.", "A large number of workers perform this work under contract for meat and  poultry plants; we interviewed three cleaning and sanitation companies  that employ more than 5,000 workers at 140 plants across the country.

Another representative said  he felt that the biggest risk factor was the difficulty in communicating how  hazardous the complex and intricate machinery is because of language or  cultural differences. OSHA inspects the cleaning and sanitation shift  during its inspections of meat and poultry plants, whether the workers are  employees of a contract company or the plant. However, plants whose  contract workers have high injury and illness rates may not be selected for  inspection because these injuries are not included in the data OSHA uses  to select meat and poultry plants for inspection.", "Because there are allegations of underreporting in the meat and poultry  industry, OSHA attempts to counter such incidences by verifying the injury  and illness rates of worksites it inspects as part of its SST program. In  addition to reviewing employers\u2019 logs during SST inspections, OSHA also  randomly selects for inspection 200 worksites each year that report low  injury and illness rates in high-hazard industries to ensure that these  worksites are not underreporting injuries and illnesses. In 2003, 5 of the  200 worksites selected were meatpacking plants; in 2004, 10 were  meatpacking plants. The sausage and other prepared meats industry and  the poultry industry did not have injury and illness rates that met the  criteria for this effort. Therefore, OSHA did not select any worksites in  these industries for inspection that reported low rates.", "In a separate effort designed in part to combat underreporting of injuries  and illnesses, OSHA annually conducts a number of comprehensive  record-keeping audits intended to verify the accuracy of the data on  injuries and illnesses that employers submit to OSHA. However, the  selection criteria it uses allow the agency to audit the records of only a few  meat and poultry plants. While OSHA\u2019s limited resources allow it to select  few worksites in any industry for a record-keeping audit, OSHA is not  doing enough to verify the accuracy of the data that meat and poultry  plants report, considering the dramatic decreases in this industry\u2019s  reported injury and illness rates.

Previously, OSHA selected worksites in high-hazard industries  with a minimum of 40 employees for these inspections; currently, it selects  worksites with a minimum of 200 employees. This change will likely have  the effect of OSHA selecting even fewer meat and poultry plants that  report low injury and illness rates for inspection, because the majority of  plants have fewer than 200 employees. In addition, we were told by a high- ranking OSHA official that the agency is considering adjusting the criteria  further to double the number of worksites with low illness and injury rates  for inspection.

To  match data on specific worksites without such an identifier, we relied on  other identifiers\u2014such as the name of the company, address, or zip  code\u2014to find the data associated with a company over time. However,  because of differences in how these identifiers appeared in each of  OSHA\u2019s databases, we could not reliably track data for specific companies.  For example, from one year to the next, a company\u2019s name may appear  differently in the various databases, or a match on address may not  produce a match for the company name. OSHA officials we spoke to  acknowledged the difficulties involved in this type of effort. In fact, they  recently encountered similar problems in their attempts to evaluate the  impact of the SST program in 2004 (see app. III for more information).  OSHA\u2019s inability to assess the effectiveness of its efforts has been a  recurring finding.", "In November 2002, we recommended that OSHA take steps to assess the  impact of its SST program on workplace injuries and illnesses.

Although  the efforts by government, employers, and advocacy groups have helped  improve worker safety and health in this industry, and according to BLS  the number and rate of injuries and illnesses have decreased substantially  over the last decade, additional improvements could be made. For  example, the criteria that OSHA uses to select plants for inspection, while  reasonable, do not incorporate consideration of dramatic or sudden  decreases in injury or illness rates in selecting plants for inspection. In  addition, because OSHA lacks complete data on the injuries and illnesses  of meat and poultry workers, particularly those employed by cleaning and  sanitation companies, plants in need of inspection may not be identified  and selected. Further, because OSHA does not track changes in individual  plants\u2019 injury and illness rates, or have a method for comparing these rates  with data collected on inspections or plants\u2019 participation in its  cooperative programs, it lacks a means of understanding the impact its  programs have on workers in this industry.", "OSHA also lacks some of the information needed to participate more fully  in improving worker safety and health. For example, until the effects of  line speed are studied from a worker safety and health perspective to  better understand its effect on injury and illness rates, it will be difficult  for OSHA to provide meaningful input with regard to the process of  regulating the speed of the production line. In addition, OSHA has been  slow in expanding its successful efforts. Because its most successful  program aimed at improving safety and health has not been replicated in  other areas of the country, OSHA is not allowing workers in its other  jurisdictions to realize the benefits, such as the potential for a reduced  number of injuries and illnesses, of this program. Finally, the  memorandum of understanding between USDA and OSHA is not being  utilized to the full extent possible.

The CPS is a monthly survey of households  conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for BLS. The CPS, a sample of  60,000 households, provides a comprehensive body of information on the  employment and unemployment experience of the nation\u2019s population,  classified by age, sex, race, and a variety of other characteristics.", "Because the CPS estimates are based on probability samples, they are  subject to sampling error.

As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population.", "For the CPS estimates in this report, we estimated sampling error and  produced confidence intervals using the methods provided in the technical  documentation for the 2004 and 1995 March supplements. All CPS  percentage estimates contained in this report have 95 percent confidence  intervals within plus or minus 8 percentage points of the estimate itself. All  other CPS estimates contained in this report have 95 percent confidence  intervals within plus or minus 14 percent of the estimate itself, unless  otherwise noted.", "We also reviewed data on injuries and illnesses, collected and published  by BLS through its Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, for  calendar years 1992 to 2002, as they related to workers in the meat and  poultry industry. BLS\u2019s Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses  provides estimates of the number and frequency (incidence rates) of  workplace injuries and illnesses based on logs kept by private industry  employers during the year. Survey estimates are based on a scientifically  selected sample of worksites, some of which represent only themselves  but most of which also represent other employers of like industry and  workforce size that were not chosen in a given survey year. Besides  providing injury and illness counts, survey respondents also are asked to  provide additional information for a subset of the most serious nonfatal  cases logged, namely, those that involved at least 1 day away from work,  beyond the day of injury or onset of illness. Employers answer several  questions about these cases, including the demographics of the worker  disabled, the nature of the disabling condition, and the event and source  producing that condition. BLS calculates relative standard errors for all  estimates it tabulates (see BLS's Web site for more information).  These  relative standard errors were used to develop 95 percent confidence  intervals for each estimate. In this report, all estimates of incidence rates  have 95 percent confidence intervals of within plus or minus 14 percent of  the estimated incidence rate. For example, the estimated rate for  tendonitis in 1992 was 23.6 cases per 10,000 full-time meat and poultry  workers. Since 14 percent of 23.6 is 3.3, the confidence interval for this  interval is within 20.3 to 26.9 cases per 10,000 full-time workers.", "We also reviewed data on fatalities, collected and published by BLS  through its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries for calendar years 1992  to 2003 as they related to workers in the meat and poultry industry. BLS\u2019s  Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries is a federal-state cooperative  program that has been implemented in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia since 1992. To compile fatality counts that are as complete as  possible, the census uses multiple sources to identify, verify, and profile  fatal worker injuries. Information about each workplace fatality\u2014 occupation and other worker characteristics, equipment involved, and  circumstances of the event\u2014is obtained by cross-referencing the source  records, such as death certificates, workers\u2019 compensation reports, and  federal and state agency administrative reports. To ensure that fatalities  are work-related, cases are substantiated with two or more independent  source documents or a source document and a follow-up questionnaire.  Data compiled by the program are issued annually for the preceding  calendar year. We report the 2003 data in a footnote because the data are  not comparable with data from previous years. According to BLS, the new  industry and occupational classifications the agency is required to use  may, in some instances, have different definitions than the classification  system used previously.", "To analyze the extent to which OSHA interacts with meat and poultry  plants through its enforcement programs, we analyzed inspections data for  fiscal years 1996 to 2004 from OSHA\u2019s Integrated Management Information  System and worksite-specific injury and illness data collected by OSHA.  We assessed the completeness of these data by reviewing OSHA\u2019s  documentation on how the data were collected and performed electronic  tests to look for outliers, missing values, and duplicate records.

For  example, we analyzed CPS data on worker demographics by industry and  data on injuries and illnesses sustained by workers. Using the two data  sets, we attempted to determine whether workers in certain demographic  groups\u2014such as males and females, whites and minorities, and younger  and older employees\u2014were sustaining more injuries or illnesses now than  would be expected, taking into account the number of individuals in these  demographic groups. We also attempted to estimate differences in injury  rates, or in the likelihood of being injured, between certain worker  demographics, such as gender, race, and age. However, a large percentage  of cases in the meat and poultry industry that were reported to BLS\u2014 24 percent in 2002\u2014lacked data on the race of the injured worker since  race is not a required reporting item. Because of this lack of data, it was  not possible to determine whether workers of a certain race were  disproportionately injured.", "First, BLS\u2019s data on injuries and illnesses cannot be used by themselves to  estimate injury rates or the likelihood of being injured, since those data  include only information on workers who were injured, but not on  workers who were not injured. While BLS\u2019s injury and illness data could  be used to estimate the numbers of workers in the meat products industry  at risk of being injured, overall and in each of the subgroups of interest to  us, its injury and illness data do not provide demographic information  (e.g., data on race, sex, or age) on all workers who were injured, but only  those workers whose injuries were serious enough to have resulted in the  workers requiring time off from work. While we might have merged  information from BLS\u2019s injury and illness data and information from the  CPS in order to estimate rates of injuries requiring time off, and  differences in those rates across subgroups, that task was complicated by  the fact that there was considerable information missing on race, which  was one of the factors of greatest interest to us. Because BLS does not  require the various states and industries surveyed to disclose the race of  employees injured, some choose not to, and ultimately race is unknown  for roughly one in every four persons injured.", "In addition, we could have estimated differences in the rates of injury and  illness requiring time off across sex and age categories. However, the lack  of detailed information in the CPS on the types of jobs held by workers  employed in the meat products industry would not have made it possible  for us to determine whether differences in injury and illness rates across  age and sex categories was a result of differences in these demographic  characteristics or the result of women and older employees having  different types of jobs than men and younger workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey of Meat and Poultry Plants", "paragraphs": ["To obtain information about safety and health and the characteristics of  their workforce, we administered a survey to a sample of meat and poultry  plants.
