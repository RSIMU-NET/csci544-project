CFPB addressed required elements for regulatory analyses that are components of the proposed and final rules. Based on a review of selected rules, GAO observed that the discussion of rule proposals and alternatives focused on reactions to proposals and alternatives CFPB presented. Some alternatives that small entity representatives raised at panels were discussed in a significant alternatives section of the proposed rules, while others were not. CFPB officials noted that data needed to make a fuller assessment of some alternatives from small entities were not always available.

In cases in which the documents  included alternatives put forth by small entity representatives, the  alternatives proposed by small entity representatives were typically  focused on who should be exempt from a proposed rule or how much  time should be allowed to implement it. The Regulatory Flexibility Act  requires that each CFPB Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis include,  among other things, a description of any significant alternatives to the  proposed rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable  statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the  proposed rules on small entities and any increase in the cost of credit for  small entities. CFPB makes judgments about which alternatives meet  this requirement. The following examples illustrate the CFPB focus in the  rulemaking documents that we reviewed:", "Panel materials: As described earlier, panel materials include an  overview of the proposed rule and any alternatives under  consideration, as presented by CFPB. In the panel materials  disseminated for each of the four rulemakings, CFPB presented its  \u201cOutline of Proposals under Consideration and Alternatives  Considered.\u201d Consistent with its internal guidance, CFPB developed  the proposals and alternatives presented in these documents to  facilitate inputs from small entity representatives. For example, in the  panel materials for the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure  rulemaking, CFPB presented alternative prototypes for the \u201cLoan  Estimate\u201d and \u201cSettlement Disclosure\u201d documents. According to  CFPB, testing on these alternative prototypes with consumers was  completed in January 2012, before the SBREFA panel met with  representatives in March 2012.", "Panel reports: The panel reports generally comprehensively  discussed different aspects of proposals and alternatives presented  by CFPB. In reviewing the alternatives in the panel reports, we found  that the discussions also principally addressed the proposed rules and  alternatives presented by CFPB in the panel materials. Accordingly,  the majority of comments from representatives in the panel reports  were focused on their reactions to CFPB\u2019s proposed rules and  alternatives. Furthermore, some of the comments reflected  discussions over which entities should be exempt from the proposed  rules and time frames to implement them. For instance, on the HMDA  rulemaking, representatives conveyed their positions on the  appropriate threshold for exemption from certain reporting  requirements. CFPB officials said that it was not often the case that  small entity representatives offered a large volume of alternatives.  The SBREFA panel republishes the small entity representatives\u2019  written comments in an appendix of the panel report. In some cases,  panel reports include summaries of small entity representatives\u2019 ideas  for alternatives to CFPB\u2019s proposed rules\u2014that is, the discussion  ranged beyond numeric exemption thresholds and implementation  time frames. For example, in the report on Mortgage Loan Originator  Compensation, small entity representatives asserted that the  economic costs of origination vary with the loan balance, and  therefore, a flat loan origination fee was unsuitable.", "Proposed rules: The Notices of Proposed Rulemaking contained  discussion and assessment of CFPB\u2019s proposed alternatives. We  found that some alternatives posed by representatives as part of the  SBREFA panel process were discussed and assessed in the  proposed rule and others were not. For example, for the proposed  rule on Mortgage Loan Originator Compensation, CFPB discussed an  alternative proposal from small entity representatives in the section of  the proposed rule discussing significant alternatives. We also  observed that CFPB often used the significant alternatives section of  the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to further elaborate on its own  proposed rules. In an example of an alternative not presented in the  significant alternatives section of the proposed rule, small entity  representatives for the HMDA rulemaking sought an alternative for  \u201cCFPB to limit the addition of data points to those mandated by the  Dodd-Frank Act and only as necessary to meet the HMDA purposes\u201d  to address concerns about the burdens and costs associated with  new data points, particularly those not specifically enumerated in the  Dodd-Frank Act. In its notice of proposed rulemaking, CFPB  acknowledged concerns about the proposals to add new data points  to the HMDA reporting requirements, but did not explicitly present the  alternative offered by small entity representatives to limit the addition  of new data points. During the comment period for this proposed  rule, SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy commented on this alternative  emphasizing that these data points were not statutorily required and  urged CFPB to exempt small entities from collecting such data points  until CFPB had the opportunity to determine whether the additional  information furthered the goals of HMDA. As required by the RFA,  CFPB responded to the comments of the Office of Advocacy,  including its comment on discretionary data points, in its Final  Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, which was published in the final HMDA  rule. Other interested parties can identify or comment on  alternatives as part of the proposed rule comment period.", "CFPB officials emphasized that they solicited alternatives from small  entity representatives, but were not required to list in the Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking all alternatives offered by the small entity  representatives. They only had to include those that they deemed  significant and consistent with applicable statutes of the proposed rule.  The officials also noted that data needed to make a fuller assessment of  some alternatives from small entities were not always available. In  developing the panel materials, CFPB officials stated that the agency  sought to balance the need to develop enough information for  consideration before the panel convened against providing such complete  information that it would appear the agency had reached a conclusion on  the content of the rule. As mentioned earlier, CFPB and SBA\u2019s Office of  Advocacy officials emphasized the challenge of completing the panel  report within 60 days of convening the SBREFA panel. At the same time,  CFPB officials stated that the public, including trade associations and  small entities themselves, had opportunities to comment and provide  additional information on the proposed rule after the SBREFA process  was completed during the public comment period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Small Entity Representatives Generally Viewed Panel Process as Useful, but Expressed Their Views on Areas for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Small entity representatives\u2019 views on the panel process were generally  positive, but they also suggested areas for improvement.

Another  felt the panel was more symbolic than meaningful\u2014there was no  reflection of input from small entity representatives in the rule and that  representatives were not given a valid role in the rulemaking.  Furthermore, 7 representatives felt the process was hindered by CFPB\u2019s  lack of knowledge of their industry. For example, one said CFPB staff did  not have enough practical experience and during the panel meeting there  was limited time to talk about the actual rule because small entity  representatives had to explain certain banking processes to CFPB.", "Finally, 15 representatives felt the SBREFA process could be improved.  For instance, one said she would have liked more detailed discussion  with live beta or mock-up testing with her operational people so they  could test some of the things CFPB proposed. She believes this would  have produced a better rule. Another said there should have been a  second panel meeting after publishing the proposed rule to discuss the  topics again and so that representatives could better evaluate it.

For all panels,  CFPB provided the representatives with materials that included the draft  proposal for rulemaking, discussion questions, and a fact sheet  describing the SBREFA process. For the panels on the TILA-RESPA  Integrated Disclosure and Mortgage Servicing rules, CFPB also provided  representatives with a draft agenda for the panel meeting and the  opportunity to comment. For the HMDA panel only, CFPB conducted two  sets of teleconferences before the panel meeting to discuss elements of  the draft proposal for rulemaking.", "Of the 57 small entity representatives we interviewed, 31 believed  CFPB\u2019s outreach efforts prepared them to provide constructive input  during the SBREFA panel meeting (question 6) and 15 said CFPB efforts  partially prepared them (see table 2). The HMDA panel had the greatest  share of representatives who said CFPB\u2019s outreach efforts prepared them  to provide constructive input and the Mortgage Loan Originator  Compensation panel had the smallest share. Seven representatives from  the HMDA panel specifically mentioned the teleconferences were helpful  when asked about CFPB\u2019s outreach efforts.", "Furthermore, when asked how were CFPB\u2019s outreach efforts constructive  or not constructive (question 7), 12 small entity representatives stated  they needed more time to prepare for the panel.

CFPB officials stated that the role of small entity  representatives does not include reaching out to other businesses or  entities. As discussed previously, the time CFPB had available for  outreach in the first three panels was constrained by the deadlines  imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act to promulgate implementing regulations.", "When asked how CFPB\u2019s outreach could be improved (question 8), 10 of  57 small entity representatives suggested CFPB obtain more knowledge  of industry practices before convening the panels. For example, one  representative believed CFPB was surprised by answers representatives  provided to their questions because the agency lacked real world  experience; the representative suggested CFPB do site visits with typical  small entities to become better informed. Another representative said  CFPB did not know what entities regulated its business or its reporting  requirements, and that CFPB did not understand day-to-day operations in  their line of business. CFPB officials stated they were diligent in their  desire to understand business practices so they focused their attention on  these areas during outreach. In addition, 7 of 57 said CFPB could provide  better guidance about the role of small entity representatives in the  process or what to expect at the panel meeting.
