Employer-sponsored IRA plans, which can be either  Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE) or Simplified  Employee Pension (SEP) plans, generally allow employers and, in SIMPLE  IRA plans, employees, to make contributions to separate IRA accounts for  each participating employee. Employers generally have fewer  administration and reporting requirements compared to other types of  plans. The second plan category\u2014DC plans\u2014which includes 401(k) plans,  allows employers, employees, or both to contribute to individual employee  accounts within the plan. DC plans tend to have higher contribution limits  for employees than employer-sponsored IRA plans; however, they also  have more reporting requirements and other rules; for example, they may  be subject to requirements for nondiscrimination testing or top-heavy  testing. The third category is DB plans, which promise to provide a  specified retirement benefit to employees; the employer is generally  responsible for funding the plan.", "Over the years, Congress has responded to concerns about lack of  access to employer-sponsored retirement plans for employees of small  employers with legislation to lower costs, simplify requirements, and ease  administrative burden. For example, the Revenue Act of 1978 and the  Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 established the SEP IRA plan  and the SIMPLE IRA plan respectively, featuring fewer administration  requirements than other plan types. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) also included a number of  provisions that affected small employers, which were made permanent by  the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). The PPA also established  additional provisions that support retirement plan participation by rank- and-file employees, such as automatic enrollment.", "Federal agencies also play a role in fostering retirement plan sponsorship  by small employers.

These plans can incur additional costs associated with hiring a plan  professional to make corrections to plan documents and instituting a  minimum top-heavy employer contribution for all participating rank-and- file employees.

For example, one domestic proposal calls for the  creation of a federally managed and federally guaranteed national  savings plan. Under this proposal, participation in the program would  generally be mandatory for workers; both employers and employees  would contribute to the plan; and plan funds would be pooled and  professionally managed. By pooling funds, plan administration would be  simplified and administrative costs and asset management fees would be  reduced.

Such a proposal would provide  employers who do not sponsor any retirement plans with a mechanism  that allows their employees to save for retirement. However, as we  reported in 2009, such proposals pose trade-offs. For example,  although a proposal that mandates participation would increase plan  sponsorship and coverage for workers, employers might offset the  resulting sponsorship costs by reducing workers\u2019 wages and other  benefits. Retirement systems in other countries also use asset pooling  and other features that help reduce administrative and financial burdens  for small employers. For example, as we previously reported, the  predominant pension systems in the Netherlands and Switzerland pool  plan assets into pension funds for economies of scale and for lower plan  fees.

Based on the limited data available, we found the rate of  plan sponsorship among small employers, a segment of the economy  which employs about one third of all private sector workers, was only 14  percent in 2009. Although one would expect that the high churn rate of  small business formation and dissolution would impede small employer  plan sponsorship, it also means that many millions of workers in this  sector are without access to an employer-sponsored retirement savings  plan. Thus, while remaining sensitive to the financial challenges currently  facing our nation, expanding coverage among small employers should be  an important consideration of national strategies seeking to strengthen  the pension component of retirement income security.", "Our discussions with small employers and other stakeholders identified a  variety of challenges small employers face in sponsoring retirement  plans. One initial problem is the inability of small employers to easily  obtain useful information on how to establish and maintain plans.  Although Labor and IRS already provide small employers with  considerable online information about retirement plans, information is  scattered across multiple federal websites and portals in a largely  uncoordinated fashion, making it difficult for busy employers to navigate  and locate what they need. However, even if federal information about  retirement plans were more accessible to small employers, our interviews  with small employers identified a number of other significant challenges to  plan sponsorship, including plan administration requirements that are  perceived to be unduly complicated and burdensome, not having  sufficient financial and personnel resources to sponsor a plan, and  insufficient incentives to create and maintain a plan.", "These challenges, while very real, are also complex and in many  instances may not lend themselves to easy answers. Because the  expertise to address these issues is spread across multiple agencies and  departments that may not always communicate or work together  effectively on these issues, there is the potential that inertia and other  competing priorities will push these issues onto the back burner.", "The report we are issuing today recommends the creation of a  multiagency task force, to be overseen by the Department of Labor, that  would explore and analyze these challenges in greater detail, including  ways to make information more accessible, to streamline reporting and  disclosure requirements in a thoughtful manner, and to identify the  appropriateness and effectiveness of existing and proposed tax  incentives and plan designs to boost sponsorship among small  employers. Such a task force could help jump-start sustained action on  what we consider to be an essential element of our nation\u2019s retirement  security challenge and initiate a national dialogue on the critical issues of  pension coverage   Finally, federal agencies\u2019 ability to address the challenges to small  employer plan sponsorship depends in part on the availability of relevant,  timely, and complete data. During our work in estimating the extent of  small employer plan sponsorship, we found that complete data on small  employer plan sponsorship did not exist because IRS did not have the  means to collect information on employers that sponsor SEP IRA plans.  Although there are about 1.5 million SEP IRAs, many of these may be  sponsored by larger businesses, and we simply do not know the  distribution of these plans across all employers. Without a complete  picture of small employer plan sponsorship rates, agencies may find it  difficult to effectively target their research and outreach efforts. Thus, in  our report we also recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury direct  the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service to consider modifying  existing tax forms, such as Forms W-2 or 5498, to gather complete and  reliable information about these plan types. Although the challenges that  small employers face in sponsoring plans are significant, they can be  addressed and with appropriate federal action and cooperation, as well as  assistance from the service provider community.", "While the Department of Treasury, IRS, Labor, SBA, and the Department  of Commerce generally agreed with our findings and conclusions, Labor  disagreed with our recommendation to create a single web portal for  federal guidance on retirement plans for small employers.
