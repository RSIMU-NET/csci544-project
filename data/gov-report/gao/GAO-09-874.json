Many of these posts are vital to U.S. foreign policy objectives and need a full complement of staff with the right skills to carry out the department's priorities. As such, State offers staff at these posts a hardship differential--an additional adjustment to basic pay--to compensate officers for the conditions they encounter and as a recruitment and retention incentive. GAO was asked to assess (1) State's progress in addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts since 2006 and the effect of any remaining gaps, and (2) the extent to which State has used incentives to address staffing gaps at hardship posts.

Several factors contribute to these gaps. First, State continues to have fewer officers than positions, a shortage compounded by the personnel demands of Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, while State has reduced its mid-level experience gap, the department does not anticipate eliminating this gap until 2012 and continues to face difficulties attracting experienced applicants to hardship posts--especially posts of greatest hardship. Third, although State's assignment system has prioritized the staffing of hardship posts, it does not explicitly address the continuing experience gap at such posts, many of which are strategically important, yet are often staffed with less experienced officers. Staffing and experience gaps can diminish diplomatic readiness in several ways, according to State officials. For example, gaps can lead to decreased reporting coverage, loss of institutional knowledge, and increased supervisory requirements for senior staff, detracting from other critical diplomatic responsibilities. State uses a range of incentives to staff hardship posts, but their effectiveness remains unclear due to a lack of evaluation. Incentives to serve in hardship posts range from monetary benefits to changes in service and bidding requirements, such as reduced tour lengths at posts where dangerous conditions prevent some family members from accompanying officers. In a 2006 report on staffing gaps, GAO recommended that State evaluate the effectiveness of its incentive programs for hardship post assignments. In response, State added a question about hardship incentives to a recent employee survey. However, the survey does not fully meet GAO's recommendation for several reasons, including that State did not include several incentives in the survey. State also did not comply with a legal requirement to assess the effectiveness of increasing danger and hardship pay in filling certain posts. Recent legislation increasing Foreign Service Officers' basic pay will increase the cost of existing incentives, thereby heightening the importance that State evaluate its incentives for hardship post assignments to ensure resources are effectively targeted and not wasted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State (State) has designated roughly two-thirds of its  268 overseas posts as hardship posts.

In  addition to the high number of hardship posts State must staff, the number  of positions in locations too dangerous for some family members to  accompany an officer has grown considerably in recent years, from more  than 700 in 2006 to over 900 at the end of fiscal year 2008.

We reported in 2002 that State\u2019s staffing  shortfalls and ineffective assignment system compromised diplomatic  readiness at hardship posts. Subsequently, we reported in 2006 that State  had made progress in addressing overall staffing shortfalls since  implementing its Diplomatic Readiness Initiative (DRI), which enabled the  department to hire and train more than 1,000 employees above attrition  from 2002 to 2004; however, the initiative did not fully meet its goals and  mid-level vacancies remained a problem at critical posts. Furthermore,  the department faces the continuing challenge of staffing embassy  compounds in the conflict zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. To help meet  these challenges, the Congress authorized additional positions for State in  2008\u2014the first new positions outside the department\u2019s consular and  worldwide security upgrade programs since 2004, according to State.  Moreover, State has requested over 700 additional Foreign Service Officer  (FSO) staff in its fiscal year 2010 budget request.", "In response to your request, this report discusses (1) State\u2019s progress in  addressing staffing gaps at hardship posts since 2006 and the effect of any  remaining gaps, and (2) the extent to which State has used incentives to  address staffing gaps at hardship posts.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed GAO and State Office of  Inspector General (OIG) reports and analyzed staffing, bidding, and  position data.

Additionally, we met with officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Human  Resources, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Bureau of Administration, six  regional bureaus, and the American Foreign Service Association. To assess  the impact of staffing gaps and State\u2019s use of hardship incentives firsthand,  we conducted fieldwork in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria; Shenyang, China;  and Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We selected these posts for their  level of hardship, their strategic importance to the United States, and the  low number of staff applying for each position. Specifically, the locations  in Nigeria and Shenyang are posts of greatest hardship and the locations in  Saudi Arabia are hardship posts which, at the time of our visit, had 1-year  tours. In addition to our fieldwork, we conducted telephone interviews  with senior officials in several additional hardship locations, including  Bangladesh, Cambodia, Liberia, and Tajikistan. We also convened an  expert roundtable of several retired senior State officials, all of whom  previously served as ambassadors to hardship posts.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2008 through September  2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

It staffs approximately  268 embassies, consulates, and other posts with over 8,000 Foreign Service  positions overseas. Roughly two-thirds of these posts are in locations that  qualify for a special salary differential to compensate officers for the  harsh living conditions experienced there. The differential ranges from 5  to 35 percent of basic pay and is determined by a number of factors  including extraordinarily difficult living conditions, excessive physical  hardship, or notably unhealthy conditions affecting at least a majority of  employees stationed at such a post. Figure 1 shows the distribution of  overseas posts and positions by hardship differential. In general, tours of  duty are two years in the United States and at 20 percent and 25 percent  hardship posts. Tours at other posts are generally three years, although a  number of posts in locations too dangerous for some family members to  accompany an officer carry 1-year tours.", "FSOs serving abroad fall into two broad categories: generalists and  specialists. FSO generalists help formulate and implement the foreign  policy of the United States and are grouped into five career tracks:  management, consular, economic, political, and public diplomacy. FSO  specialists provide support services at overseas posts worldwide or in  Washington, D.C., and are grouped into seven major categories:  administration, construction engineering, information technology,  international information and English language programs, medical and  health, office management, and security. State requires its FSOs to be  available for service anywhere in the world, and reserves the ability to  direct officers to any of its posts overseas or to its Washington  headquarters. However, directed assignments are rare. The process of  assigning FSOs to their positions typically begins when the staff receive a  list of upcoming vacancies for which they may compete. Staff then submit  a list of positions for which they want to be considered, or \u201cbids,\u201d to the  Office of Career Development and Assignments (HR/CDA) and consult  with their career development officer. The process varies depending on an  officer\u2019s grade and functional specialty:    Entry-level officers\u2019 assignments are directed by the En of HR/CDA with little input from the posts or bureaus.", "Mid-level officers consult with bureaus and overseas posts to market  themselves for their desired position panels to finalize the assignments. s.

As with mid-level officers, HR/CDA convenes a panel to  finalize the assignments.", "In recent years, State has taken a series of measures to address gaps and  reallocate staff to emerging priority nations. In 2002, State implemented  the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative (DRI) to address staffing and training  gaps that, according to the department, endangered U.S. diplomatic  readiness. Through the DRI\u2014a 3-year, $197 million program\u2014State hired  1,069 new foreign and civil service employees above attrition. However, as  we previously reported, most of this increase was absorbed by the demand  for personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, State introduced the Global  Repositioning Program, which reallocated existing positions to emerging  high-priority countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

In its FY 2007 Annual Performance Report, State identified staffing  of critical positions\u2014designated positions at the posts of greatest hardship  (those with hardship differentials of at least 25 percent)\u2014as a key priority,  noting that such positions are often on the forefront of U.S. policy  interests. As such, State established a target for fiscal year 2007 of filling  90 percent of such critical positions with qualified bidders by the end of  the assignments cycle. However, State reported filling 75 percent of its  critical positions, thereby missing its target. State further noted that it  would be unable to fill more than 75 percent of critical positions until its  resource needs were met. Subsequently, the department lowered its target  to 75 percent for fiscal year 2008, which it reported it met.", "In addition to staffing gaps specific to critical positions, State faces its  highest rate of vacancies at the posts of greatest hardship. As of  September 2008, State had a 17 percent average vacancy rate at the posts  of greatest hardship\u2014nearly double the average rate of 9 percent at posts  with no hardship differentials. Vacancies at posts we visited during our  review included a mid-level public affairs position in Jeddah, Saudi  Arabia, that was vacant as of September 2008 and, at the time of our  March 2009 visit, was not expected to be filled until June 2009. Similarly, a  section chief in Lagos, Nigeria, stated that prior to his arrival at post in  August 2008, his position had been vacant for nearly a year. Although there  were few vacancies in Shenyang, China, at the time of our visit, nearly  one-quarter of the staffed positions had been vacant for 4 months or more  before their current incumbents arrived.", "Beyond higher position vacancy rates, posts of greatest hardship face  experience gaps due to a higher rate of staff filling positions above their  own grades (see table 1). As of September 2008, about 34 percent of mid- level generalist positions at posts of greatest hardship were filled by  officers in upstretch assignments\u201415 percentage points higher than the  upstretch rate for comparable positions at posts with no or low  differentials. Furthermore, as of the same date, 25 of 34 (over 70 percent)  of all overseas generalists working two grades above their rank were  located at hardship posts.", "At posts we visited during our review, we observed numerous officers  working in positions above their rank. For example, in Abuja, Nigeria,  more than 4 in every 10 positions were staffed by officers in upstretch  assignments, including several employees working in positions two grades  above their own.

Approximately 270 of these vacancies were due to State not having  enough employees to fill all of its positions\u2014a shortfall that has grown  since our last report. Officers attending training or rotating from post to  post without replacements to fill their positions accounted for most of the  remaining 1,380 vacancies. As we reported in 2006, State implemented  DRI with the intention of hiring enough new employees above attrition to  allow staff time for critical job training\u2014also referred to as a \u201ctraining  float\u201d\u2014and to respond to emerging crises. However, as we previously  reported, this goal became quickly outdated largely due to staffing  demands for Iraq and Afghanistan. In particular, due to the overall  shortage of FSOs and the high priority of meeting Iraq and Afghanistan\u2019s  staffing needs, bureaus have had to identify nearly 670 positions to leave  unfilled, or \u201cfrozen,\u201d since 2005. As a result, State has generally been able  to find candidates to fill positions in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014its top  priority posts\u2014but doing so has created gaps elsewhere, including at other  hardship posts. For instance, positions that bureaus decided not to fill in  the 2009 assignments cycle included several positions at hardship posts,  such as an economic officer in Lagos, a management officer in Shenyang,  and three or more positions each in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Mexico City,  Mexico; and Moscow, Russia.", "State officials also noted that the pressing need to staff Iraq and  Afghanistan has led officers serving elsewhere to interrupt or cancel their  current tours and volunteer for service in those two countries, thereby  leaving other posts with unexpected gaps. For example, a senior official  stated that a key political/military officer position in Russia was vacant  due to the incumbent volunteering for a year of service in Afghanistan. The  senior official further stated that he anticipated it would be difficult to find  a temporary replacement for the unexpected vacancy. Similarly, officials  in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs told us an officer who  received nearly a year of language training in Vietnamese cancelled her  tour in Vietnam to serve in Iraq.", "Although State recently received a significant increase in resources and  has requested more, the extent to which this influx will allow the  department to eliminate vacancies is unclear. State received funding for  about 140 additional Foreign Service positions in fiscal year 2008.  Subsequently, in fiscal year 2009, State received about 720 additional  Foreign Service positions that, according to the department, largely  allowed it to fill vacancies created by personnel serving in Iraq and  Afghanistan and increases in language training. The department has  requested nearly 740 additional Foreign Service positions for fiscal year  2010 that, according to State\u2019s 2010 Congressional Budget Justification,  will allow it to begin expanding its presence according to strategic  priorities.

The official told us that the department  plans to manage this experience gap by assigning officers in the FS-03  grade to stretch positions. However, as we discuss later in this report,  positions filled by officers in upstretch assignments can compromise  diplomatic readiness. State has also accelerated promotions of FS-03  officers to address the experience gap. For instance, State\u2019s Five-Year  Workforce Plan for Fiscal Years 2008 through 2012 projects that it will  take about 8 years for officers hired in 2008 to be promoted to the FS-02  level. By contrast, officers promoted to the FS-02 level in 2003 had an  average time-in-service of 10.7 years.

The increase has been  more pronounced for posts of greatest hardship, which received a median  average of 4.5 bids per post in 2008\u2014about 40 percent higher than the  median average of 3.2 bids we previously reported. However, hardship  posts continue to have difficulty attracting bids from experienced officers.  Specifically, positions at hardship posts received a median average of 4  bids from at-grade officers, including a median average of 2.7 at-grade bids  for positions at the posts of greatest hardship. By contrast, posts with no  or low hardship differentials received a median average of over 9 at-grade  bids. Furthermore, as of September 2008, hardship posts comprised over  90 percent (62 of 67) of posts that State classified as historically difficult to  staff for 2009.", "Low bidding on hardship posts exacerbates State\u2019s staffing deficits\u2014 particularly its shortage of mid-level consular and public diplomacy  officers. Figure 3 shows the average number of bids per generalist career  track for each hardship differential in the summer 2008 assignments cycle.  While all generalist career tracks received about 3 to 4 times fewer bids at  the posts of greatest hardship than at posts with no differentials in 2008,  consular and public diplomacy positions received among the fewest bids  on average\u20143.6 and 4.3, respectively. Given that State faces its largest  staff shortages in mid-level consular and public diplomacy positions, low  bidding for such positions at hardship posts increases the difficulty of  filling them.", "State has taken steps in recent years to prioritize staffing of hardship  posts. For example, in the 2007 assignments cycle, State assigned staff to  hardship positions it considered critical\u2014including in Iraq and  Afghanistan\u2014prior to assigning staff to positions elsewhere. Similarly, in  the 2008 assignments cycle, State assigned staff to the posts of greatest  hardship before assigning staff elsewhere. However, as we noted earlier in  this report, hardship posts face a higher rate of upstretch assignments than  posts with no or low differentials\u2014an experience gap that State\u2019s  assignment system does not explicitly address. For example, while State\u2019s  instructions to bidders for the 2007 and 2008 assignments cycles did  emphasize the staffing of hardship positions, the instructions did not  differentiate between filling the positions with at-grade officers and filling  them with officers below the positions\u2019 grades. Although State\u2019s  instructions to bidders clearly state that employees bidding on stretch  assignments compete against at-grade bidders, the low number of at-grade  bids on hardship positions limits the likelihood that such positions will be  filled by at-grade officers. Furthermore, in the assignments cycles for 2007  through 2009, State consistently permitted upstretch assignments to  hardship posts 1 to 3 months prior to permitting upstretch assignments to  posts with low or no hardship differentials, which may have encouraged  officers with less experience to bid on hardship posts. According to State,  upstretch assignments can be career-enhancing in some cases; however,  the experience gap they represent\u2014particularly at the mid-levels\u2014can  compromise diplomatic readiness."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Staffing and Experience Gaps at Hardship Posts Can Compromise Diplomatic Readiness", "paragraphs": ["Current and former State officials, including recently retired ambassadors  and former directors general who participated in a GAO expert  roundtable, staff currently posted overseas, and officials in Washington  told us that staffing gaps at hardship posts diminish diplomatic readiness  in a variety of ways. According to these officials, gaps can lead to  decreased reporting coverage, loss of institutional knowledge, and  increased supervisory requirements for senior staff, which take time away  from other critical diplomatic responsibilities.", "Senior management at selected posts had concerns that vacant positions  caused an increased workload on officers at posts, which may detract  from important functions. For example, the economic officer position in  Lagos, whose responsibility is solely focused on energy, oil, and natural  gas, was not filled in the 2009 cycle. The incumbent explained that,  following his departure, his reporting responsibilities will be split up  between officers in Abuja and Lagos. He said this division of  responsibilities would diminish the position\u2019s focus on the oil industry and  potentially lead to the loss of important contacts within both the  government ministries and the oil industry. A 2008 Office of Inspector  General (OIG) inspection of Freetown, Sierra Leone, noted concern over  the effect of a sudden vacancy when the embassy\u2019s sole political/economic  officer cut his tour short to serve in Iraq. This vacancy deprived the  embassy of its only reporting officer and the resulting transition period  caused officials in Washington to be dissatisfied with economic reporting  on issues such as the diamond industry and its impact on political  instability, money laundering, drug smuggling, and, perhaps, terrorism.  Similarly, an official told us that a political/military officer position in  Russia was vacant because of the departure of the incumbent for a tour in  Afghanistan, and the position\u2019s portfolio of responsibilities was divided  among other officers in the embassy. According to the official, this  vacancy slowed negotiation of an agreement with Russia regarding  military transit to Afghanistan.", "Another potentially adverse effect of staffing gaps is that important post- level duties, such as reporting and staff development, may suffer from  inexperience when entry-level officers are staffed to mid-level positions.  While officials at post said that some officers in stretch positions perform  well, others told us that the inexperience of entry-level officers serving in  mid-level capacities can have a negative impact. For example, the  economic section chief at one post we visited stated that reporting  produced by an entry-level officer in a mid-level position lacked the  necessary analytical rigor. The political section chief at the same post  noted that a mid-level position responsible for reporting on terrorism was  staffed by an officer serving two grades above his current grade level with  no previous reporting experience. A 2008 OIG inspection of N\u2019Djamena,  Chad, found that difficulties attracting staff with the requisite skills and  experience contributed to deviations from standard operating  procedures.", "Another consequence of staffing gaps is that senior-level staff at posts with  no experienced mid-level officers are diverted from key responsibilities by  the need to supervise inexperienced entry-level staff. In 2006, we found  that senior staff at several posts spent more time on operational matters  and less time on overall planning, policy, and coordination than should be  the case. On our recent visits, we found that there are still inexperienced  officers taking on mid-level responsibilities and that these officers require  more supervision and guidance from senior post leadership than more  experienced mid-level officers would require; as a result, the senior  officers have less time to perform high-level planning and policy  implementation. According to officials we met with, inexperienced  officers sometimes perform essential tasks such as adjudicating visas,  identifying political trends, and assisting American citizens abroad;  therefore, they often require guidance on how to carry out such activities.  When senior-level officials must serve as the only source of guidance, post  officials explained, they have less ability to plan and coordinate policy. For  example, the ambassador to Nigeria told us spending time helping officers  in stretch positions is a burden and interferes with policy planning and  implementation. The consular chief in Shenyang told us he spends too  much time helping entry-level officers adjudicate visas and, therefore, less  time managing the section. A 2008 OIG inspection of N\u2019Djamena, Chad,  reported that the entire front office was involved in mentoring entry-level  officers and that this was an unfair burden on the ambassador and deputy  chief of mission, given the challenging nature of the post.", "In addition to gaps in established positions, some State officials at  overseas posts told us that there are not enough authorized positions to  manage the heavy workload at some posts. These officials stated that even  if the department had an adequate number of people to fill all current  positions, there would still be a need for additional positions and officers  to fill them because the current workload outweighs the workforce. For  example, a senior official at one post told us that her embassy did not have  enough authorized management positions to support the rapid increase in  staff for all government agencies located there. As a result, the  ambassador placed a moratorium on the addition of any new staff from  any agency until the embassy received more management officer  positions. The official explained that the moratorium has prevented some  agencies from adding staff to implement important programs related to  health, education, and counternarcotics efforts. During the GAO expert  roundtable of former ambassadors to hardship posts, a former director  general said that one of his former posts had so many visitors that four  officers had to deal primarily with visits and not their other  responsibilities. In addition, according to the ambassador to Liberia, the  embassy in Monrovia lacks adequate staff positions to meet its goals. She  said it is not uncommon for one section to work twenty hours of overtime  in one week. The ambassador listed four new positions that she believes  should be authorized but, according to her, will not likely be added in the  next few years. The State OIG also commented on the need for reasonable  growth in Monrovia in a 2008 mission inspection. A 2009 OIG inspection  of Nouakchott, Mauritania, noted concern that without another political  officer in the embassy, the post would not have the depth needed to  adequately cover the rapidly evolving political situation and achieve  department goals in the country. Similarly, officials in Jeddah, Saudi  Arabia, noted that the creation and filling of a political/economic section  chief position, as they have requested in their Mission Strategic Plan,  would alleviate the current need for entry-level officers to report directly  to the consul general."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Has Wide Range of Measures and Incentives to Staff Hardship Posts but Their Effectiveness is Unclear Due to Lack of Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["State uses a range of incentives to staff hardship posts, but their  effectiveness remains unclear due to a lack of evaluation.

State allows officers to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan on detail  from Washington or their current post of assignment, which provides  financial and other benefits. For example, officers serving on detail from  Washington, D.C., retain locality pay. Moreover, according to State  officials, officers who leave their families at their current post of  assignment to serve on detail avoid the disruption of moving their families  and may extend their tour at their current post of assignment from 3 years  to 4 years, which may be particularly attractive for officers with school age  children as it enables more educational continuity.", "Favorable consideration for promotion. State\u2019s selection boards that  recommend employees for promotion are expected to look favorably on  service in Iraq and Afghanistan. In particular, State instructs the boards to  \u201cparticularly credit performance in Provincial Reconstruction Teams and  other regional operations in Iraq, which the President and Secretary of  State have determined to be of the highest priority.\u201d", "In addition to incentives, State has rules requiring certain employees to bid  on positions at hardship posts. These Fair Share rules require designated  FSOs to bid on a minimum of three posts with a 15 percent or higher  differential pay incentive in two geographic areas.", "Table 3 lists the various incentives and requirements across posts, based  on hardship differential.", "Although State offers a range of incentives, it does not routinely track or  report on their total cost. In response to our request for cost information,  State queried its payroll system and estimated that it spent about $83  million on hardship pay, $30 million on danger pay, and about $3 million  on SND in fiscal year 2008. The cost information indicates that the amount  spent on financial incentives has increased in recent years. According to  the State OIG, in fiscal year 2005, the department spent about $65 million  on hardship pay, $16 million on danger pay, and $3 million on SND.  Separately, State reports the amount spent on student loan repayments to  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as part of that office\u2019s  statutory requirement to report annually to the Congress on agencies\u2019 use  of student loan repayments. According to our analysis of data from  OPM\u2019s report for 2007, State repaid about $2.5 million of student loans to  FSOs in that year.", "Although not all incentives cost money, they may present other tradeoffs.  First, State officials report that the 1-year tour of duty to Iraq has been a  useful recruitment tool. However, these and other officials told us that  the 1-year tour length makes it difficult for FSOs to form the relationships  with their counterparts in other governments necessary for the conduct of  U.S. diplomacy. For example, a State official told us of a recent instance  where the U.S. government needed information on a Middle Eastern  country\u2019s relationship with another nation in the region. However, none of  the four political officers at the U.S. embassy in the country had sufficient  contacts with the host government to obtain the information required.  Consequently, the U.S. embassy needed to ask State headquarters to  obtain the information from the host government by way of that country\u2019s  embassy in the United States, resulting in delayed reporting of the  information. A former Director General told us that 1-year tours result in a  loss of institutional knowledge and program continuity. Second, the  opportunity to bid on stretch assignments is an incentive because such  assignments may be career-enhancing. However, as noted earlier in this  report, senior officials may need to supervise and guide officers in stretch  positions more than officers in positions at their current grade levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Systematically Evaluated Effectiveness of Incentive Programs for Hardship Post Assignments", "paragraphs": ["State has not systematically evaluated the effectiveness of its incentive  programs, despite recommendations to do so.

We  previously reported that State created a number of incentives to address  the growing number of vacancies at hardship posts to achieve its goal of  having the right people in the right place with the right skills. However, in  2006, we reported State had not measured the effectiveness of hardship  incentives, and recommended State systematically evaluate the  effectiveness of such measures, establishing specific indicators of  progress and adjusting the use of the incentives based on this analysis.  State responded to this recommendation by including a question on the  impact of incentives to its biennial employee quality of life survey, but this  step does not fully respond to our recommendation for three reasons.", "First, the survey\u2019s incentive question is not specific enough. State included  the question \u201cHow important was each of the following in your decision to  bid on overseas positions during the last assignment cycle in which you  submitted bids?\u201d in its most recent Quality of Life at Work survey. The  question then listed 11 items, some of which are incentives (e.g., hardship  pay) and others are generic aspects of overseas assignments (e.g.,  security). While the survey provides some limited information, the survey  question does not ask about the influence of the incentives on officers\u2019  willingness to bid on\u2014and remain in\u2014hardship post assignments.  Further, by mixing incentives and other aspects of hardship post  assignments, the question dilutes the focus on the incentives. Moreover,  the list of incentives included is incomplete. For example, it does not ask  employees about the extent to which the opportunity to include upstretch  jobs on their core bid list or the favorable promotion consideration by  selection boards impact their decisions to bid on hardship post  assignments. Excluding some incentives from the survey hampers State\u2019s  ability to evaluate the effectiveness of programs for hardship post  assignments individually and collectively.", "Second, the overall survey design has limitations preventing State officials  from segregating responses by post and also does not collect key  demographic information. For example, the survey data do not allow State  officials to determine which responses came from posts with no hardship  differential, such as London, United Kingdom, and which came from posts  of greatest hardship, such as Lagos, Nigeria. The survey also does not ask  respondents for key demographic information, such as age and family  status. The absence of this information makes it difficult to assess the  effectiveness of the incentives as they apply to posts differently. Further,  the appeal of one incentive relative to another incentive may differ based  upon an officer\u2019s personal circumstances.", "Third, State did not establish specific indicators of progress against which  to measure the survey responses over time. As previously noted, State  tracks the percentage of critical positions filled with qualified bidders by  the end of the assignments cycle. However, State has not attempted to link  this information to the survey results, as suggested by government  management standards.

Since we last reported on this issue, State has  begun collecting data on which officers decline SND.

According to a State official, the legislative change will result in an  approximately 8 percent increase in basic pay for FSOs, beginning in  August 2009.

Despite these  advances, State continues to face persistent staffing and experience gaps  at such posts\u2014especially at the mid-level\u2014which can compromise its  diplomatic readiness. The department has generally been able to fill its top  priority posts in Iraq and Afghanistan, but key positions at other hardship  posts remain vacant or are filled by officers who may lack the necessary  experience to effectively perform their duties, potentially compromising  State\u2019s ability to advance U.S. international interests. Although State plans  to address staffing gaps by hiring more officers, the department  acknowledges it will take years for these new employees to gain the  experience they need to be effective mid-level officers. The department  plans to manage this experience gap in the near term by continuing to  assign officers to positions above their current grade level. However, the  frequent assignment of officers to stretch positions in hardship posts  brings some risks, which will likely persist since State\u2019s assignment system  does not explicitly address the continuing experience gap at hardship  posts as a priority consideration in making assignments.
