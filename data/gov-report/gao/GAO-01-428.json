However, the transition to a paperless environment will require that several challenges be overcome. Transferring the depository library program to the Library of Congress entails both advantages and disadvantages. In studies done in 1993 and 1994, the Library concluded that the depository library program was not inconsistent with the mission and functions of the Library and that it might be appropriate for the Library to oversee this program. However, the Government Printing Office (GPO) believes that the Library is not an appropriate home for the depository library program because the Library's mission and operations are inconsistent with a large-scale information dissemination program. In addition, the studies and librarian organizations raised concerns about the potential negative effects of the transfer on public access to information and the availability of funds to maintain the current program. If a decision is made to transfer the depository library program, the concerns raised by library organizations and employee unions should be addressed. One option for addressing these issues is to form a GPO/Library transition team to develop appropriate strategies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Government Printing Office (GPO) is the principal agent for federal printing. Specifically, all printing for the three branches of government\u2014 with a few exceptions\u2014is required to be done by GPO. GPO also disseminates and sells government publications through programs managed by the Superintendent of Documents. The Superintendent disseminates government publications to the public through the depository library program and sells publications online, through 23 bookstores, and by mail order. Until recently, the dissemination and sales programs dealt mostly in paper, microfiche, or CD-ROM formats. However, advances in electronic publishing technologies and the availability of government publications on the World Wide Web are affecting paper-based dissemination and sales and are raising questions about the direction and future of the Federal Depository Library Program.", "The conference report for the legislative branch appropriations for 2001 required that we submit to you, by March 30, 2001, a study on electronic dissemination of government information. Specifically, we were required to   study the impact of providing documents to the public solely in electronic   assess the feasibility of transferring the depository library program to the Library of Congress.", "As part of our assessment of the depository library program, we were asked to (1) identify how such a transfer might be accomplished; (2) identify measures that are necessary to ensure the success of such a transfer; (3) identify when such a transfer might optimally occur; (4) examine the functions, services, and programs of the Superintendent of Documents; (5) examine and identify administrative and infrastructure support that is provided to the Superintendent by GPO, with a view to the implications for such a transfer; and (6) examine and identify the costs, for both GPO and the Library of Congress, of such a transfer. In addition, the conference report required that we provide (1) a current inventory of publications and documents that are provided to the public and (2) the frequency with which each type of publication or document is requested for deposit at nonregional depository libraries.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed GPO dissemination data and work processes, GPO and Library of Congress program and budget documents, and other documentation. We also reviewed technical literature and previous relevant studies. In addition, we interviewed GPO and Library officials, representatives of professional library associations, representatives of unions representing GPO employees, and officials from the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Further details on our objectives, scope, and methodology are presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1861, GPO is the principal agent for federal printing. All printing for the Congress, the Executive Office, and the Judiciary\u2014except for the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014and for every executive department, independent office, and establishment of the government is required to be done at or contracted by GPO. An agency located in the legislative branch, GPO produces the Congressional Record, the Federal Register, the Code of Federal Regulations, and other key government documents.", "GPO, through its Superintendent of Documents, is also responsible for the acquisition, classification, dissemination, and bibliographic control of tangible and electronic government information products. Accordingly, regardless of the printing source, the law requires that federal agencies make all their publications in all formats available to the Superintendent of Documents for cataloging and distribution. The Superintendent of Documents then distributes this government information in traditional and electronic formats to the public through a system of more than 1,300 depository libraries nationwide\u2014the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The Superintendent of Documents also links the public to about 203,000 online government documents through its Web site, known as GPO Access. In addition, it makes about 9,000 titles available for sale via telephone, mail, fax, e-mail, online orders from publishing agency Web sites, booksellers, the GPO Online Bookstore, and GPO Bookstores.", "This longstanding structure for centralized dissemination of government information is facing several challenges.", "First, government printing has evolved from a primarily in-house GPO operation to a combination of GPO-administered private printing contracts, executive branch agency contracts, and in-house printing. We have reported on this development and questioned the efficiency and effectiveness in this environment of the centralized GPO model for government printing.", "Second, federal agencies are increasingly disseminating information via agency Web sites, which is decreasing reliance on large-scale printing as the means to produce government documents.", "Third, the statutory mechanism for GPO printing and document distribution faces constitutional issues. Congress gave the congressional Joint Committee on Printing (JCP) broad authority to supervise government printing and distribution of government publications. Its regulation of executive branch printing and document distribution, however, has been viewed by the Department of Justice as being unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s 1983 \u201cseparation of power\u201d decision in INS v. Chadha. In this case, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), the Supreme Court invalidated the legislative veto authority of Congress, ruling that Congress can only affect the executive branch through legislation that has been passed by both Houses and signed into law. In the years since Chadha, the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget have several times instructed executive branch agencies that they need not comply with either statutory JCP requirements or the JCP Printing and Binding Regulations.", "These challenges have impaired GPO\u2019s ability to acquire and disseminate government documents. In 1996, GPO estimated that about 50 percent of government documents published in that year were not indexed, catalogued, and distributed to the depository libraries. Documents that should be\u2014but are not\u2014distributed by the Superintendent of Documents to the depository libraries are known as fugitive documents. GPO asserts that these fugitive documents are increasing because of electronic dissemination of information via agency Web sites and decreasing agency compliance with the statutory requirements for printing through GPO.", "Many government documents are also disseminated or sold by other components of the national information dissemination infrastructure, including the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Technical Information Center (a major component of the Department of Defense\u2019s Scientific and Technical Information Program) and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Technical Information Service. Increasingly, these documents are also available on agencies\u2019 Web sites and through FirstGov\u2014a government Web site providing the public with one-stop access to online federal resources, including government publications.", "Increasing use of electronic publishing and dissemination technology is also changing the FDLP itself. The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996 directed GPO to reassess the program within this context. Noting that the use of these technologies requires careful analysis, planning, and the probable restructuring of the current federal dissemination program, the act directed GPO to examine the functions and services of the FDLP, identify measures that were necessary to ensure a successful transition to a more electronically based FDLP, and prepare a strategic plan for such a transition. The resulting study and its companion strategic planrecommended a 5-year transition to a more electronic FDLP, identified a core of government publications that should continue to be distributed on paper, such as the Code of Federal Regulations, and established a schedule for the transition. According to this schedule, by the end of fiscal year 1998 FDLP libraries were to receive 50 percent of publications in electronic format. The program reached this objective in fiscal year 2000, when about 57 percent of FDLP titles were made available online via GPO Access.", "Although the FDLP has begun to provide online access to selected government publications via GPO Access, it uses electronic information to supplement\u2014and selectively replace\u2014the dissemination of the same information on paper or microfiche. Thus, the number of tangible titles\u2014 on paper, microfiche, or CD-ROM\u2014distributed to FDLP libraries since the publication of the study has remained relatively stable: from 29,372 titles distributed in fiscal year 1996 to 28,849 titles in fiscal year 2000. A similarly modest decline was evident in the number of distributed tangible copies, from 13,472,946 copies distributed in fiscal year 1996 to 12,207,064 copies in fiscal year 2000.", "A major impetus for accelerating the transition to a more electronic FDLP occurred in fiscal year 2001, when the Congress reduced by $2 million the funding for the programs managed by the Superintendent of Documents. Faced with this funding shortfall, GPO analyzed printing contracts to determine whether the publications distributed on paper or microfiche might also have online versions available. The analysis showed that 40 percent of the distributed tangible titles had online versions available.", "Acting on this finding, the Superintendent has accelerated the transition of the FDLP to a primarily electronic program and issued a policy for the dissemination of publications to depository libraries. The policy restated earlier guidance articulated in an August 2000 letter from the Superintendent of Documents to the directors of depository libraries, reaffirmed the commitment to use online dissemination as the primary method of FDLP distribution, and defined the conditions under which the program will continue to distribute paper publications and other tangible products, even if the publications are available online. Specifically, the program will also distribute the paper or tangible version when any one of the following conditions is met:   There is a legal requirement to distribute the publication in tangible format.", "The paper publication is of significant reference value to most types of FDLP libraries.", "The paper publication serves a special needs population.   The commonly accepted medium of the user community is tangible format.", "The product is essential to the conduct of government.", "With regard to the last category, the Superintendent of Documents has identified a list of \u201cEssential Titles for Public Use in Paper Format.\u201d Based on an initial list developed in 1996, these \u201cessential\u201d titles would be made available to the depository libraries in paper format, regardless of their online availability. These documents, listed in appendix VII, include such titles as the Budget of the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations, the Congressional Record, and the United States Code. We determined that 28 of the 42 titles (about 67 percent) are also available online. According to the Superintendent of Documents, maintaining the availability of these titles for selection in paper format is essential to the purpose of the FDLP.", "Advances in information technologies and the Internet continue to shape the FDLP. Over the years, these advances have also triggered numerous initiatives focused on reforming and restructuring the nation\u2019s information dissemination infrastructure in general and the Office of the Superintendent of Documents in particular. These initiatives\u2014including the recent proposal by the National Commission on Libraries and Information Sciences\u2014are discussed in appendix VIII."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Providing Government Documents to the Public Solely in Electronic Format", "paragraphs": ["Electronic dissemination of government documents offers the opportunity to reduce the costs of dissemination and make government information more usable and accessible. However, to move to an environment in which documents are disseminated solely in electronic format, a number of challenges would need to be overcome. These challenges include ensuring that these documents are (1) authentic, (2) permanently maintained, and (3) equally accessible to all individuals. In addition, cost issues should be addressed, including the effect of shifting printing costs to depository libraries and end users."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electronic Dissemination Provides Advantages", "paragraphs": ["One of the advantages of electronic dissemination is that electronic documents cost less to store, maintain, and disseminate. Electronic documents require no warehouse space and incur no shipping charges. If necessary, they may be readily updated with little further production cost. The contrast in costs between electronic and paper dissemination is illustrated by the costs associated with GPO Access in fiscal year 2000. In this period, the Superintendent of Documents distributed almost 12.2 million copies of 28,849 tangible titles to depository libraries and added 32,306 online titles to the 160,726 titles available at the end of fiscal year 1999 through GPO Access. For the 28,849 tangible titles, the reported fiscal year 2000 printing and reproduction costs were about $13.7 million; for operating and maintaining the 193,032 online titles the reported cost was about $3.3 million.", "A second advantage of electronic dissemination is that electronic documents may offer greater functionality than traditional paper documents. They can be searched, can be linked to related information, can be manipulated (allowing users to cut and paste text), and may incorporate not only images, but also audio and video. Further, electronic documents make printing on demand accessible to individuals.", "A third advantage of electronic dissemination is that electronic documents make government information far more accessible to citizens, including those with physical impairments. Once posted, they are immediately accessible to thousands of users from multiple locations around the nation. Because the Web is location independent, it reduces geographic differentiation and may eliminate the need for visits to a distant depository library or GPO bookstore. Moreover, unlike their paper counterparts stored in the nation\u2019s libraries and bookstores, electronic documents are generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disseminating Documents Solely in Electronic Format Poses Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While the Web-based dissemination of electronic government publications provides an attractive alternative to the traditional ink-on-paper approach, a number of challenges would need to be overcome if the government were to disseminate documents solely in electronic format. These challenges include addressing (1) authentication, (2) permanence, and (3) equity of access. In addition, cost issues would need to be addressed.", "Authentication provides the assurance that the electronic document is official and complete: i.e., that the document was not surreptitiously or accidentally modified. When citizens access and retrieve government documents from federal Web sites, they should have assurance that the accessed documents are authentic.", "Although document authentication may be achieved through electronic signatures or seals, government documents currently available on the Web often lack authentication. Once downloaded from government Web sites, documents lacking electronic signatures or seals may be modified without detection. The FDLP is not currently using electronic signatures or other electronic means to authenticate government documents, but GPO is in the process of procuring public key infrastructure (PKI) technology to provide authentication of government publications disseminated online via GPO Access. Program officials told us that they guarantee the authenticity of the electronic documents available on the GPO Access Web site, although no such guarantee is posted on the Web site itself.", "Permanence refers to the retention of an online document by a Web site, making it possible for users to repeatedly find or link to the document. In practice, this means that the document must be maintained online in perpetuity.", "Since GPO provides FDLP libraries with access to electronic documents through GPO Access, it has assumed responsibility for their permanence. To do this, GPO uses the Online Computer Library Center\u2019s Persistent Uniform Resource Locators, which provide an effective means to update Internet addresses by redirecting users from old Internet addresses to the most recent address associated with an electronic publication.", "Although the Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 directs the Superintendent of Documents to maintain an electronic directory of government information and provide online access to government documents, there is no explicit legal requirement for the Superintendent of Documents or any other federal entity to permanently maintain online electronic versions of government documents. However, GPO has advised us that it believes that it has a legal basis to maintain permanent access to electronic information.", "In addition, portions of government electronic information products managed by the Superintendent of Documents in what is known as the FDLP Electronic Collection are maintained by partner institutions, including other federal agencies and depository libraries and consortia. Recognizing the risk of losing documents controlled by other agencies, FDLP is acquiring and archiving electronic documents managed by these agencies.", "Equity of access recognizes that some individuals may have difficulty accessing and using electronic information. Many individuals have no access to the Internet, lack computer skills, or are unable to navigate the increasingly complex Web environment. A recent National Telecommunications and Information Administration report on Americans\u2019 access to the Internet notes that while the Web is becoming more and more widespread, about 60 percent of U.S. households have no access to the Internet, whether by choice, poverty, or disability. Moreover, people with disabilities are only half as likely to have access to the Internet compared to those without disabilities. Although individuals in households without Internet access may use access provided by public schools or libraries, the lack of direct access poses a barrier. Similarly, even frequent Internet users may find it difficult to search for and locate specific government documents on the Web. According to the National Commission on Libraries and Information Sciences, government Web sites are often difficult to search, with users confronted with such a massive volume of disorganized materials that they cannot easily find what they are seeking, even if they are highly computer and information literate.", "In addition, while electronic documents are less costly to disseminate, GPO may face near-term cost increases associated with creating electronic documents when none exist. In 2000, the Superintendent of Documents explored the cost of a fully electronic depository library program. The study pointed out that there are no electronic versions available to the depository library program for many of the documents printed by GPO, and that the library program would have to digitize (that is, scan electronically) thousands of documents to make them suitable for online dissemination via GPO Access. The Superintendent of Documents estimated, based on 25,063 titles distributed to depository libraries between April 1999 and March 2000, that approximately 40 percent (10,000 titles) had an online counterpart, and that the remaining 60 percent (15,000 titles) would have to be converted. According to GPO, an additional $7.7 million would have been required in fiscal year 2000 to convert to a totally electronic FDLP, bringing total program costs to $38 million.", "The depository libraries may also expect to bear additional costs if the depository library program begins to disseminate government documents solely in electronic format. These include the costs of (1) printing shelf copies of electronic documents, (2) purchasing selected printed documents no longer provided by the library program, (3) training librarians in the use of the Internet and electronic reference services, and (4) helping library patrons to use the Internet to search and locate government publications.", "This shift in costs to the end user or to libraries was also recognized by the Depository Library Council. The Council noted that although this shift is an unintended consequence of technology, libraries will struggle with different issues such as printing, formatting, and providing users with instructions on how to use online technology. This point was echoed by the National Research Council in its argument that libraries must adopt a new model for library acquisitions, one that considers not only the cost of access to information, but also the cost of maintaining the technical environment\u2014including hardware, software, and personnel\u2014required to make these resources available to readers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Feasibility of Transfer of the Depository Library Program to the Library of Congress", "paragraphs": ["Both advantages and disadvantages are associated with transferring the depository library program to the Library. In studies conducted in 1993 and 1994, the Library concluded that the depository library program is not inconsistent with the mission and functions of the Library and that it might be appropriate for the Library to have responsibility for a program established to acquire government documents and distribute them to depository libraries. Further, a transfer could allow the depository library program and the Library to develop governmentwide solutions to the common issues they face in addressing the acquisition, maintenance, and dissemination of electronic information. In addition, three other GPO programs\u2014closely related to the depository library program or the Library and consistent with the Library\u2019s mission\u2014could also be considered for transfer. However, the Public Printer stated that the Library is not an appropriate home for the depository library program because the Library\u2019s mission is inconsistent with a large-scale information dissemination program. In addition, the Library studies, as well as organizations representing librarians, cited disadvantages associated with such a transfer.

The Library noted that its National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped has long experience with distributing library materials through its network of libraries for the blind and physically handicapped. Therefore, a transfer could expand the Library\u2019s current involvement in the dissemination of government information and enable consolidation of dissemination functions.", "A transfer of selected programs of the Superintendent of Documents might also facilitate the depository library program and the Library working together to address the broad issues of acquiring, managing, and disseminating digital information\u2014issues critical to both organizations. In December 2000, the Library received a special appropriation of $100 million to lead a national strategic planning effort to develop a National Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. In making this appropriation, the Congress directed the Librarian to develop a plan jointly with federal entities having expertise in telecommunications technology and electronic commerce, and with the participation of representatives of other federal, research, and private libraries and institutions having expertise in the collection and maintenance of archives of digital materials. The Library has developed a planning framework and is assembling advisory groups and forming partnerships to guide its planning for the national digital information strategy.", "In addition to the depository library program, three of the six other programs managed by the Superintendent of Documents could be considered for transfer. These programs are (1) Cataloging and Indexing, (2) GPO Access, including the FDLP Electronic Collection, and (3) the International Exchange Service. Two of the programs, the Cataloging and Indexing program and GPO Access, are closely related to the depository library program. Under the third program, the International Exchange Service, the Superintendent of Documents disseminates documents to foreign libraries on behalf of the Library of Congress.", "The Cataloging and Indexing program is responsible for identifying and organizing government publications by title, subject, and agency, and providing this information to users through indexes, catalogs, and online retrieval systems. The Cataloging and Indexing program ensures that government publications entering FDLP dissemination are under bibliographic control.", "According to Library studies, the Cataloging and Indexing program is consistent with the functions of the Library. The program would complement the Library\u2019s cataloging operations and centralize the cataloging of government documents in a single entity. The Library considers that information gathered through the consolidated cataloging and indexing operation would help to ensure that all government publications are reported to a central source and thus help to reduce the number of fugitive documents that escape bibliographic control.", "GPO Access provides the public with access to electronic documents under the bibliographic control of the Superintendent of Documents. This program is essential to the Superintendent\u2019s commitment to provide online access to government documents.", "The International Exchange Service program provides for the distribution of U.S. government publications to foreign libraries in exchange for publications produced by their governments. Foreign publications are then sent to the Library, which administers the program. As such, the program is already the responsibility of the Library and consistent with the Library\u2019s mission. In addition, integrating the international exchange program into the Library\u2019s ongoing domestic and international information exchange programs would allow the Library to consolidate responsibilities for the administration and distribution of all federal documents. The Library\u2019s Office of the Director of Acquisitions, which currently administers the Library\u2019s portion of the program, could assume complete responsibility for the international exchange program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disadvantages of Transferring the Depository Library Program", "paragraphs": ["Both the Library studies and organizations representing the interests of libraries and librarians\u2014including the American Library Association and its Government Documents Roundtable\u2014identified disadvantages associated with a potential transfer.

This would lead to the loss of thousands of publications that would no longer be accessible to the public. Efforts to retrieve and convert these documents after the fact would be logistically and financially prohibitive.", "The library community stated that disengaging the dissemination functions of the depository library program from the printing functions of GPO may destroy the only gateway available to minimize the number of fugitive documents.

On the other hand, the Public Printer stated that the mission and operations of the Library are inconsistent with a large-scale information dissemination program such as the depository library program. He further stated that transferring the depository library program to the Library would increase costs, impose additional burdens on the Library, and not result in any improvement in the public\u2019s ability to access government information.

First, he stated that the report does not provide a comprehensive study of the impact of providing documents solely in electronic format. He stated that the report only briefly mentions such major issues as authenticity, permanent public access, security, equity of access, and cost considerations, and does not address how these issues will be resolved in an all-electronic information environment. Second, he stated that the Library is not an appropriate home for the federal depository library program, as the Library\u2019s mission is inconsistent with a large-scale dissemination program. Finally, he states that the draft report lacks balance in the presentation of information from prior GAO audits because we did not include a discussion of a more recent study of GPO management.", "With regard to electronic dissemination, the conference report required us to study the impact of providing government information solely in electronic format, among other issues, and provide a report by March 30, 2001. Recognizing this limited timeframe, our report appropriately raises the major issues and challenges that would need to be addressed to move to an environment in which government documents are disseminated solely in electronic format. Resolving these challenges, however, is well beyond the scope of what we were asked to do and is instead the responsibility of federal agencies that disseminate information, including GPO. With regard to the transfer of the depository library program, we have revised the report to reflect GPO\u2019s position that the mission of the depository library program is inconsistent with that of the Library. With regard to the comment on balance, our 1990 report is mentioned briefly in the report\u2019s background because of its discussion of issues relating to the structure of GPO. We did not mention the Booz-Allen & Hamilton report cited by GPO because it dealt primarily with the management of GPO\u2014an issue not addressed by this report.", "In a letter dated March 21, 2001, the Librarian of Congress also raised numerous issues concerning the draft report. First, the Librarian stated that sufficient analysis has not been done to support our recommendation that an Interagency Transition Team be established to plan the transfer of the depository library program, particularly in light of the recent mandate from the Congress that designated the Library the lead agency in developing the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. The Librarian also stated that the report focuses exclusively on shifting functions from one legislative branch agency to another and not on the larger policy issues involved in providing citizens useful and persistent access to government information.", "With regard to the Librarian\u2019s comment concerning the recommendation in the draft report, we would like to clarify that the report contains neither conclusions nor recommendations. Our discussion of a transition team is offered only as one possible option for facilitating a transition, if the Congress decides to direct such a transfer. With regard to the focus of the report, we again note that the conference report specifically required us to study issues related to the feasibility of transferring the depository library program to the Library.

Our report refers to security issues within the context of authenticity.", "Specifically, we note that authentication provides the assurance that a document has not been surreptitiously or accidentally modified, which are problems that can be avoided with appropriate security controls. 2.  The report has been revised to reflect that electronic documents may offer greater functionality than paper documents. However, we disagree with the Public Printer\u2019s statement that the only barriers to the use of printed documents are basic literacy and physical disability. In fact, other barriers exist including geographic distance from the library where the printed information is maintained. In addition, the costs associated with maintaining paper documents may limit what is readily available. 3.  Our report states that GPO would face major challenges\u2014including ensuring equity of access\u2014in moving to an environment in which government information is disseminated solely in electronic format. GPO raises valid concerns about how to achieve equity of access in an electronic environment and how this would be more achievable by the Library. Resolving such concerns is beyond the scope of what we were mandated to study. 4.  We agree that total program costs may increase if the number of the documents eligible for inclusion in the depository library program also increases because of the availability of documents on the Web or other factors. We also recognize in our report that electronic dissemination may result in costs shifting to end users and depository libraries. Finally, an economic analysis of dissemination costs is beyond the scope of this study, but we do include the results of GPO\u2019s own study of the costs of converting to an all-electronic depository library system. 5.  The policy decision of whether to transfer the library program is one that rests with the Congress. Our role is to provide factual information\u2014including advantages and disadvantages\u2014that can be used to inform the decision-making process. The question of how public access to government information might be improved by transferring the depository library program to the Library is a valid one but clearly beyond our charge. 6.  Our report points out that if a decision is made to transfer the depository library program, policymakers may want to consider limiting the physical movement of staff and equipment. This is offered as a measure for ensuring the success of a potential transfer, in response to our mandate. 7.  The Public Printer is correct in stating that the depository library program is much larger in scope than the Library\u2019s National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. In recognition of this, our report notes that the Library cautioned in its studies that administering the depository library program would considerably expand the Library\u2019s mission. 8.  A transfer of the depository library program would clearly require changes to legislation. However, a detailed discussion of the specific changes needed would be difficult, if not impossible, without knowing the details of a policy decision that, to date, has not been made. The Public Printer\u2019s question concerning the effect of a transfer on fugitive documents is valid, and our report highlights the concerns of the library community related to this issue. 9.  The Public Printer is correct in stating that if a transfer is directed, spreading GPO\u2019s current overhead costs over the programs remaining at GPO would result in increased costs for those programs. He is also correct that some reduction in overhead costs may, as a result, be warranted. We would expect that this issue would be addressed during transition planning. Further, we would expect that the transition team would identify and consider all options for dealing with this issue, including transferring the positions supporting the depository library program to the Library. 10. If a decision is made to transfer the depository library program to the Library, the Librarian would, of course, have to address the priority of the transferred program within the context of the mission of the Library. 11. The Public Printer also points out many detailed implementation questions that our report does not address. We believe such questions can be addressed if and when a decision is made to transfer the depository library program and the details of the functions to be transferred are known. 12. In regard to the impact on transferred employees, the report identifies the concerns of unions representing GPO employees and states that issues such as seniority, salary rates, and bargaining rights should be addressed during transition planning. 13. In regard to a potential transfer of GPO Access, our report does not suggest that the Library duplicate GPO\u2019s preparation of the data bases that are derived from the printing processes currently managed by the production department or that dissemination of the databases be moved to another location. If a decision is made to transfer the program, we are confident that detailed transition planning\u2014 conducted by the Library and GPO\u2014would result in an appropriate and cost-effective division of responsibilities between the two organizations. 14.
