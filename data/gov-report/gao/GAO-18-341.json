GAO examined 1) the changes in expenditures and the potential savings for items and services subject to prior authorization demonstrations, 2) reported benefits and challenges of prior authorization, and 3) CMS's monitoring of the programs and plans for future prior authorization. To do this, GAO examined prior authorization program data, CMS documentation, and federal internal control standards. GAO also interviewed CMS and MAC officials, as well as selected provider, supplier, and beneficiary groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Prior authorization is a payment approach used by private insurers that generally requires health care providers and suppliers to first demonstrate compliance with coverage and payment rules before certain items or services are provided to patients, rather than after the items or services have been provided. This approach may be used to reduce expenditures, unnecessary utilization, and improper payments. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has begun using prior authorization in Medicare through a series of fixed-length demonstrations designed to measure their effectiveness, and one permanent program. According to GAO's analyses, expenditures decreased for items and services subject to a demonstration. GAO's analyses of actual expenditures and estimated expenditures in the absence of the demonstrations found that estimated savings from all demonstrations through March 2017 could be as high as about $1.1 to $1.9 billion. While CMS officials said that prior authorization likely played a large role in reducing expenditures, it is difficult to separate the effects of prior authorization from other program integrity efforts. For example, CMS implemented a durable medical equipment competitive bidding program in January 2011, and according to the agency, it resulted in lower expenditures.", "Many provider, supplier, and beneficiary group officials GAO spoke with reported benefits of prior authorization, such as reducing unnecessary utilization. However, provider and supplier group officials reported that providers and suppliers experienced some challenges. These include difficulty obtaining the necessary documentation from referring physicians to submit a prior authorization request, although CMS has created templates and other tools to address this concern. In addition, providers and suppliers reported concerns about whether accessories deemed essential to the power wheelchairs under the permanent durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) program are subject to prior authorization. In practice, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that administer prior authorization programs review these accessories when making prior authorization determinations, even though they are not technically included in the program and therefore cannot be provisionally affirmed. As a result, providers and suppliers lack assurance about whether Medicare is likely to pay for these accessories. This is contrary to a CMS stated benefit of prior authorization\u2014to provide assurance about whether Medicare is likely to pay for an item or service\u2014and to federal internal control standards, which call for agencies to design control activities that enable an agency to achieve its objectives.", "CMS monitors prior authorization through various MAC reports. CMS also reviews MAC accuracy and timeliness in processing prior authorization requests and has contracted for independent evaluations of the demonstrations. Currently, prior authorization demonstrations are scheduled to end in 2018. Despite its interest in using prior authorization for additional items, CMS has not made plans to continue its efforts. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving objectives. CMS risks missed opportunities for achieving its stated goals of reducing costs and realizing program savings by reducing unnecessary utilization and improper payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) subject accessories essential to the power wheelchairs in the permanent DMEPOS program to prior authorization and (2) take steps, based on results from evaluations, to continue prior authorization.

CMS\u2019s monitoring of prior authorization programs and its plans for  future prior authorization.", "To determine changes in expenditures and the potential savings for items  and services subject to prior authorization demonstrations, we analyzed  Medicare monthly expenditure data. We did not analyze expenditure data  for the permanent program because it was implemented in March 2017.  We calculated monthly expenditures for each demonstration for 2 time  periods: 1) the 6 months prior to implementation of each demonstration  and 2) the start of implementation of each demonstration through March  2017, the month for which the most recent reliable data were available at  the time of our analysis. We analyzed these data separately for three  groups of states: initial demonstration states (states that were part of the  initial implementation), expansion demonstration states (states added  after the initial implementation of the demonstration), and non- demonstration states (states that were never part of the demonstration).  We calculated average monthly expenditures by state for each of the  three groups of states. We then estimated potential savings by comparing  average monthly expenditures before and after implementation in initial  and expansion demonstration states. For the power mobility device  demonstration, we also estimated potential savings from reduced  expenditures in non-demonstration states, since CMS officials stated that  savings may occur in all states\u2014even those not part of the  demonstration\u2014in part because they think that larger nationwide  suppliers could have improved their compliance with CMS policies in all  states based on their experiences with prior authorization. Finally, we  analyzed the effect of prior authorization over time by determining the  percentage of the total reduction in expenditures that took place in the  first 6 months of implementation for each demonstration. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of these data on CMS\u2019s Medicare  expenditures; however, we checked these data for obvious errors and  omissions, compared analyses results to CMS\u2019s publicly reported  information about expenditures, and interviewed CMS officials to resolve  any identified discrepancies. On the basis of these actions, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  reporting objectives. We also interviewed CMS officials and reviewed  CMS documents, such as CMS\u2019s annual program integrity report, to  identify other program integrity efforts that may have affected  expenditures.", "To identify reported benefits and challenges of prior authorization, we  interviewed multiple stakeholders. First, we interviewed a non- generalizable sample of officials from nine Medicare beneficiary and  provider and supplier groups to learn about their experiences with  Medicare prior authorization, including challenges they faced and their  views on program benefits. Second, we interviewed officials from CMS  and the six Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that administer  the Medicare prior authorization programs about program benefits and  challenges implementing and conducting the programs. When possible,  we reviewed relevant documentation, such as the prior authorization  programs\u2019 operational guides, to corroborate information reported by  stakeholders. Third, we interviewed a sample of four private health  insurers and two associations that represent health insurers about their  experiences with prior authorization. To identify private health insurers,  we considered which insurers had the greatest market share among large  group insurers in states with Medicare prior authorization programs and  which offered Medicare Advantage plans, as well as whether the insurer  had been discussed in stakeholder interviews as having particularly  relevant experience. We then compared CMS\u2019s efforts to mitigate  reported challenges to federal standards for internal controls related to  control activities.", "To determine the monitoring CMS conducts of prior authorization and its  plans for future prior authorization, we obtained and reviewed CMS and  Medicare contractor documents including Federal Register notices,  proposed and final rules, and CMS prior authorization demonstration  status updates.

Medicare covers  hyperbaric oxygen therapy for certain conditions, such as diabetic  wounds of the lower extremities, after there have been 30 days of no  measurable signs of healing during standard wound care treatment.  According to CMS, previous experience indicates that hyperbaric oxygen  therapy has a high potential for improper payments and raises concerns  about beneficiaries receiving medically unnecessary care.

This program aims to  reduce unnecessary utilization for certain DMEPOS items. To select the  items that would be subject to prior authorization, CMS compiled a Master  List of items that 1) appear on the DMEPOS Fee Schedule list, 2) have  an average purchase fee of $1,000 or greater (adjusted annually for  inflation) or an average rental fee schedule of $100 or greater (adjusted  annually for inflation), and 3) meet one of these two criteria: the item was  identified in a GAO or HHS Office of Inspector General report that is  national in scope and published in 2007 or later as having a high rate of  fraud or unnecessary utilization, or the item is listed in the 2011 or later  published Comprehensive Error Rate Testing program\u2019s annual report.  CMS may choose specific items from this Master List to include on the  required prior authorization list, and there is no set end date for requiring  prior authorization for those items. CMS may suspend prior authorization  for those items at any time. (See app. I for the items on the Master List.)  In March 2017, CMS began requiring prior authorization for two types of  group 3 power wheelchairs from the Master List for beneficiaries with a  permanent address in selected states (Illinois, Missouri, New York, and  West Virginia) and expanded the program nationwide in July 2017.

This increase is due to including non-demonstration states  in the analysis and changing the assumptions for expanded  demonstration states in the analysis.

For  example,  in September 2011, CMS began revalidating providers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019  enrollment in Medicare to ensure that they continue to be eligible to  bill Medicare. Revalidation involves confirming that the provider or  supplier continues to meet Medicaid program requirements, including  ensuring that a provider or supplier does not employ or contract with  individuals who have been excluded from participation in federal  health care programs. We previously reported that screening all  providers and suppliers\u2014not just the ones subject to prior  authorization\u2014resulted in over 23,000 new applications being denied  or rejected and over 703,000 existing enrollment records being  deactivated or revoked from March 2011 through December 2015.  We also reported that CMS estimated the revised process avoided  $2.4 billion in total Medicare payments to ineligible providers and  suppliers from March 2011 to May 2015, some of which may have  been payments for items and services subject to prior authorization.  in July 2013, CMS implemented moratoria on enrollment of new  providers for home health services and for repetitive, scheduled non- emergency ambulance transport in select counties. As of January  2018, CMS had extended the home health services moratoria  statewide to Florida, Illinois, Michigan, and Texas and the repetitive,  scheduled non-emergency ambulance transport moratoria statewide  to Pennsylvania and New Jersey. During a moratorium, no new  applications to enroll as a billing provider of the affected service types  are reviewed or approved. In October 2017, CMS officials said that  home health and non-emergency ambulance services\u2019 expenditures  may have been affected by provider enrollment moratoria.", "Certain durable medical equipment pricing, payments, and  education and outreach: CMS has taken steps to change how certain  durable medical equipment is paid for and to provide ongoing durable  medical equipment education and outreach. For example,  in January 2011, CMS implemented a DMEPOS competitive bidding  program required by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,  and Modernization Act of 2003. Under the program, only  competitively selected contract suppliers can furnish certain durable  medical equipment items at competitively determined prices to  Medicare beneficiaries in designated areas. CMS began the program  in 9 of the largest metropolitan areas, and in July 2013 expanded to  an additional 100 large metropolitan areas. In January 2016, CMS  implemented competitive bidding program-based adjusted prices for  non-designated areas for durable medical equipment items that were  previously, or are currently, included in the competitive bidding  program. According to CMS, the program\u2014which generally results in  lower competitively bid prices\u2014is reducing expenditures for  approximately half of the beneficiaries receiving power mobility  devices nationwide. We have previously reported that prices  decreased for power mobility devices in the competitive bidding  program; some of these devices are also subject to prior  authorization.  in January 2011, CMS eliminated the lump sum purchase option for  standard power wheelchairs. This change reduced expenditures for  power wheelchairs used on a short-term basis because payments for  short-term rentals are lower than for the purchase of these items. durable medical equipment MACs and CMS provide continuous  DMEPOS education and outreach.

For example, CMS has created e-clinical templates for home  health services and power mobility devices that can be incorporated into  progress notes to help ensure physicians meet medical necessity  requirements. CMS and the MACs have also created documentation  checklists, prior authorization coversheets, and other tools to assist  providers and suppliers in verifying that they have obtained the  documentation necessary to meet CMS\u2019s documentation requirements.

Some MAC  representatives said that having a phone conversation with suppliers  allows them to resolve non-affirmations more expediently and reduces the  number of resubmissions. Representatives from one MAC estimated that  when they call providers and suppliers, they are able to resolve 50 to 80  percent of the issues that led to the non-affirmations. Several MAC  representatives also said calling helps providers and suppliers gain a  better understanding of CMS\u2019s documentation requirements, which will  increase their likelihood of having future requests provisionally affirmed.

Therefore, if an essential accessory does not meet  medical necessity requirements, a MAC will deny a prior authorization  request for a power wheelchair base.
