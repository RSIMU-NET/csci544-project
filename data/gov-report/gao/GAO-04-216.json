The act included reforms intended to strengthen auditor independence and to improve audit quality. Mandatory audit firm rotation (setting a limit on the period of years a public accounting firm may audit a particular company's financial statements) was considered as a reform to enhance auditor independence and audit quality during the congressional hearings that preceded the act, but it was not included in the act. The Congress decided that mandatory audit firm rotation needed further study and required GAO to study the potential effects of requiring rotation of the public accounting firms that audit public companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The arguments for and against mandatory audit firm rotation concern whether the independence of a public accounting firm auditing a company's financial statements is adversely affected by a firm's long-term relationship with the client and the desire to retain the client. Concerns about the potential effects of mandatory audit firm rotation include whether its intended benefits would outweigh the costs and the loss of company-specific knowledge gained by an audit firm through years of experience auditing the client. In addition, questions exist about whether the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements for reform will accomplish the intended benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation. In surveys conducted as part of our study, GAO found that almost all of the largest public accounting firms and Fortune 1000 publicly traded companies believe that the costs of mandatory audit firm rotation are likely to exceed the benefits. Most believe that the current requirements for audit partner rotation, auditor independence, and other reforms, when fully implemented, will sufficiently achieve the intended benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation. Moreover, in interviews with other stakeholders, including institutional investors, stock market regulators, bankers, accountants, and consumer advocacy groups, GAO found the views of these stakeholders to be consistent with the overall views of those who responded to its surveys. GAO believes that mandatory audit firm rotation may not be the most efficient way to strengthen auditor independence and improve audit quality considering the additional financial costs and the loss of institutional knowledge of the public company's previous auditor of record, as well as the current reforms being implemented. The potential benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation are harder to predict and quantify, though GAO is fairly certain that there will be additional costs. Several years' experience with implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's reforms is needed, GAO believes, before the full effect of the act's requirements can be assessed. GAO therefore believes that the most prudent course of action at this time is for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of existing requirements for enhancing auditor independence and audit quality. GAO believes audit committees, with their increased responsibilities under the act, can also play an important role in ensuring auditor independence. To fulfill this role, audit committees must maintain independence and have adequate resources. Finally, for any system to function effectively, there must be incentives for parties to do the right thing, adequate transparency over what is being done, and appropriate accountability if the right things are not done."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Full, fair, and accurate reporting of financial information by public  companies is critical to the effective functioning of the capital and credit  markets in the United States.

The act\u2019s requirements included reforms to strengthen  corporate responsibility for financial reports and auditor independence and  created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

There has long been an arguably inherent conflict in the  fact that an auditor is paid by the public company for which the audit was  being performed.  Various study groups over the past 20 years have  considered the independence and objectivity of auditors as questions have  arisen from (1) significant litigation involving auditors, (2) the auditor\u2019s  performance of nonaudit services for audit clients, which prior to the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, had risen to 50 percent of total revenues on average  for the large accounting firms, (3) \u201copinion shopping\u201d by clients, and   (4) reports of public accountants advocating questionable client positions  on accounting matters.", "The major accountability breakdowns at Enron and WorldCom, and other  failures in recent years such as Qwest, Tyco, Adelphia, Global Crossing,  Waste Management, Micro Strategy, Superior Federal Savings Bank, and  Xerox, led to the reforms contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to enhance  auditor independence and audit quality and to restore investor confidence  in the nation\u2019s capital markets.  To enhance auditor independence and audit  quality, the act\u2019s reforms included  establishing the PCAOB, as an independent  nongovernmental entity, to  oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities  laws;  making the PCAOB responsible for (1) establishing auditing and related  attestation, quality control, ethics, and independence standards  applicable to audits of public companies, (2) conducting inspections,  investigations, and disciplinary proceedings of public accounting firms  registered with the PCAOB, and (3) imposing appropriate sanctions;  making the public company\u2019s audit committee responsible for the  appointment, compensation, and oversight of the registered public  accounting firm;  requiring management and auditors\u2019 reports on internal control over   prohibiting the registered public accounting firm from providing certain  nonaudit services to a public company if the auditor is also providing  audit services;  requiring the audit committee to preapprove all audit and nonaudit  services not otherwise prohibited;  requiring mandatory rotation of lead and reviewing audit partners after  they have provided audit services to a particular public company for 5  consecutive years; and  prohibiting the public accounting firm from providing audit services if  the public company\u2019s chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, or  any person serving in an equivalent position was employed by the firm  and participated in the audit of the public company during the 1-year  period preceding the date of starting the audit.", "Mandatory audit firm rotation was also discussed in congressional hearings  to enhance auditor independence and audit quality, but given the mixed  views of various stakeholders, the Congress decided the effects of such a  practice needed further study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pros and Cons of Requiring Mandatory Audit Firm Rotation", "paragraphs": ["Our review of research studies, technical articles, and other publications  and documents showed that generally the arguments for and against  mandatory audit firm rotation concern auditor independence, audit  quality, and increased audit costs.

Further, many  Fortune 1000 public companies will only use Big 4 public accounting firms  and believe that the limited choices, that are likely to be further reduced by  the auditor independence requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, coupled  with the likely increased costs of financial statement audits and increased  risk of an audit failure under mandatory audit firm rotation strongly argue  against the need for mandatory rotation.", "In addition, most Tier 1 firms and Fortune 1000 public companies believe  that the pressures faced by the incumbent auditor to retain the client are  not a significant factor adversely affecting the auditor appropriately dealing  with financial reporting issues that may materially affect a public  company\u2019s financial statements.

According to our survey,  Fortune 1000 public companies\u2019 average auditor tenure is 22 years.  Two  contrasting factors greatly influence this 22-year average\u2014the recent  increased changes in auditors lowered the average and the long audit  tenure period associated with approximately 10 percent of Fortune 1000  public companies raised the average.  About 20 percent of the Fortune 1000  public companies had their current auditor of record for less than 3 years, a  rate of change in auditors over the last 2 years substantially greater than  the nearly 3 percent annual change rate historically observed.  This  increased rate of auditor change was driven largely by the recent  dissolution of Arthur Andersen LLP.  More than 80 percent of Fortune 1000  public companies that changed auditors over the last 2 years did so to replace Andersen.  Increasing the overall average audit tenure period for  Fortune 1000 public companies were the approximately 10 percent of  public companies that had the same auditing firm for more than 50 years  and have an average tenure period of more than 75 years.

Generally, the views expressed by these  knowledgeable individuals were consistent with the overall views  expressed by survey respondents.  Most did not favor implementing a  requirement for mandatory audit firm rotation at this time because they  believe the costs of implementing such a requirement outweigh the benefits  and greater experience with implementing the requirements of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act should be gained prior to adding new requirements.", "Many individuals acknowledged that conceptually, audit firm rotation  could provide certain benefits in the areas of auditor independence and  audit quality.  For example, audit firm rotation may increase the perception  of auditor independence because long-term relationships between the  auditor of record and the client that could undermine independence would  not likely develop under the limited term as auditor of record.  Some  individuals also believe that under mandatory audit firm rotation, the  auditor might be less likely to succumb to management pressure to accept  questionable accounting practices because the incentive to keep the client  is gone and another audit firm would be looking at the firm\u2019s work in the  future.  Some also believed that audit quality may also be increased through  a change in auditors because a new auditor of record would provide a  \"fresh look\" at an entity\u2019s financial reporting practices and accounting  policies.  In addition, some individuals noted that mandatory audit firm  rotation might cause a company to reexamine its audit needs and seek  more knowledgeable and experienced audit firm personnel when  negotiating for a new auditor of record.", "The individuals we spoke to, however, acknowledged a number of practical  concerns related to mandatory audit firm rotation, one of the most  important being the limited number of audit firms available from which to  choose.  For example, some companies, especially those with  geographically diverse operations or those operating in certain industries,  may be somewhat limited in the choice of auditing firms capable of  performing the audit.  Not all audit firms have offices or staff located in all  the geographic areas, whether domestically or internationally, where the  clients conduct their operations, nor do all audit firms have personnel with  certain industry knowledge to be able to perform audits of clients that  operate in specific environments.", "Similar to the views of Fortune 1000 public companies and audit committee  chairs, individuals we spoke to noted that large companies are often  limited to choices among the Big 4 firms.  In some cases, the choices are  further restricted because the accounting profession has become  segmented by industry, and a lack of industry-specific knowledge may  preclude some firms from performing the audits.  For a company that is  limited to use of Big 4 firms, it was viewed that selection may also be  restricted because an audit firm providing certain nonaudit services or  serving as a company\u2019s internal auditor is prohibited by independence rules  from also serving as that company\u2019s auditor of record.  In some cases, a  company may also be limited in its choice of firms if an audit firm audits  one of the company\u2019s major competitors and the public company decides  not to use that firm as its auditor of record.", "With regard to the use of a Big 4 firm, some individuals believe that  although a new auditor provides a \"fresh look\" at an audit engagement, the  Big 4 audit firms have somewhat similar cultures and methodologies for  performing audits, and as a result, the benefit of a \"fresh look\" is more  limited today than it was in the past when the firms had different cultures  and employed a greater variety of methodologies.", "Many individuals we spoke with also noted that when a change in auditor  of record occurs, a learning curve, which can last a year or more, exists  while the new auditor becomes familiar with the client\u2019s operations, thus  increasing the audit risk associated with the engagement.  Although a new  auditor provides a \"fresh look\" for the audit, concern was raised that a new  auditor may challenge the previous auditor\u2019s judgments in an overly  aggressive manner because the new auditor is not familiar with the client\u2019s  operations or accounting policies, and this poses a problem for the public  company because the previous auditor is not present to explain the  rationale for those judgments.  It was viewed that in some cases, these are  matters of professional judgment rather than actual errors and that such a  situation could result in increased tension between the client and new  auditor of record.", "Some individuals we spoke with expressed concern that if mandatory audit  firm rotation were implemented, the audit firm may rotate its most  qualified staff off the engagement during the later years of audit tenure  because the audit firm might focus its resources on obtaining or providing  services to new clients.  These individuals believe that such a practice  would increase audit risk, as did most Tier 1 firms and Fortune 1000 public  companies.  Some individuals also expressed concern that toward the end  of audit tenure, an audit firm might shift its attention to marketing nonaudit  services the firm could provide when it was no longer the auditor of record,  which may be counter to the intended benefits of mandatory audit firm  rotation.", "Individuals we spoke with also noted other implementation issues with  mandatory audit firm rotation.  For example, they viewed mandatory audit  firm rotation as increasing costs to a company, not only in terms of higher  audit fees but also in additional selection and support costs.  In particular,  many individuals we spoke with, as did most Tier 1 firms and Fortune 1000  public companies, believed that when a company rotates auditors, a certain  amount of disruption occurs and the company spends a significant amount  of resources\u2014both financial and human\u2014educating the new auditor about  company operations and accounting matters.  Individuals we spoke with  expressed concern not only that these additional audit, selection, and  support costs are ultimately passed on to shareholders but also that audit  committees may lose control of selecting the best auditors to provide the  best quality to shareholders since the incumbent firm would not be eligible  to compete to provide audit services for some period of time.", "Some individuals we spoke with noted that they have already observed a  heightened sense of corporate responsibility and better corporate  governance as a result of a change in behavior brought about by the large  corporate failures in recent years.  Overall, the majority of knowledgeable  individuals we spoke with believe that a requirement for mandatory audit  firm rotation should not be implemented at this time.  However, some  individuals suggested that regulators could require a change in the auditor  of record as an enforcement action if conditions warrant such a measure.   Most individuals we spoke with believe that the cost of requiring  mandatory audit firm rotation would exceed the benefits because of the  various practical concerns noted.  Rather, these individuals believe that  greater experience with the existing provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  should be gained and the results assessed before the need for the  mandatory audit firm rotation is considered.  Many individuals we spoke  with believe that individual Sarbanes-Oxley Act provisions, such as audit  firm partner rotation and the increased responsibilities of the audit  committee, are not a substitute for mandatory audit firm rotation, but taken  collectively, they could accomplish many of the same intended benefits of  mandatory audit firm rotation to improve auditor independence and audit  quality.  For example, some individuals believe that the existing Sarbanes- Oxley Act provisions related to audit committees have already resulted in  more time spent on audit committee activities and greater contact and  frequency of meetings with auditors.  These individuals commented that  audit committees now ask more questions of auditors because of a  heightened sense of accountability for the performance, accuracy,  reliability, and integrity of everything the independent auditors are doing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Groups Views on Implementing Mandatory Audit Firm Rotation if Required and Other Alternatives for Enhancing Audit Quality", "paragraphs": ["If mandatory audit firm rotation were required a number of implementing  factors affecting the structure of the requirement would need to be decided  by policy makers (e.g., the Congress and regulators).

The most notable exception involved the  practice in which an audit committee would hire an auditor of record on a  noncancelable multiyear basis, for which most Fortune 1000 public  companies and their audit committee chairs reported that the practice  would have no benefit.  (See table 5 in app. III.)", "Regarding practices other than mandatory audit firm rotation that may  have potential value to enhance auditor independence and audit quality, the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides the PCAOB with the authority to set auditing  and related attestation, ethics, independence, and quality control standards  for registered public accounting firms and for conducting inspections to  determine compliance of each registered public accounting firm with the  rules of the PCAOB, the SEC, or professional standards in connection with  the performance of audits, the issuance of audit reports, and related  matters involving public companies.  In that respect, the PCAOB\u2019s  inspection program for registered public accounting firms could also  provide the PCAOB with the opportunity to provide a \u201cfresh look\u201d at the  auditor of record\u2019s performance regarding auditor independence and audit  quality.  For example, the inspections could include factors potentially  affecting auditor independence, such as length of the auditor\u2019s tenure,  partners or managers of the audit firm who recently left the firm and are  now employed by the public company in financial reporting roles, and  nonaudit services provided by the auditor of record, as suggested by the  Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise in  its January 9, 2003, report.  Also, the inspections could consider the  auditor\u2019s work in high-risk areas of the public company\u2019s operations and  related financial reporting.  Further, the inspections can serve to provide  some degree of transparency of their overall results and enforcement of  PCAOB and SEC requirements that may be useful for audit committees to  consider."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Auditor Experience in Restatements of annual Financial Statements Filed with the SEC for 2001 and 2002", "paragraphs": ["With the dissolution of Arthur Andersen LLP in 2002, Tier 1 firms reported  replacing Anderson, as auditor of record, for more than 1,200 public  company clients since December 31, 2001.  Such volume of change in  auditors provided an unprecedented opportunity to gain some actual  experience with the potential value of the \u201cfresh look\u201d provided by a new  auditor.  Since many of these public companies had to replace Andersen as  their auditor of record during 2002, the number of changes in their auditor  of record effectively represented a partial form of mandatory audit firm  rotation.  We identified all annual restatements of financial statements filed  on a Form 10-KA and any annual restatements included in an annual Form  10K filing with the SEC by Fortune 1000 public companies for 2001 and  2002 through August 31, 2003, and focused on which restatements were  attributable to errors or fraud where the previous financial statements did  not comply with GAAP and identified whether there was a change in the  auditor of record.", "We found that 28, or 2.9 percent, of the 960 Fortune 1000 public companies  changed their auditor of record during 2001, and 204, or 21.3 percent, of the  companies changed their auditor during 2002.  The significant increase  from 2001 through 2002 was primarily due to the dissolution of Andersen.   Our analysis showed that the Fortune 1000 public companies filed 43  restatements during those 2 years that were due to errors or fraud.  The  financial statements affected ranged from years 1997 to 2002.  The  misstatement rates of these public companies\u2019 previously issued  statements of net income ranged from a 6.7 percent overstatement of net  income for 2000 to a 37.0 percent understatement of net loss for 2001.", "The restatement rates due to errors or fraud among the 43 Fortune 1000  public companies that changed their auditor of record were 10.7 percent in  2001 and 3.9 percent in 2002 compared to restatement rates of 2.5 percent  in 2001 and 1.2 percent in 2002 for companies that did not change auditors.   Although the data indicate that the overall restatement rate is  approximately 4.5 times higher for 2001 and 3.25 times higher for 2002 for  the companies that changed their auditor of record as compared to those  companies that did not change auditors, caution should be taken as further  analysis would be needed to determine whether the restatements are  associated with the \u201cfresh look\u201d attributed to mandatory audit firm  rotation.  In that respect, for the majority of the restatements, the public  information filed with the SEC and included in the SEC\u2019s Electronic Data  Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system did not provide  sufficient information to determine whether company management, the  auditor of record, or regulators identified the error or fraud, and in those  cases in which there was a change in the auditor of record, whether the  predecessor auditor or the successor auditor identified the problem and  whether it was identified before or after the change in auditor of record.   Also, the recent corporate financial reporting failures have greatly  increased the pressures on company management and their auditors  regarding honest, fair, and complete financial reporting.  See appendix IV  for additional details of our analysis.", "Regarding further analysis to determine whether restatements are  associated with the \u201cfresh look,\u201d we believe such additional future research  could potentially add value to better predict the benefits of mandatory  audit firm rotation and the future need for mandatory audit firm rotation.

Austria also reported that beginning in 2004,  mandatory audit firm rotation will be required for the auditor of record of  public companies.  Spain and Canada reported that they previously had  mandatory audit firm rotation requirements.  Generally, reasons reported  for requiring mandatory audit firm rotation related to auditor  independence, audit quality, or increased competition for providing audit  services.  Reasons for abandoning the requirements for mandatory audit  firm rotation related to its lack of cost-effectiveness, cost, and having  achieved the objective of increased competition for audit services.

In that respect, the SEC\u2019s regulations to implement the  auditor independence and audit quality requirements of the act have only  recently been issued, and the PCAOB is in the process of implementing its  inspection program.  Therefore, we believe it will take at least several years  to gain some experience with the effectiveness of the act\u2019s requirements  concerning auditor independence and audit quality.", "We believe that it is critical for both the SEC and the PCAOB, through its  oversight and enforcement programs, to formally monitor the effectiveness  of the regulations and programs intended to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act.  This information will be valuable in considering whether changes,  including mandatory audit firm rotation, may be needed to further protect  the public interest.  We noted that survey responses from Tier 1 firms show  that the potential for lawsuits or regulatory action is a major incentive for  the firms to appropriately deal with public company management in  resolving financial reporting issues.  We believe that the SEC\u2019s and  PCAOB\u2019s rigorous enforcement of regulations and other requirements will  be critical to the effectiveness of the act\u2019s requirements.", "It is clear that the likely additional costs associated with mandatory  rotation have influenced the views of Tier 1 firms and Fortune 1000 public  companies and their audit committee chairs to not support mandatory  rotation.  However, we believe that these additional costs need to be  balanced with the need to protect the public interest, especially  considering the recent significant accountability breakdowns and their  impact on investors and other interested parties.  Although expecting to  have zero financial reporting/audit failures is not a realistic expectation,  Enron, WorldCom, and others have recently demonstrated that a single  financial reporting/audit failure of a major public company can have  significant consequences to shareholders and other interested parties.  We  believe it is fairly certain that mandatory audit firm rotation would result in  selection costs and additional support costs for public companies.  Also,  most Tier 1 firms and Fortune 1000 public companies believe that  mandatory audit firm rotation would also result in higher audit fees,  primarily due to higher initial years\u2019 audit costs.", "If public accounting firms under mandatory audit firm rotation have (1) a  shorter tenure as auditor of record to recover higher initial year audit costs  and (2) fewer opportunities to also sell nonaudit services due to the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements concerning prohibited nonaudit services,  then we believe it is reasonable to assume, as public accounting firms and  public companies have done, that the higher initial year audit costs  associated with a new auditor are likely to be passed on to the public  companies, along with increased marketing costs.  However, competition  among public accounting firms for providing audit services should to some  extent also affect audit fees.  Therefore, we believe it is uncertain at this  time how these dynamics would play out in the market for audit services  and their effect on audit fees over the long term.  However, if intensive  price competition were to occur, the expected benefits of mandatory audit  firm rotation could be adversely affected if audit quality suffers due to audit  fees that do not support an appropriate level of audit work.", "We believe that mandatory audit firm rotation may not be the most efficient  way to enhance auditor independence and audit quality, considering the  costs of changing the auditor of record and the loss of auditor knowledge  that is not carried forward to the new auditor.  We also believe that the  potential benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation are harder to predict  and quantify while we are fairly certain there will be additional costs.  In  that respect, mandatory audit firm rotation is not a panacea that totally  removes pressures on the auditor in appropriately resolving financial  reporting issues that may materially affect the public companies\u2019 financial  statements.  Those pressures are likely to continue even if the term of the  auditor is limited under any mandatory rotation process.  Furthermore,  most public companies will only use the Big 4 firms for their auditor of  record for a variety of reasons, including the firms\u2019 having sufficient  industry knowledge and resources to audit their companies and  expectations of the capital markets to use Big 4 firms.  These public  companies may only have 1 or 2 choices for their auditor of record under  any mandatory rotation system.  However, over time a mandatory audit  firm rotation requirement may result in more firms transitioning into  additional industry sectors if the market for such audits has sufficient  profit margins.", "The current environment has greatly increased the pressures from  regulators and investors on public company management and public  accounting firms to have financial statements issued by public companies  that comply with GAAP and provide full disclosure.  These pressures and  the reforms of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provide incentives to have financial  reporting that is honest, fair, and complete and that serves the public  interest.  If such reporting is widely and consistently achieved then the  likelihood of the \u201cfresh look\u201d serving to identify financial reporting issues  that may materially affect financial statements that were either overlooked  or not appropriately dealt with by the previous auditor of record will be  reduced.  However, it is uncertain at this time if the current climate and  pressures for accurate and complete financial reporting and for restoring  public trust will be sustained over the long term.", "Regarding the need for mandatory audit firm rotation, we believe the most  prudent course at this time is for the SEC and the PCAOB to monitor and  evaluate the effectiveness of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s requirements for  enhancing auditor independence and audit quality, and ultimately restoring  investor confidence.  In that respect, the PCAOB\u2019s inspection program for  registered public accounting firms could also provide an opportunity to  provide a \u201cfresh look,\u201d which would enhance auditor independence and  audit quality through the program\u2019s inspection activities, and may provide  new insights regarding (1) public companies\u2019 financial reporting practices  that pose a high risk of issuing materially misstated financial statements for  the audit committees to consider and (2) possibly either using the auditor  of record or another firm to assist in reviewing these areas.  In addition,  future research on the potential benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation  as suggested by our analysis of restatements of financial statements may  also be valuable to consider along with the evaluations of the effectiveness  of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.", "Further, we also believe that currently audit committees, with their  increased responsibilities under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, can play a very  important role in enhancing auditor independence and audit quality.  In that  respect, the Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private  Enterprise in its January 9, 2003, report stated that auditor rotation is a  useful tool for building shareholder confidence in the integrity of the audit  and of the company\u2019s financial statements.  The commission advocated that  audit committees consider rotating audit firms when there are  circumstances that could call into question the audit firm\u2019s independence  from management.  The circumstances that merited consideration included  when (1) significant nonaudit services are provided to the company by the  auditor of record (even if they have been approved by the audit  committee), (2) one or more former partners or managers of the audit firm  are employed by the company, or (3) lengthy tenure of the auditor of  record, such as over 10 years\u2014which our survey results show is prevalent  at many Fortune 1000 public companies.  In such cases, we believe audit  committees need to be especially vigilant in the oversight of the auditor and  in considering whether a \u201cfresh look\u201d is warranted.  We also believe that if  audit committees regularly evaluate whether audit firm rotation would be  beneficial, given the facts and circumstances of their companies\u2019 situation,  and are actively involved in helping to ensure audit independence and audit  quality, many of the intended benefits of audit firm rotation could be  realized at the initiative of the audit committee rather than through a  mandatory requirement.", "However, audit committees need to have access to adequate resources,  including their own budgets, to be able to operate with the independence  necessary to effectively perform their responsibilities under the Sarbanes- Oxley Act.  Further, we believe that an audit committee\u2019s ability to operate  independently is directly related to the independence of the public  company\u2019s board of directors.  It is not realistic to believe that audit  committees will unilaterally resolve financial reporting issues that  materially affect a public company\u2019s financial statements without vetting  those issues with the board of directors.  Also, the ability of the board of  directors to operate independently may also be affected in corporate  governance structures where the public company\u2019s chief executive officer  also serves as the chair of the board of directors.  Like audit committees,  boards of directors also need to be independent and to have adequate  resources and access to independent attorneys and other advisors when  they believe it is appropriate.

Therefore, we  coordinated with the AICPA to establish a population of public accounting  firms that would most likely register with the PCAOB.  The AICPA provided  a complete list of the more than 1,100 public accounting firms that were  registered with the AICPA\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission Practice  Section (SECPS) as of January 2003.  Prior to the restructuring of the  SECPS, AICPA bylaws required that all members that engage in the  practice of public accounting with a firm auditing one or more SEC clients  join the SECPS.  Public accounting firms that did not have any SEC clients  could join the SECPS voluntarily.  Based on the information submitted in  their 2001 annual reports, these SECPS member firms collectively had  nearly 15,000 SEC clients.

The overall  restatement rates are higher in 2001 than the comparable levels of  restatements observed in 2002.  This may be due to the fact that our  analysis was limited to restatements submitted to the SEC on Form 10-KA  filings for 2001 and 2002 through August 31, 2003.  Some of the Fortune  1000 public companies that had not filed restatements with the SEC as of  August 31, 2003, may still do so in the future.   Additionally, because some  companies may require considerable amounts of time and effort to unravel  complex accounting and financial reporting issues (e.g., WorldCom, which  is in the process of working its way out of bankruptcy proceedings, and the  Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac,  which is working to restate 3 years of previously issued financial  statements), it is reasonable to expect that additional restatements will be  included in Form 10-KAs or other filings that had not been submitted to the  SEC as of August 31, 2003.", "Financial statement restatements filed for changes in accounting principles  or changes in organizational business structure (e.g., stock splits, mergers  and acquisitions), reclassifications, or compliance with SEC reporting  requirements, referred to as \u201crules based changes,\u201d are not necessarily  indications of compromised audit quality or auditor independence.   However, financial statement restatements due to errors or fraud raise  doubt about the integrity of management\u2019s financial reporting practices, the  quality of the audits, and the auditor\u2019s independence.  Therefore, the  following focus of our analysis was on annual financial statement  restatements (hereinafter referred to as \u201crestatements\u201d) due to errors or  fraud.", "The rate of restatement due to errors or fraud for Fortune 1000 public  companies that changed auditors were 10.7 percent in 2001 and 3.9 percent  in 2002 compared to restatement rates due to errors or fraud of 2.5 percent  in 2001 and 1.2 percent in 2002 for companies that did not change auditors.   Although the data indicate that the overall restatement rate is  approximately four times higher in 2001 and three times higher in 2002 for  those Fortune 1000 public companies that changed auditors than for those  companies that did not change auditors, caution should be exercised as  further analysis would be needed in order to determine whether the  restatements are associated with the \u201cfresh look\u201d of the new auditor  attributed to mandatory audit firm rotation.  In that respect, in some cases  we were able to determine from our review of the Form 10-KAs, any related  Form 8-Ks, and the results of Internet news searches, that the restatements  were identified as a result of an SEC investigation or an enforcement  action.  However, for the majority of the restatements we identified, the  information included in the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system did not provide sufficient  information to ascertain whether company management, and in those  cases where there was a change in auditor, the predecessor auditor, or the  successor auditor identified the error or fraud and whether it was identified  before or after the change in auditor.
