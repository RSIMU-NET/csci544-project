Instead, the focus of federal programs is on providing affordable access to homeownership, including through grants, loans, and mortgage insurance or guarantees.

For example,  homeownership can build wealth through the accumulation and  appreciation of home equity\u2014the difference between the value of a home  and the amount owed on the mortgage.

Homeowners also could lose money on their home if  they sold it shortly after purchasing because principal reduction in the  initial years of a mortgage is relatively small and the benefit of any home  value appreciation would be limited. Additionally, selling a home incurs  transaction costs, such as realtor commissions. To avoid losing money on  a home sale, homeowners would need to sell their home at an amount  higher than their purchase price plus transactions costs. For example, if a  homeowner buys a home for $250,000 (all fees included) and plans to  sell it 3 years later, assuming transaction costs of 10 percent (or  $25,000), the homeowner would have to sell the home for at least  $275,000 to break even, meaning an annual appreciation in home value  of more than 3 percent.

For  example, under QM requirements borrowers generally cannot exceed a  maximum monthly debt-to-income ratio of 43 percent, unless the loan is  eligible for sale to an enterprise.

The borrower\u2019s fixed  monthly payment would be fully amortizing and be calculated based on  prevailing rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the time of loan  origination. But the interest portion of the payment due to the lender  would be separately calculated each month, based on a rate derived from  COFI plus a gross margin to account for lenders\u2019 costs and insurance risk  premiums. Each month, the difference between the borrower\u2019s fixed  payment and interest due the lender based on the COFI rate plus a gross  margin would determine if any funds from the borrower\u2019s payment would  be added to the equity savings account.", "The funds allocated to the equity savings account are designed to be  used to pay down the principal. However, the ways in which the home  equity funds could be used to pay down mortgage principal depend on  the terms of each loan. If the home equity account were depleted, lenders  might cover any payment shortfalls and seek insurance reimbursements.  In addition, the accelerated equity-building effect of the Fixed-COFI  mortgage product would rely on the historical difference between the  COFI rate and 30-year fixed rate (see fig. 5). If the difference between the  rates narrowed, the savings allocated to the equity savings account would  lessen, and equity-building effects would be reduced. That is, in months  in which the COFI rate plus the gross margin was lower than the 30-year  fixed rate used to calculate the monthly payments, the difference between  the COFI-based and fixed amounts would be deposited into a home  equity savings account. In months in which the fixed payment would not  cover the interest payment (because the COFI rate plus the gross margin  is higher than the 30-year fixed rate used to calculate the fixed monthly  payment), funds could be withdrawn from the equity savings account to  cover any shortfall. If the equity savings account had a zero balance, the  lender could seek an insurance payout.", "According to the economists, some details of the Fixed-COFI contract can  be modified for different rules concerning refinancing and savings. For  example, a borrower and a lender can agree to how and when funds in  the home equity savings account could be applied to pay down the  mortgage principal. However, the Fixed-COFI mortgage contract would  place limits on a borrower\u2019s options to refinance\u2014for instance, only in the  case of the loss of a job\u2014because it is designed to protect borrowers and  lenders from fluctuations in interest rates.", "If interest rates drop significantly, benefits from the rate decrease for a  borrower with a Fixed-COFI mortgage would be limited as compared with  the benefits of a borrower with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage who  refinances. For example, the additional savings from lower interest rates  for the borrower with a Fixed-COFI mortgage could only be used to pay  down the mortgage principal. In contrast, although refinancing has costs,  borrowers with a traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would be able to  refinance to take advantage of the lower rate and reduce their monthly  payment. They could use the resulting difference in monthly payments  from the new, refinanced loan to pay down mortgage principal, build up  savings, or for any other purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advantages of Accelerated Home Equity Building Include a Financial Safeguard", "paragraphs": ["For some homeowners, building home equity faster can provide financial  benefits. Home equity can serve as a financial asset to fund retirement,  education expenses, or absorb financial emergencies like the loss of a  job. All else being equal, having more home equity also can help sustain  homeownership through a downturn in the housing market. For example,  default rates are generally higher for loans with higher loan-to-value (LTV)  ratios.", "Although some accelerated equity-building options are designed to be  originated with high LTV ratios (in some cases exceeding 100 percent),  the accelerated equity-building effect can lower the LTV ratio at a faster  pace than for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. As shown in figure 6,  according to our analysis, LTV ratios can converge after about 5 years for  a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage with a high LTV and a 30-year fixed-rate  mortgage with a higher down payment. More specifically, in about 5 years  a 15-year fixed-rate loan with an LTV ratio of 103 percent at origination  will reach the same LTV ratio as a 30-year fixed-rate loan with an LTV  ratio of 80 percent at origination. Borrowers under both mortgage  scenarios would have accrued close to 30 percent equity in about 5  years, assuming no change in the home\u2019s value.", "Lenders and proponents of accelerated equity building with whom we  spoke said that having substantial equity in a home provides more  options for remediation in the event the homeowner encounters difficulties  making mortgage payments. For instance, a lender with whom we spoke  said that having more equity in a home provides a borrower with a better  opportunity to refinance to get a better interest rate and also extend their  loan term, both of which would lower their monthly payment. Two lenders  with whom we spoke also said that accelerated equity-building options  can provide financial discipline and serve as a forced savings mechanism  by, for example, paying additional principal on the mortgage. In addition,  proponents of accelerated equity building have suggested that  homeowners with more equity at stake may have more incentive to stay  in their home because they have more invested in the home.", "In addition to building equity, borrowers with shorter-term mortgages or  those opting to make extra payments on 30-year mortgages would reduce  overall loan expenditures\u2014relative to the interest they would pay on a 30- year loan (see fig. 7).

For example, a private mortgage insurer for  WBHLs requires a minimum credit score of 680, compared with the  minimum for the state housing finance agency of 640 for 30-year fixed- rate mortgages.

As we  previously reported, although QM regulations are not expected to  significantly affect the overall mortgage market, some researchers have  estimated that QM regulations could adversely affect certain lower- income home buyers, particularly those living in high-cost areas.

For the same loan amount,  the monthly payments of a 15-year mortgage can be more than 40  percent greater than the monthly payments of a 30-year mortgage,  depending upon the current market interest rates. The higher monthly payments may make shorter-term loans unaffordable for many low- income home buyers or leave borrowers with less discretionary income to  cover other obligations, including paying off higher-interest debt, putting  some of them at greater risk of defaulting on monthly mortgage  payments.", "The higher monthly payments of shorter-term loans thus reduce  homeowners\u2019 financial flexibility. In contrast, experts and stakeholders  highlighted the greater flexibility a 30-year mortgage affords homeowners,  including for situations where individuals may experience instability or  fluctuations in their income. For example, though some home buyers may  have adequate income over the course of a year to afford monthly  mortgage payments, fluctuations in monthly income can affect a  homeowner\u2019s ability to sustain a higher monthly mortgage payment.  However, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage may enable a homeowner to  make additional payments to build equity faster and still maintain a lower  monthly payment than a 15-year mortgage.
