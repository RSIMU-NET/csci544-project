Excluding these subcontracts made the percentage of subcontracted dollars going to small businesses appear larger than it would have, if such subcontracts were not incorrectly excluded. If these subcontracts had been included, some contractors said it was likely they would have requested lower goals. (2) Even when all relevant subcontracts are included, the contractor-reported data can still overstate contractors' subcontracting achievements. Because a contractor could decide to subcontract only a small amount of its total federal contract, the portion of subcontracted dollars going to small businesses could, by comparison, appear misleadingly large. As a result, contractor-reported data is not useful to DOE in determining its contractors' actual small business subcontracting achievements or adequately assessing whether small businesses are receiving maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities. DOE has not taken adequate steps to address known problems with the contractor-reported data. Because the data showed that the department was meeting its subcontracting goals, DOE officials were not inclined to closely monitor contractors' practices for calculating their subcontracting goals and achievements. DOE officials were aware in 2002 that the contractors were not following federal guidelines on which subcontracts to include when developing goals. DOE's Small Business Office did provide clarifying information on the requirements, but DOE officials failed to ensure that the guidelines were being followed, and problems continued. In March 2005, DOE issued additional guidance, but it is uncertain whether DOE will ensure that the guidance is followed.

These contractors reported  exceeding their goals by as much as 28 percent, whereas the contractors  that reported falling short of their goals for that year did so by as much as  26 percent. Whether or not individual contractors achieved their goals, the  34 contractors collectively reported directing nearly $3.3 billion to small  business subcontractors in fiscal year 2004, representing a 27 percent  increase over the amount they had directed to small businesses in fiscal  year 2001 (see table 1). Additional information on the facility management  contractors\u2019 subcontracting goals and achievements for fiscal years 2001  through 2004 is presented in appendix I.", "Although facility management contractors generally reported exceeding  their subcontracting goals, the data are not useful for monitoring the  contractors\u2019 performance, because the contractors\u2019 achievements were  frequently overstated. When calculating subcontracting achievements,  SBA guidelines allow contractors to exclude from their calculations only  those subcontracts performed outside of the U.S. or its territories and  subcontracts with affiliate organizations, such as a subsidiary or parent  company. However, in fiscal year 2004, all 34 of the contractors\u2019 reported  achievements incorrectly excluded other types of subcontracts, beyond  what SBA guidelines allow (see table 2). The facility management  contractors we visited generally told us it was their normal practice to  make these types of exclusions. In making these types of exclusions, the  contractors said they were following their past practices or that DOE  contracting officers had approved the additional exclusions. For example,  officials representing one of these contractors pointed out that, in  excluding subcontracts from the calculation of their subcontracting  achievements beyond what SBA guidance allows, their company was  following the subcontracting plan approved by DOE. The contractor  officials said that they would not have made these exclusions, if DOE had  not permitted them, nor would they have negotiated as high a  subcontracting goal under those circumstances.", "Facility management contractors\u2019 practice of incorrectly excluding certain  subcontracts from achievement calculations resulted in overstating their  reported subcontracting achievements by making the achievements  appear larger than they would have appeared, if only the appropriate  exclusions had been made in the calculation. For SBA-reporting purposes,  contractors calculate their subcontracting achievements by expressing the  dollars that they directed to small business subcontracts as a percentage  of the total amount they subcontracted. However, because they incorrectly  excluded subcontracts that generally did not go to small businesses\u2014such  as subcontracts with other facility management contractors\u2014the facility  management contractors incorrectly reduced the total amount that was  subcontracted (the denominator), without affecting the total amount going  to small businesses (the numerator). As a result, the percentage of total  subcontracted dollars going to small businesses appeared larger than it  actually was.", "The effect of making incorrect exclusions on achievement calculations is  significant. At the 13 facility management contractors we visited, we  analyzed the fiscal year 2004 dollar amounts associated with the  subcontracts that were incorrectly excluded from the calculation of their  reported subcontracting achievements. These excluded subcontracts  totaled about $887 million. For these 13 contractors, the practice of  incorrectly excluding subcontracts from their reported achievements  resulted in overstating the percentage achievements by as much as 27  percent. Moreover, although 12 of the 13 contractors had appeared, from  their reported achievements, to be meeting or exceeding their  subcontracting goals, when the achievements were recalculated by adding  the incorrectly excluded subcontracts back into the calculation, only 4  contractors would have achieved their goals. The remaining 9 contractors  would have fallen short of their subcontracting goals, by as much as $31.1  million, or about 19 percent. According to contractor officials, it is also  likely that these contractors would not have agreed to as high of a  subcontracting goal, if they had to include these subcontracts (see table  3).", "The fiscal year 2004 small business subcontracting achievements reported  by many of the remaining 21 contractors that we did not visit during our  study also are likely overstated, although we did not document the extent  of the overstatement. Based on information these contractors reported to  us, all 21 contractors had incorrectly excluded subcontracts from the  calculations of fiscal year 2004 subcontracting achievements.

Rather, the method for  calculating small business subcontracting achievements is based on a  quantity determined by the facility management contractors\u2014namely, the  portion of total work under their DOE contract that they intend to  subcontract out. Thus, a contractor can appear to be performing well\u2014i.e.,  directing 80 percent of its subcontracting dollars to small businesses\u2014but  that percentage is not very informative about the actual amount of  subcontracting occurring with small businesses.", "In our view, calculating small business subcontracting achievements in  this manner invariably presents a misleading picture. For example, in  fiscal year 2004, contractors at two of DOE\u2019s weapons production facilities  reported substantially different small business subcontracting  achievements\u2014one reported directing 80 percent of its subcontracting  dollars to small businesses (or $92.6 million) while the other reported 57  percent (or $109.9 million). However, these percentages hide the fact that  the first contractor subcontracted out proportionally less of the work of  the facility management contract than the second contractor, despite the  fact that both facility management contracts were similar in size.  Recalculating the subcontracting achievements as a percentage of the  amount of funding directed by DOE to each facility management contract  for the year reveals that the actual subcontracting achievements were  quite similar\u201421 and 23 percent respectively of the contracts\u2019 annual  funding. Thus, the contractor that appeared, from the data that DOE uses,  to be significantly outperforming the other was actually devoting a slightly  smaller portion of its facility management contract dollars to small  business subcontracting.", "Recalculating the subcontracting achievement data as a percent of the  annual amount funded by DOE for each facility management contract  provides a very different picture of the contractors\u2019 performance. Some  contractors that appeared to be outperforming most other contractors  were ranked near the bottom of the list when their achievements were  measured as a percent of the annual funding on their contract. For  example, the reported subcontracting achievement in fiscal year 2004 of  the contractor at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory appeared to be  the second highest among the 34 contractors. However, after we  recalculated the achievements as a percentage of annual contract funding,  the contractor\u2019s performance dropped significantly to 28th out of 34  contractors (see table 4). Conversely, 6 of the 17 contractors that were in  the bottom half of the rankings of reported subcontracting achievements  moved to the top half, after we recalculated the achievements as a percent  of the annual amount funded on each facility management contract.", "While a contractor may be subcontracting a smaller percentage of its  facility management contract to small businesses than other facility  management contractors, there can be several reasons for differences in  contractors\u2019 small business subcontracting achievements, which should be  examined before concluding that a particular contractor is  underperforming. For example, DOE and contractor officials told us that  the type of work contractors perform at DOE sites is an important factor  in determining the potential for small business subcontracting. Our  analysis of the 34 facility management contractors\u2019 fiscal year 2004 small  business subcontracting achievements suggests that this may be true. We  found that the 16 contractors primarily involved in environmental cleanup  or weapons production at DOE sites generally directed a greater  percentage of their contracts\u2019 annual funding to small business  subcontracting than the 16 contractors at DOE research laboratories.  Contractor and DOE officials said that opportunities for small business  subcontractors tend to be more limited at research laboratories than other  types of DOE facilities, because research activities are often integrated,  and fragmenting those activities among several contractors could  negatively impact the work. Officials said that other types of work, such as  facility construction or cleanup projects, generally have more  subcontracting potential and can often be structured at such a scale that  small businesses could perform the work.", "Contract performance goals can also affect opportunities for small  business subcontracting. For example, small business subcontracting  opportunities diminished somewhat at an environmental cleanup site in  Oak Ridge, Tennessee, after DOE and the facility management contractor,  Bechtel Jacobs, renegotiated the contract to include more aggressive time  lines and cost limitations for completing the work. In response to the  changes in its contract, Bechtel Jacobs began subcontracting less of the  work, including work that small business subcontractors had previously  performed. DOE and contractor officials told us that the company wanted  more control over the work to better ensure meeting the new time lines  and cost limitations. Officials from local small businesses that subcontract  with Bechtel Jacobs said that while they did not disagree with Bechtel  Jacobs\u2019s strategy for dealing with the changes to its contract, the small  businesses had to adapt to a new business environment in which less  subcontracting work would be available under that facility management  contract.", "Although differences in the type of work and contract performance goals  may account for some of the differences in facility management  contractors\u2019 performance in small business subcontracting, there may be  other reasons for those differences. For example, contractor officials said  that the timing of projects or changes in the annual funding for a facility  management contract could affect opportunities for small businesses to  participate in work that is generally conducive to small business  subcontracting. In addition, contractors at sites with similar missions and  similar types of work can vary substantially in the amount of funding that  they direct to small business subcontractors. For example, contractors at  the Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico ranked  highly among the 34 facility management contractors\u20148th and 12th,  respectively\u2014in the percentage of their contracts\u2019 annual funding that  they directed to small businesses in fiscal year 2004. In contrast, the  contractor at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California,  which conducts work similar to that of the two New Mexico laboratories,  ranked much lower\u201427th among the 34 contractors. Contractor and DOE  officials with whom we met suggested reasons for such differences in  performances, for example, differences in the availability of small  businesses that are capable of providing the needed goods and services or  differences in the facility management contractors\u2019 commitment to  providing small businesses with the maximum practicable opportunity to  participate in the work.", "Furthermore, actions by DOE to increase its direct, or prime, contracting  with small businesses may reduce the subcontracting opportunities  available for small businesses. For example, in an effort to increase the  amount of prime contract dollars going to small businesses, in 2003, DOE  redirected around $30 million of work from the facility management  contract for managing and operating the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in  Louisiana and awarded it as a separate prime contract to a small business.  Before DOE redirected the work, a contractor official said that the facility  management contractor responsible for performing the work had been  subcontracting most of it to small businesses. The official further stated  that, as a result, DOE and the facility management contractor negotiated a  lower small business subcontracting goal for fiscal year 2004 of 27.7  percent of the total dollars subcontracted, representing a 21.3 percent  drop from the 49 percent goal at the end of fiscal year 2003. Although the  facility management contractor exceeded its subcontracting goal in fiscal  year 2004, the total dollars available for subcontracting decreased by  around 12 percent ($6.1 million), and the portion going to small businesses  decreased by 9.3 percent ($1.8 million).", "Because the subcontracting achievement data that DOE relies on does not  provide a true picture of the facility management contractors\u2019  performance in small business subcontracting, the department cannot  meaningfully use those data to monitor performance. Without data  providing a truer picture of contractors\u2019 performance, DOE lacks a basis  for knowing whether differences in performance truly exist. Moreover, the  department also lacks a basis for understanding whether differences in  performance are legitimate\u2014such as stemming from the types of work  performed under a facility management contract\u2014or are the result of  differences in contractors\u2019 level of commitment to small business  subcontracting.", "Having recognized potential weaknesses in contractor-reported  achievement data, at least one federal agency we contacted is taking a  more innovative approach for using data to monitor subcontracting  efforts. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), for  internal management purposes, calculates small business subcontracting  goals and achievements for its prime contractors as a percentage of the  annual funding for the prime contracts. NASA\u2019s small business office said  it uses this method to oversee contractor performance because it (1)  presents a truer picture of actual achievements and (2) provides a better  basis to evaluate a contractor\u2019s maximum practicable opportunity to  subcontract with small businesses. This office said the data the  contractors report to SBA can be misleading, in that a large percentage  achievement can be reported even though a relatively small amount of  dollars may actually be going to small business subcontracts.", "Although DOE continues to base its facility management contractors\u2019  subcontracting goals on the total dollars subcontracted, for at least one of  those contractors, the department\u2019s Environmental Management program  plans to use a small business subcontracting approach that is similar to  NASA\u2019s approach. During a recent solicitation for bids for an  environmental cleanup contract at the Hanford Site\u2019s River Corridor  Project in Washington State, the program\u2019s solicitation specified that the  winning bidder must subcontract 60 percent of work under the  approximately $2 billion contract, with half of that directed to small  businesses, or potentially about $600 million over the 7-year life of the  contract. According to proposal documents, Environmental Management  took this approach in part because of input from small businesses and  because it would better ensure that small businesses had an opportunity to  participate in a significant portion of the work under the contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Oversight of Small Business Subcontracting by Facility Management Contractors Was Not Adequate to Address Identified Problems with Contractor- Reported Data", "paragraphs": ["DOE had not taken adequate steps to address known problems with the  small business subcontracting achievement data reported by its facility  management contractors.

In April 2002, DOE\u2019s  Small Business Office provided clarifying information in an e-mail message  to small business program managers both in the DOE program offices and  the facility management contractors. The information emphasized the  importance of consistently following SBA guidelines. Although DOE  provided subsequent training for small business program managers, DOE  officials did not take adequate steps to ensure that the contractors were  correctly applying SBA guidelines. Based on our analysis of fiscal year  2004 subcontracting practices, none of the 34 facility management  contractors fully complied with the SBA guidelines.", "In some cases, DOE actually approved the incorrect reporting practices by  its facility management contractors. For example, we found 10 instances  where DOE had reviewed and approved subcontracting plans that  specifically called for incorrectly excluding subcontracts from the  calculations of small business subcontracting goals and achievements. In  two other cases, the facility management contractors specified incorrect  exclusions in annual planning documents for fiscal year 2004. DOE uses  these planning documents to evaluate overall contractor performance for  the year. DOE contracting officers told us that they had approved or  allowed the incorrect practices because they did not believe these  subcontracts could practically go to small businesses anyway. For  example, the facility management contractors may have had existing long- term subcontracts with large businesses to provide information  technology assistance, building maintenance, or other site support  services.", "Recent program reviews by DOE\u2019s Small Business Office were also not  sufficient to identify and rectify these incorrect practices. In September  2002, the Secretary directed the Small Business Office to develop a  strategic plan for providing maximum practicable opportunities to small  businesses, including subcontracting by facility management contractors.  As part of its May 2003 strategic plan, the Small Business Office stated that  it would periodically review the small business subcontracting efforts of  the facility management contractors. During fiscal year 2004, the Small  Business Office performed reviews of the small business subcontracting  programs at five of DOE\u2019s facility management contractors. These reviews  focused primarily on determining if the small business subcontracting  plans contained the information required by federal regulations and  whether the contractors met their annual small business subcontracting  goals. The reviews did not evaluate how the facility management  contractors were developing the annual small business subcontracting  goals or whether all appropriate subcontracts were included in the goal  and achievement calculations. DOE Small Business Office officials told us  that, based on the results of our work, they are considering revising their  review methodology to include these steps.", "In March 2005, near the end of our review, DOE and NNSA procurement  organizations issued additional guidance on small business contracting  goals. The guidance stressed that the accuracy of contractor-reported data  was vital to the credibility of the department\u2019s performance in small  business subcontracting. The guidance emphasized that, in calculating and  reporting small business subcontracting goals and achievements,  contractors could exclude only the subcontract types allowed by SBA  guidelines. The guidance further states that contracting officers shall  ensure that facility management contractors are aware of these  procedures and do not apply additional exclusions when developing their  subcontracting goals. However, given DOE\u2019s oversight of these practices  in the past, it remains to be seen whether DOE will now follow through  and ensure that facility management contractors comply with this  guidance.", "Errors in recognizing and rewarding contractor performance. DOE\u2019s  Small Business Office established a Secretarial Small Business Awards  program to recognize and acknowledge outstanding performance on an  annual basis. One of these awards\u2014the facility management contractor  small business achievement award\u2014is presented each year to the facility  management contractor with the highest percentage increase in  subcontract awards to small businesses from the previous year.", "We reviewed the facility management contractor small business  achievement awards DOE presented in fiscal years 2003 and 2004.  Although the fiscal year 2003 award appears to be appropriate, the fiscal  year 2004 award went to a facility management contractor who directed  fewer dollars to small businesses from one year to the next. Specifically,  the data DOE used to make the determination showed that the percentage  of subcontracting dollars going to small businesses increased from 61  percent in fiscal year 2002 to 66 percent in fiscal year 2003, a 5 percentage  point increase. However, during the same period, the total dollars  subcontracted by the facility management contractor dropped from $60.7  million to $52.1 million, and the subcontracting dollars directed to small  businesses dropped from $36.8 million to $34.4 million. If DOE had  measured the change in the contractor\u2019s small business subcontracting  achievements by comparing them with the annual funding on the facility  management contract, DOE officials would have discovered that the  contractor\u2019s performance actually declined by about 7 percent during the  period (from 19.7 percent of annual funding on the contract to 13.0  percent). DOE Small Business Office officials told us that they based this  award on increases in the percentage of subcontracting dollars going to  small businesses rather than changes in the total dollars directed to small  businesses. Officials said using changes in total dollars directed to small  businesses would not be fair to all the contractors because the facility  management contractors with multibillion dollar annual funding on their  contracts would have an advantage in showing increased dollars to small  businesses. While we agree that using dollars to compare the performance  among contractors could favor those with greater annual funding, relying  solely on the percentage of subcontracted dollars going to small  businesses may result in rewarding declining performance, as  demonstrated above.", "Undermined efforts to ensure maximum practicable opportunities for  small businesses. DOE\u2019s reliance on misleading data created an  environment in which DOE officials were not inclined to closely monitor  the small business subcontracting program. For example, DOE allowed  facility management contractors to incorrectly exclude subcontracts when  calculating their small business subcontracting achievements, which led to  the incorrect perception that they were achieving their subcontracting  goals. Without accurate and consistent data on the subcontracting efforts  of the facility management contractors, DOE has no way of determining  whether a facility management contractor is providing the maximum  practicable opportunity for small businesses.", "Another consequence of these program weaknesses is a perception among  members of the small business community that DOE\u2019s facility  management contractors could do better at providing opportunities for  meaningful subcontracting work. This perception has led to distrust and  criticism of DOE\u2019s facility management contractors by small business  associations and advocates. For example, during a May 2004 congressional  hearing on DOE\u2019s direct contracting with small businesses, small business  advocacy groups raised concerns about whether the level of  subcontracting by DOE facility management contractors reflected  maximum practicable opportunities. Additionally, small business  associations have expressed concerns about what they perceive as unfair  treatment by DOE facility management contractors, such as using small  business subcontractors to perform work that provides little opportunity  for the small business to develop technical capabilities. Small business  advocacy groups that we contacted said that if DOE held the facility  management contractors more accountable for achieving small business  subcontracting results, such as by using data that provided a truer picture  of actual performance, the small business groups would have a basis for  greater confidence in DOE\u2019s small business subcontracting program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight Responsibilities for the Small Business Subcontracting Program Were Not Clearly Defined or Integrated", "paragraphs": ["DOE officials did not address problems with the small business  subcontracting program, in part, because the various headquarters and  field organizations that must work together to provide oversight of the  small business subcontracting program did not do so effectively.

DOE contracting officers, usually located  at DOE field locations, have primary responsibility for communicating  with facility management contractors on all aspects of the contracts,  including the contractors\u2019 small business subcontracting efforts. DOE\u2019s  Small Business Office has the overall responsibility for managing the  department\u2019s small business programs and monitoring performance  toward meeting annual goals.

DOE guidance on the small business  program clearly defines only the roles of the contracting officer, which  include review of small business subcontracting plans, annual goals, and  reported achievements. The guidance also states that the contracting  officer is responsible for ensuring that facility management contractors  comply with the SBA guidelines on which subcontracts may be excluded  from their subcontracting goals and achievements. However, the guidance  does not clearly define roles or responsibilities for the Small Business  Office, small business program managers, or others who need to  coordinate their efforts to achieve department goals.

As  our report clearly demonstrated, the method can overstate the  performance of contractors that devote a relatively small portion of their  total contract to subcontracting. Thus, to ensure that DOE is providing the  maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities to small businesses,  for internal program management purposes, the department should use  subcontracting achievement data calculated as a percentage of the facility  management contract obligations.

In the data collection  instrument, we provided tables for the contractors to enter their  subcontracting information, and we included instructions on how to  complete the tables. The data collection instrument also included a series  of questions on various aspects of the reliability of the data they provided,  as part of our assessment of data reliability described later in this  appendix.", "Because we received the requested information from all 34 of DOE\u2019s  facility management contractors, we did not rely on results from any  subset of those contractors to conduct our analysis and, therefore, no  sampling error is associated with our work. However, data gathering  methods, such as the ones we used, may introduce error into the data that  is not associated with statistical sampling, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular  instruction was interpreted, in the availability of the information  requested, and in how the data were entered into the tables could  introduce unwanted variation into the data collected. We took steps in the  development of the data collection instrument to minimize these  nonsampling errors. For example, we pretested a draft of the data  collection instrument with 3 facility management contractors. In addition,  we provided the draft to 5 knowledgeable small business and procurement  officials in DOE headquarters. Within GAO the data collection instrument  was reviewed by the Office of General Counsel and by experts in federal  contracting and research methodology.

For example, 3 contractors stated that their subcontracting  data was both accurate and complete, while noting that it was such to the  extent that they could make it. Another contractor reported that the data it  provided for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 may be less accurate than the data  for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, because prior to 2003, the contractor did  not require that its small business subcontractors self-certify or provide  documents that verify their small business status.", "Second, we visited a nonprobability sample of 13 of the 34 facility  management contractors to conduct a more detailed assessment of the  reliability of the fiscal year 2004 subcontracting achievement data that  they provided in response to our data collection instrument.

The three DOE component organizations we focused on control  30 of DOE\u2019s 34 facility management contracts, and their annual budgets  account for over 70 percent of DOE\u2019s overall budget. In selecting NNSA  contractors, we chose both research laboratories and weapons production  facilities, to ensure inclusion of the types of work that NNSA uses to carry  out its missions. In addition, to obtain geographically diverse cases, we  selected contractors from four states in the Western U.S.\u2014California,  Nevada, New Mexico, and Washington\u2014and one Eastern state, Tennessee.  Nearly one-half of the 34 DOE facility management contractors are located  within these five states.", "Based on these selection criteria, we made visits to the following 13  facility management contractors:  Battelle Memorial, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Wash.;  Bechtel Hanford, Hanford Site, Wash.;  Bechtel Jacobs, Oak Ridge Site, Tenn.;  Bechtel National, Waste Treatment Plant, Wash.;  Bechtel Nevada, Nevada Test Site, Nev.;  Bechtel SAIC, Yucca Mountain Project, Nev.;  BWXT Y-12, Y-12 National Security Complex, Tenn.;  CH2M Hill Hanford, Hanford Site, Wash.;  Fluor Hanford, Hanford Site, Wash.;  Lockheed Martin, Sandia National Laboratories, N.

Even though our data covered fiscal years 2001 through 2004,  for our more detailed review of data reliability, we focused on fiscal year  2004, because we performed most of our analyses on data from that year.", "Although individual contractors may manage thousands of small business  subcontracts in a given year, for each of the 13 contractors, we chose  separate nonprobability samples of 5 small business subcontracts\u2014for a  total of 65 subcontracts\u2014that the facility management contractors had  included in the fiscal year 2004 small business subcontracting  achievements. We selected each nonprobability sample from a complete  list of the contractors\u2019 fiscal year 2004 small business subcontracts, which  we obtained prior to visiting the contractors. The criteria we used for  selecting contracts was the subcontract amount and the goods and  services provided. We selected subcontracts that received among the  largest dollar commitments in fiscal year 2004 and that encompassed a  variety of the types of goods and services provided by small business  subcontractors. In total, the 65 subcontracts in our nonprobability samples  accounted for 17.2 percent ($368.1 million) of the $2.1 billion dollars  committed to small business subcontracts in fiscal year 2004 by the 13  facility management contractors.", "At each contractor\u2019s facility, we reviewed documents for each of the five  subcontracts, in order to verify the dollar commitments to those  subcontracts in fiscal year 2004, that the contractor included in their  response to the data collection instrument. We also reviewed any  documents certifying the small business status of those subcontractors at  the time the subcontracts were awarded. In addition, to understand the  effect of excluding certain subcontracts from the contractors\u2019 small  business subcontracting achievement calculations, these 13 contractors  provided us with data on the dollar amount of their excluded subcontracts  in fiscal year 2004.", "For all 65 of the small business subcontracts we reviewed, we were able to  verify through documents in the subcontract files that the amount of  dollars committed to the selected subcontracts in fiscal year 2004 equaled  the dollar amounts that the facility management contractors had taken  credit for when reporting their small business subcontracting  achievements for that year. Also, for 63 of the selected subcontracts, we  were able to find documents that certified the subcontractor\u2019s status as a  small business at the time the subcontract was awarded. However, for the  2 remaining subcontracts\u2014which were from 2 different facility  management contractors\u2014documents showed that the subcontractors had  been classified as large businesses at the time the subcontract was  awarded. Therefore, these 2 subcontracts should not have been reflected  in those contractors\u2019 fiscal year 2004 subcontracting achievements as  small business subcontracts. Because this only occurred with 3 percent of  the 65 subcontracts (representing 5.7 percent of the total $368.1 million  value of those subcontracts), we did not consider it to be a material  weakness of the subcontracting achievement data. In both instances  where facility management contractors had mistakenly included a large  business subcontract in their small business subcontracting achievements,  the contractors subsequently restated their fiscal year 2004 subcontracting  achievements. The subcontracting achievement data included in this  report reflect the restated amounts.", "Based on all of our efforts to assess data reliability, we believe that the  data are sufficiently reliable for characterizing the 34 facility management  contractors\u2019 fiscal year 2004 small business subcontracting achievements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Actions Taken by DOE to Address Problems", "paragraphs": ["To determine the actions that DOE has taken to address any problems  identified with its facility management contractors\u2019 small business  subcontracting efforts, we visited officials at the nonprobability sample of  13 of the 34 facility management contractors previously described.

We acknowledge in the draft report and highlights page that DOE had  taken steps to address the problems with contractor-reported data,  including issuing clarifying information in 2002 and additional  guidance in March 2005. However, we stated that these steps had not  been adequate to ensure that the facility management contractors were  complying with the guidance. The draft report also stated that the  reviews of the five facility management contractors performed by  DOE\u2019s Small Business Office did not include an evaluation of whether  the facility management contractors were following SBA guidelines for  developing small business subcontracting goals.  2.  We agree that the Small Business Act and the Federal Acquisition  Regulation do not require a specific level of subcontracting and that  individual contractors determine the amount of work that will be  subcontracted. The draft report reflects these two statements.  However, we also stated in the draft report that if a contractor  determines that only a small percentage of the work will be  subcontracted, calculation of small business subcontracting  achievements as a percentage of that percentage can be misleading.  3.  We agree and modified the final report.  4.  We modified the final report to acknowledge that prior to fiscal year  2000, DOE was able to include the small business subcontracting  achievements of its facility management contractors toward the  department\u2019s small business prime contracting goals. However, while  it may have been an acceptable past practice for the facility  management contractors to exclude more subcontracts under these  conditions, the practice should have been discontinued in fiscal year  2000.  5.  In the draft report, we acknowledged that DOE is in the process of  revising existing guidance to clarify oversight roles and responsibilities  and the necessary coordination and integration of oversight efforts  between DOE headquarters and field organizations.  6.  In the draft report, we stated that effective oversight of facility  management contractors\u2019 practices for calculating and reporting their  small business subcontracting goals and achievements will require  more than providing guidance and training.  We believe that regular  oversight activities will also be necessary to verify that contractors are  complying with this guidance.  7.

We  obtained fiscal year 2004 data after the end of the fiscal year so that it  would reflect the final subcontracting activities for the year. We  assessed the reliability of the data for accuracy and completeness (see  app. II). In addition, in March 2005, we provided a statement of facts to  the contractors for their review to ensure the accuracy of the  information.   9.  DOE disagreed with our recommendation that, for internal  management purposes, the department use data on its contractors\u2019  subcontracting achievements, calculated as a percentage of the dollars  obligated to their prime contract with DOE.
