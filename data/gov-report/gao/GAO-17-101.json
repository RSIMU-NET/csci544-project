This report examines: (1) how VA uses EULs to provide supportive-housing and services, (2) VA's plans to develop additional supportive-housing through EULs and how past plans have been implemented, and (3) how HUD-VASH, GPD, and SSVF have helped support the goal of ending veterans' homelessness. GAO analyzed agency documents, VA data on enhanced-use leases, and VA data on the HUD-VASH, GPD, and SSVF programs.

GAO interviewed VA and HUD officials, lessee representatives, service providers, and veteran organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of September 2016, for veterans who were homeless or at risk of homelessness, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) had developed 35 enhanced-use leases (EUL) for supportive-housing with low cost rental housing and coordinated access to medical, rehabilitative, mental healthcare, and other services. Each supportive-housing EUL is located on a VA medical center campus. Some lessee representatives told GAO that having access to federal property at little or no cost helped them to rehabilitate or build facilities to create supportive-housing. Furthermore, they noted that the close proximity to VA healthcare services allowed them to invest in other needed services for homeless veterans, such as counseling, job training, and quality-of-life amenities.", "VA has plans to develop additional supportive-housing EULs, 6 of which are under construction and 16 in development. However, VA needs to improve its documentation and update its policies to develop additional EULs. VA officials did not provide clear and complete documentation for the selection of supportive-housing EUL projects, as required by VA policy, and Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government. Completely documenting this decision-making process for selecting properties could provide institutional knowledge to inform future decisions. Also, Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government states that management should periodically review policies and procedures for continued relevance and effectiveness of a federal program, and that management considers the impact of deficiencies identified in achieving documentation requirements. VA's existing policy on EUL projects is outdated. For example, it refers to an EUL authority that previously allowed the development of a full range of EUL projects. However, this authority is no longer in effect. VA is updating its EUL policy; however, the updated draft policy still does not discuss VA's limited authority to provide housing for homeless veterans. Further, the updated draft policy does not specifically provide direction on how to determine whether a proposed supportive-housing EUL meets the needs of homeless veterans. Without documented policies and procedures that address these needs, VA may not be well positioned to identify viable supportive-housing EUL projects and help ensure that those projects are successfully developed.", "Three programs\u2014Housing and Urban Development and VA Supportive-Housing (HUD-VASH), VA's Grant and Per Diem (GPD), and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF)\u2014were used in conjunction with supportive-housing EULs to help support the goal of ending veteran homelessness. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, the number of chronically homeless and vulnerable veterans housed through the HUD-VASH program increased from about 37,000 to 72,500. Community officials GAO interviewed stated that the HUD-VASH program has been instrumental in reducing chronic veteran homelessness. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, veterans served by the transitional housing-focused GPD program remained relatively steady. Veterans and their family members participating in the SSVF program increased from about 33,000 in fiscal year 2012 to 149,000 in fiscal year 2016.

HUD estimates that 39,471 veterans  were homeless in January 2016, declining from 74,087 in January 2010.  In 2009, USICH member agencies, including HUD and VA, outlined  ending veteran homelessness by 2015 as a goal. One effort to house  homeless veterans is through VA\u2019s use of its statutory authority to enter  into enhanced-use leases (EULs) to use unneeded federal real property  (land or buildings) for housing for homeless veterans. As of September  2016, there are 35 active supportive-housing EULs on VA campuses\u2014 that is, EULs that include supportive services such as mental health  counseling or job training. EULs are typically long-term agreements with  public and private entities, such as public-housing authorities and  development corporations, for the use of federal property in exchange for  cash considerations at fair value. As a part of the EUL program, VA  provides access to federal facilities and land to the lessee and developer;  however, the lessee is responsible for financing, developing, constructing,  rehabilitating, operating, and maintaining the supportive-housing EUL for  homeless veterans.

HUD,  through public-housing authorities, allocates subsidized housing  vouchers to eligible homeless veterans and their families while VA  provides case management and other services. Through the  program, the public-housing authority pays the subsidy to the landlord  directly and the veteran family pays the remainder of the rent. A  majority of the HUD-VASH vouchers are tenant-based, meaning that  the vouchers move with the veterans.

In some cases, the lessees face challenges getting these  services up and running as the provision of these services involves  multiple parties, for example:  Transportation: VA officials identified the need to provide transportation  services as a challenge in cases where public transportation is not easily  accessible to the supportive-housing EUL location. We found that several  supportive-housing EUL sites we visited provided veterans with some  type of transportation. For example, one lessee provided veterans  transportation to another VA campus for psychiatric, substance abuse,  and other specialized care. Other lessee officials said that VA provided a  campus shuttle to medical appointments on campus or provided funds for  public transportation. A USICH report noted that transportation is critical  in helping connect residents in supportive-housing to jobs, schools, health  care, and childcare. We previously reported on VA programs to  transport homeless veterans to VA or other private medical care in  partnership with community-based providers. For example, the Veterans  Health Administration developed the Veterans Transportation Service to  help veterans obtain care by improving coordination with other  transportation service providers in the community. Similarly, lessees told  us they work with other community organizations to find transportation  options for residents.", "Mail Delivery: In some cases, supportive-housing EULs faced the  challenge of ensuring that the U.S. Postal Service delivers personal mail  to residents, rather than to a central location on the VA campus. For  example, at the supportive EUL in Sepulveda, California, it took 3 years to  work out an arrangement with the Postal Service to deliver personal mail  directly to the residents at the housing facility. EUL residents experienced  delays in receiving mail when the Postal Service delivered it along with all  of the mail for the entire VA medical campus. The mail for EUL residents  was sorted from that delivered to the VA medical campus, delivered to the  EUL, and then sorted again for each individual resident. This was  problematic for the residents who needed personal mail on a timely basis  for income and benefits, such as Social Security disability checks.", "Law Enforcement: VA officials noted that they have helped resolve issues  of jurisdictional law enforcement authority between local law enforcement  and VAMC campus police. This issue is a concern at some supportive- housing EULs because the EUL is a private residential facility located on  a federal medical campus. Local law enforcement has jurisdiction over  the private housing facility, and VA has jurisdiction for the part of the  campus it operates. However, at times, it is unclear to local law  enforcement agencies which organization is the first responder for the  EUL facility.

VA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 \u201cEUL Consideration  Report,\u201d said that supportive-housing EULs resulted in cost savings by  repurposing underutilized capital assets or transferring the cost to  construct or renovate, operate, and maintain these properties to third- party partners (the lessees of the supportive-housing EULs). Further,  allowing homeless veterans to stay in a VA medical center bed is more  costly than providing them with supportive-housing. VA also reported  qualitative benefits, including strengthening the network of local services  available to veterans and developing community partnerships.", "According to VA officials, supportive-housing EULs benefit most of the  lessees and developers by providing them with long-term access to  federal property and land at little or no cost, access that can be  particularly beneficial for those located in high-rent markets. According to  the VA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 \u201cEUL Consideration Report,\u201d 18 of 29 EULs did  not pay any lease payment in fiscal year 2015. A few lessee officials we  interviewed said access to federal property and land at little or no cost  helped them to rehabilitate or construct facilities, in addition to providing  needed services to homeless veterans. In addition, lessees we  interviewed said the close proximity to VA medical, rehabilitative, and  mental health services allowed them to invest in other needed services  for homeless veterans, such as employment training and quality-of-life  amenities.", "According to VA and USICH, supportive-housing EULs can also have  benefits for the local community. Communities that added relatively more  permanent supportive-housing units over a 6-year time frame showed  significant decreases in chronic homelessness over time. Evaluations of  permanent supportive-housing have demonstrated significant  improvements in housing stability, reductions in days of homelessness,  and reductions in the utilization and costs of public services such as  emergency shelter, hospital emergency room and inpatient care, sobering  centers, and jails. Supportive-housing EULs also can increase the tax  base for the local community, because, according to VA officials, the  facility is subject to state and local taxes, which can provide new long- term revenue sources for the local economy, jobs, and tax revenues for  local and state entities. Furthermore, we identified several studies that  attempted to quantify benefits to local communities. For example, a 2014  study on supportive-housing projects found that these projects create  fiscal benefits for the state and local governments as a result of sales  taxes collected on construction materials, income taxes paid by  construction and other workers, and corporation or income taxes on  profits earned by builders, developers, and other firms.

The Department entered into these 38 EUL  agreements with lessees to develop 4,100 BURR housing units. As of  September 2016, 871 of the 4,100 planned BURR units (21 percent) were  active. In order for VA to achieve its goal by the end of December 2016, it  would need to open an additional 3,229 units. The 35 active supportive- housing EULs are comprised of 15 BURR and 20 \u201clegacy\u201d projects (see  table 3 for details on the status of these EULs).", "VA\u2019s EUL policy states that to enter the development phase, EUL projects  must be identified as valid priorities and included on the Department\u2019s  EUL project list. The policy describes several steps in the development  phase, such as: (1) a preliminary inspection of the property; (2)  identification of physical limitations such as local, state, or federal  limitations on the site (e.g., zoning, environmental, or historic  preservation); and (3) a preliminary asset valuation. It also requires  collecting documentation about the site, such as title files, flood plain  maps, and local zoning and code requirements. The policy further states  that milestones, approvals, and supporting documents that occur during  each phase of the process must be reported and attached in VA  databases and that the office responsible for the project will ensure that  all \u201creportables\u201d are appropriately and accurately recorded.  Furthermore, VA policy states that the Office of Asset Enterprise  Management is responsible for establishing policies, procedures,  guidelines, and assuring proper documentation for the EUL program. In  the case of these 38 sites, under the expedited leasing process, VA  completed some, but not all, of the steps in the development phase  before entering into short-term leases. VA officials said they outlined the  required transaction details needed to be completed before finalizing the  EUL agreement, such as a development plan, financing, and  environmental, and historic compliance. For example, VA analyzed the  physical potential for housing, need for housing, and potential financing  availability for the projects. However, VA officials did not consistently  assess the same conditions for each site. In some cases, they  documented known historic preservation or environmental issues but not  in others. VA officials intended the short-term five-year leases to allow for  the additional steps in the development process, but they did not clarify in  their BURR documents the steps they had completed before signing the  leases and those they planned to complete later. This lack of clarity made  it difficult to assess how VA officials complied with their own policy. VA  could not provide us with a final summary report or analysis documenting  the BURR initiative. For the final site selection, VA officials provided us  with documents of EUL sites with differing information. Initially, VA  provided us with a document entitled \u201cDraft BURR Site Priority for  Housing Reuse,\u201d dated December 2010, which included basic information  on 39 sites (rather than the final 38), such as square footage, physical  potential for housing, need for housing, and financing availability.  However, this document did not include 21 of the 38 lease agreements.  Subsequently, they provided us with a BURR project list from the third  quarter of 2011 that did not mention 19 of the 38 lease agreements.  Further, since the time that VA identified the 38 sites, some of those sites  are no longer on the list, and additional sites are now categorized as  BURR projects, making it difficult to reconcile the original list with  subsequent updates. Federal Standards for Internal Control states that  documentation is required for the effective design, implementation, and  operating effectiveness of a federal program, and that management  considers the impact of deficiencies identified in achieving documentation  requirements. In addition, management clearly documents internal  control and all transactions and other significant events in a manner that  allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. Further,  management designs control activities so that all transactions are  completely and accurately recorded. This type of readily available, clear,  and complete documentation of the EUL projects could have allowed VA  to more effectively implement the supportive-housing EUL program by  excluding sites that it later found it could not develop. We discuss  examples of such cases in the next section of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Faces a Challenge in Identifying Available and Suitable Properties for Additional EULs", "paragraphs": ["In 2014, VA conducted a second nationwide housing-needs analysis to  determine whether any additional opportunities existed to develop  supportive-housing EULs.

For these reasons, the OIG reported that it was unable to  determine whether the selection process was appropriate and fair.

Our prior work has consistently  found stakeholder resistance to locating federal homelessness programs  in some communities. Stakeholders for supportive-housing EULs  represent many different groups, including veterans, local and national  veteran support organizations, the local community, state and local  government, and developers. VA officials told us that reaching agreement  with all stakeholders can be challenging, and objections from any one of  these groups could delay or prevent a project from going forward. The  officials provided us with several examples of cases in which the local  community did not want formerly homeless individuals living nearby (in  Perry Point, Maryland, and Los Angeles, California). Or veterans wanted  VA to improve the medical facilities on the campus rather than lease the  property to a private developer for supportive-housing for veterans and  their families (in Queens, New York, and West Los Angeles). In some  cases, legislation was introduced to stop supportive-housing EUL  projects. Additionally, in West Los Angeles, a 2007 law prohibited VA  from selling or exchanging land on the medical campus. According to  VA officials, this prohibition resulted largely from veterans\u2019 opposition to  VA\u2019s use of property for any purpose but direct services to veterans.  According to VA officials, VA could not proceed with its draft master plan  for 1,200 units of supportive-housing without a change in this law. VA  officials also provided us with examples of approaches they used to  address stakeholder opposition. For example, in the case of the West Los  Angeles campus, they held an estimated 100 town hall meetings with  various community groups to hear their concerns about locating  supportive-housing EULs on-site. VA officials also said they collected  more than 1,000 comments on the draft master plan and, in response to  these comments, modified the plan to add a town center, redesign the  flow of traffic, and increase the planned housing units from 900 to 1,200.

VA officials told us that HUD- VASH project-based vouchers are important to EUL projects for rental  payments as they are attached to the project for a period of 15 years. The  process of obtaining funding for supportive-housing projects can be highly  competitive, and the EUL lessees have to meet program requirements for  each funding source from government and private entities, such as the  HUD-VASH or LIHTC.

As discussed  earlier, prior to 2012, VA\u2019s EUL authority allowed it to develop a wide  range of projects where the EUL contributed to VA\u2019s mission, enhanced- use of the property, and would not adversely affect VA\u2019s mission. In  August 2012, legislation was enacted that limited VA\u2019s EUL authority to  the development of supportive-housing for homeless veterans. VA\u2019s  policy does not discuss the current program mission\u2014to provide supportive-housing for homeless veterans\u2014or outline specific  considerations\u2014such as addressing stakeholder opposition and obtaining  financing for supportive-housing EULs. Identifying and developing real  property to meet the housing and supportive service needs of homeless  veterans is different from identifying and developing real property for  other types of EULs, such as administrative offices, parking, hospice  centers, and child-care facilities. Federal Standards for Internal Control  state that management should periodically review policies, procedures,  and related control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in  achieving the entity\u2019s objectives or addressing related risks. VA reported  that it updated its policy Directive and Handbook 7454 in June 2012.  However, that update did not address the current EUL authority,  specifically the inclusion of the provision that EULs can only provide for  housing for homeless veterans. Further, the update did not revise the  development phase of its process to address relevant needs for  supportive-housing for homeless veterans, such as the type of housing  needed for the local area or the space configuration or square footage  needed for supportive-housing as compared with available VA property.  VA officials told us that they had not updated the policy Handbook to  address the changes in the current law because they were anticipating an  amendment to its EUL authority that would again allow the use of EULs  for purposes other than supportive-housing for homeless veterans.", "As of October 2016, VA officials told us that they were in the process of  revising the Handbook to address the current EUL authority and related  information such as financing options, which may be useful for lessees,  and that they expected to complete it by December 2016.

VA officials told us  that they do assess whether the homeless veteran population can benefit  from supportive-housing in the area of a proposed EUL. For example,  since 2013, VA has conducted a gap analysis as part of its effort to  determine the need for homeless veteran programs such as HUD-VASH,  SSVF, and GPD. However, this assessment is not included in the draft  Handbook.

National Alliance to End Homelessness officials stated while  the housing assistance payments from HUD-VASH were supposed to  keep up with increasing rental rates, this has not been the case. To  address this issue, HUD officials stated that HUD has granted permission  for some public-housing authorities to increase the housing assistance  payments for housing in some high cost cities. Officials in the city of Los  Angeles stated that the city received an increase in housing assistance  payments in February 2016 and that as of August 2016, about half of the  veterans found housing using the higher housing assistance payment  amount. However, the low vacancy rate in Los Angeles still presents a  challenge for the time it takes to find housing using HUD-VASH vouchers.  Los Angeles county officials stated that as compared to the prior year, the  average number of HUD-VASH voucher holders who found housing  increased. However, in addition to housing assistance payments, Los  Angeles county officials pointed to other efforts, such as providing  incentives to landlords to hold vacant units for veterans and increasing  the number of staff and housing locators for HUD-VASH, as contributing  to the increase. According to VA officials we interviewed, some veterans  may also have difficulty finding housing that complies with HUD\u2019s housing  quality standards.

We discuss the importance of clear  documentation in the context of maintaining sufficient internal controls for  program management and informing future decisions. In addition, we do  provide several illustrative examples of sites that VA initially selected that  missed key factors that prevented the development of the site. For  example, VA later learned that one site was not located on VA property,  another site was already used for other purposes, and another no longer  had underutilized facilities. We point out that additional documentation  could have allowed VA to more effectively implement the program by  excluding sites such as these.", "With regard to our second recommendation, VA stated that it is in the  process of updating its EUL policy and guidance to specifically document  requirements, which are detailed in the agency\u2019s comment letter (see  app. VII), and it expects to complete the update by the end of the second  quarter of 2017. Among the requirements, it refers to a review of market  conditions, such as homeless populations to be served and the services  they may require. However, VA does not specifically state that it will  address how to identify properties that can meet the needs of homeless  veterans. We continue to believe that VA should include this objective in  its policy because, as discussed in our report, not all properties are  suitable for housing the population the EUL program is required to serve.", "In its comments, VA noted some additional points they felt we should  include in our report. However, we did cover these points to the extent  applicable. In particular, VA raised an overall concern that the theme of  our report does not take into account the entrepreneurial spirit and private  sector dependency that are fundamental to the EUL program. To the  contrary, we make these points clear throughout our report, by discussing  the multiple parties (e.g., public housing authorities, private development  corporations, non-profit lessees, and service providers) that play key roles  in the success of the EUL program. We discuss the range of services  provided and the benefits to VA, lessees, developers, and the local  community through participation in the program. We note that VA  reported that its ability to retain EUL lease proceeds provides it with an  incentive to be creative and aggressively pursue opportunities to  collaborate with both private and non-profit entities. Further, we describe  some of the key challenges that come with providing services through  multiple parties\u2014such as transportation, mail delivery, and law  enforcement. And, we acknowledge the complexity of financing  supportive-housing EULs through multiple funding sources.", "In sum, our report acknowledges VA\u2019s successful development of 35  active supportive-housing EULs, 6 under construction and 16 in  development, notwithstanding the challenges faced with identifying  suitable properties, stakeholder coordination, and obtaining sufficient  financing. We believe that the improvements in documentation and  updated policy that we recommended and VA has agreed to make will  help to ensure that the supportive-housing EUL program continues to  make an important contribution toward ending veterans\u2019 homelessness.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Housing  and Urban Development, the Executive Director of the United States  Interagency Council on Homelessness, points of contact from the 13  EULs we visited, and other interested parties.

This report focuses on VA\u2019s supportive-housing  EULs.", "To examine how VA uses its EUL authority to provide supportive-housing  to veterans, we collected and analyzed data from VA on the 35 active and  other supportive-housing EULs from July 1998 to September 2016 and  reviewed VA\u2019s annual \u201cEUL Consideration Report.\u201d The data included  project location, project status, housing type, the award date for the lease,  number of housing units, and the year the facility began operating. We  analyzed the number of EULs by housing type to determine what  percentage of the housing units were permanent housing. We assessed  the reliability of the data through interviews with knowledgeable VA  officials and a review of the data for completeness and potential outliers.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  providing summary information about supportive-housing EULs. Of the 35  active supportive-housing EULs, we conducted site visits to 13  supportive-housing EULs located on VA medical center (VAMC)  campuses. Specifically, we visited the following supportive-housing EULs:  one in Lyons, New Jersey; four in Dayton, Ohio; one in St. Cloud and two  in Minneapolis, Minnesota; three in Hines, Illinois; and two in Sepulveda,  California. We judgmentally selected these 13 supportive-housing EULs  to include a range of geographic locations, a variety of stakeholders (e.g.,  public, private, and non-profit lessees and service providers); housing  types (e.g., transitional and permanent housing); and with leases  spanning a range of years. At these site visits, we interviewed VA officials  from the Office of Asset Enterprise and Management (OAEM), Office of  General Counsel, local VAMC officials, lessees (some of which were  developers), and service providers to understand factors involved in  developing the EULs, the supportive services provided, and the benefits  of developing supportive-housing through the EUL program. The  information from our site visits is illustrative of issues affecting particular  sites and cannot be generalized to VA sites agency-wide. To understand  how VA\u2019s EUL authority has supported housing for homeless veterans,  we interviewed officials from the U.S. Interagency Council on  Homelessness (USICH)\u2014an independent federal agency composed of  19 Cabinet secretaries and agency heads, and not-for-profit veterans  organizations concerned with veterans\u2019 homelessness: The National  Alliance to End Homelessness, National Coalition for Homeless Veterans,  U.S. Vets, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the National Equity Fund.", "To examine VA\u2019s plans to develop additional supportive-housing and how  VA implemented past plans, we analyzed VA data from July 1998 to  September 2016 for projects under construction, development, and on  hold. We assessed the reliability of the data through interviews with  knowledgeable VA officials and a review of the data for completeness and  potential outliers. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of providing summary information about supportive- housing EULs. We also interviewed VA headquarters, local VAMC  officials, lessees, and service providers as part of our 13 site visits. Five  of the six VAMC campuses that we visited had supportive-housing EULs  under development or construction. These VAMC campuses are located  in Hines, IL; Lyons, NJ; Dayton, OH; and Minneapolis, and St. Cloud, MN.  Additionally, we spoke to OAEM officials and local VAMC officials in Los  Angeles, where VA is planning additional supportive-housing EULs. We  also analyzed information on VA\u2019s Building Utilization Review and  Repurposing (BURR) initiative to identify VA\u2019s proposed plans for and  completed supportive-housing EULs. Additionally, we reviewed VA\u2019s  policies on EULs, including VA Handbook 7415 and VA Directive 7415,  which contain EUL policies and procedures; and VA Handbook 7454 and  VA Directive 7454, which contain policies and procedures for oversight  and management of EULs. To understand potential challenges in  developing EULs, we interviewed OAEM officials, local VAMC officials,  lessees, and service providers at the 13 operating supportive-housing  EULs about the challenges of developing an EUL. We reviewed and  analyzed leasing agreement documents, directives, agency policy,  guidance, and VA reports. We also reviewed VA\u2019s Strategic Plan, VA  Office of Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) work, and our prior work related to  EULs and lease agreements. We also reviewed the Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government.", "To describe how VA leverages key programs to support the goal of  ending veterans\u2019 homeless, we examined three key housing programs:  HUD-VASH, GPD, and SSVF. For each program, we asked VA for  information about its performance targets and outcomes for fiscal year  2012 onward and the role these programs play in providing rent subsidies  and services for supportive-housing EULs. We assessed the reliability of  the data through interviews with knowledgeable VA officials and a review  of the data for completeness and potential outliers. We selected fiscal  year 2012 because we had conducted a review of the HUD-VASH  program that captured its performance for 2012\u2014the year in which SSVF  began operation. Selecting fiscal year 2012 also allowed us to capture the  program outcomes in the years after VA and other agencies announced  their goal to end veterans\u2019 homelessness. We conducted a literature  review to identify available and relevant research on the effects of the  three programs on homeless veterans. We identified relevant studies,  surveys, and analyses published by industry associations, academics or  research entities, and federal agencies. A GAO social scientist assessed  the design and methods of each study and determined they were  sufficient to support the findings we cite in this report. Additionally, we  interviewed VA\u2019s Veterans Heath Administration Homeless Program  Office and HUD officials about relevant studies. We reviewed HUD and  VA guidance and policies on HUD-VASH, including notices HUD issued  on set-aside funding availability for project-based HUD-VASH vouchers;  VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA) Handbook 1162.05 on the  procedures for the HUD-VASH program, and VA\u2019s Resource Guide on  HUD-VASH. Additionally, we reviewed guidance and policies VA has  published on GPD and SSVF, including the VHA Handbook 1162.01 on  the procedures for the GPD program and VA\u2019s SSVF Program Guide. To  understand how these programs have supported housing for homeless  veterans and supportive-housing EULs we visited, we interviewed officials  from the following organizations: VA\u2019s VHA; the Department of Labor;  USICH; National Alliance to End Homelessness; National Coalition for  Homeless Veterans; EUL lessees and service providers; and officials  from the city and county of Los Angeles, which has the largest population  of homeless veterans in the United States. Furthermore, to understand  the roles the programs played in ending veteran homelessness in specific  areas, we interviewed officials from Houston, Texas; New Orleans,  Louisiana; the Las Vegas metropolitan area; and the Commonwealth of  Virginia\u2014all areas USICH certified as having ended veteran  homelessness. We selected Houston, New Orleans, and the Las Vegas  metropolitan area because, among the areas that ended veteran  homelessness, they had the highest number of homeless veterans in  2011\u2014the first year of the national effort to end veteran homelessness.  We selected Virginia because it had a higher number of homeless  veterans in 2011, as compared to Connecticut, the other state that had  ended veteran homelessness at the time of our review. In Houston, we  spoke with representatives from the local VA medical center, the Houston  mayor\u2019s office, and representatives involved in the local SSVF and HUD- VASH program. Similarly, in New Orleans, we spoke with representatives  from the local VA medical center and three service providers involved  with the local SSVF and HUD-VASH programs. In the Las Vegas  metropolitan area, we spoke with the Combined Working Group to End  Veteran Homelessness, which included representatives from VA, HUD,  city of Las Vegas, and several service providers. In Virginia, we  interviewed representatives of the Governor\u2019s Coordinating Council on  Homeless Veterans. We also reviewed USICH\u2019s criteria and benchmarks  for ending veteran homelessness. Additionally, we reviewed our prior  work on veteran homelessness and the HUD-VASH program.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2015 to December  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
