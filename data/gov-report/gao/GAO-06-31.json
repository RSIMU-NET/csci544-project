In addition, DLA has not implemented a fully effective certification and accreditation process for authorizing the operation of its information systems. Key reasons for these weaknesses are that responsibilities of information security employees were not consistently understood or communicated and DLA has not adequately maintained the accuracy and completeness of data contained in its primary reporting tool for overseeing the agency's performance in implementing key information security activities and controls.

Instead, the central review team relies on documentation  submitted to them by the information assurance personnel who performed  the certification tasks. However, this documentation was not always  adequate. For example, the checklist contained questions about whether  physical access controls were adequate to protect all facilities housing user  workstations, but for the central review team to verify such a task, either  an on-site inspection or a diagram of the facility or other documentation to  demonstrate the physical access controls in place would have been needed.

He  further stated that DOD 8510.1-M contains a \u201cminimum activities checklist\u201d  that all DOD Components are expected to follow when conducting  certifications and that DLA\u2019s information assurance One Book policy  includes roles and responsibilities for performing security certification and  accreditation.", "Our draft recommendation refers to the DLA quality review checklist used  by the agency\u2019s central review team to verify completion of certification  tasks, not to the DOD \u201cminimum activities checklist\u201d described in DOD  8510.1-M. Unless certification tasks performed by information assurance  personnel at the various DLA locations have been verified, the authorizing  official may not have objective or sufficient information that is necessary to  make credible, risk-based decisions on whether to place an information  system into operation. Accordingly, we have clarified our recommendation  to state that the Secretary of Defense direct the DLA Director to ensure that  the DLA central review team verifies that certification tasks have been  completed.", "The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense also disagreed with our draft  recommendation to update and maintain the agency\u2019s primary reporting  tool for recording, tracking, and reporting performance metrics on  information security practices and controls. He stated that the primary  reporting tool was developed and maintained by DLA and that  responsibility for updating and sustaining the tool was transferred to an  internal application development team for continued maintenance and  support. He also stated that DLA initiated implementation of enterprise  standard DOD solutions that will replace the functionality currently  provided by the agency reporting tool and that sustainment of the tool  would not be cost effective or efficient.", "The intent of our draft recommendation was to update and maintain the  accuracy and completeness of data entered into DLA\u2019s primary reporting  tool, not the application programs. While DLA has several initiatives  underway at various stages of development and implementation that are  intended to introduce new functionality or replace some of the existing  functionality in the agency reporting tool, none of these initiatives have  been fully implemented throughout the agency. If DLA continues to use a  tool for managing and overseeing its information assurance program, the  fundamental practice of having accurate and complete data\u2014whether in  the current tool or in a future tool\u2014is important to ensure the data are  reliable for reporting performance metrics on key information security  practices and controls to DOD and OMB for FISMA evaluation reporting.  Accordingly, we have clarified our recommendation to state that the  Secretary of Defense direct the DLA Director to maintain the accuracy and  completeness of the data contained in the agency\u2019s primary reporting tool  for recording, tracking, and reporting performance metrics on information  security practices and controls.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense (Business Transformation); Assistant Secretary of Defense,  Networks and Information Integration; DLA Director; officials within DLA\u2019s  Information Operations and Information Assurance office; and the Acting  DOD Inspector General.

We also  evaluated DLA\u2019s agencywide tool\u2014the Comprehensive Information  Assurance Knowledgebase\u2014for aggregating the agency\u2019s performance data  on information security activities that are required by the Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), such as the  number and percentage of risk assessments performed, employees with  significant information security responsibilities that received training to  perform their duties, and weaknesses for which the agency had plans of  action and milestones. To gain insight into DLA\u2019s certification and  accreditation process, we reviewed the agency\u2019s methods and practices for  identifying vulnerabilities and risks and the process for certifying systems  and making accreditation decisions. We assessed whether DLA\u2019s  information security program was consistent with relevant DOD policies  and procedures, as well as with the requirements of FISMA, applicable  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies, and National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance.", "We also assessed whether selected information security plans and  documents related to risk assessments, testing and evaluation, and plans of  action and milestones were current and complete. To accomplish this, we  non-randomly selected 10 sensitive but unclassified systems. The 10  systems came from 10 different DLA locations and included 3 systems, 4  sites, and 3 types. We selected these systems to maximize variety in  criticality and geographic locations. We also conducted telephone  interviews with 17 information assurance managers and information  assurance officers from the 10 locations in order to gain insight into their  understanding of FISMA requirements, relevant OMB policies, NIST  guidance, and agencywide and DOD policies and procedures.", "We performed our review at DLA Headquarters, located at Ft.
