Since 1991, Congress has required federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action (PCA) to identify and promptly address capital deficiencies at institutions to minimize losses to the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires GAO to study federal regulators' use of PCA. This report examines (1) the outcomes of regulators' use of PCA on the DIF; (2) the extent to which regulatory actions, PCA thresholds, and other financial indicators help regulators address likely bank trouble or failure; and (3) options available to make PCA a more effective tool. GAO analyzed agency and financial data to describe PCA and DIF trends and assess the timeliness of regulator actions and financial indicators. GAO also reviewed relevant literature and surveyed expert stakeholders from research, industry, and regulatory sectors on options to improve PCA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the PCA framework has provided a mechanism to address financial deterioration in banks, GAO's analysis suggests it did not prevent widespread losses to the DIF--a key goal of PCA. Since 2008, the financial condition of banks has declined rapidly and use of PCA has grown tenfold. However, every bank that underwent PCA because of capital deficiencies and failed in this period produced a loss to the DIF. Moreover, these losses were comparable as a percentage of assets to the losses of failed banks that did not undergo PCA. While regulators and others acknowledged PCA's limitations, regulators said that the PCA framework provides benefits, such as facilitating orderly closures and encouraging banks to increase capital levels. PCA's triggers limit its ability to promptly address bank problems, and although regulators had discretion to address problems sooner, they did not consistently do so. Since the 1990s, GAO and others have noted that the effectiveness of PCA, as currently constructed, is limited because of its reliance on capital, which can lag behind other indicators of bank health. That is, problems with the bank's assets, earnings, or management typically manifest before these problems affect bank capital. Once a bank falls below PCA's capital standards, a bank may not be able to recover regardless of the regulatory action imposed. GAO tested other financial indicators, including measures of asset quality and liquidity, and found that they were important predictors of future bank failure. These indicators also better identified those institutions that failed and did not undergo the PCA process during the recent crisis. Although regulators identified problematic conditions among banks well before failure, the presence and timeliness of enforcement actions were inconsistent. For example, among the banks that failed, more than 80 percent were on a regulatory watch list for more than a year, on average, before bank failure. However, GAO's analysis of regulatory data and material loss reviews showed that actions to address early signs of deterioration were inconsistent and, in many cases, regulators either took no enforcement action or acted in the final days before an institution was subject to PCA or failed. Without an additional early warning trigger, the regulators risk acting too late, thereby limiting their ability to minimize losses to the DIF. Most stakeholders (23 of 29) GAO surveyed agreed that PCA should be modified and identified three top options to make it more effective. The first option--incorporating an institution's risk profile into PCA capital categories--would add a measure of risk to the capital category thresholds beyond the existing risk-weighted asset component. The second option was increasing the capital ratios that place banks in PCA capital categories. The third most popular option was including another trigger for PCA, such as asset quality or asset concentration. Each option has advantages and disadvantages. For example, while an additional trigger could account for other factors often found to precede capital deterioration, it might be difficult to implement. Although stakeholders supported these broad options, they cautioned that the manner in which any option was crafted would determine its success."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the bank regulators consider additional triggers that would require early and forceful regulatory action to address unsafe banking practices as well as the other options identified in the report to improve PCA. The regulators generally agreed with the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the savings and loan crisis, federal regulators were criticized for  failing to take timely and forceful action to address the causes of bank  failures and prevent losses to taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund  (currently and hereinafter referred to as the DIF). In response, Congress  passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act  (FDICIA) of 1991, which made significant changes to the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act (FDIA). In particular, FDICIA created sections 38 and 39 of  FDIA to improve the ability of regulators to identify and promptly address  deficiencies at depository institutions\u2014banks and thrifts\u2014and better  safeguard and minimize losses to the DIF. Section 38 requires regulators to  classify banks into one of five capital categories and take increasingly  severe actions, known as prompt corrective action (PCA), as a bank\u2019s  capital deteriorates. Section 38 primarily focuses on capital as an indicator  of bank health; therefore, supervisory actions under it are designed to  address a bank\u2019s deteriorating capital level. Section 39 requires the  banking regulators to prescribe safety and soundness standards related to  noncapital criteria, including operations and management; compensation;  and asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. Section 39 allows the  regulators to take action if a bank fails to meet one or more of these  standards.", "Before 2007, PCA was largely untested by a financial crisis that resulted in  a large number of bank failures. After the passage of FDICIA, sustained  growth in the U.S. economy meant that the financial condition of banks  was generally strong. For instance, as a result of positive economic  conditions, the number of bank failures declined from 180 in 1992 to 4 in  2004. And from June 2004 through January 2007, no banks failed.", "Since 2007, failures have increased significantly. In 2010, 157 banks failed,  the most in a single year since the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and  1990s. The 157 banks had combined assets of approximately $93 billion,  costing the DIF an estimated $24 billion. Overall, more than 300 banks  have failed since the current financial crisis began in 2007, at an estimated  cost of almost $60 billion to the DIF to cover losses to insured depositors.  During this time, the balance of the DIF has declined dramatically,  becoming negative in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the DIF had a  negative balance of $7.4 billion. During this same period, beginning late in  2008, the federal government provided significant financial assistance to  many financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program and  other actions taken by the Federal Reserve System and FDIC to stabilize  the U.S. banking system. For example, regulators used certain emergency  authorities to enable assistance to some large banks because in their view  the failure of these institutions would have imposed large losses on  creditors and threatened to undermine confidence in the banking system.", "The number and size of failures during the recent financial crisis have  raised questions about the ability of PCA to help turn around troubled  banks and minimize losses to the DIF. Section 202(g) of the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)  requires GAO to study the federal regulators\u2019 use of PCA and report our  findings to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Dodd-Frank Act  also requires that the Financial Stability Oversight Council report to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the  Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on  actions taken in response to our report, including any recommendations  made to the federal banking regulators. Specifically, this report (1)  analyzes the outcomes of regulators\u2019 use of PCA on the DIF; (2) evaluates  the extent to which regulatory actions, capital thresholds, and other  financial indicators helped regulators to address likely bank trouble or  failure; and (3) identifies options available to make PCA a more effective  tool to prevent or minimize losses to the DIF.", "To describe trends in and outcomes from the implementation of PCA, we  analyzed banking data from regulators, including FDIC Quarterly Banking  Reports and the quarterly \u201cproblem\u201d bank lists. We analyzed data on banks  that underwent the PCA process, failed from the first quarter of 2006  through the third quarter of 2010 (i.e., from January 1, 2006, through  September 30, 2010), or both, and identified their outcomes. To determine  the number of banks that produced losses to the DIF\u2014including those  banks that underwent the PCA process before failure and those that did  not\u2014we used the 2010 estimate of losses to the DIF from loss data  obtained from FDIC, which we determined to be sufficiently reliable for  our purpose of enumerating failed banks and the losses associated with  these failures based on our ongoing work related to the DIF. We also  interviewed representatives from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).", "To assess the utility of various financial indicators in predicting bank  distress, we developed a model of leading indicators of bank failure based  on financial ratios researchers identified in the 1990s that predicted bank  failures in previous stress periods. We used these financial ratios,  regulatory ratings, and an indicator we developed of sector loan  concentration to forecast bank failure within 1 to 2 years (for failed banks  and peers from 2006 through the third quarter of 2010). We used this  model to assess the predictive power of indicators other than bank capital.  To do this, we relied on data from FDIC and SNL Financial. We assessed  the reliability of data used in our analysis and found the data sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To examine the extent to which various regulatory activities and  enforcement actions, including PCA, detected and addressed troubled  banks, we examined the type and timing of regulatory actions across the  oversight cycle. This work encompassed analyzing the extent to which  existing regulatory steps provided warning of likely bank deterioration or  failure. Specifically, we reviewed off-site monitoring tools and examined if  these tools provided effective warnings of bank distress. For all bank  failures that occurred from the first quarter of 2006 through the third  quarter of 2010, we also reviewed formal and informal enforcement  actions in the 2-year period before a bank failed to identify the earliest  enforcement action taken in relation to other regulatory milestones  associated with financial deterioration. We also reviewed the timing and  nature of PCA enforcement actions in relation to bank failure. Upon  receiving enforcement data provided by FDIC, the Federal Reserve, OCC,  and OTS, we determined that the enforcement data provided could not be  relied upon without additional verification. In particular, the enforcement  data the Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS provided could not be used alone  to make distinctions among different types of enforcement actions that  may or may not have been relevant to safety and soundness issues of  banks that were deteriorating financially. While enforcement data  provided by FDIC did make such distinctions, we did not rely exclusively  on the enforcement data provided by the regulators, but rather, used these  data to corroborate information on enforcement actions from material loss  reports prepared by the inspectors general (IG) of the banking regulators  and conducted case studies of 8 banks to highlight examples of oversight  steps taken by each of the regulators and various outcomes. We selected a  nongeneralizable sample of banks that is diverse with respect to  geography, asset size, franchise value, primary regulator, date of failure,  sequence of enforcement actions, outcome (failure or a return to financial  stability), and losses to the DIF. The inspectors general for the FDIC, the  Department of the Treasury, and the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System are currently conducting a joint evaluation of the PCA  framework that will address the use of both sections 38 and 39 of FDICIA  during the last few years, among other issues.", "To identify options to make PCA more effective, we surveyed informed  stakeholders from the regulatory agencies, research, and industry sectors.  We used a two-part Delphi survey to gather ideas from the stakeholders,  who were identified through professional credentials, authorship of  research, and membership in relevant research and industry groups. The  first survey, using open-ended questions, asked respondents to identify  options, including those outside the PCA framework, which could be more  effective in minimizing losses to the DIF. The second survey, through a set  of closed-ended questions created from a content analysis of the responses  from the first survey, asked the same stakeholders to rate and rank the  options in terms of feasibility and impact. To further illustrate the options  that may be considered to improve PCA effectiveness, we interviewed  supervisory and research staff at the four regulators about PCA and bank  failures during the financial crisis and any additional options that could  improve PCA effectiveness. Finally, we conducted a literature review on  PCA and early intervention and synthesized any additional options  presented in the literature that could make PCA more effective. Appendix  I contains a more detailed description of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 through June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for state- chartered member banks (i.e., state-chartered banks that are members of  the Federal Reserve System) and bank holding companies, OCC is the  primary regulator of federally chartered banks, and OTS is the primary  regulator of federally and state-chartered thrifts and thrift holding  companies. FDIC is the primary regulator for state-chartered nonmember  banks (i.e., state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal  Reserve System). In addition, FDIC insures the deposits of all federally  insured banks, generally up to $250,000 per depositor, and monitors their  risk to the DIF.", "Regulators examine banks\u2019 risk management systems to help ensure the  safe and sound operation of banks and protect the well-being of  depositors\u2014those individuals and organizations that act as creditors by  \u201cloaning\u201d their funds in the form of deposits to banks for lending and other  activities. Regulators are responsible for supervising the activities of banks  and taking corrective action when their activities and overall performance  present supervisory concerns or could result in financial losses to the DIF  or violations of law. Losses to the DIF may occur when a bank does not  have sufficient assets to reimburse customers\u2019 deposits and FDIC\u2019s  administrative expenses in the event of closure or merger.", "All the regulators assess the condition of banks through off-site  monitoring and on-site examinations. Examiners use Report of Condition  and Income (Call Report) and Thrift Financial Report data to remotely  assess the financial condition of banks and thrifts, respectively, and to  plan the scope of on-site examinations. Historically, banking regulators  have used tools to monitor the financial condition of banks between on- site bank examinations. The off-site monitoring or surveillance activities  rely largely on self-reported information from banks, filed through  quarterly Call Reports to the banking regulators. Off-site monitoring and  surveillance activities help alert regulators to potentially problematic  conditions arising in a financial institution. Using these tools, each of the  regulators identifies and flags banks with potential signs of financial  distress for further regulatory scrutiny and prepares lists or reports of  such institutions requiring further regulatory scrutiny (e.g., watch list,  review list, high risk profile list, etc.).", "As part of on-site examinations, regulators closely assess banks\u2019 exposure  to risk and assign ratings, under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating  System, commonly known as CAMELS. The ratings reflect a bank\u2019s  condition in six areas: capital, asset quality, management, earnings,  liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. Each component is rated on a  scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the best and 5 the worst. The component  ratings are then used to develop a composite rating, also ranging from 1 to  5. Banks with composite ratings of 1 or 2 are considered to be in  satisfactory condition, while banks with composite ratings of 3, 4, or 5  exhibit varying levels of safety and soundness problems. Banks with  composite ratings of 4 or 5 are included on FDIC\u2019s problem bank list,  which designates banks with weaknesses that threaten their continued  financial viability. Also as part of the examination and general supervision  process, regulators may direct a bank to address issues or deficiencies  within specified time frames. However, as figure 1 illustrates, a bank\u2019s  condition can rapidly deteriorate and bypass the various regulatory steps  that usually occur as a bank\u2019s condition deteriorates.", "When regulators determine that a bank or thrift\u2019s condition is less than  satisfactory, they may take a variety of supervisory actions, including  informal and formal enforcement actions, to address identified  deficiencies and have some discretion in deciding which actions to take.  Regulators typically take progressively stricter actions against more  serious weaknesses. Informal actions generally are used to address less  severe deficiencies or when the regulator has confidence that the bank is  willing and able to implement changes. Examples of informal actions  include commitment letters detailing a bank\u2019s commitment to undertake  specific remedial measures, resolutions adopted by the bank\u2019s board of  directors at the request of its regulator, and memorandums of  understanding that note agreements between the regulator and the bank\u2019s  board of directors. Informal actions are not public agreements (regulators  do not make them public through their Web sites or other channels) and  are not enforceable by sanctions. In comparison, regulators publicly  disclose and enforce formal actions. The regulators use formal actions to  address more severe deficiencies. Formal enforcement actions include  PCA directives, cease-and-desist orders, removal and prohibition orders,  civil money penalties, and termination of a bank\u2019s deposit insurance.", "A principal goal of PCA is to prevent losses to the DIF for the vast majority  of bank failures. Section 38 of FDIA requires regulators to categorize  banks into five categories on the basis of their capital levels (see table 1).  Regulators use four different capital measures to determine a bank\u2019s  capital category: (1) a total risk-based capital ratio, (2) a Tier 1 risk-based  capital ratio, (3) a leverage ratio (or non-risk-based capital ratio). The  fourth PCA measure is a tangible equity to assets ratio for the Critically  Undercapitalized category. To be well capitalized, a bank must  significantly exceed the minimum standard for all three capital measures.  Depending on the level of deficiency, banks may be considered  undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized if they fail to meet any  one of the ratios necessary to be considered at least adequately  capitalized. A bank that fails to meet the tangible equity to total assets  ratio is considered critically undercapitalized. For example, a bank that is  experiencing significant growth, with 9 percent total risk-based capital and  6 percent Tier 1 risk-based capital but only 3.5 percent leverage capital,  would be undercapitalized for PCA purposes.", "Under section 38, regulators must take increasingly stringent supervisory  actions as a bank\u2019s capital level deteriorates. For example, all  undercapitalized banks must implement capital restoration plans to  restore capital to at least the adequately capitalized level, and regulators  generally must close critically undercapitalized banks within a 90-day  period. Section 38 also authorizes several non-capital-based supervisory  actions designed to allow regulators some flexibility in achieving the  purpose of section 38. Specifically, under section 38(g) regulators can  reclassify or downgrade a bank\u2019s capital category to apply more stringent  operating restrictions or requirements if they determine, after notice and  opportunity for a hearing, that a bank is in an unsafe and unsound  condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Under section  38(f)(2)(F), regulators can require a bank to make improvements in  management\u2014for example, by dismissing officers and directors who are  not able to materially strengthen a bank\u2019s ability to become adequately  capitalized.", "Section 39 directs regulatory attention to a bank\u2019s operations and activities  in three areas aside from capital that also can affect safety and soundness:  (1) operations and management; (2) compensation; and (3) asset quality,  earnings, and stock valuation. Under section 39, if a regulator determines  that a bank has failed to meet a prescribed standard, the regulator may  require that the institution file a safety and soundness plan specifying how  it will correct the deficiency. If the bank fails to submit an acceptable plan  or fails to materially implement or adhere to an approved plan, the  regulator must require the institution, through the issuance of a public  order, to correct identified deficiencies and may place other restrictions or  requirements on the bank pending the correction of the deficiency.

Thus, whether or not a bank underwent  the PCA process before failure, its losses to the fund totaled  approximately a third of its assets. Specifically, for banks that underwent  the PCA process before failure, the minimum loss to the DIF as a  percentage of assets was 1 percent, the median loss was 27.7 percent, and  the maximum loss was 87 percent (see fig. 10). For banks that did not  undergo the PCA process before failure, the minimum loss to the DIF as a  percentage of assets was 0 percent, the median loss was 29.1 percent, and  the maximum loss was 61 percent.

Similarly, we have found that while capital was a valid  measure of a bank\u2019s financial health, waiting until the capital standards  have been violated may be too late for a bank to be able to address its  problems. Banks had other identifiable issues before they were reflected  in capital.

Several studies published in the 1990s  demonstrated that in addition to capital, indicators based on earnings,  asset quality, liquidity, and reliance on unstable funding provide early  warning of bank distress. Capital on its own may provide some early  warning of bank failure but does not capture weaknesses that manifest\u2014 perhaps earlier\u2014in other areas of the bank\u2019s operations. We developed a  model based on this earlier research to determine if these leading  indicators would have been useful tools to predict bank failures during the  current crisis.

Indicators of  earnings, liquidity, and asset quality, in addition to capital, contain  information about the condition of the bank that provides warning of bank  distress up to 1-2 years in advance. For example, large differences in the  level of nonperforming loans between healthy banks (our peer group) and  banks that ultimately failed were evident well before the bulk of bank  failures in 2009\u20132010 (see fig. 11). Starting in 2006, the difference between  the two groups of banks increased as nonperforming loans grew  dramatically over the next 3-4 years for banks that ultimately failed, but  only modestly for healthy banks. Quantitatively, a one standard deviation  increase in the level of nonperforming loans increased the chance of  failure from roughly 2.8 percent to 7.8 percent over the next year.", "Similarly, large differences in the level of liquid assets (securities) between  healthy banks and banks that ultimately would fail are evident well before  the bulk of bank failures (see fig. 12). The degree of liquidity fell somewhat  over time, both at banks that ultimately would fail and healthy banks.  Quantitatively, a one standard deviation increase in the level of securities  decreased the chance of failure from roughly 2.8 percent to 2.3 percent  over the next year. The Basel Committee has proposed two liquidity  standards designed to promote resilience in the banking system.", "As with indicators of earnings, liquidity, and asset quality, a measure of  sector loan concentration we developed contains information about the  condition of the bank that provides warning of bank distress up to 1\u20132  years in advance. Sector loan concentration is calculated as an index that  incorporates the shares of an institution\u2019s loan portfolio allocated to  certain broad economic sectors (e.g., residential real estate, consumer  lending, etc.). Our concentration index also proved to be an important  predictor of bank failure\u2014it is both statistically and practically significant  (see app. III for more information). Banks that ultimately failed had  considerably more concentrated loan portfolios than healthy banks well  before the bulk of bank failures. Specifically, a one standard deviation  increase in the degree of concentration increased the chance of failure  from roughly 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent over the next year. Our  concentration index partly reflects banks heavily invested in commercial  real estate (see fig. 13)\u2014a troubled sector during the recent downturn.  Failed banks had roughly 20 percent more loans in commercial real estate  than their peers. However, even among banks with the same degree of  commercial real estate exposure, those with less diversified lending were  more likely to fail. The concentration index we developed would be a  more flexible forward-looking indicator than commercial real estate  concentration alone because the next episode of banking stress will not  necessarily be driven by commercial real estate.  3% 3% 2% The PCA framework does not take full advantage of early warning signs  that financial indicators we tested can provide. Because PCA relies only  on capital-based indicators, it may not capture institutional vulnerabilities  that can manifest in, for example, limited liquidity, low asset quality, or  high loan concentrations in particular sectors. Early warning signs in  earnings, liquidity, asset quality, or concentration could be identified by  assessing each indicator individually and setting indicator-specific  thresholds. Later in this report we discuss indicators that could be used  for triggers that respondents to our expert survey favored.", "Composite indicators based on the model we developed or based on an  existing regulatory tool (such as CAMELS ratings) provide a convenient  way of combining information from a number of financial indicators, and  can better identify risks in banks that did not undergo the PCA process  before failure. Our analysis showed that a model incorporating these well- known leading indicators of bank distress better identified those banks  that did not undergo the PCA process before failure\u2014that is, the model  placed them at a much higher risk of failure than healthy banks\u2014than  capital-based triggers alone. The average failure rate estimated by our  model over the next year was about 20 percent for banks that ultimately  would fail without triggering PCA (similar to the rate for all failures), and  about 3 percent for healthy banks, as of the first quarter of 2008. Similarly,  CAMELS ratings were higher (inferior) than ratings of peers at banks that  did not undergo the PCA process before failure. The CAMELS ratings were  on average 2.13 for banks that failed without first undergoing the PCA  process (similar to the ratings for all failures), and about 1.75 for healthy  banks.

Striking the right balance  between these two errors depends on the relative costs of each error, and  other considerations. For example, the cost of acting on false positives  could be quite high if healthy banks undertook costly and unnecessary  measures to avoid regulatory triggers or similarly if regulators and banks  expended significant resources during unnecessary interventions.  Comparatively, the cost of failing to act on false negatives could be quite  high if bank failures imposed dramatic costs on the DIF and the economy.  In general, setting a high threshold for action only rarely would trigger  unnecessary intervention in healthy banks but also might yield failures to  intervene in some genuinely troubled banks.

Stakeholders suggested a few ways this change  could be made. For example, in formulating the most appropriate capital  thresholds, banks could be required to maintain an appropriate level of  tangible equity or a capital buffer based on the level of risk-weighted  assets. Alternatively, specific risk areas such as liquidity or concentration  could be factored into the determination of capital adequacy.

Raising thresholds would create an incentive  for banks to increase capital levels. According to our previous work  and the work of others, by holding more capital, a bank would have a  greater capacity to absorb losses and remain solvent, particularly when  a financial crisis occurred. Similarly, with more capital, banks should  be able to survive higher levels of borrower defaults. Thus, if banks  were required to hold more capital, this might limit losses to the DIF in  the event of failure by shifting risks from the DIF and taxpayers to the  providers of capital, according to researchers.

Instead, regulators decided to take risky  asset concentrations into account during bank examinations. Additionally,  FDIA (section 39) requires banking regulators to prescribe safety and  soundness standards related to noncapital criteria, including operations  and management; compensation; and asset quality, earnings, and stock  valuations, allowing regulators to take action if a bank fails to meet one or  more of these standards. Initially, the standards for asset quality and  earnings were to be quantitative and intended to increase the likelihood  that regulators would address safety and soundness problems before  capital deteriorated.

In turn,  PCA has not achieved a principal goal of preventing widespread losses to  the DIF when banks fail.", "Weaknesses in the current PCA framework stem primarily from tying  mandatory corrective actions to only capital-based indicators. We and  others have argued since 1991 that capital-based indicators have  weaknesses, particularly because they do not provide timely warnings of  bank distress. A number of alternative indicators exist or could be  developed, and their advantages derive primarily from the early warnings  of distress they could provide. In particular, a composite indicator can  integrate information from a number of noncapital indicators in a single  number. Regulators have stressed that the effectiveness of the PCA  framework depended on making early and forceful use of other  enforcement tools. However, while regulators have their own authorities  and PCA also authorizes other discretionary actions, the regulators have  not used these enforcement tools consistently. Tying mandatory corrective  actions to additional indicators could mitigate these current weaknesses  of PCA and increase the consistency with which distressed banks would  be treated. And, enhancing the PCA framework in such a way would allow  both regulators and banks more time to address deteriorating conditions.  More important, banks facing such corrective actions likely would not be  in as weakened a condition as typically is the case when current capital  thresholds are triggered. Thus, the banks might have more options  available to them to bolster their safety and soundness and avoid failure.

As the expert  stakeholders noted and we also recognize, making any changes to the PCA  framework would entail some trade-offs. Specifically, regulators would  have to strike a balance between more corrective actions and unnecessary  intervention in healthy banks. The Financial Stability Oversight Council  could provide a forum for vetting changes to the PCA framework and  proposing these changes to Congress.

According to section  13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the resolution method  FDIC selects must be the alternative that is least costly to the insurance  fund, except in cases involving systemic risk where FDIC may take other  action for the purpose of winding up the insured depository institution for  which the FDIC has been appointed receiver as necessary to avoid or  mitigate such effects. To select the least costly method, FDIC compares  the estimated cost of liquidation\u2014basically, the amount of insured  deposits FDIC must pay minus the net realizable value of a bank\u2019s assets\u2014 with the amounts that potential acquirers bid for the bank\u2019s assets and  deposits. The most common resolution method for failing banks is the  purchase and assumption transaction, in which a healthy bank purchases  certain assets and assumes certain liabilities of a failed bank. FDIC sells  banks through a purchase and assumption transaction unless another  approach is less costly to the DIF.", "According to FDIC, their ability to influence the cost of bank failures to  the DIF is limited, but FDIC said certain resolution methods helped  minimize losses. FDIC\u2019s Division of Resolutions and Receiverships (DRR)  told us that the cost of a bank failure to the DIF is embedded in the  financial position of the failed bank. According to FDIC DRR, factors  (beyond the resolution process) that affect the cost of a bank failure are  both internal and external to the failed bank. For instance, the stability of  the bank\u2019s funding sources\u2014that is, the degree to which the bank has a  stable base of customers rather than \u201cbrokered\u201d or bulk deposits from out- of-state institutional investors\u2014is a key internal factor. The quality of the  bank\u2019s assets (for example, the proportion of its loans that carry a high  risk of default) is a second, key internal factor. External factors such as  wider economic conditions and the risk appetite of potential buyers also  affect the cost of a bank failure.", "FDIC DRR officials told us that although the cost of a bank failure is  largely fixed by the time of failure, the manner of resolution can affect  losses to the DIF \u201cin the margin.\u201d In an effort to minimize these losses,  FDIC DRR customized purchase and assumption transactions, which it  used to sell 254 of the 270 banks that failed after undergoing the PCA  process, to the needs of the market. In a purchase and assumption  transaction, a healthy bank purchases certain assets and assumes certain  liabilities of a failed bank. The specific composition of the transaction  depends on the assets and liabilities held by the failed bank as well as  wider market conditions. FDIC may offer to sell acquirers (1) the whole  failed bank; (2) the whole failed bank with a shared-loss agreement, an  arrangement whereby FDIC, with the intent of limiting losses to the  deposit insurance fund, agrees to share with the acquirer the losses on  those assets; (3) less than whole bank with a shared-loss agreement; or (4)  a clean transfer (cash, securities, and insured deposits). FDIC DRR  resolved the remaining 16 of the 270 banks that failed after being subject  to PCA through direct payout, a scenario in which FDIC pays depositors  directly and places the assets of the failed bank in a receivership.", "Beyond tailoring purchase and assumption transactions to the needs of the  market, FDIC DRR pursued strategies based on the rationale that the long- term intrinsic value of the assets of failed banks exceeded their depressed  market value. Examples are the FDIC structured transaction program, in  which FDIC acts as a receiver and partners with a private-sector  institution to dispose of assets from failed banks. According to FDIC DRR,  this program enables FDIC to take advantage of private-sector knowledge  while recouping future cash flows from the failed bank. FDIC also sought  to increase the value of distressed assets through a loan modification  program. In this program, FDIC works with failed banks to modify rather  than foreclose on residential mortgages. This reduces the number of  borrowers who face foreclosure and rehabilitates inactive mortgages into  performing loans.", "FDIC DRR told us that it used shared-loss agreements to increase the  value of distressed assets and protect the DIF. When market values were  falling, in 2008, FDIC DRR\u2019s valuations of failed banks were too high to  attract bidders. As its backlog of banks grew, FDIC DRR adopted a loss- share approach in which it sold a pool of problem assets to an acquirer  under an agreement that FDIC would share a portion of the losses. This  structure allowed FDIC to reduce the immediate cash outlays for the  transaction. Figure 15 illustrates the increase in shared-loss agreements  from 2007 through the third quarter of 2010. According to FDIC, these  shared-loss agreements enabled FDIC to transfer failed banks to a private- sector acquirer, an outcome that cost the fund less than liquidation of the  failed bank.", "FDIC DRR told us that as the economy improved in 2010, it received bids  for failed banks that included no loss-share agreement. For shared-loss  agreements that FDIC did offer in this time period, it shifted more risk to  bidders.

The rationale for each of these indicators is described in  table 6 below.", "We found that the equity capital measure from the literature evolved in a  way that was quite similar to certain regulatory capital measures (see fig.  16) for banks that ultimately failed. The correlation between the aggregate  equity capital measure and the leverage ratio was 0.99; the correlation with  the tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 0.97.", "Given the attention to commercial real estate concentrations during this  crisis, we developed a more generic measure of loan concentration as a  potential leading indicator. The Bank for International Settlements and  Deutsche Bundesbank have described how a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index  (HHI) could be used to measure loan concentration. We adopted a version  based on sectors defined below. This is an imperfect measure of  concentration because it does not account for the correlations between  the various sectors and with the overall economy. However, an HHI is a  useful and straightforward indicator of credit concentration. All else being  equal, it should be associated with greater risk and there may therefore be  associated with a greater likelihood of failure. We define two possible  HHIs based on two different sector definitions (identical except for one  distinction\u2014in HHI 1 multifamily residential real estate is included with  one-four family residential real estate, and in HHI 2 it is included with  commercial real estate):    HHI 1: Sector shares are defined as acquisition, development, and  construction loans (ADC) plus nonfarm nonresidential real estate  (commercial real estate, or CRE, narrowly defined), residential real  estate (including one-four family and multifamily  real  estate), consumer loans, loans to farms plus agricultural production  loans, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, and other (a residual).", "HHI 2: Sector shares are defined as ADC loans plus nonfarm  nonresidential real estate (CRE narrowly defined) plus multifamily  residential real estate loans (these three sectors are similar to the  broad definition of CRE used in the joint CRE concentration guidance  that the federal banking regulators issued), one-four family residential  real estate loans, consumer loans, loans to farms plus agricultural  production loans, C&I loans, and other (a residual).", "We identified failed banks and dates of failure based on FDIC data.

Concentration in the CRE sector in particular could explain the predictive  power of the concentration index because of the recent downturn in CRE.  As evident in tables 11 and 12 below, while CRE is predictive of bank  failure, HHI 2 remains predictive after controlling for CRE concentration,  though the coefficient is smaller and less significant than the model in  table 10.", "Next we estimated a model with HHI 2 at the eight-quarter horizon.

CAMELS ratings remain a highly statistically  significant predictor of bank failure when added to a regression with capital,  earnings, nonperforming loans, securities, unstable funding, and the  concentration index, though unsurprisingly the coefficient is somewhat less  significant than on its own. Thus CAMELS ratings contain information that  is not fully accounted for by the financial indicators we have identified and  included in the regression, and vice versa.", "Finally, we estimated marginal effect of a one-rating increase  (deterioration) in the CAMELS rating based on the coefficients in table 15.
