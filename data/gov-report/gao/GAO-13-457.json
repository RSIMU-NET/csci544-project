Now known as AbilityOne, the program\u0092s public-private structure consists of the federal, independent U.S. AbilityOne Commission (15 part-time presidentially-appointed members supported by 27 staff) to oversee the program; two central nonprofit agencies (CNAs) to administer much of the program; and hundreds of affiliated nonprofit companies employing people who are blind or severely disabled to provide products and services to federal agencies. Federal agencies are generally required to purchase such products and services through the program.", "GAO examined how the AbilityOne Commission: (1) directs and oversees the CNAs; (2) adds products and services (hereafter called projects) to the program and assigns affiliates to provide them; and (3) prices program projects. GAO reviewed policies, procedures, relevant federal laws and regulations, and other documents; interviewed CNA and AbilityOne officials; held five focus groups with affiliates; and analyzed data on program products, services, and pricing reviews."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies need to exercise strong oversight to promote effectiveness and efficiency and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse--especially in a federal procurement program such as this, which is exempt from full and open competition requirements. However, although the AbilityOne Commission is ultimately responsible for overseeing the program, the Commission cannot control how CNAs (1) spend their funds, (2) set and manage their performance goals, or (3) set and implement governance policies and other internal controls. The Commission's authority to direct CNA budget priorities--including how much they compensate their executives and the level and growth of their reserves--is limited. As independent entities, the CNAs are responsible for determining their spending. Most of their money comes from fees they charge their affiliates as a percent of revenue earned from AbilityOne contracts. Moreover, the Commission does not have sufficient authority to set CNA performance and governance standards, so it depends on the CNAs to set and enforce such standards. Although the CNAs have instituted their own internal controls, the Commission does not have procedures to monitor alleged CNA control violations, nor is there an inspector general to provide independent audit and investigative capabilities for the program, including at the CNAs.", "The AbilityOne Commission is responsible for determining which products and services can be suitably provided by the program. It delegates to the CNAs most of the responsibility for deciding which affiliates should develop and provide these projects. According to CNA and affiliate officials, the CNAs often do not fully disclose how they make these decisions. This limited transparency could increase the risk of biased decisions because CNA officials have wide latitude in determining which affiliate should be awarded a project. Although AbilityOne Commission officials have acknowledged the importance of transparency and equity in assigning projects, they have done little to indicate how these outcomes can be achieved.", "The Commission has statutory responsibility for determining the fair market price of projects in the program, but: (1) its written pricing review policies and procedures are limited and (2) it does not have sufficient internal controls to ensure that prices are appropriately revised over time. The Commission sets procedures that encourage affiliates and federal customers to negotiate prices that reflect the market. Although Commission staff review these prices in accordance with written policies and procedures, they acknowledged that these instructions are not sufficiently explicit or transparent. Such limitations can make it difficult for the CNAs and affiliates to understand the Commission's pricing review procedures and, by extension, its reasons for rejecting prices. This lack of understanding may partially explain the 77 percent rejection rate for initial pricing packages. Commission policy also states that CNAs submit for Commission review any request for adjusting the price of a project beyond a single contract period that does not conform with the prior Commission-approved mechanism. Occasionally customers and affiliates implement non-conforming price revisions without requesting Commission approval. This negates the Commission's internal controls for ensuring fair market prices and results in the Commission not knowing the actual price being charged. Neither the AbilityOne Commission nor the CNAs have procedures in place to systematically identify such instances."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["We are presenting a matter for Congressional consideration to establish an inspector general and several recommendations to the Commission to enhance program oversight.

Congress created this program in 1938 and it is now the  single largest source of employment for people who are blind or have  severe disabilities. In fiscal year 2012, this program provided jobs for  approximately 48,000 such individuals and accounted for about $2.8  billion of federal procurements.", "The AbilityOne Program relies on nonprofit agencies to employ people  who are blind or have severe disabilities. These nearly 600 independent  nonprofit affiliates are assisted by one of two private Central Nonprofit  Agencies (CNAs): the National Industries for the Blind (NIB), which  supports the creation of employment opportunities for people who are  blind, and NISH, which supports the creation of employment opportunities  for people with severe disabilities other than blindness. The U.S.  AbilityOne Commission oversees the CNAs and is ultimately responsible  for the performance of the program. The CNAs, in turn, manage much of  the day-to-day operations of the program, including working with affiliates  to identify and recommend products and services that the Commission  may want to add to the program and providing training and other support  to their affiliates.", "Federal agencies are required to obtain the products and services they  need through the use of full and open competitive procedures, unless  otherwise authorized by law. Full and open competition promotes  transparency and integrity within the federal procurement system  because it allows for all responsible businesses that meet a customer\u2019s  stated requirements to submit proposals in response to that customer\u2019s  request for the product or service. In contrast, products and services  procured through the AbilityOne Program are exempt from full and open  competition requirements, but ensuring that the program is managed  transparently and with integrity remains critically important. Such  accountability must be ensured through appropriate levels of oversight  and reporting of program operations. This includes overseeing the overall  management and operations of the CNAs as well as ensuring that key  program functions\u2014such as determining which affiliate is assigned to provide a project and the pricing of those projects\u2014are transparent. Without this accountability, it is impossible to know the extent to which  this uniquely structured public-private program is truly benefiting the blind  and other persons with severe disabilities and whether federal customers  are charged fair prices for the products and services they receive.", "In light of the program\u2019s importance in creating employment opportunities  for the disabled and its unique public-private structure, you asked us to  examine some key aspects of the program\u2019s oversight. We focused on  the following questions:  1.  How does the AbilityOne Commission direct and oversee the CNAs  and what limitations may exist with this oversight?  2.  How are products and services added to the AbilityOne Program and  how are providers of such projects assigned?  3.  What processes does the AbilityOne Program follow when pricing  projects?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed the policies and procedures of  the AbilityOne Commission and the CNAs, as well as their relevant  reports, including annual business plans, annual financial statements and  budget justifications, strategic plans, compensation studies, IRS Form  990s, as well as relevant federal laws and regulations. We also  interviewed officials from the AbilityOne Commission (members of the  presidentially appointed Commission and senior staff) as well as officials  from both CNAs (members of their boards of directors, senior executives,  and senior staff). These interviews focused on: (1) how projects are  added to the program, assigned to affiliates, and priced; (2) how the  Commission oversees the CNAs; (3) concerns about project assignment,  pricing, and oversight; and (4) how these concerns could be addressed.  In addition, we spoke with 10 directors or managers of NISH affiliates  about their perspectives on the AbilityOne Program and used this input in  part to develop and conduct five focus groups. We conducted the focus  groups with both NISH and NIB affiliates. To ensure that we obtained a  range of viewpoints from the focus groups, four groups that we convened  included affiliates that varied by size as well as their affiliated-CNA. The  fifth focus group included affiliate directors who had appealed project  assignment decisions. We spoke with 35 affiliates in all, in groups of 5 to  10. These group discussions focused on obtaining perspectives regarding  the program in general and processes and practices associated with  assigning and pricing projects in particular. To review the distribution of  projects, we analyzed AbilityOne data on what projects were produced  within the program and which affiliates produced them as of the end of  fiscal year 2012. We assessed the reliability of these data and determined  that they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Finally, we analyzed  information from the Commission on the number and types of pricing  reviews conducted between January 1, 2012 and December 10, 2012  (the latest period for which the Commission has data) and the outcome of  these reviews.", "We conducted our work between February 2012 and May 2013, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Both CNAs have basic  eligibility criteria that all affiliates must meet or they will be disqualified  from pursuing a potential project.

On the one hand, AbilityOne and  CNA officials said that the program could benefit from spreading projects  widely among its affiliates. Under this scenario, the program would not be  as reliant on the capabilities of a few affiliates to hire people who are blind  or have severe disabilities. Such a broad bench of affiliates may reduce  the possibility of the program losing a federal customer if a producing  affiliate becomes unable to provide a project because the project could be  transferred to another affiliate within the program that had similar or  potentially similar capabilities and capacity. On the other hand,  Commission and CNA officials also said there could be benefits from a  completely different distribution that assigned relatively more projects to  some of the largest affiliates. Larger affiliates typically have more  experience and their size creates economies of scale necessary to  provide large projects, such as computer destruction or contract closeout  services for an entire federal agency or program within an agency.", "We analyzed fiscal year 2012 program data and found that while the  largest affiliates represent a minority of the AbilityOne affiliates, they hold  the majority of projects.

For example,  they told us that small affiliates cannot devote as many resources to  business development or may only have the capacity to compete for  projects in their local area. Affiliates also said that CNAs may not select  them because of a perceived lack of work experience in a new line of  business. Indeed, one affiliate told us it provides janitorial services and,  despite efforts to expand into other businesses, it could not persuade its  CNA to consider it for anything other than janitorial contracts. AbilityOne  and CNA officials told us that while they try to give opportunities to  smaller, less experienced firms, opportunities for smaller affiliates may be  reduced when other factors are taken into account, such as a federal  customer\u2019s preference for a larger, more experienced contractor."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The AbilityOne Commission Has Final Approval of Project Prices, but Procedures Could Be Strengthened", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Commission\u2019s Review and Approval of Price Recommendations for New Projects Lacks Transparency", "paragraphs": ["While the AbilityOne Commission is ultimately responsible for determining  the fair market price of projects in the program, it permits the CNAs,  affiliates, and federal customers to negotiate pricing and recommend a  fair market price for each project.

As a result, according to Commission staff, a  project\u2019s price under the AbilityOne Program is not necessarily the lowest  possible price, but it also isn\u2019t the highest possible price. Commission  guidance holds that the fair market price should include the CNA fee.", "In addition, the Commission recognizes  The process for determining the price of a project begins when an affiliate  and federal customer are developing a potential project for the program  and ends when that project is added to the Procurement List (see fig. 6).", "Commission staff review the CNA pricing package in step 3 of the  process. This review is a key control intended to ensure a fair market  price. Between January 1, 2012 and December 10, 2012, the  Commission received 336 new packages for price review. As shown in  figure 7, staff recommended 78 to Commission members for final  approval (23 percent). Staff rejected the pricing proposed in the other 258  pricing packages (77 percent), primarily because of insufficient  documentation, but in some instances because they found the price too  high. The CNAs and affiliates have the option of revising and resubmitting  the rejected packages. After working with the CNAs, affiliates, and  customers, as necessary, to produce better documentation or a revised  price, staff recommended that Commission members approve the revised  packages of 116 proposals. For the last several years, the Commission  has approved all pricing packages the staff have recommended because  they agreed with their staffs\u2019 recommendations.", "Commission staff told us that they consider various factors when  reviewing recommended prices, such as whether negotiations between  the federal customer and affiliate are sufficiently documented. Staff also  told us that they conduct research to determine whether the  recommended price in a project addition package conforms with the  pricing for similar goods and services available from public sources, and if  not, whether the project addition package contains a sufficient  explanation for these differences. Commission staff also told us that they  conduct these reviews in accordance with written policies and  procedures, but acknowledged that these instructions are not sufficiently  explicit and transparent. Such limitations can make it difficult for the CNAs  and affiliates to understand how and why decisions are made. CNA  managers and some affiliates told us, for example, that they sometimes  do not understand the Commission\u2019s price reviewing procedures and by  extension, its reasons for rejecting prices. This lack of understanding  about Commission reviews of recommended prices may partially explain  the relatively high rejection rate of initial packages (see fig. 7). More  explicit and transparent written policies and procedures on pricing reviews  might include, for example, a checklist of what Commission staff should  look for when assessing prices and a list of red flags that could indicate  when recommended prices might be too high. Clearly-communicated  price review procedures, including a discussion about the protocols the  Commission uses to review pricing packages, could result in better- prepared pricing packages and therefore fewer rejections and less  rework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Commission\u2019s Pricing Revision Process Has Not Ensured Approval of All Price Revisions", "paragraphs": ["According to AbilityOne policy, all projects that extend beyond a single  contract period must include a mechanism for adjusting the price.

According to CNA officials,  periodic negotiations between the affiliate and the customer are the most  common price revision mechanism. If a price revision conforms to the  originally approved mechanism, the affiliate and customer implement the  revision without seeking Commission approval or submitting  documentation of the revision to the Commission. However, if the change  in price does not conform to the originally approved mechanism,  Commission policy directs affiliates to prepare a price revision request  package, which the CNA submits to the Commission for staff approval.", "Between January 1, 2012, and December 10, 2012, Commission staff  reviewed 569 packages for non-conforming price revisions (see fig. 8).  Commission staff initially approved 216 of these packages (38 percent)  and, after a subsequent review, approved an additional 157. Commission  staff rejected 196 of the price revision packages, none of which had been  resubmitted at the time of our review. Commission staff told us that they  might reject a price revision for a variety of reasons. Staff might see an  anomaly in the request, such as a price that is increasing much faster  than either (1) the original terms of the contract specified for future year  price changes or (2) research indicates that it should be changing.  Affiliates and their federal customers have the option to resubmit their  requests with additional information or clarifications.", "Commission staff and CNA officials reported that they do not have  procedures in place to ensure that affiliates comply with the policy that  affiliates report to the Commission, through their CNA, any price revisions  that do not conform with approved contract pricing mechanisms. If the  Commission becomes aware of unreported price revisions, staff told us  that they contact the affiliate and federal customer to attempt to resolve  the situation, typically by asking for an immediate price revision package.  Commission staff told us that unreported price revisions are a recurring  problem, and provided us with three examples of price increases that  should have been reported between 2 months and 19 years ago.  Although they were not able to estimate the number of times such  unreported increases occurred, they said that its recurring nature causes  them concern. CNAs collect information on current prices, but the  Commission does not require them to submit this information to the  Commission. If the Commission had this information, it could  electronically compare the current prices to the data it maintains on the  approved prices and thus have assurances that controls were met.  Failure to submit price revision requests to the Commission before raising  prices (1) negates the Commission\u2019s internal controls that ensure that  affiliates are charging fair market prices and (2) means that the  Commission does not have accurate data regarding the prices that are  actually being used within the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The AbilityOne Program is one of many federal programs designed to  help people with disabilities find employment.

The Commission added that it will establish or enhance and  disseminate policies and procedures regarding CNA oversight and  internal controls and anticipates that this will be completed in fiscal year  2014.", "While NIB agreed with our recommendations to the Commission, NIB  disagreed with our finding that the Commission has limited control over  CNA spending. NIB highlighted several tools which it believes show that  the Commission\u2019s controls are sufficient, such as the Commission\u2019s ability  to set fee limits for the CNAs and provide guidance for, and review of,  CNA budgets and performance. The report discusses these tools and  presents evidence as to why we believe they are not sufficient for the  Commission to oversee CNA spending. Both CNAs cited other controls  that contribute to the oversight of their budgets. We cited examples of  these other controls in the report, including IRS reporting requirements for  nonprofit agencies and such CNA internal controls as undergoing annual  independent financial audits. However, IRS and CNA internal controls  cannot replace Commission oversight because the Commission is the  entity that is most knowledgeable about the program\u2019s regulations and is  ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations and  for the stewardship of the program.", "The Commission and the two CNAs commented on CNA reserve levels.  The Commission provided some additional clarification on its written  guidance for reserves and actions taken, which we incorporated into the  report. NISH disagreed with the statement that the CNAs have been  accumulating reserve funds. However, our analysis of certified financial  statements for NISH and NIB shows that (1) the annual reserves for NISH  for fiscal years 2008 to 2012, as well as its reserve projection for fiscal  year 2013, continued to grow and (2) NIB\u2019s reserves declined slightly in  2011and 2013 (see fig. 3). NISH also disagreed with the statement that  the CNAs have not provided the Commission with financial analyses that  support their levels of reserves and reserve policies. However, the  statement in the report to which NISH refers actually focuses on actions  of the Commission and we have clarified this in the report. This statement  indicates that the Commission has not developed guidance about what  the CNAs should consider when setting reserve policies nor determined  what financial information the CNAs should provide to it to fully support  their reserve levels. NISH and NIB cited the criteria they took to establish  their reserve policies and levels in their comments.", "NISH disagreed with the Commission\u2019s position that the Commission  lacks the authority to require and enforce program improvements. During  the course of our work, Commission officials noted that the Commission  has very little explicit authority to regulate the CNAs and, as a result of  this lack of authority, said they have not taken additional action to expand  the Commission\u2019s oversight in ways that may be beneficial to the  program.  They said that, without additional oversight tools, they have few  ways to enforce regulations. For example, although they could remove a  CNA as an administrator of the program for noncompliance or  significantly reduce its fees, such approaches could be highly disruptive  to the program and the people it serves. Thus, depending on the  infraction in question, they could be reluctant to use them. Because an  agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulatory authority under the laws it is  charged with administering is generally to be afforded deference, we  did not make any changes to our report.  However, we note that it may  be beneficial for the Commission to engage with NISH on this issue as  it takes steps to implement our recommendations, particularly the one  focusing on entering into written agreements.", "NIB disagreed with our finding that the Commission has limited oversight  and control over areas such as CNA performance, governance, and  internal controls. NIB\u2019s comments on this topic generally provided  additional information about NIB\u2019s governance structure and controls and  did not directly address the Commission\u2019s level of authority and control.  However, in response to NIB\u2019s comments, along with additional  clarification from a NIB official, we revised the report to make clear that  NIB does not allow board members who are executives or employees of a  NIB affiliate to serve as a Board officer, but those individuals can serve on  the Board.", "The Commission agreed with our recommendation that it take additional  action to ensure that CNAs\u2019 processes of assigning projects to affiliated  agencies result in a transparent and equitable distribution. The  Commission noted that it has already initiated a review of CNA  assignment policies as part of a larger review of procedures across the  entire AbilityOne Program and that it will build our recommendations into  the deliberative process. The Commission added that the target  completion date for this review and development of procedures is no later  than June 2014.", "Both CNAs disagreed that their processes for assigning projects to  affiliates were not transparent. NIB stated that the primary factor it uses  when making assignment decisions is the potential to positively impact  employment for people who are blind and NISH stated that it ensures  transparency through several actions, including posting all notices of  project opportunities on its website. However, we continue to believe that  greater transparency is needed for the reasons stated in the report,  including to address the concerns of some affiliates that: (1) they do not  understand how the CNAs prioritize the criteria used to evaluate their  proposals; (2) NISH applies its criteria inconsistently across its regions,  and (3) NIB does not notify all of its affiliates about potential project  opportunities it is considering for the program. NISH also stated that it  disagreed with what it believed to be our assessment that CNA  assignment processes are biased. We did not, however, state that these  processes are biased; rather, we stated that some affiliates view them as  biased. Greater transparency can help organizations address concerns of  bias. NISH also provided additional information about its assignment  processes that we incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "The Commission and NISH provided comments about the distribution of  projects among affiliates. The Commission noted that it will increase its  emphasis and attention to mentoring the smaller affiliates so that they can  more fully participate in the program. The Commission also suggested  that we note that factors other than an affiliate\u2019s size can influence the  number of projects affiliates are assigned in the program. We agree, but  did not make any revisions to the report in this regard because we had  already discussed such factors in the draft. NISH noted that it assigned  more projects to its smaller affiliates in fiscal year 2012 than in prior  years. However, because it is not clear how the distribution of projects  among affiliates affects the creation of employment opportunities for  people who are blind or have severe disabilities, it is not currently known  whether assigning more projects to smaller affiliates is the most effective  path for the program to pursue.", "The Commission suggested that we modify the wording of our finding on  the extent of the Commission\u2019s knowledge about how project assignment  affects employment opportunities for its target population. The  Commission noted that, while it is presented with information on the  number of employment opportunities a proposed project will generate, it  does not track the number of overall employment opportunities realized.  In response, we revised the wording to clarify that the Commission does  not track how the program\u2019s distribution of projects affects job creation for  its target population. NIB reiterated several aspects about the process of  adding projects to the Procurement List. In response to these comments  we now more explicitly note that the Commission relies on CNA  recommendations when adding projects to the Procurement List and  votes on whether to approve CNA-recommended affiliates as project  providers at the Procurement List addition stage.", "The Commission agreed with our two recommendations for Commission  actions to improve pricing reviews.  However, the Commission took  exception with our statement that Commission staff do not have written  policies and procedures for reviewing pricing packages. The Commission  stated that staff do have such written instructions and we confirmed this  statement and revised the report to incorporate this information.   Nonetheless, the Commission agreed with our assessment that its pricing  review procedures are not sufficiently explicit or transparent and that this  can make it difficult for the CNAs and affiliates to prepare acceptable  pricing packages. The Commission noted, however, that the extent to  which Commission reviews of pricing packages can be transparent is  limited by the fact that such reviews are often based upon sensitive  information that is not releasable to the CNAs or affiliates. We agree, but  continue to believe that the Commission can increase the transparency of  its pricing review processes.", "As agreed with your offices, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Chairperson of the U.S. AbilityOne  Commission, the President and CEO of NISH, the President and CEO of  NIB, and other interested parties.
