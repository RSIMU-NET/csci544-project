Under its system, the Eximbank places each borrower/guarantor in one of eight country risk categories\u2014A, B, C, C-, D, D-, E, and E-. Fee rates are based primarily on the assessed risk of the particular credit and the repayment term of the transaction.

The Eximbank periodically revises its fee levels to help ensure that they appropriately reflect credit risks and, at the same time, remain competitive with those of other ECAs.

Our analysis shows that the Eximbank could have reduced its subsidy costs by about $63 million if it had set its fees to be as low as or lower than 55-60 percent of the fees charged by other major ECAs for sovereign financing in the same importing country markets. We used Eximbank program authorization data for fiscal year 1995, Eximbank fee data, and the same OMB financial model that the Eximbank uses to calculate its subsidy costs. To perform this analysis, we modeled the effects of raising fees by different percentage rates while holding all other variables in the OMB model constant, such as the dollar value of Eximbank-supported transactions, the interest rate, and the repayment term. Using the same methodology, we estimated that the Eximbank could have achieved approximately $35 million in subsidy savings by setting its fees so that overall, they were as low as or lower than about 65-70 percent of the fees for sovereign financing charged by its major ECA competitors in the same markets, and approximately $84 million in savings by setting fees so that they were as low or lower than about 45-50 percent of the fees charged by these competitors.

These include both external factors (those that contribute to the overall demand for Eximbank support) and factors that are, to a greater extent, within the control of the Eximbank, such as the fees it charges and other technical program characteristics. Although interest rates and repayment terms for export credits (i.e., direct loans) are elements of cost competitiveness, they are highly constrained by the provisions of the OECD\u2019s Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credit. These provisions limit the variability of interest rates charged and repayment terms allowed by member ECAs. Since exposure fees charged for loans, loan guarantees, and insurance are now excluded from the OECD Arrangement, differences in fees are the most significant factor accounting for program cost differences between the Eximbank and other ECAs.", "When we asked Eximbank officials about the prospects for future fee increases, they responded that the Eximbank had raised fees in August 1994 and expressed concerns about how future increases would affect U.S. export competitiveness. They said that should the Eximbank lower its \u201ccompetitiveness target,\u201d the number of instances in which U.S. exporters would risk losing sales as a result of uncompetitive financing would also increase. At the same time, Eximbank officials said it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the impact of fee changes on exporter behavior, because exporters\u2019 sensitivity to fee changes would vary by transaction.", "As noted earlier, Eximbank fees are generally as low as or lower than those of its major competitors in most country markets. In some of the higher-risk markets, the Eximbank\u2019s fee advantage over some of its competitors is even greater. For example, Eximbank fees are as low as or lower than those of its major competitors for about 85 percent of medium-term transactions in high-risk markets. Thus, we believe it would be possible for the Eximbank to further offset subsidy costs by raising fees while remaining competitive relative to other major ECAs. For instance, if fees were set at the 65-percent competitiveness level, Eximbank fees would still be as low as or lower than those of other ECAs in 65 percent of the same importing country markets, and the proportion of cases in which its fees would be higher than other ECAs would increase from 25 percent to 35 percent.", "The trade implications of increasing the Eximbank\u2019s fees are uncertain and would depend in part on the magnitude and timing of such action. It is possible that charging higher fees would result in an incremental reduction in program participation on the part of U.S. exporters selling to some higher-risk markets. However, the overall impact of Eximbank fee increases are speculative. U.S. exporters\u2019 sensitivity to a fee increase would depend on factors such as the size of the fee increase, the volume of U.S. exports to a particular market, and the risk of the importing market.

The OECD has promoted efforts to limit government subsidies and provide common guidelines for national export-financing assistance programs. The OECD\u2019s Arrangement sets terms and conditions for government-supported export credits and has been progressively strengthened since it was first established in 1978.

The working group\u2019s goal is to develop guiding principles for setting fees, among other issues, before the 1997 OECD Ministerial Meeting. As part of this overall effort to gradually reduce government export finance subsidies, OECD members have tentatively agreed to work toward creating member export financing systems that include, among other things, (1) risk-based premiums (defined to include exposure fees) based on a common reference country classification system, (2) premiums that are set high enough to cover long-term operating costs and losses, and (3) establishment of a fee benchmarking system. According to an Eximbank official, it is hoped that these negotiations will eventually lead to an agreement for fee convergence that would allow for reductions in the costs of OECD members\u2019 officially supported export financing programs. The agreement would be implemented after an appropriate transition period.", "The U.S. government is an advocate for reaching an OECD agreement in this area.

Representatives of trade associations that we interviewed also stated that greater risk-sharing requirements will frustrate the small businesses that have fewer options to structure alternative financing than do large firms.

Before that, it offered 95-percent loan guarantees on interest.", "Similar objections about increased private sector risk-sharing requirements were raised when the Eximbank reduced its risk coverage on its export working capital guarantee program from 100 percent to  90 percent of principal and interest in September 1994. However, U.S. exporters and their commercial lenders continued to use this program at an increased rate after these changes went into effect. The volume of Eximbank export working capital loan guarantees increased 99 percent from fiscal year 1994 to fiscal year 1995.", "U.S. banks that we interviewed acknowledged that they utilize the services of competitor ECAs that generally provide less than 100-percent risk coverage in support of their trade finance activities.", "Private sector lenders and a representative of Moody\u2019s Investor Services stated that Eximbank-backed loans with less than 100 percent cover could still be securitized, although the structure and pricing of the security would reflect the higher marginal risk associated with the reduced U.S. government cover."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Project Finance Program Provides Opportunities for Potential Subsidy Reduction", "paragraphs": ["Project financing is a rapidly expanding export financing mechanism that the Eximbank is using to meet the needs of U.S. exporters and project sponsors while taking advantage of the growth of privatization and private sector-oriented reforms in various developing countries. It involves lending for major capital projects where the assurance of repayment is provided through the project\u2019s structure and anticipated future revenues rather than through sovereign or other forms of guarantee. In contrast to traditional Eximbank financing, the Eximbank and lending institutions depend primarily upon the financial success of the project for the repayment of loan principal and interest. Project financing provides the Eximbank considerable flexibility in stipulating which risks it will assume on a project-by-project basis, thus permitting the government to reduce risk and subsidy usage.", "Eximbank project financing support is generally available in A through D risk markets, is available in E markets only in limited circumstances, and is not available in E- markets. Project finance requires a relatively stable legal and commercial environment in the host country in order for risk mitigation of the project to be possible. Some high-risk markets do not yet have the legal and commercial structures that would make project finance possible. Once a project is completed, the Eximbank provides the same level of risk coverage, that is, 100 percent guarantees, under its project finance program as is currently available in its traditional program\u2014but only for the share of the project that is financed by the Eximbank. During the project construction period, the Eximbank provides only political risk coverage; other risks are assumed by the private sector.", "The Eximbank\u2019s policy is that the project sponsor and other participants must assume a portion of the entire project risk and all or most of the commercial and technical risks during the construction phase of an infrastructure project. The Eximbank may also share project risks with other ECAs, multilateral institutions such as the International Finance Corporation, or OPIC. The Eximbank may also look for opportunities to establish hard currency escrow accounts outside the project country for certain projects and seek other risk mitigation to protect taxpayer interests and to reduce the associated subsidy costs. According to the Eximbank, if properly structured, these techniques can lower the risks for the Eximbank that would otherwise be involved in supporting these transactions in risky countries. Because this program is fairly new, it is too early to determine if budget estimates are accurate.", "Under the project finance program, many of the administrative costs that the Eximbank traditionally incurs in evaluating a project\u2019s financial, legal, and technical risks are to be borne by the private sector rather than the Eximbank. When the Eximbank assumes any risks, private sector project participants are expected to pay premiums that compensate the government for most of these risks. However, the Eximbank\u2019s ultimate flexibility in passing these costs on to the private sector may be constrained by the level of fees charged by competitor ECAs.", "Eximbank officials told us that the Eximbank\u2019s goal is to structure project financing transactions in a manner that will ultimately require no taxpayer subsidy. Although the Eximbank has yet to meet this program goal, the average subsidy rate for project finance transactions was lower than the overall subsidy rate incurred for all Eximbank transactions in 1996. In that year, the average budgetary cost for project finance deals was about 3 percent, whereas the average cost for all Eximbank-supported transactions was 7.5 percent. According to Eximbank officials, the Eximbank\u2019s success in meeting this goal will ultimately depend on its willingness and ability to limit risk in high-risk transactions while complementing, but not competing with, the private sector.", "The Eximbank\u2019s project finance program has expanded over the past few years and has accounted for an increasing proportion of Eximbank transactions. In 1993, project finance accounted for less than 1 percent of the Eximbank\u2019s total financing commitments. By fiscal year 1995, project finance constituted almost 20 percent of the Eximbank\u2019s total financing commitments. The Eximbank attributes this growth to developing countries\u2019 emphasis on privatization, their need to reduce sovereign debt obligations, and the rapid economic growth in emerging markets. As shown in figure 6, Eximbank project financing commitments expanded from $150 million in 1993 to $2.1 billion in fiscal year 1995\u2014the program\u2019s first full year of operation. Eximbank project financing declined slightly, to $1.7 billion, in fiscal year 1996.", "From fiscal year 1993 to 1995, the Eximbank approved a total of 11 project finance transactions valued at more than $2.6 billion. Six of these projects were located in Asia, four in Latin America, and one in Europe. These projects were generally located in countries that the Eximbank rates as medium-risk category countries and were mostly power generation infrastructure projects.", "The growth of project financing is consistent with the Eximbank\u2019s expanded financing of exports to private sector buyers in developing countries. According to Eximbank officials, in fiscal year 1992, 71 percent of the Eximbank\u2019s financing commitments were used to support foreign public sector purchasers, while 29 percent was used to support foreign private sector purchasers in emerging markets around the world. By fiscal year 1995, the ratio was reversed\u2014about 35 percent of the Eximbank\u2019s commitments supported foreign public sector purchases and about 65 percent supported foreign private sector purchasers. Although private sector purchasers are becoming larger users of export financing in developing countries and the Eximbank\u2019s project financing program provides the flexibility necessary for reducing the subsidy cost of these transactions, this method of financing is not suitable for all transactions. It is best suited for large transactions, for example, major infrastructure projects, that generate revenues that are sufficiently high to repay debt obligations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Eximbank financing helps support the sale of billions of dollars of U.S. goods and services to foreign markets each year consistent with U.S. foreign policy interests but comes at a cost to U.S. taxpayers\u2014about $3.75 billion in appropriated program funds over the last 5 years. OMB projects a substantial decline in these resources over the next 5 years.", "We identified two options for reducing the Eximbank\u2019s subsidy costs: (1) raising fees (based on a modified definition of \u201cfully competitive\u201d) and (2) reducing program risks. If implemented, these options may help the Eximbank respond to the projected decline in resources over the next  5 years. These options would not require a change in the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended, because they fall within its present authority. However, these options need to be considered within the full context of their trade and foreign policy implications and should be consistent with the Eximbank\u2019s other statutory obligations.", "Raising exposure fees within the context of ongoing international negotiations to reduce government export credit subsidies seems to be the least disruptive of the two options for a number of reasons. First of all, Eximbank fees for sovereign financing are generally lower than those of other ECAs in most country markets. Second, a fee increase could be implemented without raising some of the foreign policy concerns associated with restricting or eliminating program coverage in certain risky markets. Third, exposure fee increases are compatible with U.S. government efforts to minimize competition in government-supported export financing among OECD members and consistent with its legal directive to do so. The magnitude and timing of any fee increases should take into account progress in the ongoing OECD negotiations to minimize the possible competitive impact on U.S. exporters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Eximbank made four general observations:", "The subsidy cost computations should only be interpreted as approximations of the cost of the Eximbank\u2019s programs.", "Because no estimate of the amount of lost exports, jobs, federal tax revenue, or other potential adverse consequences of raising fees or lowering the amount of the Eximbank\u2019s risk have been developed, the implementation of the options presented needs to be considered with great caution.", "Taking unilateral action to increase fees could undermine the U.S. negotiating position with other OECD members.", "Other alternatives for reducing the Eximbank\u2019s budget that would not adversely affect the Eximbank\u2019s programs have not been considered.", "Regarding our cost computations, we used the same methodology for our analysis that the Eximbank uses to estimate the subsidy costs for its official budget submission to Congress. We agree that the methodology utilized to meet the requirements of the Credit Reform Act yields estimates and that the actual costs for a particular case may be higher or lower than the estimate. However, since the actual costs cannot be predetermined, these estimates can be used to make rational program decisions.", "In preparing this report we did consider the likely impact of the options we identified on Eximbank-supported exports. We acknowledge that we could not precisely quantify the impact of implementing the fee increases. Nevertheless, our review indicated that the Eximbank could raise fees while still maintaining a competitive position relative to other ECAs. Moreover, we did estimate that the reduction in Eximbank-financed sales associated with reducing program risks would only have a slight effect (5 percent or less) on the overall level of U.S. exports supported with Eximbank financing in a given year.", "Our past work has shown that no definitive empirical research exists that demonstrates unequivocally the net macroeconomic impact on the nation\u2014positive or negative\u2014of government funding for federal export promotion programs or of reductions in Eximbank funding levels. It is difficult to fully quantify the net benefits of federal export promotion programs because it is difficult to demonstrate \u201cadditionality,\u201d that is, the level of exports that would have been provided in their absence. Proponents and opponents of these programs have mainly relied on qualitative arguments to state their cases rather than demonstrate quantitatively the impact on exports, jobs, and federal tax revenue.", "We recognize that the most efficient means to reduce Eximbank subsidies without disadvantaging U.S. exporters is to reach agreement with other ECAs to lower and eventually eliminate export subsidies. We clearly stated in the report that any proposed fee increases should be considered only in the broader context of the ongoing OECD efforts to negotiate minimum fee schedules and that the magnitude and timing of such an increase should take into account progress in these negotiations.", "Eximbank also commented that we did not recognize other alternatives for reducing the Eximbank\u2019s budget without adversely affecting its program.

The two options proposed by the Eximbank (changing its program mix and making greater use of asset-based financing) would have some drawbacks that were not disclosed in its letter. For example, the budgetary and possible implementation difficulties associated with the greater use of Eximbank loans as opposed to guarantees are not addressed in the Eximbank\u2019s comments. In addition, the potential for extending asset-based financing beyond the areas noted in the Eximbank\u2019s comments is uncertain. Finally, it is not clear whether OMB would endorse any of the Eximbank options noted in its letter.", "The Eximbank\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II, along with our specific evaluation of them.

In addition, we completed a transaction analysis of the Eximbank\u2019s financing commitments made in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, including an analysis of the Eximbank\u2019s high-subsidy transactions. We defined \u201chigh-subsidy\u201d transactions as those transactions that consumed $1 million or more of the Eximbank\u2019s subsidy budget in a given year or consumed a subsidy of 15 percent or more of the financed amount.

We also interviewed officials from these organizations and the private banking industry to obtain their views on the feasibility and likely impact of the options.", "To illustrate potential subsidy savings associated with different levels of fees, we estimated the possible subsidy savings that would have been obtained in fiscal year 1995 by setting fees within the 45-50, 55-60, and 65-70 percent competitiveness levels, holding all other variables (such as dollar value of transactions, interest rates, and repayment terms) constant. We used aggregate Eximbank fee data and an OMB financial model to perform this analysis. (We did these calculations by setting fees at a level that fell within the range we specified. Specifically, the fees selected for our analysis at the 45-50, 55-60, and 65-70 percent competitiveness levels included medium- and long-term fees set at the 47th and 46th, 57th and 56th, and 66th and 65th percentiles, respectively).

Credit programs\u2014like other U.S. government programs\u2014were reported in the budget on a cash basis (i.e., loan guarantees did not show up in the budget unless and until they defaulted). This created a bias in favor of loan guarantees over direct loans. In the budget year, loan guarantees appeared to be free, while direct loans appeared to be expensive because the budget did not recognize that at least some of the loan guarantees would default and that some direct loans would be repaid. Under the act, the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1992 and after must include the total estimated net cost to the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) of the cash flows, discounted to present value, of its direct loans, guarantees, and insurance.", "Credit reform requirements separate the government\u2019s cost of extending or guaranteeing credit, called the \u201csubsidy cost,\u201d from administrative costs.

These projections are also estimates and the actual costs of a particular commitment may ultimately be higher or lower. Credit reform subsidy allocations reflect only those commitments made in a given fiscal year. 2. The report noted that it is difficult to estimate the full impact of fee changes on exporter behavior and states that U.S. exporters\u2019 sensitivity to a fee increase would depend on several factors, including the size of the fee increase, the volume of U.S. exports to a particular market, and the credit risk of the importing market. We did acknowledge that raising fees for financing transactions in the higher-risk markets, such as the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union (NIS), could lead to a decline in U.S. exports to these markets. 3. The report notes that to minimize the possible competitive impact on U.S. exporters, any proposed Eximbank fee increases should only be undertaken in the broader context of ongoing Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) efforts to reduce government export subsidies. 4.
