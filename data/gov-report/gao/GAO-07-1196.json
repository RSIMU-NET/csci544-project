This number is small relative to the Armed Forces' total force of approximately 2.3 million servicemembers. Of the 425 applications the components reported processing, 224 (53 percent) were approved; 188 (44 percent) were denied; and 13 (3 percent) were pending, withdrawn, closed, or no information was provided. Each component considers applications from servicemembers who wish to be classified as conscientious objectors. Each component's process is essentially the same, taking an average of about 7 months to process an application. After the servicemember submits an application, arrangements are made for a military chaplain and a psychiatrist to interview the applicant. An investigating officer holds a hearing and prepares a report. An authorized official or board makes the final decision and informs the commanding officer, who informs the applicant that he or she has or has not met the burden of proof necessary to establish the claim. Officials from all the components stated that they attempt to temporarily reassign applicants to noncombatant duties while their applications are pending. Conscientious objector status is not considered when determining eligibility for benefits; the primary determinant is the type of discharge--honorable or under honorable conditions (general). Of those 224 servicemembers whose applications were approved for conscientious objector status, 207 received honorable discharges, 14 received general discharges, and information on the remaining 3 was not available. In addition to the characterization of discharge, a servicemember may have to meet other eligibility requirements--including years of service--to receive certain Veterans Affairs benefits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the adoption of an all-volunteer force in 1973, the United States no  longer drafted individuals for its military force. Before this change,  individuals could apply for conscientious objector status and, if approved,  be exempted from the draft. Servicemembers in today\u2019s all-volunteer  force\u2014which is comprised of approximately 2.3 million active and  reserve members, including the Coast Guard\u2014can also apply for  conscientious objector status and, if approved, either leave the military  before the end of their service obligations or be reassigned to  noncombatant duties. Although recruits are asked on entrance  applications if they oppose war, the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 conscientious  objector policies recognize that servicemembers\u2019 religious, ethical, or  moral beliefs can change over time and lead to conscientious objection to  war. For example, after joining the military, a servicemember might  convert to a religion that opposes war or have other life-altering  experiences (e.g., exposure to combat or the death of a family member)  that change the servicemember\u2019s religious, ethical, or moral beliefs.  Therefore, the Armed Forces have policies and procedures in place to  consider applications from servicemembers who wish to be classified as  conscientious objectors.", "The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  directed us to review the Armed Forces\u2019 conscientious objector process.  Specifically, we addressed (1) the trends in the number of servicemembers  applying for conscientious objector status during calendar years 2002  through 2006; (2) how each component of the U.S. Armed Forces  administers its process for approving or denying conscientious objector  applications; and (3) whether conscientious objectors are eligible to  receive the same benefits that other servicemembers are eligible to receive  after they are discharged from the military. In addition to the mandate, as  agreed with your offices, we are providing demographic information on  servicemembers who separated as conscientious objectors between  calendar years 2002 and 2006. This demographic information is presented  in appendix I.", "To address the first objective\u2014to report on trends in the numbers of  applications for conscientious objector status\u2014we used data provided by  each component for calendar years 2002 through 2006. We did not report  on data between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2001, as directed  in the mandate, because several of the components did not have these data  available or believed the data to be unreliable. The Defense Manpower  Data Center (DMDC) does not maintain information on applications for  conscientious objector status but does maintain information on  separations. We obtained personnel information on separations for  conscientious objectors from DMDC because it maintains data for all of  the Armed Forces, including the Coast Guard, dating back to the early  1970s. To assess the reliability of the conscientious objector applications  and separations data we received from the components and DMDC, we   (1) performed electronic testing; (2) compared data provided by the  components with data provided by DMDC to assess their reasonableness;  (3) reviewed information about the systems that produced the data; and  (4) interviewed component and DMDC officials to identify known  problems or limitations in the data and to understand how DMDC receives  and processes data from the components. When we found discrepancies,  we worked with the component or DMDC to understand why the  discrepancies had occurred and to gather the most complete data possible.  We found limitations with the consistency and completeness of the data  that could result in a possible understatement of the number of  applications, but we believe that the data are sufficiently reliable to  demonstrate overall trends in the numbers of applications, approvals, and  denials for applications submitted for conscientious objector status during  calendar years 2002 through 2006. However, the numbers of applications  maintained by the components do not include those applications that did  not get formally reported to the components\u2019 headquarters.

For the third  objective, we reviewed relevant documentation about veterans\u2019 benefits,  such as the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) guidance and benefits  booklet. To address all three objectives, we interviewed knowledgeable  officials\u2014including those responsible for the conscientious objector  process and its guidance and regulations\u2014from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), DMDC, and each of the  military services and their reserve components within the Department of  Defense (DOD); from the Coast Guard within the Department of  Homeland Security; and from the VA.

These regulations do not recognize selective conscientious objection, that  is, opposition to a specific war or conflict. The components\u2019 regulations  recognize two categories of applicants for conscientious objector status.

If it is determined that the veteran  does not meet basic eligibility requirements (i.e., the characterization of  discharge is not honorable or under honorable conditions (general)), then  the examiner or other qualified VA employee will notify the veteran that he  or she is not entitled to benefits. The veteran can then (1) seek an upgrade  in the characterization of his or her discharge through the military  component and, if successful, provide the revised discharge papers to VA  or (2) provide the examiner or other qualified VA employee with evidence  of mitigating circumstances that could lead VA to revise its determination  of the veteran\u2019s eligibility. Even if the veteran does not provide additional  information, the examiner or other qualified VA employee will review the  veteran\u2019s military personnel and service record to determine if (1) there  were mitigating circumstances surrounding the discharge; (2) there is a  period of service, other than the one for which the veteran was  discharged, upon which the benefits may be based; or (3) despite the  characterization of discharge, the veteran\u2019s service was faithful or  meritorious. For example, if it is determined after a review of the military  personnel and service record that the veteran received an under other than  honorable conditions discharge because of an absence without official  leave to see a dying parent, the veteran may still receive VA benefits. If an  examiner or other qualified VA employee determines that a veteran with  an under other than honorable conditions or bad conduct discharge is not  eligible for most VA benefits, the veteran may still be eligible for health  care for any disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during  active service, unless the veteran is barred from receiving VA benefits. If  the veteran\u2019s military personnel or service record indicates that he or she  refused to perform military duties, wear the uniform, or comply with  lawful orders of a competent military authority while the conscientious  objector application was pending, the veteran is barred from receiving VA  benefits. The decision of the examiner or other qualified VA employee  applies not only to those benefits that the veteran was requesting at the  time of the decision but also to any future benefits he or she may seek,  except for education and training, for which the discharge must be  honorable.
