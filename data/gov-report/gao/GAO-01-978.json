Transfer agents and broker-dealers used credit bureaus and professional search firms the least and found these methods to be the least effective. About 40 percent of the responding transfer agents and broker-agents spent less than $10 trying to locate each lost customer. SEC has been unable to use data provided by transfer agents to assess the operation of the 1997 rule because of differences in the way agents interpreted the questions. In addition, the requested information was insufficient for SEC staff to review the operation of the rule after three years as they were directed when the Commission adopted the rule. SEC relies primarily on its general inspections of transfer agents to ensure that these firms comply with the 1997 rule. SEC found violations in compliance with the 1997 rule's reporting and procedural requirements in about one quarter of the inspections it made between 1998 and 2000.

Our overall survey response rate was 69 percent for transfer agents  and 54 percent for broker-dealers. The low overall response rates to the  surveys and individual questions along with the low response rate from the  largest firms, which represent most account volume, threaten the validity  of estimates made using these data, if those not providing data are  materially different from those who do. Because of these low response  rates and the inability of some respondents to provide complete lost  account data, we are (1) restricting our analysis to that subset of firms that  participated in our surveys and (2) not making estimates about the larger  population of broker-dealers and transfer agents in the United States.

Broker- dealers hold securities and other investments for customers. Because the  broker-dealer holds the customers\u2019 underlying assets, customers have an  economic incentive to maintain contact with the firm. Also, the broker- dealer has an incentive to maintain contact with the customer since the  customer may purchase additional securities. Transfer agents maintain  individual security holder records for banks; corporations; and other  issuers, such as mutual funds. In this capacity, transfer agents frequently  are responsible for disseminating shareholder communications and  dividend and interest payments. However, the transfer agent does not hold  the underlying security on behalf of the investor as a broker-dealer does.", "SEC became concerned that while various transfer agents attempted to  locate lost security holders, the extent and type of efforts used varied  considerably. Establishing minimum search requirements, SEC reasoned,  would facilitate finding lost security holders. Accordingly, SEC adopted a  rule on October 1, 1997, requiring transfer agents to conduct searches and  annually report to SEC aggregate data on the accounts of lost security  holders. The rule requires transfer agents to exercise \u201creasonable care\u201d in  their efforts to find the correct addresses of all lost security holders. At a  minimum, transfer agents must conduct two electronic searches for  accounts whose owners are considered lost. An owner generally becomes  \u201clost\u201d when correspondence is returned as undeliverable and the transfer  agent has not received the security holder\u2019s new address. Transfer agents  are not required to search for the owners of a lost account if (1) the  aggregate value of the account is less than $25; (2) they have received  documentation of the security holders\u2019 death; or (3) the account owner is  not a person. Transfer agents are also required to submit information  regarding the status of lost security holder accounts and the number of lost  security holder accounts that were remitted to the states during the  reporting period. In adopting the rule, SEC directed its staff to review the  operation of the adopted rules after 3 years and to report back on its  findings. On June 2, 2000, SEC modified the reporting requirements for lost  security holders as part of its revision of the TA-2, which is the annual  report filed by all registered transfer agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transfer Agents and Broker-dealers Reported Limited Numbers of Lost Accounts, but Little Historical Data Were Available", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, the year for which the data are most complete, the average number  of lost security holders for transfer agents and broker-dealers was  approximately 2 percent of total accounts. Seventy-five percent of transfer  agents reported that the number of their lost security holders amounted to  less than 1 percent of their total accounts. Ninety-five percent of broker- dealers reported that their lost accounts amounted to less than 1 percent of  their total accounts. Our survey observations are similar to those of SEC in  its informal surveys in 1997 and 2000. In the 1997 survey, SEC estimated  that 1.34 percent of accounts held by transfer agents were lost. On the basis  of a second survey in 2000 that represented about 75 percent of  shareholder accounts held by transfer agents, SEC estimated that lost  security holder accounts were 2.23 percent of total accounts. A May 2000  SIA poll of 17 broker-dealers showed that 0.79 percent of total accounts  belonged to lost security holders.", "Over half of the transfer agents and broker-dealers that responded to our  surveys were unable to provide us with information on lost owners for  earlier years. However, data from the 75 transfer agents that did have the  information for previous years showed that the ratio of lost accounts to  total accounts was more likely to have increased or remained the same  than decreased since the 1997 rule change. On the other hand, data  supplied by the 42 broker-dealers who were able to supply it showed that  this ratio was most likely to have stayed the same or decreased.", "Most of the transfer agents and broker-dealers that were unable to provide  us with data reported to us that they believed that the lost account ratio has  remained the same or decreased in the last 2 years. Among transfer agents,  about 21 percent told us that the ratio had increased, about 43 percent  indicated it had remained the same, and about 35 percent said it had  decreased. Broker-dealers\u2019 responses included a higher percentage  reporting that the lost account ratio had remained the same over the last 2  years: about 10 percent indicated they felt it had increased; about 67  percent, that it had remained the same; and about 24 percent, that it had  decreased.", "In testimony before the House Committee on Commerce, SIA said that  security holders frequently become lost through no fault of the financial  institution holding the assets. According to SIA, the most common situation  occurs when a security holder relocates and leaves no forwarding address.  Our survey also showed that the primary reason owners become lost is that  they have failed to notify the firms of address changes (see fig. 1). The  second most common reason for owners becoming lost was a transfer of  beneficial ownership, such as through an inheritance, in which the transfer  agent or broker-dealer does not receive information about the transfer. Few  transfer agents and broker-dealers believe that they received inaccurate  information in initially setting up the account. Although internal data entry  or processing errors are clearly the firms\u2019 responsibility, they are not  considered to be a significant cause of lost security accounts.", "When searches for lost security holders are unsuccessful, transfer agents  and broker-dealers are required to remit the property to the state  unclaimed property administrators under the state escheat laws. Both  groups indicated that few account holders remain lost for so long a period  that the firms would be required to remit the securities to the state. Twenty- six percent of broker-dealers remitted property to the state in 1995, and 30  percent did so during 2000. Our survey findings indicated that the  proportion of transfer agents remitting property to the states has grown  since 1995. Only 30 percent of all transfer agents able to provide data  remitted property to the states in 1995; however, over 55 percent remitted  property to the states in 2000. A number of factors could influence the  proportion of property remitted to the states. However, we could not  determine the causes of these changes from our survey results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transfer Agents and Broker-dealers Used Similar Techniques to Find Lost Security Holders", "paragraphs": ["The transfer agents we surveyed indicated that they routinely used  telephone, mail, and searches of the Internet and telephone directories in  looking for lost security holders (see fig. 2). Although they are not required  to search for lost customers, broker-dealers often do, using the same  techniques. Both transfer agents and broker-dealers used telephone calls  and mail for over 75 percent of their searches. Transfer agents used credit  bureaus and professional search firms less frequently, but they still used  these firms more than broker-dealers.", "The transfer agents and broker-dealers we surveyed also estimated that  they spend a similar amount of resources to find lost security holders.  About forty percent of all transfer agents and broker-dealers estimated  spending less than $10 in the search for each lost security holder (see fig.  3). For transfer agents, the smallest firms were the most likely to spend less  than $10 per lost customer (55 percent), while almost 67 percent of  medium firms and 58 percent of larger firms spent more. Small and medium  broker-dealer firms spent more than $10 per lost customer over 60 percent  of the time, while 77 percent of larger firms spent more. Thirty-seven  percent of transfer agents told us that, in 2000, they had full-time staff at  headquarters assigned to find lost security holders. These employees were  in addition to any that may have been located at branch offices. The  average number of personnel assigned was 2.5 at firms with full-time  staffing. About 34 percent of broker-dealers had full-time staff assigned to  find lost security holders; on average, these firms devoted 2.5 employees to  this task.", "Transfer agents and broker-dealers usually have policies or procedures in  place specifying steps to be taken to find security holders when mail is  returned as undeliverable. According to our survey results, 78 percent of  transfer agents and 69 percent of broker-dealers responding told us that  they have written policies on searching for lost security holders. For the  transfer agents with policies or procedures, 48 percent had these measures  before they were required by the 1997 SEC rule. Larger transfer agents  were more likely to have written policies or procedures before the 1997  ruling. Some 75 percent of large firms and 65 percent of medium firms  reported having written policies or procedures on locating lost customers  before 1997, compared with only 24 percent of small firms. Among broker- dealers, who are not required to have search policies, 55 percent had  similar measures before 1997.", "Other financial institutions that have customer accounts, such as banks  and insurance companies, are not required to search for lost account  holders or maintain data on lost accounts. Thus, the Federal Reserve  Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency do not maintain information on the extent of  lost accounts or search techniques used in the industry.

The  number of lost security holder accounts was to be reported as lost for  specified periods of time: 1 year or less, 3 years or less, 5 years or less, or  greater than 5 years. Transfer agents were also to report information on  security holder accounts that were remitted to the state unclaimed  property administrators. According to SEC officials, the reporting  requirement took effect in February 1998, and the numbers were to be  reported in an annual filing due in August that reports data as of the  preceding June.

As a result, the  data that the transfer agents reported to SEC were inconsistent. Because of  these inconsistencies, SEC staff have not been able to review the operation  of the rule after 3 years as instructed by the Commission in 1997. SEC  proposed changes to the reporting form in March 1999 and adopted a  revised form on June 2, 2000. SEC officials expect that the revised  reporting requirement will provide more consistent and accurate data that  will allow them to assess the scope of the lost security holder problem and  the effectiveness of the search requirements of the rule.

SEC staff said that most firms respond to the  deficiency letter by indicating corrective actions they will take or have  taken. If the firm\u2019s response letter indicates that the firm will take adequate  steps to address the issues, no follow-up is conducted until the next  examination. However, if the deficiency is serious or if the transfer agent\u2019s  response to the deficiency letter does not indicate that adequate corrective  actions will be taken, SEC staff may decide that a follow-up exam is  needed. However, SEC officials said that it was unclear whether a lost  security holder rule violation, alone, would likely be considered serious  enough to trigger a follow-up exam.", "As of July 11, 2001, SEC had sent deficiency letters to all 51 agents with  violations in 2000. SEC also referred 19 transfer agents\u2019 exam results to  banking regulators and 4 results to SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement.

In addition,  most security holders appear to be lost due to address changes that they  have not reported to the transfer agent or broker-dealer, rather than  through errors made by the firm that would clearly be the firm\u2019s  responsibility. In addition, SEC directed its staff to assess the operation of  the rule after 3 years. Now that SEC has adopted a revised form for these  data, the Commission expects that its revised reporting requirements will  provide it with more consistent and accurate data.
