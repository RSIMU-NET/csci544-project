First, assistance programs have helped partner nations gather, process, and share information and intelligence leading to arrests and drug seizures. Second, they have enabled these nations to participate in counternarcotics operations--both at sea and on land--by providing assets (such as interceptor boats and vehicles), logistical support, and training for police units. Third, U.S. assistance has helped strengthen the capacity of prosecutors to work more effectively on drug-related cases. Assessing the impact of such a wide variety of programs is difficult because some are indirectly related to drug interdiction, and because results reporting has been limited and inconsistent. Despite gains in international cooperation, several factors, including resource limitations and lack of political will, have impeded U.S. progress in helping governments become full and self-sustaining partners in the counternarcotics effort--a goal of U.S. assistance. These countries have limited resources to devote to this effort, and many initiatives are dependent on U.S. support. Programs to build maritime interdiction capacity have been particularly affected, as partner nations lack fuel and other resources needed to operate and maintain U.S.-provided boats. Limited political support, particularly in Venezuela, and corruption have also hindered U.S. counternarcotics efforts. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented a Container Security Initiative (CSI) that targets and scans containers for weapons of mass destruction and terrorist contraband.

They shift routes and operating methods quickly in  response to pressure from law enforcement organizations or rival  traffickers. They ship drugs through the transit zone primarily by sea,  though their methods have become more evasive in recent years. They  typically use go-fast boats and fishing vessels to smuggle cocaine from  Colombia to Central America and Mexico en route to the United States.  Go-fast boats are capable of traveling at speeds over 40 knots, are difficult  to detect in open water, and are often used at night. When drug traffickers  travel in daylight, they often use boats painted blue, or that can be quickly  covered with a blue tarpaulin, thereby becoming virtually impossible to  see. Even when detected, go-fast boats can often outrun conventional  ships deployed in the transit zone. Traffickers also use \u201cmother ships\u201d in  concert with fishing vessels to transport illicit drugs into open waters and  then distribute the load among smaller boats at sea. In addition, traffickers  use evasive maritime routes and change them frequently. Some boats  travel as far southwest as the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean  before heading north toward Mexico, while others travel through Central  America\u2019s littoral waters, close to shore, where they can hide among  legitimate maritime traffic. In addition, the Joint Interagency Task Force- South (JIATF-South), under Defense\u2019s U.S. Southern Command, has  reported an increase in suspicious flights\u2014particularly departing from  Venezuela. In addition, traffickers fly loads of cocaine to remote,  ungoverned spaces\u2014such as northern Guatemala, near the Mexican  border\u2014and abandon the planes. Planes, however, generally carry much  smaller loads than most maritime vessels used for drug trafficking.  Traffickers also are using increasingly sophisticated concealment  methods. For example, they have built fiberglass semisubmersible craft  that can avoid both visual- and sonar-detection, hidden cocaine within the  hulls of boats, and transported liquefied cocaine in fuel tanks.", "According to Defense\u2019s Office of Counternarcotics, Counterproliferation,  and Global Threats, these shifts in drug trafficking patterns and methods  have likely taken place largely in response to U.S. and international  counternarcotics efforts in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean, although  measuring causes and effects is imprecise.

These units have worked closely with U.S. officials to  develop successful investigations. The United States provides these units  with operational support, from money to pay agents and confidential  sources to vehicles and surveillance equipment. For example, in the  Dominican Republic, a vetted unit within the counternarcotics police used  a U.S.-supported wire intercept program to conduct more than 730 wiretap  operations in fiscal year 2007. The program provided daily support to  numerous major investigations in the United States and abroad, including  the investigation of eight priority target organizations. In Ecuador, DEA  estimates that one vetted investigative unit has been responsible for   70 percent of all drug seizures in that country. In Jamaica, according to  State, intelligence-driven operations coordinated with DEA and the vetted  unit targeted major drug traffickers, and collaboration between Jamaican  and international law enforcement agencies have resulted in significant  seizures of cocaine and arrests of midlevel and major traffickers\u2014 including kingpins\u2014and the dismantling of their organizations, in Jamaica,  the United States, the Bahamas, and Colombia. Since late 2004, almost all  significant bilateral investigations with Jamaica have included a wire  intercept component using DEA-funded facilities. In the Bahamas,  according to State, intelligence gathering and surveillance equipment  provided by State/INL enabled local law enforcement to dismantle two  Bahamas-based drug trafficking organizations in 2006.", "DEA has also helped governments draft legislation to broaden the scope of  investigative tools available to law enforcement organizations. For  example, Guatemala\u2019s Organized Crime Bill, put into effect in 2007,  authorizes wire intercepts and undercover operations, and allows drugs to  be delivered under controlled circumstances in order to identify the  traffickers involved\u2014referred to as controlled delivery. DEA also  encouraged legislation in Jamaica to authorize wire intercepts and  fingerprinting of suspects. Similarly, legislation in Venezuela enhanced  police investigative powers in 2005 by allowing controlled deliveries.", "In addition, with U.S. technical and financial assistance, several countries  are operating information centers to collect, analyze, and disseminate  statistical and case-related data to aid local and foreign law enforcement  officials in criminal investigations. In the Dominican Republic, for  example, the DEA-sponsored Caribbean Center for Drug Information  serves as a clearinghouse for narcotics-related intelligence for countries  throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. According to DEA,  Caribbean countries are both frequent contributors to and beneficiaries of  the center\u2019s intelligence analysis services.

For example, in 2003, the Dominican Republic entered into a  bilateral agreement granting the United States permanent over-flight rights  for counternarcotics operations. In 2006, the United States and Ecuador  negotiated operating procedures to facilitate interdiction of suspect  Ecuadorian-flagged vessels. According to State, in fiscal year 2007, these  new procedures enabled the United States to board seven Ecuadorian  flagged vessels and remove about 26 metric tons of cocaine. In addition,  according to State, under the terms of maritime agreements, Guatemala  and Panama have provided valuable support for international interdictions  by permitting the Coast Guard to fly suspected drug traffickers to the  United States. This has allowed U.S. assets to remain on station and  continue pursuing drug interdiction and homeland security missions. In  Panama, according to State, the Coast Guard\u2019s 2007 seizure of over 32  metric tons of cocaine\u2014including the single largest maritime drug seizure  in U.S. history\u2014was directly related to cooperative efforts executed under  provisions of the bilateral agreement between Panama and the United  States.

Also, several U.S. vessels  that were transferred to the Dominican Navy as excess defense articles are  in poor condition due to a lack of preventive maintenance and funds for  repairs. State reported in 2006 that the Navy\u2019s maintenance command  lacked necessary equipment, parts, and training.", "In Haiti, State/INL and the U.S. Coast Guard provided substantial support  to the Haitian coast guard, including interceptor boats, vessel overhauls  and retrofitting, infrastructure improvements, and training and equipment.  However, according to State, a lack of necessary equipment, maintenance,  fuel, and logistical support has continued to impair the Haitian coast  guard\u2019s ability to conduct maritime operations and combat drug trafficking  effectively.", "In Guatemala, State/INL provided the counternarcotics police force with  two fiberglass boats\u2014one located on the Caribbean Coast and the other  on the Pacific Coast\u2014for limited counternarcotics operations. In 2007,  State reported that both boats were inoperable because the police had not  maintained the engines.", "In Jamaica, the United States donated several patrol vessels capable of  intercepting go-fast boats. State reported in 2006 that the vessels had only  limited operational capability because they were not in good working  order.", "In Panama, the U.S. Coast Guard donated a 180-foot cutter. However,  Panama\u2019s National Maritime Service, which is highly dependent on U.S.  support for operations and maintenance resources, has been unable to  keep the vessel seaworthy.", "U.S. agencies have not always planned for the sustainability of the  counternarcotics-related assets they provided to partner nations.  According to State officials we spoke to, when receiving these assets,  country officials have typically signed agreements accepting the long-term  responsibility of operating and maintaining them, including providing the  necessary staff, as well as fuel, parts, and other maintenance resources,  unless these are provided for by the United States. However, the long-term  cost of operating and maintaining the assets and the source of funding are  not typically included in such agreements, according to these officials.", "In 2007, Defense began providing additional boats to partner nations,  including Panama, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and the Bahamas,  under its Enduring Friendship program, for use in maritime security  operations. However, Defense has not developed plans to address long- term sustainability of these assets over their expected 10-year operating  life. These interceptor boats were accompanied by support equipment  such as trucks and trailers for on-land mobility; radios; infrared cameras;  as well as training and a limited maintenance program, at a cost of  between $6 million and $11 million for each country. However, Defense  did not make provisions to ensure that the partner countries can fuel the  donated boats and maintain them beyond an initial short-term  maintenance contract period. For the boats provided to the Dominican  Republic, for example, the agreement between Defense and the Dominican  Republic did not specify the estimated costs or funding source of  operating the boats and related equipment. The agreement indicated the  United States may provide some additional support for repair parts,  contingent upon the availability of funds. The ability to provide the  necessary resources to operate these assets over the long-term is a  concern, according to the U.S. and partner nation officials we spoke to in  the Dominican Republic and Panama. According to the Coast Guard  attach\u00e9 in the Dominican Republic, although the Dominican Navy has  added these and other boats to its fleet in recent years, it has not increased  its budget for fuel since 2002, and the cost of fuel has since doubled.  Similarly, according to a senior official of the Panamanian National  Maritime Service, it has been operating under a static budget and fuel  allotment, even as the number of assets and staff under its control has  increased. State/INL officials in both Panama and the Dominican Republic  told us that these countries have not effectively used the interceptor boats  for counternarcotics purposes.", "In addition, the personnel operating the interceptor boats have limited  maritime interdiction skills. Training included in the assistance package  focused on operation and maintenance of boats and included some  training in first aid, navigation, and communications but only limited  training on interdiction tactics. The memorandum of understanding  between Defense and the Dominican Republic for this program indicated  that Defense may provide some additional training, contingent upon the  availability of funds, but did not specify the training likely to be needed for  conducting counternarcotics operations or its cost.", "In some cases, however, State/INL has recognized the long-term  sustainability challenges associated with providing capital assets and has  planned and budgeted for operations and maintenance costs, thus helping  to ensure the assets will be used effectively for counternarcotics  operations. For example, State reported that it has funded maintenance  contracts in the Bahamas that provide a means for keeping U.S.-provided  boats operational for drug interdiction missions. Also, State/INL helps  sustain U.S.-funded initiatives along the Ecuador-Colombian border by  funding a large spare parts program, as well as maintenance training for  the heavy trucks and other vehicles it has provided, and by budgeting for  gas and maintenance costs over the long term. State/INL has also funded  contractors to maintain the electrical and plumbing systems in the police  buildings constructed for the police in Ecuador.", "According to State, the counternarcotics police of several partner nations  are dependent on logistical and operational support of State/INL and DEA,  as the following examples show:  In the Dominican Republic, the police force\u2019s effectiveness in  counternarcotics affairs is almost completely attributable to equipment,  training, and close support provided by DEA and State/INL over several  years. State also reported that the financial intelligence unit, begun with  U.S. support in 2003, lacks the resources and institutional support to  perform effectively and has reported no real successes in implementing its  money-laundering legislation since the unit was established.", "In Ecuador, State/INL and DEA provide almost all logistical and  operational support to the Ecuadorian National Police Anti-Drug Division.", "In Haiti, the lack of government resources makes the national police  largely dependent upon DEA and State/INL for logistical and advisory  support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Countries\u2019 Limited Political Support Impairs U.S. Counternarcotics Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["According to State, a few governments in the region have demonstrated  limited political support for U.S. counternarcotics efforts.

In 2005, the Venezuelan  President accused DEA of espionage and planning a coup, and the  government eventually withdrew from both U.S.-supported vetted units  and has refused counternarcotics cooperation with the United States.", "State has also reported that Jamaica has shown limited political support  for some U.S. counternarcotics-related initiatives. For example, the United  States helped develop a corporate reform strategy for the Jamaican  constabulary forces, but it was never implemented due to a combination  of internal resistance to change and a lack of power to ensure  implementation of the strategy\u2019s recommendations. In addition, the  government of Jamaica has not enacted an initiative to permit extended  data-sharing between U.S. and Jamaican law enforcement agencies  concerning money-laundering cases.", "In Ecuador, even though the government has generally supported U.S.- funded counternarcotics initiatives, political developments may threaten  future international cooperation in maritime operations. Ecuador\u2019s  President has stated that he no longer supports a U.S. military presence in  Ecuador and that his government will not renew the agreement allowing  the United States to operate its forward operating location there when the  agreement expires in November 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corruption Undermines Interdiction Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The United States relies on the cooperation of partner nations\u2019 law  enforcement and security agencies in the transit zone to conduct  successful counternarcotics operations. But, corruption in these agencies  limits the extent to which U.S. law enforcement agencies can involve their  counterparts in investigations. According to data compiled by  Transparency International, a civil society organization that monitors  corruption issues worldwide, corruption is a major problem in transit zone  countries. Its Corruption Perception Index (CPI) ranks countries from 0  (highly corrupt) to 10 (highly clean) based on a series of indicators. Seven  of the eight countries in our review received a score of 3.3 or lower  (compared with a score of 7.2 for the United States and 8.7 for Canada).  The eighth country, the Bahamas, was not reviewed.

Some examples  of this official corruption are as follows:    Guatemala disbanded its antinarcotics police unit in 2002 in response to  reports of widespread corruption within the agency and its general lack of  effectiveness in combating the country\u2019s drug problem. The government  reassigned most of the unit\u2019s law enforcement agents to the national  civilian police, and the U.S. government suspended major joint operations  in light of these circumstances. With U.S. assistance, Guatemala  established a successor antinarcotics police force but, in 2005, in a joint  operation with DEA, the Chief and Deputy of this agency were arrested in  the United States for corruption. Later that year, DEA suspected that  members of the antinarcotics force stole 475 kilograms of cocaine from an  evidence storage facility. Further, according to DEA, Guatemalan  antinarcotics agents misused intelligence leads provided by DEA to extort  investigative targets.", "In Haiti, in 2003, State reported strong evidence of Haitian law  enforcement officials leaking information on planned operations and  trafficking drugs. DEA reported that planes under surveillance for drug  shipments were met and off-loaded by heavily armed uniformed police  officials with vehicles that transported the drugs. In 2007, the Haitian  government removed both the National Police Director of Administration  and Director of Logistics for suspected corruption.", "In the Dominican Republic, the government removed 24 judges from office  for improperly handing out favorable sentences to known traffickers in  2006. Corruption has also hampered Dominican-based, money-laundering  investigations, according to DEA.", "In Panama, in 2005, the head of a police counternarcotics unit was  arrested and charged with corruption. In 2007, after years of lackluster  counternarcotics cooperation from the National Maritime Service, the  former head of this organization was also arrested on corruption charges.", "In the Bahamas, State reported in 2003 that it was reluctant to include  Bahamian defense personnel in Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos  and to share sensitive law enforcement information with them due to  corruption concerns.", "In Ecuador, in 2002, the Deputy Chief of Operations of the Ecuadorian  Army was arrested for facilitating the transshipment of drugs through  cargo containers by providing trafficking organizations with false security  seals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cargo Container Security Programs Have Had Limited Effect on the Counternarcotics Effort", "paragraphs": ["According to DEA, drug smuggling on containerized cargo ships poses a  significant threat to U.S. counternarcotics efforts.

However, most of State/INL\u2019s initiatives have not been effective, and DHS  has not routinely used its program of targeting and scanning cargo  containers overseas to detect illicit drugs.", "State/INL has supported counternarcotics initiatives at cargo container  ports in four of the eight countries we reviewed, and in three of those  countries State\u2019s International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports  indicate that these initiatives were largely ineffective. For example, in  Guatemala, although State/INL has provided technical assistance,  logistical support, and training for the country\u2019s port security program for  several years, State reported in 2006 that the program had little  interdiction success, and seizures were very low. In the Bahamas,  State/INL supported a canine unit of the Bahamian Customs Department  to help detect drugs shipments at the Freeport container port but  discontinued the assistance in 2004 due to high maintenance costs and its  failure to produce expected results. In Venezuela, the United States funded  a sophisticated container inspection facility at a large port known to be an  embarkation point for multiton shipments of cocaine, but the Venezuelan  government has not put it into operation.", "DHS, through CBP, has implemented the Container Security Initiative  (CSI) overseas, which may have potential for greater use in  counternarcotics operations. CBP initiated CSI under its existing authority  in January 2002 to assist selected overseas ports in targeting suspicious  containers and scanning their contents. The program subsequently  received specific congressional authorization in 2006. By 2007, CSI  operated in 58 ports, including seven in the transit zone. CBP officers  stationed at foreign ports collaborating with host-country partners use  intelligence and automated risk assessment information to target  shipments and identify those that may contain weapons of mass  destruction or other terrorist contraband. DHS has generally not used the  technology to detect and interdict illicit drug shipments, though CSI  technology can help detect illicit drugs. In fact, the automated targeting  system that CSI uses to help target containers for inspection was originally  designed for this purpose. The first time the CSI scanning equipment was  used in the port of Caucedo in the Dominican Republic, operators  detected a shipment of cocaine that was packed amidst canned fruit.", "Ultimately, several metric tons of cocaine were seized, and suspected  traffickers were arrested.", "CBP officials we spoke with noted that including routine container  screening for drugs in CSI\u2019s scope of operations would be difficult and  could conflict with achievement of CBP\u2019s counterterrorism objectives.  They indicated that CSI\u2019s budget and staffing are based on its  counterterrorism-related workload, and targeting drugs would require  additional research and analysis resources. They said that, without more  funding, DHS would have to shift its priorities away from counterterrorism  activities. Furthermore, they said that expanding existing agreements with  CSI participating countries would entail difficult and sensitive  negotiations. According to these officials, proposing that CSI should  search for illicit drugs could undermine the international political support  for CSI and other CBP counterterrorism initiatives because additional  container screening could cause transshipment delays and related  economic costs and involve other concessions that participating countries  may not be willing to accept.", "However, CBP officials acknowledged that they have not formally  assessed the feasibility of conducting additional container targeting and  inspection in selected major drug transit countries. In particular, CBP has  neither calculated the related costs, including human resource  requirements, nor has it consulted with State and Justice on the related  diplomatic and security risks or the potential law enforcement benefits.

Through these initiatives, U.S. law enforcement has been able to extend  the scope and effectiveness of its drug interdiction activities by (1) gaining  access to critical information and intelligence, (2) participating in seizure  and eradication operations within the territory or jurisdiction of partner  nations, and (3) bringing suspected drug traffickers to justice.", "The absence of comprehensive and consistent reporting on the results of  these initiatives makes it difficult to monitor their outcomes over time,  assess their relative effectiveness, and make resource allocation decisions  based on results. However, available information concerning results  indicates that the United States has not made significant progress toward  its goal of assisting governments to become full and self-sustaining  partners in the international counternarcotics effort. Partner nations are  dependent on U.S. logistical, financial, and advisory support, and without  this support many U.S. initiatives are not sustainable. U.S. agencies have  funded initiatives and invested in assets, particularly for maritime  operations, without planning for the long-term operations and  maintenance of these assets, and partner nations have not utilized many of  them to their maximum capacity.", "U.S. assistance in cargo container security has been largely ineffective for  the international counternarcotics effort.

State noted that it has already  developed performance measures to reflect progress in achieving broad  counternarcotics goals and development goals in general, though they do  not necessarily capture program-specific results. We modified our  recommendation to emphasize the need for more systematic reporting of  program-specific results that would link U.S. counternarcotics efforts to  State\u2019s broader performance goals and measures. State also noted that  there is substantial variation in assistance programs in particular countries  in terms of program types and funding levels. However, we observed that  many programs in several countries are similar in nature and lend  themselves to the comparison of results among countries. Developing a  method of reporting these results more comprehensively and consistently  across years and among country programs in the International Narcotics  Control Strategy Report would address our concern.", "State partially agreed with our recommendation on sustainability planning  and indicated that its project designs, agreements with recipient countries,  and monitoring mechanisms are appropriate for addressing sustainability  concerns, given the unpredictability of recipient countries\u2019 long-term  priorities and budgetary resources. Furthermore, State commented that it  has limited ability to influence the coordinated sustainability planning of  other agencies and has no influence over Defense\u2019s Enduring Friendship  program. Given past experience, we question whether providing assets is  justifiable without more specific and detailed plans that give better  assurances that the recipient country and participating agencies are  committed to funding specified operations and maintenance costs. State is  in a unique position as the lead foreign affairs agency to ensure that all  participating U.S. agencies involved in providing counternarcotics assets  agree on a discrete sustainability plan. State, in particular, can influence  Defense\u2019s sustainability planning when it approves security assistance  programs, such as Enduring Friendship. Section 1206 of the National  Defense Authorization Act of 2006, under which Enduring Friendship was  authorized, requires State and Defense to jointly approve all projects and  coordinate their implementation.", "State fully supports any consultation needed to determine the feasibility of  expanding DHS\u2019s container security assistance program.", "DHS did not concur with our recommendation to study the feasibility of  expanding the CSI program. According to DHS, expanding CSI to include  narcotics interdiction would unnecessarily broaden the program\u2019s  strategic goals and is inconsistent with its mandate to secure the  international supply chain from high-risk shipments with a potential risk  of terrorism and acts of terrorism. CSI\u2019s mandate does not prohibit  leveraging the program\u2019s resources for other agency missions. In addition,  the CSI Strategic Plan for 2006-2011 states that, \u201cat some point in the  future, consideration should be given to potential expansion of the  program from focusing on terrorism alone to encompassing other  activities known to support terrorism, such as smuggling narcotics,  violations of intellectual property rights and currency violations.\u201d A logical  first step would be for relevant stakeholders to study the feasibility of  enlisting CSI as a counternarcotics tool, formally assessing the program\u2019s  statutory authority, among other factors. DHS also noted that 90 percent  of cocaine moves through Mexico, but that no CSI ports are located in  Mexico.

In addition, DHS/CBP notes in the CSI Strategic  Plan for 2006-2011 that, \u201cat some point in the future, consideration  should be given to potential expansion of the program from focusing  on terrorism alone to encompassing other activities known to support  terrorism, such as smuggling narcotics, violations of intellectual  property rights and currency violations.\u201d  3.  As noted in our report, seven CSI ports are located the Caribbean and  Central America. Four of those ports (Balboa, Colon, and Manzanillo  in Panama and Puerto Cortes in Honduras), are located on the central  American isthmus and, as such, are included in the \u201cCentral  American/Mexican Corridor,\u201d through which nearly 90 percent of  cocaine destined for the United States moves. (See fig. 1.)  4.  As DHS notes in its letter, the United States has \u201cunique and  unparalleled cooperation and information sharing between the CBP  officers at the foreign seaports and the host government customs  personnel.\u201d CSI\u2019s way of working with host country partners may serve  as a model for combating corruption and gaining the political support  necessary to make U.S. efforts successful.  5.  We are not recommending that CSI target maritime containers  destined for other countries. Rather, we are recommending that, in  addition to the factors CSI currently uses to target containers for  inspection, DHS study the feasibility of using potential narcotics  trafficking as one of the targeting factors.  6.  We added information on CBP\u2019s advisory program.  7.  The focus of our review was on U.S. initiatives to assist selected major  drug transit zone countries and we intentionally did not address many  U.S. interdiction operations DHS described. We have reported  previously on CBP\u2019s activities. See GAO, Drug Control: Agencies Need  to Plan for Likely Declines in Drug Interdiction Assets, and Develop  Better Performance Measures for Transit Zone Operations, GAO-06- 200 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 15, 2005); and GAO, Drug Control:  Difficulties in Measuring Costs and Results of Transit Zone  Interdiction Efforts, GAO-02-13 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 25, 2002)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of State\u2019s letter  dated June 25, 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We modified our recommendation to emphasize the need for State to  report the results of U.S.-funded counternarcotics initiatives more  comprehensively and consistently for each country in its annual  International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. Such information  would complement and aid interpretation of the broad performance  measures State includes in its performance plan.  2.  While the broad performance measures State has developed are  important, they do not capture results of specific assistance programs,  and, without other information, their usefulness in managing  counternarcotics programs is limited. Reviewing program-specific  results in a particular country over time or comparing results among  countries with similar programs can help identify patterns and lessons  learned that may be useful in evaluating and managing these programs  more effectively. Furthermore, without consistently reported program- specific results information, State cannot assess the extent to which  the results of specific programs have contributed to overall progress  reflected in State overall performance measures.  3.  While we agree that assistance programs vary, we observed that many  programs in several countries are similar and comparable.  4.  Past experience with U.S.-provided assets has shown that State\u2019s  monitoring of nation\u2019s commitment alone has not been sufficient to  ensure that such assets are utilized effectively. We question whether  such U.S. investments are justifiable without stronger up-front  assurances, beyond an agreement, that recipient countries or  sponsoring U.S. agencies can afford the long-term operations and  maintenance costs and are committed to providing those resources.  We continue to believe that explicit sustainability plans are needed  that include a projection of total asset ownership costs that have been  considered and agreed upon by all relevant parties with adequate  contingency plans in case assumptions change about sustainability and  commitment.  5.  State is in a unique position as the lead foreign affairs agency to ensure  that all participating U.S. agencies involved in providing  counternarcotics assets agree on a discreet sustainability plan. State,  in particular, can influence Defense\u2019s sustainability planning when it  approves security assistance programs, such as Enduring Friendship.", "Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2006, under  which Enduring Friendship was authorized, requires State and Defense  to jointly approve all projects and coordinate their implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Office of National Drug Control Policy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, A.
