Except for its coastal shoreline, the property is surrounded by dense urban residential neighborhoods In 1972, when the Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, a small part of the Presidio, then an Army base, was included in the recreation area. When the Department of Defense determined that the Presidio was excess to its needs in 1988, the remainder of the Presidio was designated for inclusion in the recreation area. On October 1, 1994, the Presidio closed; its grounds became part of the recreation area and the National Park Service (Park Service) assumed its management.", "Since managing the Presidio\u2019s 770 buildings and unique landscape was, by far, the most costly of any other single area it managed, the Park Service suggested that the Congress create an entity to manage the majority of the property.

In addition, the law stipulated that the Trust was to become financially self-sufficient within 15 years of the first meeting of its Board of Directors\u2014that is, by 2013. Also, the law required the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Trust, to provide public interpretive services, visitor orientation, and educational programs throughout the Presidio. The Park Service carries out these responsibilities and also provides additional public safety services under a reimbursable agreement with the Trust.", "The legislation that created the Trust also includes a requirement that we periodically review and report to the Congress on the Trust\u2019s activities.

Public comments were solicited on the alternatives until January 16, 2001.", "On July 25, 2001, the Trust released the Presidio Trust Draft Implementation Plan and draft environmental impact statement, which described and analyzed six alternatives for future development of the Presidio. Two of the alternatives have, thus far, received the most attention from the public. One, referred to as the \u201cGeneral Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative,\u201d would implement the Park Service\u2019s 1994 General Management Plan Amendment, assuming the year 2000 conditions. The Trust stated that it modified this alternative from the Conceptual Alternatives Workbook because many neighborhood and environmental groups had commented that they preferred an alternative that was patterned after the Park Service\u2019s 1994 General Management Plan Amendment plan but modified to make it financially feasible. The Trust developed another alternative, also in response to public comments, entitled the \u201cDraft Plan Alternative,\u201d which is its proposed action for future development of the Trust\u2019s portion of the Presidio. The Trust stated that this alternative is the proposed action because it is patterned after the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative but includes modifications to ensure its financial viability and to combine a number of concepts proposed in the Conceptual Alternatives Workbook into a single alternative. These concepts include expansion of open space, no reduction in housing units, and a variety of cultural and educational programs for visitors. Appendix III contains a summary of the alternatives the Trust considered. The public has until October 25, 2001, to provide comments on the Draft Plan Alternative and draft environmental impact statement. The Trust envisions concluding the planning process with the publication of a final plan and final environmental impact statement in early 2002.", "The Trust\u2019s Draft Plan Alternative contains many of the features of the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative, but there are several noteworthy differences between the two. For example, total development at the Presidio under Draft Plan Alternative is 5.6 million square feet, or about 6 percent less than current levels, rather than just over 5 million square feet discussed in the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative. Furthermore, the Draft Plan Alternative permits 50,000 square feet less in building demolition than the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative and replacement buildings under the Draft Plan Alternative could increase by about 540,000 square feet over the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative.

Appendix IV contains a comparison of the land use patterns envisioned by the alternatives.", "The Draft Plan Alternative assumes expenditures of $10 million annually for Trust programs rather than the $2 million annually provided for in the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative. The difference is due, in part, to the Trust providing programs rather than only the tenants as the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative assumed. According to the Trust, a wide variety of program possibilities would be available including interpretive programs for visitors as well as museums, exhibitions, and community programs. Also, the projected number of annual visitors under the Draft Plan Alternative is 60 percent higher than the projection in the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative. Finally, total capital construction costs under the Draft Plan Alternative would be $61 million higher than under the General Management Plan Amendment 2000 alternative. Appendix V contains a comparison of the capital costs among the alternatives.", "The Trust\u2019s analysis of the public comments it received before releasing the Draft Plan Alternative, indicated that many of those commenting noted concerns with the proposed plans compatibility with the Park Service\u2019s 1994 General Management Plan Amendment.

The financial model projected that the Trust could become financially self-sufficient by 2013 under every alternative.", "In developing the financial model, the Trust relied on historical data from a number of sources, such as the San Francisco area\u2019s real estate markets for data on fair market rental and vacancy rates and national studies for information on capital costs for rehabilitation and new construction. In addition, the Trust made many assumptions in order to project its financial analyses into the future. Some of the key variables included land use, annual program expenditures, and the timing of demolition and rehabilitation of existing buildings.", "According to our economic analysis of the financial model, the Trust\u2019s assumptions appear to be conservative because they tended to minimize projected revenues. For example, even though the market rental rate in calendar year 2000 for Class B office space in San Francisco was about $60 per square foot, the Trust used a more conservative rental rate of $29 per square foot. This rate was based on the average market rate over the past 7 years.", "In developing its financial model, the Trust stated that the model was not designed to be a budgetary or accounting tool and the results should not be interpreted as being what will happen, but rather what could happen given certain assumptions. When the Trust finalizes its Presidio Trust Implementation Plan, it needs to refine the financial model to assure itself that the model\u2019s results are based on the latest and best information and assumptions.", "Also, the model meets the definition of a financial forecast as defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements which provide a mechanism by which financial forecasts that are expected to be used by a third party can be independently examined. Because it is likely that the public, the Congress, and the Trust will rely on the new financial forecast, at least in part, to judge the Trust\u2019s likelihood of becoming financially self-sufficient by 2013, we believe that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants guidelines should be applied and the Trust should have the financial model independently examined. We brought this issue to the attention of Trust officials, who stated they were not aware of such guidance but thought that having a new financial forecast independently examined was a good idea.", "Depending on future rental revenues and how the Trust proceeds with development of the Presidio, it is possible that at some point the Trust may generate revenues in excess of its costs.
