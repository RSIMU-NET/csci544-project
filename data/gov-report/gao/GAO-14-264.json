Different discount rates can create large differences in the valuation of a plan's obligations, which in turn can lead various stakeholders to draw different conclusions about a plan's health, the value of a plan's benefits, and the contributions required to fund them.", "As requested, GAO examined different approaches used to determine the discount rate.

These differences can result in significant implications:", "Sponsors of public sector plans generally use discount rates using a long-term assumed average rate of return on plan assets. This approach results in reported obligations that generally appear lower than those of comparable private sector single-employer plans. Some experts believe this approach may encourage public plans to invest in riskier assets, which can increase the assumed return and thereby lower estimated obligations and plan contributions. Other experts believe this approach helps to maintain more predictable and lower costs. Private sector multiemployer plans generally use an assumed rate of return for funding purposes.", "Sponsors of private sector single-employer pension plans use bond-based discount rates, which are generally lower than assumed rates of return, for financial reporting of their plans' liabilities. Experts believe this approach may encourage plans to invest in less risky assets, particularly high-quality bonds, to make pension costs less volatile, but it may increase current reported costs. Funding requirements for these plans are tied to historical interest rates, which can reduce funding compared to measures based on more recent interest rates.", "Experts identified at least five purposes for measuring the value of future benefits where discount rates are used, including determining sponsor contributions, reporting plan liabilities to stakeholders, determining the amount needed to secure benefits, measuring the value of employee benefits, and determining lump sum settlement amounts. They also identified a variety of considerations in setting discount rate policy, including cost, risk, fairness, sustainability, transparency, and comparability. To address trade-offs among these varied and sometimes competing purposes and considerations, many experts saw value in reporting multiple measures of plan obligations, using different discount rates. Some experts also regarded assumed returns used by U.S. public plans as too high under current market conditions.", "Selected countries we examined reported that they apply a variety of approaches to discounting. Canada requires determination of multiple measures of plan obligations, based on both assumed returns and high-quality bond rates and annuity prices. The Netherlands requires that plan obligations be measured based on market interest rates, but allows the use of assumed returns for determining plan contributions or developing recovery plans. In the United Kingdom, discount rates are determined on a plan-specific basis and can include some allowance for assumed returns in excess of high-quality bond rates, depending on plan characteristics and the strength of the sponsor. To the extent that plans in these countries use long-term assumed rates of return, they are generally lower than the 7.5 to 8 percent used by many U.S. public plans under recent market conditions. Experts GAO interviewed in these countries described a greater degree of government oversight which might help explain their use of lower assumed returns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Traditional defined benefit (DB) plans remain an essential source of  retirement income, with tens of millions of Americans relying on them for  retirement security. As of 2011, state and local government sector DB  plans covered over 28 million participants, many of whom were not  eligible for Social Security, and private sector DB plans covered more  than 40 million Americans. However, DB plans have faced a number of  challenges, including the lingering effects from the 2008 stock market  downturn; the implications of lower interest rates for the cost of financing  retirement benefits; increased longevity of plan participants; and the  possibility of a need for higher contributions to these plans. For some  public plans, these challenges have been compounded by some plan  sponsors not making recommended plan contributions or granting benefit   For  increases during more favorable economic environments in the past.private plans, these challenges have occurred in the context of a long  decline in the portion of private sector workers covered by such plans.  While many plans have weathered these challenges, they have raised  questions about the ability of some DB plans to provide adequate benefits  to current workers and retirees in the future.", "At the same time, experts sharply disagree on which approach should be  taken to calculate these plans\u2019 estimated obligations for benefits promised  to workers and retirees, referred to in this report as liabilities regardless of  the purpose of the measurement (e.g., funding, financial reporting, or  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) reporting). More  specifically, a major source of disagreement relates to how projected  future benefit payments should be discounted\u2014or valued\u2014in today\u2019s  dollars. Discounting is based on the concept that $1 payable in the future  (e.g., in 1 year) is worth less than $1 payable today because the dollar  payable today can be invested and grow with interest over that year. One  approach to discounting future benefits\u2014the \u201cassumed-return  approach\u201d\u2014uses a discount rate based on a long-term assumed average  rate of return on the pension plan\u2019s assets, typically a mix that includes  substantial portions of stocks and bonds. A second approach\u2014the \u201cbond- based approach\u201d\u2014uses a discount rate based on market prices for  bonds, annuities, or other alternatives that are deemed to have certain  characteristics that are similar to pension promises. In many instances, a  bond-based approach produces a lower discount rate, and therefore  higher estimates of pension liabilities, than the assumed-return approach,  particularly given recent bond market conditions and current U.S. practice  in setting assumed-return discount rates.", "The discounting approach used can have a significant effect on the  calculated pension obligations. For example, for a typical pension plan,  the liability calculated using a 4 percent discount rate (a rate close to what  would be produced in recent years under certain bond-based  approaches, with little or no averaging or \u201csmoothing\u201d) could be more  than 80 percent higher than the liability calculated using an 8 percent  discount rate (a rate commonly used under the assumed-return approach  in recent years). In addition, the appropriate discount rate can vary  depending on the purpose of the measurement (see later discussion).  These differences in approach to the valuations of a plan\u2019s liabilities can  lead stakeholders and sponsors to draw very different conclusions about  an individual plan\u2019s financial health, the value of the plan\u2019s promised  benefits, the contributions required to fund those benefits, the appropriate  investment strategy, and perceptions about the health of the defined  benefit \u201csystem\u201d as a whole.", "As requested, GAO examined the differences of opinion concerning  discount rates for pension plan valuations and funding. This report  addresses the following three questions:  1.  What is the significance of the differences in discounting approaches  used by public versus private pension plans?  2.  What are the purposes for measuring the value of a plan\u2019s future  benefits and key considerations for determining plan discount rate  policy?  3.  What approaches have select countries taken to choose discount  rates?", "To address our objectives, we interviewed experts, including actuaries,  economists, and other pension experts, who represent diverse points of  view and a variety of organizations and constituencies.

We also  modeled different hypothetical pension investment portfolios and cash  flows and calculated average investment returns using available historical  data. Lastly, we reviewed approaches used in other countries by selecting  three countries with relatively substantial DB coverage and ongoing  discount rate discussions\u2014Canada, the Netherlands, and the United  Kingdom (U.K.)\u2014and spoke to experts from these countries.

Properly- funded DB plans can shield participants from numerous risks that  participants face in DC plans, including eligible employees not enrolling in  the plan; employees enrolling but contributing amounts likely to be  insufficient, together with other sources of retirement income, to provide  adequate overall retirement income; \u201cleakage\u201d of plan assets through  withdrawals for purposes other than retirement; investment risks; and the  \u201clongevity risk\u201d of outliving one\u2019s savings. Participants in DC plans must  save a sufficient amount through contributions and investment returns to  meet future retirement needs, and must adequately manage both the  \u201caccumulation phase\u201d of building up assets prior to retirement and the  \u201cdecumulation phase\u201d of spending down assets during retirement. On the  other hand, while DB plans can shield participants from numerous risks,  they can sometimes be less advantageous than DC plans for workers  who change employers one or more times before retirement.", "There are several major DB-plan sectors in the United States: (1) \u201cpublic  plans,\u201d which cover state and local government employees; (2) private  sector single-employer plans; (3) private sector multiemployer plans,  which generally cover union employees who work for participating  employers in a particular trade or industry; and (4) nonqualified plans,  which do not meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under  the Internal Revenue Code and are typically maintained by employers  primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for select  groups of management or highly-compensated employees. We will  not discuss nonqualified plans in this report because sponsors of such  plans typically do not have to satisfy laws and regulations requiring a  minimum level of benefits or contributions.", "For most private sector single-employer and multiemployer pension  plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures plan  benefits, up to certain statutory limits, under separate insurance programs  for these two types of plans. PBGC was established under ERISA to insure the pension benefits of participants in qualified DB plans and pay  participants up to the statutory limits, should their plans be terminated  with insufficient funds or become insolvent. The statutory limits on  insured benefits are much lower for multiemployer plans than for single- employer plans. In recent years, PBGC has faced large net  accumulated deficits coupled with future risks posed by plan sponsors  and their plans that have threatened its solvency. PBGC recently  reported that while its single-employer program is likely to remain in net  deficit over the next 10 years, some improvement is projected. However,  there is significant variation in projected results under PBGC\u2019s single- employer Pension Insurance Modeling System, with a worsening of the  financial position of the single-employer program also possible. In  contrast, the financial status of some multiemployer plans is deteriorating.  PBGC reports that the insurance fund for its multiemployer program is  more likely than not to be exhausted within the next 8 years, and 90  percent likely to be exhausted by 2025, which would result in benefits for  participants in insolvent plans being cut to a small fraction of current  guarantees. PBGC uses a discount rate assumption, discussed later,  to determine the present value of projected future pension benefits to be  paid to the participants of single-employer plans it has taken over, and the  present value of projected financial assistance payments to multiemployer  plans.", "In the public sector, DB plans still provide primary pension benefits for  most state and local government workers. In contrast, DB plan coverage  in the private sector has declined as these employers continued to shift  away from sponsoring DB plans toward sponsoring DC plans. About 78  percent of state and local government employees participated in DB plans  in 2013, compared with only 16 percent of private sector employees. few states offer DC or other types of plans as the primary retirement  plan.", "For the same period, there were about 19 million state and local government employees  and over 106 million private sector employees.

Also, unlike private  sector employees with DB plans, state and local government employees  generally contribute to their DB plans.", "As a result, employer-provided  ERISA established minimum standards for pension plans in the private  sector and, through the Internal Revenue Code, provides extensive rules  on the federal tax effects of transactions associated with employee  benefit plans. ERISA protects the interests of employee benefit plan  participants and their beneficiaries by requiring the disclosure of financial  and other information concerning the plan, establishing standards of  conduct for plan fiduciaries, and providing for appropriate remedies and  access to the federal courts, among other things. Since its enactment in  1974, ERISA has been amended many times, including by the Pension  Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), which changed minimum funding standards  for private sector single-employer defined benefit pension plans by,  among other things, changing the measurement of a plan\u2019s funding target  (including the discount rate used) and shortening the period of time over  which the funding target should be attained. Minimum funding standard  provisions have since been further revised by subsequent legislation.  PPA also included provisions requiring private sector multiemployer plans  in poor financial shape to take action to improve their financial condition  over the long term.", "The federal government has not imposed the same funding and reporting  requirements on state and local government pension plans as it has on  private sector pension plans. State and local government plans are  specifically exempted from ERISA funding requirements, in part, because  of the presumption that state and local governments can rely on their  taxing power to pay for DB plan benefits. These plans are also not  insured by the PBGC as private DB plans are. However, in order for  participants to receive preferential tax treatment (that is, for contributions  and investment earnings to be tax-deferred), state and local government  pension plans must comply with certain requirements of the Internal  Revenue Code.", "State and local governments also follow different standards than the  private sector for financial reporting. The accounting standards for  financial reporting by public and private sector pension plan sponsors are  promulgated by two independent organizations. For the public sector, the  GASB has been designated by the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants as the accounting standard-setter to establish generally  accepted accounting principles for U.S. state and local governmental  entities. GASB\u2019s standards are not federal laws or regulations and GASB  does not have enforcement authority.

A pension liability generally includes two  pieces: (1) the present value of all projected future benefits for current  retirees, as well as for former employees not yet retired but who have a  vested right to a future pension, plus (2) the present value of a portion of  the projected future benefits for current employees, based on their service  to date (with each additional year of service adding to the liability, such  that approximately the full cost of benefits is accrued when employees  reach retirement). The increase in the liability that arises from an  additional year of employee service is called the \u201cnormal cost,\u201d which can  also be thought of as the pension cost attributable to employees\u2019 work in  a single year. Both the liability and the normal cost depend on the  discount rate, as they both represent the present value of some portion of  future benefits. The higher the discount rate, the lower the plan\u2019s estimate  of its liability and normal cost (see fig. 1). In addition, the further into the  future that the projected benefit payments occur, the more pronounced is  the effect of the discount rate, because it is applied over a greater number  of years. As a result, a pension liability for current workers is typically  more sensitive to changes in the discount rate than is a pension liability  for retirees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approaches to Determining the Discount Rate", "paragraphs": ["Methods for determining a plan\u2019s discount rate can be categorized into  two primary approaches\u2014the assumed-return and bond-based  approaches. The first approach\u2014the \u201cassumed-return approach\u201d\u2014 bases the discount rate on a long-term assumed average rate of return on  the pension plan\u2019s assets (which includes expected long-term stock  market returns to the extent plan assets are so invested, and which, in  recent years, and as employed by U.S. public plan sponsors, often would  produce discount rates between 7 and 8 percent). Under this  approach, the discount rate depends on the allocation of plan assets. For  example, a reallocation of plan assets into fewer bonds and more stocks  can increase the discount rate and reduce the measurement of plan  liabilities. Under this approach, the discount rate also depends on  estimates of what future investment returns the plan will earn on its  assets; more optimistic estimates produce higher discount rates and  lower plan liabilities. The assumed-return approach is based in part on  the premise that pension plans are long-term enterprises that can  weather fluctuations in financial markets, and that the estimated long-term  average cost of financing plan benefits, based on the plan\u2019s asset  allocation, provides the most relevant measure of plan costs.", "The second approach\u2014the \u201cbond-based approach\u201d\u2014uses a discount rate  based on market prices for bonds, annuities, or other alternatives that are  deemed to have certain characteristics similar to pension promises,  instead of estimates of future returns. The bond-based approach is premised on the theory that pension benefits are \u201cbond-like,\u201d in that they  constitute promises to make specific payments in the future, and should  be similarly valued. Under this approach, the discount rate is independent  of the allocation of plan assets. The relevant bond \u201cquality\u201d (e.g., AAA- rated, AA-rated, etc.) can depend on the specific purpose of the liability  measurement, which can result in rates that vary considerably. There are  at least five variations of bond-based approaches that are in use or have  been proposed.", "Interest Rates on High-Quality Corporate Bonds: This method is  typically used by private sector single-employer plan sponsors for  financial reporting under FASB standards.", "Historical Averages of High-Quality Corporate Bond Interest  Rates: This \u201csmoothing\u201d approach is allowed for funding purposes for  private sector single-employer plan sponsors under amendments to  ERISA and PPA, which allowed discount rates based on a 2-year  average of high-quality corporate bond rates. This 2-year smoothing  was lengthened to 25-year smoothing by the Moving Ahead for  Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), tying discount rates to a  25-year historical average (see table 1 in the next section). The use of  a 25-year historical average results in current discount rates that are  significantly in excess of current or recent interest rates on high  quality bonds.", "Risk-Free Interest Rates: Another variation is to use risk-free interest  rates (e.g., Treasury rates). A panel commissioned by the Society of  Actuaries recommended that public plans disclose an additional  liability measurement using this method, and at least one public plan  currently discloses such a supplemental measure. A liability based  on risk-free interest rates can be thought of as approximating the  amount of money that would be needed to come close to protecting  the payment of future benefits from investment risk. Demographic risk  would still remain, such as the risk of life expectancy improving faster  than expected.", "Matching Bond Credit Quality with Estimated Riskiness of the  Pension Promise: Under this variation, as advocated by some  financial economists for certain purposes, as discussed later, the  bond credit quality could be chosen to match the estimated riskiness  of the pension promise.", "Annuity Settlement Rates: This fifth variation is the method used by  PBGC for its financial reporting of its deficit.be considered a bond-based approach as it is based on estimated  market prices for annuities, which are influenced by, and will vary   This method can also  with, market interest rates. A liability based on an annuity settlement  rate is the estimated market value of the amount of money that is  required to fully insure the payment of future benefits against both  economic and demographic risks. As a result, a settlement liability  can be significantly greater than a liability calculated using high-quality  bond rates. PBGC officials stated that this often leads to unpleasant  surprises when a plan terminates, whereby a plan that was thought by  plan participants to be overfunded turns out to be underfunded. The  remainder of this report focuses mainly on the discount rates used by  plan sponsors and trustees.", "Because bond interest rates are currently at historic lows (see fig. 2), and  because plans\u2019 assumed returns have not declined commensurately,  bond-based approaches today that use little or no smoothing are likely to   produce discount rates that are much lower than current assumed  returns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defined Benefit Systems in Selected Other Countries", "paragraphs": ["The discount rate approaches and regulatory structure governing pension  plans in Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom differ in  various ways from those in the United States. As in the United States,  most Canadian defined benefit plans\u2014both public and private\u2014are  prefunded, according to Canadian experts with whom we spoke.  Additionally, they noted that most plans are regulated at the provincial  level, although some plans, such as those of federally regulated  employers such as banks, telecommunications companies, and inter- provincial transportation companies, are regulated by a separate federal  regulator. Nonetheless, the regulatory principles are generally similar  across all regulators, according to experts. There is no national pension  insurance program in Canada. In the Netherlands, De Nederlandsche  Bank (DNB) regulates pension discount rates. An official told us that  there are no regulatory distinctions among public, private, or  multiemployer defined benefit plans in the Netherlands.

Benefit  amounts can vary with plan investment performance and plan funded  status. In the United Kingdom, private sector defined benefit plans are  prefunded and public sector plans generally are not. The Pensions  Regulator is the regulating entity for private pension plans and a national  pension insurance program is administered by the Pension Protection  Fund. Plans have trustees who are autonomous from the sponsoring  employers. The trustees and employers negotiate in setting plan policies,  with assumptions and approaches subject to a risk-based process of  review by the Pensions Regulator. According to experts, the Pensions  Regulator uses what it calls a Scheme Specific Funding framework for  evaluating funding requirements.

Private sector multiemployer plans generally use an  assumed-return approach for funding purposes, but also calculate an  additional liability measure under ERISA based on an average of  Treasury bond rates, while standards related to discounting for  accounting purposes are typically not applicable to participating  employers in these plans. These various rules and guidance result in  considerable variation in the discount rates that are currently in use. The  result is discount rates that are generally highest for public plans and for  funding private sector multiemployer plans, followed by discount rates for  funding private sector single-employer plans (under the interest rate path  of the past 25 years). The lowest discount rates among U.S. plans are for  financial reporting by sponsors of private sector single-employer plans  and for the additional liability calculated by multiemployer plans.", "Table 1 summarizes these laws, standards, and rules for different plan  types. Different laws and standards also specify different actuarial cost  methods and give different names to the resulting liability measures. See  appendix II for more details. In addition, both FASB and GASB have  differences in their requirements applicable to financial reporting by  pension plan sponsors (and participating employers in the case of  multiemployer plans) and financial reporting by the pension plans  themselves. Under GASB standards, the discount rate requirements are  the same for both plan sponsor and plan financial reporting. Under FASB  standards, plan sponsors are required to discount using \u201csettlement  rates,\u201d---which can be based on the discount rates implicit in the current  prices of annuity contracts, such as PBGC\u2019s rates, but can also be based  on current high quality bond rates, which plan sponsors generally do--- while plans are required to discount using best-estimate assumed rates of  return. With regard to U.S. financial reporting requirements, the focus of  this report is on requirements applicable to plan sponsors and  participating employers, not financial reporting by the plans themselves.", "Public plans and private sector multiemployer plans generally report  higher funded ratios, and their liabilities generally appear lower, than  those of comparable private sector single-employer plans because these  plans currently use very different discount rate approaches, leading to  potentially large differences in funded ratios and reported liabilities. This  difference is because public plan sponsors\u2019 and multiemployer plans\u2019  discount rates are determined largely using an assumed-return approach,  which generally produces higher discount rates. As such, this  approach generally produces lower liabilities than variations of bond- based approaches with little or no smoothing (which often produces lower  discount rates), as used by private sector single-employer plan sponsors  for financial reporting purposes. For example, Mercer, a retirement  industry consultant, estimated that at the end of 2013 an average private  sector single-employer plan sponsor would have a discount rate of 4.88  percent for FASB reporting. According to the National Association of  State Retirement Administrators, however, public plan sponsors assumed  a return of 7.72 percent on average as of December 2013.

There are other  experts, however, who disagree with this viewpoint or see value in both  types of measures. See the next section for a discussion of various  considerations underlying different views on discount rate policy.", "Bond-based discount rates can vary considerably, and may not always  result in significantly lower discount rates than assumed-returns. In  practice, there are variations of the bond-based approach that can result  in discount rates that do not, to varying degrees, reflect current or recent  market rates. These approaches have been implemented or proposed in  order to provide stability for funding or financial reporting purposes but  can have the effect of obscuring any measure of a market value of the  liability (i.e., a connection to current market prices). For funding  purposes under ERISA as amended by the PPA, but prior to the MAP-21  amendments, private sector single-employer plan sponsors who elected  to use 2-year smoothing of interest rates based on high-quality corporate  bonds would have used, in December 2013, Treasury-prescribed  discount rates of 1.28 percent for benefit payments due in less than 5  years, 4.05 percent for payments due between 5 and 20 years, and 5.07  percent for payments due in 20 years or more. This simplified three- segment yield curve was adjusted up by MAP-21, with its boundaries tied  to 25-year smoothing, to minimum rates of 4.94 percent, 6.15 percent,  and 6.76 percent respectively, for the same month (see app. II for more  details). In contrast, PBGC interest rate factors at December 30, 2013  were 3.00 percent for benefit payments within the first 20 years and 3.31  percent for payments beyond 20 years. At these discount rates, the  present value of a benefit payment due in 15 years for a private sector  single-employer plan under ERISA (MAP-21) segment rates would be  closer to the value determined under the average 7.72 percent assumed  return used by public plans than to the annuity settlement rate used by  PBGC.", "Table 2 summarizes the preceding findings with regard to public and  private sector discount rates.", "In addition to the discount rate, the actuarial cost method used to allocate  retirement costs among employees\u2019 work years can affect the size of a  pension plan\u2019s liability. Public sector plan sponsors typically use  actuarial cost methods that assign higher liabilities to younger workers as  compared to the cost methods private sector single-employer plan  sponsors use. As discussed in appendix II, the cost methods typically  used by public plan sponsors tend to somewhat increase the liability  relative to the cost methods used by private sector single-employer plan  sponsors. However, this effect is often greatly offset by the effect of the  differences in discount rates determined between the bond-based and  assumed-return approaches.", "These different funding and financial reporting requirements for setting  discount rates for different types of plans also result in differing amounts  of discretion that plan sponsors can use in setting their discount rates. Of  the GASB, ERISA, and FASB requirements with respect to discount  rates, GASB standards and ERISA\u2019s multiemployer funding standards  leave the most room for judgment, because, for example, estimated long- term average rates of return on pension plan investments in equities are  judgments rather than observable data, and such estimates can vary  significantly even among experts. This stands in contrast to ERISA\u2019s  single-employer standards and FASB standards (for plan sponsors) which  allow less discretion.", "Some experts said that the assumed-return approach could incentivize  public plan sponsors to invest in riskier assets because doing so can  increase the assumed-return discount rate, thereby lowering reported  liabilities and reducing funding requirements. In addition, some experts  said that some public plan sponsors have sometimes inverted the  recommended practice of first determining plan asset allocation\u2014based  on an assessment of investment goals and the amount of risk that can be  taken on\u2014and then deriving a discount rate based on an assumed long- term average return for that mix of assets. Instead, these experts said  that some plan sponsors have set a target discount rate and then asked  the plan\u2019s investment team to develop an asset allocation to support it.  Other experts stated that this practice does not occur. In a related way,  some experts said that the assumed-return approach has led some public  plan sponsors to issue pension obligation bonds.bonds could help state and local governments improve plan funding, the  increased capital into the pension fund is derived from the apparent  arbitrage opportunity created for the plan sponsor by taking on more debt  outside the plan. The use of an assumed-return discount rate allows the  plan sponsor to capitalize on the difference between the assumed return  on the invested assets and the interest rate on the pension obligation  bonds, essentially taking credit for the assumed returns before actually  achieving them. The use of pension obligation bonds effectively allows  plan sponsors to invest on \u201cmargin,\u201d or borrow money to invest in risky  While issuing such  assets. This strategy comes with increased risk and is only successful if  the sponsor\u2019s pension assets actually do appreciate at a higher rate than  the rate at which the plan sponsor borrowed.", "Some experts told us that it is also possible that a plan\u2019s discount rate  approach could influence future benefit levels. At the most basic level, the  cost of benefits typically will appear lower using an assumed-return  discount rate than using a bond-based discount rate, perhaps leading to  compensation packages that are weighted toward more retirement  benefits or to larger overall compensation packages. Further, some  experts expressed concern that sponsors of plans that have earned more  than the assumed return, such as in a bull market, have given this extra  return to participants as a benefit increase, but that benefits would not be  cut at the same rate during periods of low returns. To the extent this  occurs, it would mean that an assumed-return discount rate would need  to be lowered, or the plan liability increased in some other manner, to  reflect the fact that future bull-market gains would not be fully available to  offset future bear market losses. On the other hand, many public plans  have reduced some aspect of their benefit structure in recent years in  response to low returns on assets.", "In contrast to the investment incentives that public plan sponsors (and  multiemployer plans) may face, the use of a bond-based discount rate for  private sector single-employer plan sponsors can create an incentive to  invest in bonds to make pension contributions more predictable or  financial reporting results less volatile. For plans using bond-based discount rates (with little or no smoothing), liability values will fluctuate  with changes in market interest rates. A bond-based investment policy  can be used so that plan asset values will move in tandem with liability  values as interest rates fluctuate. The greater the match between a plan\u2019s  investment assets and the amount and timing of its projected benefit  payments, the more stable the plan\u2019s funded status will be. However,  holding bonds means forgoing potentially higher returns from equities.  Thus, the more that a plan matches assets to liabilities by purchasing  similar-duration low-risk bonds, the more expensive the plan may become  to fund, which may provide a countervailing disincentive to invest more in  bonds.", "Additional incentive effects are discussed in the next section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Identified a Variety of Considerations for Setting Discount Rate Policy and Many Saw Value in Plan Sponsors Reporting Multiple Measures", "paragraphs": ["For many of the experts we interviewed, the appropriate discount rate to  use depends on the purpose of the measurement.

These considerations can present trade- offs in setting discount rate policy and can be grouped into issues related  to cost and risks, fairness and sustainability, and transparency. (See table  3 for a summary of these considerations). In terms of costs and risks,  some experts identify tradeoffs between two competing goals: having  level and predictable costs versus being certain that plans will ultimately  have sufficient funds to ensure benefit security for plan participants and  minimizing risks to other stakeholders, including the entity sponsoring the  plan, shareholders and PBGC in the case of a private sector plan, and  taxpayers and beneficiaries of public services in the case of a public plan.  Some experts also said that it could be useful to account for plan and  sponsor characteristics in setting discount rates for funding purposes.  Plan and sponsor characteristics could include the size of the plan  relative to the size of the plan sponsor, the maturity of the plan, and the  strength of the plan sponsor. In terms of issues of fairness and  sustainability, experts disagreed on whether an assumed-return or bond- based approach to discounting would best ensure intergenerational equity  for bearing the cost of these plans, and would best promote system  sustainability. Additionally, experts who support the use of only the bond- based approach or both approaches identified transparency and  comparability as important considerations for setting discount rate policy,  but they disagreed as to whether these considerations suggested using  an assumed-return or bond-based discount rate. Lastly, many experts  cited financial economic theory as an important consideration in setting  discount rate policy based on market valuation principles. Other experts  argued that this theory is not relevant to public plans because as \u201cgoing- concerns\u201d with very long time horizons, they do not have significant risk of  plan termination; according to these experts, discounting based on long- term assumed-return expectations is a best estimate of long-term plan  costs for public plans.", "Level and predictability of costs refers to the level of certainty a  sponsor has that its pension costs will be affordable and stable from  year to year. Reported costs based on bond rates will typically be  higher than reported costs based on assumed rates of return, but  depending on asset allocation and amortization periods. Experts  also noted that liabilities based on point-in-time bond-market rates will  fluctuate as interest rates rise and fall, causing costs to be  unpredictable compared to costs based on assumed long-term  returns, which tend to be more stable than bond interest rates  because they are based on very long-term expectations. Some of  these experts suggested smoothing discount rates by averaging bond  rates over a number of years in order to make costs more predictable,  as used by most private single-employer plan sponsors under ERISA  provisions. Other experts preferred that, if smoothing were to be done,  that costs be smoothed directly rather than smoothing discount  rates. For funding purposes, private sector single-employer plan  sponsors generally use a smoothing approach to discount rates, but  for financial reporting, they do not.", "Benefit security and risks to stakeholders are the risks that a plan will  be unable to pay promised benefits to plan participants or will present  serious financial challenges to other stakeholders, including the entity  sponsoring the plan, shareholders and PBGC, and PBGC premium  payers in the case of a private sector plan, and taxpayers and  beneficiaries of public services in the case of a public plan. In the  private sector, some companies fail and sometimes entire industries  decline. While participants in single-employer plans have PBGC  protection, it is limited, and participants sometimes lose a portion of  their benefits. Participants in multiemployer plans face greater risks:  as noted earlier, their PBGC benefit limits are much lower, and PBGC  projects that its multiemployer insurance program is itself likely to  become insolvent within the next decade without further action. While  states cannot and local governments usually do not go out of  business and have the option to raise tax revenue or reduce services  to pay for underfunded benefits, some local governments have  entered into bankruptcy and some participants in public plans have  lost some current benefits or anticipated future growth in benefits.", "Benefit losses can be particularly challenging for those public sector  participants who are not covered by Social Security. Some experts  told us that using an assumed-return discount rate could obscure the  risk that a plan could ultimately be unable to pay for benefits, and/or a  sponsor may be unable or unwilling to make necessary additional  contributions, even though the plan might appear fully funded on a  given date using an assumed return discount rate. For example, a  plan could be insolvent if it needed to terminate, even if it was fully  funded using an assumed-return discount rate or a bond-based rate  with significant smoothing, because the cost to actually buy out the  pension benefits or transfer them to another party could be much  higher than the liability using an assumed return. Another risk to  using the assumed-return approach cited by some experts is that a  plan\u2019s assets could fail to grow at the assumed return, which would  require higher-than-expected contributions or future reductions in  benefits. The associated risks to participants would depend on how  well the sponsor could use other financial resources to make up  funding shortfalls and pay benefits. Due to these risks, according to  some experts, using a discount rate that is lower than an assumed- return rate\u2014whether a bond-based rate (with little or no smoothing) or  something in between an assumed-return rate and a bond-based  rate\u2014can be viewed as a lower-risk approach than a pure assumed- return approach. Specifically, because the discount rates would be  more conservative, sponsors would have to put more money into the  plan to be fully funded, which would provide a cushion against the  possibility of actual returns falling short of those assumed and being  inadequate to pay for future benefits.", "Plan and plan sponsor characteristics, such as the size of the plan  relative to the size of the plan sponsor, the maturity of the plan, and  the strength of the plan sponsor may be key factors in determining an  appropriate discount rate, particularly for funding purposes. Two  supporters of the assumed-return approach for some purposes said  that weak plan sponsors with uncertain futures might need to be more  conservative in setting a discount rate because the sponsor might not  be able to make up the difference (through higher future contributions)  if plan investments perform poorly. Based on interviews with  experts, we identified the following key plan and sponsor  characteristics to consider in setting the discount rate:  1.  The size of the plan relative to the size of the plan sponsor, since a  small sponsor with a large plan may be less able to cope with  assumed returns that fail to materialize. The size of a plan sponsor  could be measured by metrics such as revenue or market  capitalization for a corporation or revenue or tax base for a state or  local government.  2.  The maturity of the plan, since an aging plan with few new participants  will wind down over a shorter time horizon. Such a plan will have less  time to recover if it does not meet investment expectations.  3.  The strength of the plan sponsor, since a sponsor with strong revenue  projections is better positioned to take risks with funding or investment  policy or with its discount rate approach.", "These characteristics can change over time. Indeed, it is not uncommon  for a plan\u2019s demographics to mature over time, for a plan to grow in size  relative to the size of the plan sponsor over time, or for once-healthy plan  sponsors to become financially strained. Related to this is that risks to  plans and plan sponsors are \u201ccorrelated,\u201d meaning that a market  downturn may both decrease the value of plan assets and weaken the  financial health of the plan sponsor at the same time.

However, the different plan sectors  have unique guidelines and practices for arriving at a final discount rate  for different purposes.", "Multiemployer plans have a choice of actuarial cost methods under ERISA for  determining the accrued liability on which minimum required contributions are primarily  based. Multiemployer plans also disclose, on Schedule MB of Form 5500, two liability  measures based on the unit credit actuarial cost method: an accrued liability using the  plan\u2019s assumed return discount rate, and a measure called the current liability using a  discount rate based on a 4-year weighted average of 30-year Treasury rates. use the entry age actuarial cost method. Using this method, a worker\u2019s  service and salary are both projected to retirement to estimate a projected  benefit. The cost of this benefit is allocated over the worker\u2019s entire  service (both past and projected future) as a level percentage of his or  her salary (for plans whose benefit formula is tied to salary levels). The  accrued liability is the value of these allocated costs accumulated up to  the point of the worker\u2019s service to date. The resulting liability measure is  simply called the total pension liability. For active workers, holding  actuarial assumptions constant, an entry age normal accrued liability  (GASB method) will typically be somewhat higher than a projected unit  credit accrued liability (FASB method), which in turn will typically be  somewhat higher (for benefit formulas tied to salary levels) than a unit  credit accrued liability (ERISA method). For plan participants who are  already retired or terminated employment, these three methods produce  the same liability.", "In addition, the different funding and financial reporting requirements for  setting discount rates for different types of plans also result in differing  amounts of discretion that plan sponsors can use in setting their discount  rates.

Thus, for some plans the composite discount rate will be a hybrid of the  assumed-return approach and bond-based approach. Industry experts  have indicated that, on average, the composite discount rate is likely to  be closer to the assumed-return rate for two reasons: many plans have  contribution policies which, combined with current plan assets, are likely  to be projected to cover projected benefit payments, so that the blended  discount rate will be the same as the assumed-return discount rate; and  for those plans where there is a projected insufficiency, the bond-based  approach would only apply to a portion of plan liabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ERISA Requirements", "paragraphs": ["With regard to the rates they use to discount benefits, single-employer  sponsors are generally required to use a bond-based approach to  determine the minimum required contribution.

Plan sponsors are given the option of using a full yield  curve approach, which matches projected benefit payments to high- quality corporate bond interest rates averaged over a current month, so  that under this option, the measurement of plan liabilities would be tied to  current or recent market conditions. A plan choosing this approach would  discount a benefit payment due in 10 years at the yield curve rate as  published by Treasury for year 10.

In contrast, a public plan using an assumed rate of return would typically  discount all future benefit payments at the same assumed return.
