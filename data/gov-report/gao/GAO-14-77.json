To  select the other cases, we obtained DCMA data on the highest dollar  contract terminations since those covered in our 2008 report that were  associated with canceled programs. In addition, we considered  cancellations reviewed for our 2008 report where there was potential to  assess additional activity since that report. We then selected cases with  completed settlements and the potential for follow up on leveraged  assets, and also included in our total sample at least one case each for  the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Section 812 of the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated that we report to the congressional  defense committees on the extent to which, among other things, DOD  considered estimates of potential termination liability as a factor in  entering into and terminating certain contracts. Our work in response to  that mandate included reviewing a DOD assessment of the extent to  which the department considers potential termination liability as a factor in  entering into and terminating contracts. We also selected a non- generalizable sample of seven current weapon programs in development  and production and collected information on whether these programs  have been requiring contract termination liability estimates before award  and during the course of a contract. These programs were selected to  represent a range of weapon platforms and military services, and to  include both development and production programs.

Increasingly, individual weapon system  investments are getting more complex and more dependent on software.  Moreover, in many cases, weapon systems are also expected to  incorporate technologies that push the state-of-the-art while operating in  harsh and even untested environments\u2014adding daunting technical  challenges that increase the cost and complexity of development.", "DOD typically executes several primary contracts over the life cycle of a  weapon system program. These contracts generally cover development,  production, or maintenance efforts.", "Although a program and its contracts are related, they are separate,  distinct efforts that can end separately. For the purposes of this review,  we refer to the end of a program as a cancellation, and the end of a  contract as a termination. For example, DOD may cancel a program but  continue a contract related to that program. Alternatively, DOD can  terminate a contract but continue the program. In some cases, programs  may not be formally canceled, but instead restructured. For example,  DOD could continue a program, but change requirements and modify a  contract or even change contractors to better align the program with  available resources.", "Cancellation of major programs has not been common in the past, and  we have noted in prior work that the acquisition of weapon systems  involves strong incentives to reduce the risk that a program will be  interrupted or called into question. When programs have been canceled,  cost, schedule, and performance problems have often been cited as  reasons for this decision, and officials have noted that program  cancellation is perceived as failure. However, in some circumstances,  program cancellation may be the best choice. As we reported in March  2013, DOD\u2019s 2012 portfolio of 86 major defense acquisition programs is  estimated to cost a total of $1.6 trillion. This represents a decrease of  about $44 billion from the previous year, due primarily to program  cancellations and restructurings. However, compared to original  estimates, the total cost of the portfolio has increased by over $400 billion  with an average delay of 27 months in the delivery of initial operating  capability, which suggests that opportunities exist to improve efficiencies  in DOD\u2019s portfolio. In 2008, we concluded that from an investment  portfolio perspective, cancellation can be a valuable tool in responding to  long-term fiscal imbalances. In 2009, Congress acted to make  cancellation the default for programs that experience a breach of a critical  cost growth threshold. In recent years, DOD has cited renewed efforts to  end troubled programs and to achieve a better capabilities balance, and  to that end DOD\u2019s annual budget submissions in recent years have each  reflected major program cancellations\u2014at least three per year and as  many as eight.", "In response to potential cancellations, defense stakeholders have  sometimes expressed concerns that terminating a contract will cost more  than completing it. In our 2008 report, we reviewed DOD\u2019s past  experience with program cancellations and contract terminations and  found that there are limited circumstances in which it could cost the  government more to terminate a contract than to complete it. Of the  eight contracts we reviewed, we did not find any cases in which the total  amount paid on a terminated contract exceeded the estimated contract  price. We recommended DOD review, and as needed amend, termination  guidance to ensure it consistently identified the conditions under which it  is appropriate to end programs or contracts, and provided the knowledge  needed to use terminations as an investment portfolio tool. DOD  concurred with this recommendation. However, DOD subsequently  determined that no changes to guidance were needed. We also  highlighted important lessons for DOD in making decisions to cancel  individual programs as well as in managing its broader investment  portfolio. For example, when considering cancellation of individual  programs, contract termination costs are generally not a compelling  reason to continue programs or contracts that otherwise warrant ending.  Moreover, while incurred or \u201csunk\u201d costs in programs being considered for  cancellation may be substantial, they must be paid regardless of whether  or not a contract is terminated. Therefore, the decision to terminate a  contract or cancel a program should not be driven by sunk costs. In  addition, when a contract warrants termination, the decision should be  made as soon as possible because delaying a termination almost always  results in higher settlement costs to the government. Finally, we noted  when a program or contract ends, DOD can make choices that would  allow the government to retain value from the work completed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weapon Programs Acquire Various Assets That May Be Leveraged", "paragraphs": ["Weapon programs acquire various types of assets throughout a  program\u2019s life cycle; assets that may include property, including computer hardware, equipment, material, special  tooling, facilities, and real property; and  software and technical data, which can include manuals, engineering  drawings, specifications, data rights, and data delivery.", "When a program ends, activities related to shutting down the program  include determining how to retain the most value from the government\u2019s  investment, which, for the purposes of this report, is the government\u2019s  expenditures on the program up to the date of cancellation. This can  include terminating or otherwise restructuring contracts, and assessing  how best to leverage the program\u2019s assets. For example, program  officials might identify technologies and facilities that can be realigned for  use on other programs. Alternately, the government may ultimately sell  assets or determine that they are not suitable for continued development.  In some cases, assets that are not reused may be destroyed or  dismantled. Figure 1 illustrates some examples of program assets.", "The types of assets a program owns will depend, in part, on the phase of  the program.

However, the  impact of a weapon program cancellation can extend beyond the  immediate program and its contractors and ultimately affect a broader  industrial base and local economies, as well as other programs and  agencies. Consideration of these various effects and consultation with  various stakeholders enables officials to have a better understanding of  the costs, benefits, and legal requirements involved in a particular  cancellation and to take steps that can help mitigate negative effects. In  addition, shutdown activities can take years. While the immediate task of  shutting down the program falls to the program office, there are other  necessary tasks, such as reallocating program funds, that fall beyond the  program\u2019s purview. Figure 2 illustrates the potential effects to be  considered when a program is canceled."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Costs", "paragraphs": ["A canceled program does not stop incurring costs immediately upon  cancellation. Once a program has been canceled, the program office  must undertake shutdown activities, which include determining whether to  terminate or otherwise restructure contracts and determining how best to  leverage the program\u2019s assets. Conducting tasks such as negotiating with  contractors and disposing of inventory requires program staff to remain  on duty and can incur cost to the government. When cancellation leads to  the termination of a contract for convenience, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) directs the contractor to submit a proposal to the  government for the amount of reimbursement it believes it is entitled to  within one year of the official date of the termination. This may include  termination costs, the incurred costs for work already performed by the  contractor, and possibly a reasonable profit or fee on completed work.  Termination costs, which represent costs that the government would not  have otherwise incurred if it did not terminate the contract, can include  expenses such as preparing the settlement proposal, negotiating with  subcontractors, and disposing of inventory. With assistance from the  Defense Contracting Audit Agency to audit the settlement proposals,  DOD then enters into negotiations with the contractor to determine a  settlement. Ultimately, DOD will likely be required to reimburse the  contractor for termination costs, which can reach up to the hundreds of  millions of dollars for a large program, though these costs can be small  relative to the full cost of the program. The final amount of termination  cost owed will not be determined until final settlement. For canceled  programs, the extent of work associated with a shutdown is sometimes  not immediately clear.

For example, when the Army\u2019s Comanche Helicopter  program was canceled in 2004, the Army proposed an investment  strategy that would redistribute $14.6 billion of planned Comanche  funding through fiscal year 2011 to enhance a broad range of Army  aviation modernization efforts. After securing approval from the Secretary  of Defense and the President, the Army briefed Congress on its plan to  redistribute the remaining Comanche funds within the Army aviation  portfolio. Based on those discussions, the Army developed a plan to  redistribute this funding to 30 different projects and other weapon  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capabilities Delivery", "paragraphs": ["Cancellation of a program can lead to a delay in providing capabilities to  the warfighter. As a result, DOD may need to increase funds for other  programs to extend the life of existing or legacy systems. For example,  the Navy\u2019s VH-71 program was initiated to build a replacement for the  current presidential helicopters with improved transportation,  communication, and security capabilities. The Navy\u2019s original plan was to  field the first of these new helicopters by 2008. However, after the  program experienced schedule slips and continued cost increases, the  program was canceled in 2009. The Navy has since initiated a successor  VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, which is still in the  early stages of development and not expected to have initial operational  capability until fiscal year 2020. Until that time, the Navy plans to continue  to maintain the legacy helicopters that it had otherwise planned to replace  with the VH-71. Additionally, in May 2007, we found that the ACS contract  termination resulted in about an additional $900 million investment  beyond what had been previously planned to maintain the legacy  systems. Another example is the Army\u2019s canceled FCS, a multibillion  dollar development program originally consisting of 18 manned and  unmanned systems tied together by an extensive communications and  information network. Initiated in 2003, the first Army combat teams were  planned to be FCS-equipped in 2011, while the rest would be fully  equipped by 2032. When the Manned Ground Vehicle portion of the  program was canceled in 2009, the Army altered its modernization  strategy but continued to develop unmanned vehicles and improved  network and technology sensors in order to deliver them to selected  combat teams starting in fiscal year 2011. Faced with disappointing test  results and high costs, FCS was fully canceled in 2011.

The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009  mandated that DOD add the impact of the cancellation of major weapon  systems in its assessment of the national technology and industrial base  that it provides annually to Congress. For example, the 2012  assessment reported on the impact of the 2009 cancellation of the  Manned Ground Vehicle portion of the Army\u2019s FCS, which was supposed  to replace current Army vehicles such as the M1 Abrams Tank and M-2  Bradley Fighting Vehicle. In our prior work, we found that smaller  companies that rely on government contracts can be particularly affected  by program cancellations. In addition, program cancellation can impact  a community that is economically dependent on a contractor facility.

Officials of the VH-71 and ACS  programs, both of whose acquisition strategies were to integrate existing  or developing systems onto a base platform, told us they expected that  program assets would be used on successor or related programs and  therefore bypassed the plant clearance process. In addition, PCARSS is  not used for assets that the government allows the contractor to continue  to use after a program is terminated, or items sold back to the contractor  or to third parties.

Defense procedures require contractors to identify in the  contract the technical data rights to be granted to the government and  delivered under the contract.  Contractors generally identify the  government\u2019s rights to technical data at the beginning of the contract  process and prior to delivery of the technical data using the Contract Data  Requirements List (CDRL)\u2014an exhibit to the contract that contains the  technical data deliverables. The technical data rights assigned to the  government can vary depending on the nature of the data, source of the  funding and negotiated terms of the contract.

Specifically, the following:", "Limited recordkeeping for unrestricted data rights\u2014The CDRL  does not contain all technical data items delivered to the government.  The DFARS requires contractors to identify technical data rights with  restrictions in the contracts. According to an Army intellectual  property attorney, the CDRL generally contains the restricted items  and not the items that are unrestricted such as those assigned  government purpose or unlimited rights. Consequently, the  unrestricted rights are not evident at contract termination and it can be  difficult to track all technical data rights that should be accounted for  when a contract is terminated.", "Complications transferring a combination of software under  contract\u2014When a system under development includes a  combination of software products, each with different types of rights  assigned, the government may need to identify all of the software  under the contract and renegotiate the data rights. For example, when  the FCS program was canceled, the Army planned to transfer the  System of Systems Common Operating Environment (SOSCOE) to  the Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and  Engineering Center for further development and distribution to  program offices that had use for it. However, SOSCOE contained a  combination of software that was DOD-developed, developed by FCS  subcontractors, developed for commercial purposes, and some that  was open source. Before transferring SOSCOE, the Army worked with  the subcontractor to develop a single distribution agreement for the  government purpose rights and open source software, and a special  license agreement for the portion of software developed for  commercial purposes.", "Difficulty in determining the value of technical data and software  before transferring data rights\u2014According to an Army intellectual  property attorney, the assignment of value to technical data and  software rights is not clearly understood and these values are  assigned, in most cases, by the contractor. Further, some contractors  are more sophisticated than others in determining the value of data  rights and maintaining good documentation. In some cases, the  government and contractors have had difficulties valuing rights in  technical data even if line items in the contract identify the technical  data to be delivered and specify the assigned value for each item. The  government may need to contest the contractors\u2019 assigned values to  technical data rights before it can transfer those rights, particularly  when there are unknowns with a program, such as the case with  research and development programs where the development  approach may not be stable and could necessitate changes to the  contract.", "Loss of knowledgeable personnel for tracking transfers\u2014 According to DOD officials, staff familiar with the contract and the  government\u2019s technical data rights would be the best source for  tracking their transfer.

For example, the Comanche program had staff with aircraft  technology expertise who helped find appropriate recipients for  equipment. A former FCS official told us that he tried\u2014by speaking at  trade shows, trying to publish technical papers, and networking with  people\u2014to make the user community aware that SOSCOE was available  for distribution.

However,  some issues involving termination costs may not be resolved until after  the termination settlement process begins. Contractors have a year from  the time of termination to produce a settlement proposal and, according to  a senior contracting termination official, contractors often request  extensions of this deadline for large and complex programs. During this  time, the contractor is to resolve areas of uncertainty and take a position  as to which costs can be claimed as termination costs. For example,  former contracting officials for the VH-71 program noted that there was  uncertainty during contract execution regarding whether the cost of  certain contractor investments, such as facilities and test vehicles, could  be claimed by the contractor as termination costs. Contractors and  program offices must also agree on the price of any contract changes that  had been unpriced at the time of termination. In the case of FCS, a former  program official said that a series of partial contract terminations and  changes to the contract led to frequent fluctuations in cost estimates that  made it more difficult to make an accurate estimate of the cost of  terminating the contract. DCMA officials told us final settlement for the  FCS contract is not expected until 2016. In two of the five canceled  programs we reviewed, a major obstacle to settling the terminated  contract was determining the fees due to the contractors for their work. A  senior contract termination official said that there are a number of other  termination costs that can be significant but difficult to calculate until after  the termination process has begun, including the costs of stopping work  until the contract is terminated and costs associated with the Worker  Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires contractors to  provide advance notice in the event of a mass termination or plant  closure.

Termination cost estimates are included among other cost data  in these reports, which contractors are required to regularly provide the  program office to help forecast and plan funding for the program. The  CFSRs we reviewed included individual estimates of the cost of  terminating the contract during each of the immediate months or quarters,  then estimates for termination costs in subsequent quarterly or annual  periods thereafter. In response to our survey of seven major weapon  programs currently in development or production, conducted as part of  our related work, the five programs that reported a source for information  used to develop their termination estimates identified their contractor,  usually through CFSRs. Six of the respondents reported considering  termination liability estimates during contract execution while one  reported considering termination liability estimates when awarding the  contract.", "Some program officials we spoke with were uncertain of how contractors  arrived at these estimates, and were not aware of any additional  information provided by contractors to support these estimates. For two of  the canceled programs we reviewed, estimated termination costs  provided by the contractor increased as terminations became more likely,  in one example by almost 50 percent from the previous quarter. A  former program official that we spoke with said that these increases  suggest that when producing their termination cost estimates, the  contractors were including all costs that could conceivably be allowable  under the FAR. In at least one case, uncertainty about costs included in  the contractor estimate led to considerable uncertainty in the program  office estimate that was submitted to decision makers.", "DOD also has access to its own independent termination cost estimates  from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE);  however, their usefulness to DOD during the consideration or planning of  a program cancellation is limited because they are usually developed  before contracts are awarded. At major milestone decisions in which  weapon programs enter the next acquisition phase, CAPE produces  independent costs assessments for DOD that include estimated  termination costs for the program. While these estimates are produced  independently within DOD, unlike those in the CFSRs, CAPE might not  provide estimates between milestone reviews, which can be many years  apart. For example, the VH-71 was canceled in 2009, while its last  milestone review was in 2005. Furthermore, when CAPE produces  estimates at the milestone phase, it is generally before a contract is  awarded, so the estimates do not reflect any data from contract  execution. According to a CAPE cost assessor, contract termination  estimates are generally not a major point of consideration during DOD  milestone reviews.", "Though it would not have applied to the canceled programs we reviewed,  the recently updated weapons acquisition instruction released by DOD in  November 2013 requires a termination liability estimate for all large  weapon acquisitions prior to contract award. Specifically, the  instructions require weapon programs for which termination liability can  be reasonably expected to exceed $100 million to include an estimate of  the potential termination liability in the program\u2019s acquisition strategy as  well as how the liability is likely to increase or decrease during execution  of the contract.", "In limited instances, contractors may provide estimates of some  termination costs prior to contract execution. Contracts for weapon  programs may contain a special termination cost (STC) clause, which  reflects the program and the contractor\u2019s estimation of certain termination  costs prior to award of the contract. However, according to officials, these  clauses are rare and do not necessarily represent all types of allowable  termination costs. Specifically, these clauses define a maximum amount  of specific termination costs that will be payable to the contractor if the  contract is terminated. DFARS states that this clause may be used when  approved by an agency head, when the contract meets certain duration  and investment thresholds, and when adequate funds are available to  cover potential liability.", "Although contracts for two of the programs we reviewed contained such  clauses, FCS and Comanche, a senior DCMA contract termination official  said that he has rarely encountered these clauses in the terminated  contracts he has reviewed. For those two programs, termination cost  uncertainty remained despite the existence of the clause. In the case of  the Comanche program, the STC clause set the special termination cost  limit for the contract at $123.2 million for fiscal year 2004, the year in  which it was canceled. When the Army requested an estimate from the  contractor for the final termination costs, the contractor responded with a  rough order of magnitude of $640 million, noting that the estimate  included other termination costs not covered by the STC clause. The STC  clause did not provide a basis for the program office to evaluate these  other potential termination costs included in the contractor\u2019s rough order  of magnitude termination cost estimate. When the contract termination  was settled, the final termination costs were around $143 million after  program officials made efforts to minimize these costs. In the case of  FCS, officials were unclear how the STC clause in the primary  development contract would be applied since the program was canceled  through a series of partial contract terminations, and they thought costs  for each partial termination were unlikely to reach the limit in the STC  clause.

Though cancellations of major programs to date have been  relatively rare, a single one may represent a multibillion dollar proposition  that can have far-reaching effects on DOD, the industrial base, and even  local economies. DAU has developed guidance that addresses the  spectrum of issues faced in a cancellation, though current efforts may be  insufficient to ensure that program managers who are faced with a  program cancellation will be aware of this guidance. Without this  awareness, program officials may lack the knowledge necessary to  manage the shutdown process and leverage related investments as  effectively as possible. Furthermore, without the continued input of  lessons learned from past cancellations, DOD will miss opportunities to  continue to build and share knowledge regarding program shutdown.  Leveraging investments in canceled programs is complicated because  there is no DOD process to track all program assets or disseminate  information about assets available for reuse. DOD uses a process that  provides visibility over specific tools, materials, and equipment that  support a program being canceled, but it has little visibility over perhaps  more valuable, but less tangible, assets such as software or partially  developed technology, as our case studies demonstrated. Leveraging  these investments is further complicated by the fact that the technologies  may be unique and expensive to continue to develop, thereby limiting the  pool of organizations that want partially developed technologies,  specialized hardware or other property.

This could be  done, for example, through acquisition decision memorandums.  (2) Direct program officials to provide lessons learned, if applicable,  related to program cancellation and shut down to DAU to enhance its  Smart Shutdown toolkit.

Thus, we continue to  believe that direction to program officials to refer to the Smart Shutdown  toolkit would be a more effective mechanism to ensure that  management\u2019s goals for the shutdown would be achieved. As noted in  this report, officials from most of our case study programs told us that  without department-wide guidance, they learned about cancellation and  shutdown by working with personnel who had been through cancellations  before. However, several of the experts in this area from the case study  programs have retired or soon will be eligible to do so.
