In addition to outreach, which all six agencies conduct, SBA's primary activities include counseling and training, provided mainly through nonfederal partner entities called Small Business Development Centers, and export financing, provided through SBA's Office of International Trade (OIT).", "While SBA collaborates to some extent with other key agencies on its export promotion activities, additional collaboration could enhance agency efforts and reduce overlap. SBA, Department of Commerce (Commerce), and the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) coordinate some export promotion activities at headquarters and at field locations, but some services overlap. For example, Small Business Development Centers and Commerce both assist companies new to exporting as well as more experienced exporters, despite intentions to divide responsibilities for those types of firms. Additionally, OIT and Ex-Im offer similar financial products for small businesses, such as export working capital loan guarantees. Overlapping services may cause confusion for small businesses and result in inefficient use of government resources. SBA and other agencies developed a joint strategy to increase small business exports and, to varying degrees, the agencies have included collaborative efforts in the performance evaluations of staff with export promotion responsibilities. However, SBA and other agencies have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and efforts to leverage resources have not included regularly sharing client information where possible. Such sharing could help agencies improve client services and clarify each agency's impact in promoting U.S. exports. Enhancing collaboration could help agencies ensure they are working toward the goal of increasing exports by small businesses in a way that maximizes limited resources and mitigates overlap.", "SBA has made some progress in increasing export training of Small Business Development Center counselors but has experienced challenges in meeting increased OIT staffing requirements under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The law required a certain number or percentage of staff working for the 63 Small Business Development Center networks to obtain export counseling certification. As of the end of September 2012, 73 percent of the networks had met this requirement, for which SBA set a 2013 deadline. To meet another requirement under the law, SBA needed to increase its OIT field staff, who primarily provide export financing assistance, from 18 to 30 staff, by the end of September 2012. However, SBA has only advertised for four temporary positions and filled two of them. SBA officials noted challenges in finding qualified candidates and lack of continued funding for additional OIT field positions. In a recent report to Congress, SBA stated its plans to hire the additional OIT staff but did not include funding plans or updated time frames to fill the positions. Furthermore, the plan did not discuss how SBA would overcome the hiring challenges or discuss the potential to leverage resources of other export promotion entities that also provide export assistance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SBA (1) consult with Commerce and Ex-Im and clearly define export entities' roles and responsibilities; (2) consult with Commerce and Ex-Im and identify ways to increase, where possible, sharing of client information; and (3) update its plan for meeting mandated staffing requirements to include funding sources and time frames, as well as possible efficiencies from improved collaboration.

While exporting is fundamentally a  decision driven by firms in the private sector, the federal government  provides various types of assistance to U.S. exporters, especially small  businesses, to help them overcome the challenges to selling their goods  and services abroad, including a lack of information about exporting and  foreign markets and difficulties in obtaining export financing.", "Many federal agencies are involved in export promotion.

Through the  Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (SBJA), Congress directed SBA to  enhance its field presence by increasing the number and improving the  training of its field staff, including staff at its nationwide network of over  900 Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), SBA partner entities  that also provide export assistance to small businesses. SBA\u2019s Office of  International Trade (OIT) leads SBA\u2019s efforts in cooperating with other  federal agencies and public- and private-sector groups to encourage  small business exports and to assist small businesses seeking to export.

The Export Enhancement Act requires this  committee to issue an annual report to Congress containing a  government-wide strategic plan for federal trade promotion efforts and  describing the plan\u2019s implementation. As a result, the TPCC\u2019s National  Export Strategy, which articulates U.S. plans to increase exports, is  generally issued annually. The President also created the Export  Promotion Cabinet and directed it to develop and coordinate the  implementation of the NEI, working with the existing TPCC. The Export  Promotion Cabinet delivered a September 2010 report to the President  with recommendations to implement the goals of the NEI.

For example, TPCC data showed that SBA received about $4  million for export promotion activities in fiscal year 2006 and $5.2 million  in fiscal year 2010 and requested $6 million and $6.4 million, respectively,  for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. While the fiscal year 2012 request  represents an increase of 60 percent from its fiscal year 2006 funding  levels, SBA\u2019s funding represents less than 1 percent of the total export  promotion funding for the six key agencies that support small business  exporting. According to the TPCC, the six key U.S. agencies requested  over $1 billion for trade promotion activities in fiscal year 2012, and SBA  requested $6.4 million, as shown in table 2.", "TPCC member agencies may define trade promotion differently. For  example, State\u2019s budget includes funding for all State business and  economic activities because, according to State, those activities could  contribute to enhancing U.S. trade. Conversely, the budget amount for  SBA only includes funding for OIT even though other SBA entities, such  as the SBDCs, may devote substantial amounts of time to export  promotion. Therefore, the reported budget amounts may not always  reflect each agency\u2019s total level of activity relating to export promotion or  each agency\u2019s actual contribution toward increasing U.S. exports.  Furthermore, the export promotion amounts in table 2 do not differentiate  activities directed toward small businesses from those directed to larger  businesses.

Ex-Im officials also noted that  Ex-Im charges significantly higher fees for Global Credit Express than  SBA does for Export Express to ensure the programs do not compete.  Additionally, SBA officials noted that there are substantial differences in  the duration of each loan, with the Export Express program offering either  a revolving line of credit with a maturity of up to 7 years or a term loan  with a maturity of up to 25 years, while Global Credit Express has a  maturity of up to 1 year.", "Overlapping services can be confusing for small businesses and may  result in an inefficient use of government resources.

According to  SBA, SBDC, Commerce, and Ex-Im officials, small businesses typically  do not know which services each agency provides or where to go for  assistance. Private sector representatives agreed it is challenging for  small businesses seeking export assistance to determine which federal  entity would best serve their needs. They noted, for example, that export  financing assistance is very important for small businesses to be  competitive in international markets, but it can be difficult to understand  the differences between federal loan programs for financing exports.

Joint performance measures include the number of small  business exporters assisted by U.S. government finance programs, the  value of exports supported by counseling, and the value of exports  supported by financing assistance. The Strategy also discusses  progress with regard to NEI priorities, including exports by small  businesses and other areas such as trade access. While the Strategy  does not identify areas of overlap in export promotion services across  agencies, it distinguishes the different types of expertise and assistance  needed by small businesses that have never exported (new-to-export)  compared with those that have exporting experience and are expanding  into new markets (new-to-market). The Strategy also notes efforts by SBA  to track data on new-to-export companies and a Commerce initiative to  target new-to-market companies.

Both plans are generally  consistent with the NEI goal.", "While the Strategy was created at the headquarters level, much of its  implementation takes place in the field. The NEI created an overarching  goal for the different trade agencies and guides the Strategy, but agency  officials at the headquarters and field levels differed in their views about  the NEI\u2019s impact on collaboration. SBA and other agency officials at the  headquarters level noted improvements in collaboration as result of the  NEI, such as interagency communication and coordination of events,  which are discussed in the Strategy. However, SBA staff and other  agency staff we interviewed in some field locations noted that while the  NEI has increased public awareness of federal export assistance  activities, it has had limited effect on the extent to which the agencies  collaborate. In its report that reviewed coordination among USEACs and  federal and nonfederal partners with respect to NEI priorities, the  Commerce Office of the Inspector General similarly noted that Commerce  actions to implement the NEI have had a limited effect on the extent and  quality of collaboration with such partners.", "SBA and other agencies have taken steps to implement the best practice  of including collaborative efforts in performance evaluations of export  assistance staff; however, the export promotion assistance entities vary in  how they include collaboration efforts in their performance standards and  measures. For example, OIT performance standards include staff\u2019s  participation in activities and events in conjunction with other export  agencies. OIT officials also noted that beginning in fiscal year 2013, they  will track the number of export credit insurance referrals made by OIT  staff to Ex-Im staff. SBDCs\u2019 performance measures focus on the clients  and jobs for which SBDC staff provide assistance, but officials told us that  SBA is beginning to track SBDCs\u2019 collaborative efforts with other  agencies. While Commerce staff\u2019s performance evaluations note services  provided by partner agencies, Commerce field staff told us that generally  the key incentive for Commerce staff is to conduct services that help  facilitate an export sale. Ex-Im\u2019s performance metrics encourage  collaboration because they allow for staff to count financial referrals to  other agencies toward their own performance goals. An Ex-Im official  noted that if an Ex-Im employee determines that an SBA financial product  is more appropriate for a client and the referral results in a completed  transaction, the Ex-Im staff may choose to count the sale of the SBA  product toward individual performance goals. The NEI states that  agencies should use such incentives to encourage employees to direct  companies to the best option for financing even if the company is sent to  another agency.", "SBA and other agencies have not developed guidance on roles and  responsibilities to address overlapping counseling and financing  functions. To implement this best practice in collaboration more  effectively, SBA and other agencies providing similar export assistance to  small businesses could clarify which export agency will serve certain  export functions or types of clients. Officials of SBA and the other  agencies have not formalized a process for determining how to direct  clients with differing needs and levels of exporting experience to the most  appropriate agency.", "First, SBA and Commerce have not clearly defined each agency\u2019s role in  counseling small business exporters. SBDC and Commerce officials we  spoke with indicated that they try to limit overlap by focusing on the areas  where each entity has relatively more experience. Headquarters SBA and  Commerce staff stated that SBDC counselors are expected to work with  new-to-export companies while Commerce trade specialists should focus  on new-to-market companies. According to Commerce officials,  Commerce prefers to work with new-to-market businesses or businesses  looking to export more in a market where they already export because  those businesses can quickly take advantage of Commerce\u2019s extensive  services and overseas resources. Commerce field staff are supposed to  refer new-to-export businesses to SBDCs, where these businesses may  benefit from an array of general business development services.  According to Commerce officials, when Commerce staff focus on new-to- market businesses and send new-to-export businesses to SBDCs, the  result is a more efficient use of Commerce resources than if Commerce  staff were to focus on counseling new-to-export businesses.", "While some SBA and Commerce officials explained the division of  responsibilities for assisting new-to-export versus new-to-market  businesses, we found that the division of responsibilities between the  SBDCs and Commerce is not clearly defined in practice. Moreover, the  agencies have not developed guidance that outlines a common  understanding about where clients should be directed based on their  export readiness. SBDC and Commerce field staff indicated that  interagency roles and responsibilities for counseling new-to-export and  new-to-market companies are unclear. SBDC and Commerce staff at all  six field locations we visited said that they counsel both new-to-export  and new-to-market businesses, and that both agencies at their location  may provide the same type of counseling. For example, sometimes both  SBDCs and Commerce specialists at some locations provide market  research for clients.", "SBDC and Commerce staff in some locations also noted that they may  counsel the same client, but they do not regularly discuss with one  another what services they provide to clients, nor do they regularly share  client information. Some Commerce field staff also said that they had little  interaction with their SBDC counterparts. Additionally, some Commerce  field staff said that they continue to work with new-to-export clients that  could help them meet their individual performance targets for export  successes. SBA and Commerce officials informed us that they had not  developed formal agency or interagency guidance that directed SBDC  counselors and Commerce staff to primarily counsel one type of client.", "Second, SBA and Ex-Im have similar roles and responsibilities for similar  financial products for small businesses. According to SBA and Ex-Im, the  overlap in their financial products results from both agencies\u2019 efforts to  respond to lender preferences. Ex-Im officials said that many lenders  prefer to work with only one agency and very few lenders use both  agencies\u2019 products, so clients may only be able to access one agency\u2019s  products through their regular bank. SBA designates Preferred Lenders  for its Export Working Capital loan guarantee with authority to process  these loans without prior SBA review, and the SBJA has a provision that  makes lenders participating in Ex-Im\u2019s similar Delegated Authority  Program eligible to participate in SBA\u2019s Preferred Lenders program.  However, both SBA and Ex-Im field staff noted that lenders primarily  prefer to work with only SBA or Ex-Im, due to the time and expertise  needed to learn each agency\u2019s complex requirements and to process  each agency\u2019s products. If a potential export financing client only meets  the eligibility requirements for one agency\u2019s product and the client\u2019s  lender does not work with that agency, the client would need to find a new  lender to receive the agency\u2019s loan guarantee. SBA and Ex-Im may be  able to explore options to better align export financing products and to  assist lenders in more easily adapting to the rules for both SBA and Ex-Im  products.", "Third, the roles and responsibilities of SBA\u2019s 68 District Offices and their  relationship to other export promotion entities have also been unclear and  are in transition. The Strategy envisioned that District International Trade  Officers would lead Export Outreach Teams that would coordinate  activities with Commerce at the local level. SBA officials noted that this  had not happened because these district officers are still learning their  responsibilities in assisting exporters, and their role is still evolving.  Furthermore, some Commerce staff expressed uncertainty about the  roles and responsibilities of the designated District International Trade  Officers and had little or no interaction with them. We found the level of  export promotion activities carried out by SBA district offices varied  widely. For example, one District International Trade Officer with  substantial personal experience with export-related issues was heavily  involved in a wide variety of activities, including organizing events and  providing one-on-one counseling to businesses interested in exporting. In  contrast, other District International Trade Officers said that they had little  or no experience with exporting and that their export-related activities are  limited to serving as a point of contact within the district office and  referring businesses to the appropriate federal entity.", "While SBA and other agencies take some steps to leverage interagency  resources both in headquarters and in the field, they do not regularly  share client information, where possible, which may result in less effective  client services. One best practice in collaboration emphasizes that  agencies should leverage resources\u2014such as human, information  technology, physical, and financial resources\u2014to support the common  outcome established by the agencies\u2019 joint strategy.", "At the headquarters level, we found several instances showing that SBA  and other agencies have taken steps to effectively leverage one another\u2019s  export-promotion resources, as the following examples illustrate:", "OIT chairs the TPCC\u2019s Small Business Working Group, which  coordinates interagency cooperation on small business export  promotion as part of the NEI. Agencies discuss coordination of small  business exporting issues through this working group, including the  issue of streamlining initial client intake across agencies to help  agencies provide more targeted assistance to companies.", "Agencies have also produced interagency outreach materials on  federal export financing services through this working group. For  example, the working group distributed a brochure on export financing  and foreign investment finance programs available through SBA, Ex- Im, and USTDA.", "SBA and Commerce staff in headquarters coordinate client intake  through the Export.gov website and are working to enhance the site to  help companies obtain more targeted assistance from agencies.", "Currently, registrants of Export.gov self-identify their export readiness; a  Commerce staff downloads registrants\u2019 information from Export.gov and  sends the information from new-to-export companies to OIT in SBA  headquarters and directs new-to-market companies to Export.gov  resources. Commerce and SBA officials told us they are working together  to develop a new version of Export.gov, expected to be completed by  January 2013, that is intended to improve upon the current design to  better direct registrants to the appropriate export promotion entity and  nearest geographical locations. These officials told us that the new  version of Export.gov will ask the registrant a series of questions to  determine the company\u2019s extent of business development and export  readiness, and direct the company to the agencies or entities that could  best assist it.", "At the field level, SBA and other agencies leverage resources by  conducting joint outreach and training events. At all six locations we  visited, SBA and other agencies invite one another to various events,  including trade shows, road shows, and training events that inform small  businesses about available federal services. For example, in one location,  staff told us that at trade show events, SBA, SBDCs, Commerce, and Ex- Im may conduct joint seminars, where Commerce staff could discuss  marketing and sales, while SBA and Ex-Im staff discuss financing. In  another location, Ex-Im staff said they may include partners such as  SBDCs in road shows they conduct.", "Although we found that SBA and other agencies leverage interagency  resources to some extent both in headquarters and in the field, we also  found that SBA and other agencies could better leverage resources by  sharing client information more consistently. In 2010, the Export  Promotion Cabinet recommended strengthening interagency information  sharing and coordination to implement the NEI. The extent to which SBA  and other agencies share exporters\u2019 information on a regular basis varies.  Commerce and Ex-Im have an informal agreement to share nonbusiness  confidential client information on a quarterly basis. Commerce shares the  name and contact information for clients that have purchased certain  Commerce products, such as a Gold Key Service, and successfully  exported. Ex-Im shares a list of new export credit insurance clients with  Commerce but does not include client contact information. By contrast,  SBDC counselors generally cannot share specific client information with  other entities unless they receive permission from the client, and OIT  does not regularly share its client list with SBDCs, Commerce, or Ex-Im,  nor does it regularly receive client lists from other entities. OIT officials  noted that currently, OIT field staff may share information about clients  with other agencies informally, such as by engaging in joint client phone  calls with other agencies\u2019 staff at the USEACs. Agency officials noted that  information sharing is limited by certain privacy restrictions. SBA and  other agencies\u2019 officials told us they are currently reviewing the types of  information that they could share with each other.", "Some SBA, SBDC, Commerce, and Ex-Im staff in the locations we visited  told us that obtaining access to agencies\u2019 client information would be  beneficial. For example, such access could help increase their own  clientele base and potentially provide small businesses with assistance in  their area of expertise, as well as track the status of clients in the export  life cycle. Commerce staff in headquarters and the field also noted that  access to OIT client lists could improve Commerce\u2019s ability to report  export successes, thereby helping Commerce track their impact in  helping increase small business exports."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Made Some Progress in Increasing Export Training but Experienced Challenges in Meeting Staffing Requirements under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010", "paragraphs": ["The SBJA expanded SBA\u2019s presence in providing export assistance to  small businesses, by requiring an increase in the export training of SBDC  staff and an increase in the number of OIT field staff.

The certification  program would encompass staff at any of the over 900 SBDCs that  provide services to small businesses. According to SBA, this  interpretation of the certification requirement helps ensure that all of the  63 SBDC networks have a minimum number of qualified counseling and  training staff available to provide export and trade assistance to their  small business clients.

In an attempt to meet the SBJA requirement of  increasing its OIT field staff levels from 18 to 22 at USEACs by the end of  2011, SBA advertised 4 temporary positions in 4 specific locations but  filled only 2 positions by June 2011 using SBJA funding that expired on  September 30, 2012. The 4 locations were based on SBA\u2019s analysis of  locations that lacked OIT staff since 2003 and had exporters with the  greatest needs. With the expiration of the SBJA funding, SBA stopped  advertising the remaining 2 positions left unfilled. Although SBA needed  to increase its field presence to 30 OIT staff by September 27, 2012, SBA  had not hired any more than the 2 additional OIT staff and had a total of  19 OIT staff in USEACs. Furthermore, despite the SBJA\u2019s requirement  for 3 OIT staff to be placed in each of SBA\u2019s regions, there are currently  only 2 out of 10 SBA regions with 3 or more OIT staff, while the other 8  regions do not have the required staff levels. See figure 1 for a map of the  current number of SBA OIT staff by SBA region.", "According to SBA officials, SBA encountered hiring challenges that  hindered it from filling the four temporary, 13-month term positions it  advertised. The main difficulties were that the positions offered were not  permanent positions and required specialized trade finance expertise,  which contributed to a shortage of qualified candidates. SBA officials said  that there were no qualified applicants for the OIT position in one location  and few interested and qualified candidates in the other locations.  Applicants for the temporary OIT positions that SBA advertised were  required to have 1 year of specialized experience to minimally qualify for  the position. SBA also considered qualifications such as knowledge of  SBA\u2019s trade finance programs; knowledge of advanced concepts,  principles, and practices of international trade; and the ability to  underwrite export trade finance transactions.", "Citing difficulties with finding qualified staff for the four advertised OIT  positions, and not having continued funding to hire more staff, SBA never  advertised for the additional eight OIT positions it would have had to fill, in  addition to the original four, to meet the SBJA field staffing requirement.  SBA officials noted that they still have the goal to hire additional OIT staff,  and said they intend to implement the requirement to hire up to 30 OIT  staff after fiscal year 2012, if SBA has sufficient funds available for that  purpose. With the expiration of SBJA funding at the end of September  2012, SBA officials told us that they no longer have the funding to hire  additional OIT staff. SBA received $26.5 million in SBJA funds to  implement SBJA requirements, according to SBA officials. Since OIT  positions required by the SBJA were not filled, SBA used the funds to  meet other SBJA requirements, such as hiring staff in offices other than  OIT and, within OIT, hiring an Assistant Administrator and preparing  export-related reports, both as required by the SBJA.", "SBA developed a plan to increase its OIT staff levels to 30 staff and  proposed\u2014in a report submitted to Congress in September 2012\u2014to  place the staff in specific USEACs. This proposed allocation of staff does  not match the one specified in the SBJA requirement. While the SBJA  required 3 OIT field staff in each of SBA\u2019s 10 regions, SBA\u2019s proposal for  staff allocation was a minimum of 2 staff in some SBA regions and 5 staff  in 1 region. SBA explained that its staffing allocation proposal reflected  optimal distribution to support exporters\u2019 needs based on available full- year trade data from U.S. Census and Commerce.

Some OIT staff told us that they  are currently covering OIT work for a large geographic area. With the  current OIT staff levels and locations, these staff have been meeting the  needs of small businesses within their office\u2019s jurisdiction but outside the  metropolitan areas where they are based. They said they can do this by  traveling to attend outreach events and by relying on referrals from staff  of other export promotion entities with offices in various locations outside  the OIT-served metropolitan areas. These other entities include  Commerce, SBDC, or financial institutions that serve as lenders of SBA  export loans. In light of the array of services provided by existing export  assistance entities, SBA may be able to leverage other entities\u2019 resources  in fine-tuning its plan for hiring additional OIT field staff to meet the SBJA  requirements, provided that SBA and other agencies clarify their roles  and responsibilities and begin to exchange information on a regular basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s increased responsibilities in the realm of export promotion have  thrust it into an already crowded field of federal agencies providing small  businesses with assistance. The challenges SBA now faces in limiting the  extent to which its export promotion efforts overlap with those of other  agencies highlight the need for SBA and other key export promotion  agencies to further their collaboration efforts. SBA and the other agencies  have collaborated on export promotion activities to some extent by  developing strategies, conducting joint outreach events, and sharing  some client information among agencies, but many challenges to  effective collaboration remain. In particular, some of SBA\u2019s OIT and  SBDC activities overlap with those of Ex-Im and Commerce, respectively.", "Without clear definition of each entity\u2019s roles and responsibilities, the  overlapping export financing products offered by SBA and Ex-Im and the  labor-intensive export counseling sessions provided by SBDCs and  Commerce may cause confusion for small businesses and could result in  duplication of efforts and inefficient use of government resources.  Additionally, SBA and other federal agencies do not regularly or  comprehensively share client information, which is a significant  impediment to achieving effective interagency collaboration in providing  export promotion assistance to small businesses. While some entities\u2019  staff told us that they are limited in their ability to share client information,  additional information sharing, where possible, would help improve client  services and help agencies better track their impact in promoting U.S.  exports.", "SBA has had mixed results in meeting SBJA requirements expanding its  export promotion presence. On the positive side, SBA is well on its way to  ensuring that a sufficient number of SBDC staff are better trained and  prepared to assist small business exporters. On the negative side,  however, SBA has fallen short of meeting the law\u2019s specific requirements  for increasing and placing OIT field staff, citing funding and hiring  challenges. The most recent SBA report to Congress reiterates the  agency\u2019s intention to hire all the additional OIT staff required by the SBJA.  However, SBA\u2019s plan does not clearly identify the funding sources or time  frames for hiring the additional staff, nor does it explain how it will address  the hiring challenges it experienced previously.

The communiqu\u00e9, which we included in appendix II,  was intended to clarify roles and responsibilities and provide guidance on  referring U.S. businesses seeking export assistance to federal, state, and  nonfederal resources according to each firm\u2019s export readiness and  business needs. We mentioned the communiqu\u00e9 in our report and noted  that it did not include referral protocols for clients requiring trade financing  products, which the communiqu\u00e9 said would be issued by the end of  January 2013. The communiqu\u00e9 also notes that agencies intend to  develop local Export Outreach Teams, to increase awareness of local  international trade expertise and enhance communication and  collaboration at the local level. Among other things, the Export Outreach  Teams would develop referral protocols and initiate ongoing discussions  of shared clients. Thus, the communiqu\u00e9\u2019s plans, when fully implemented,  would begin to address two findings in this report: the need to clarify roles  and responsibilities among SBA, Commerce, and Ex-Im and the need to  identify ways to increase sharing of client information deemed useful for  SBA, Commerce, and Ex-Im. Regarding our recommendation to increase  sharing of client information where possible, SBA acknowledged its  continued work with other agencies to integrate knowledge management  within current legislative restrictions on information sharing, and noted its  optimism about the potential for information technology to facilitate  greater information sharing. SBA also noted that the SBDC program\u2019s  authorizing legislation prevents SBDCs from sharing specific client  information outside of their network without prior written consent from the  client, except under limited purposes.
