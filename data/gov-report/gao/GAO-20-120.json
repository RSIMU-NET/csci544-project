National trends show both peaking between 2010 and 2014 and then declining. GAO's analysis shows counties with the highest rates of both were concentrated in the Southeast (see figure). After accounting for economic, demographic, and other factors, GAO found that counties with higher rates of opioid prescriptions tended to have higher rates of DI claims from 2010 through 2017. These rates were also correlated with other factors. For example, counties with higher rates of each tended to have higher poverty rates. However, GAO was unable to determine whether there is a causal relationship between rates of opioid prescriptions and DI claims or other factors, given readily available data.", "Program staff are required to evaluate and document substance use disorders (including opioids not taken as prescribed) when making certain DI eligibility decisions. Specifically, staff are required to evaluate potential substance use disorders for certain DI claims and deny benefits, for example, if the claimant would not be considered disabled if they stopped using drugs or alcohol. In addition, staff are generally required to document the rationale for their decision so that another reviewer can understand how they made the decision. However, staff in five of the six offices GAO visited in three states were confused about when to evaluate substance use disorders, and nine of 15 case files that GAO reviewed in which an evaluation was conducted did not have a documented rationale. SSA officials acknowledged the need to clarify policies on when to evaluate substance use disorders, and that a poorly documented rationale could lead to reversals or remands of decisions.

Physicians and other treatment providers may prescribe opioids to treat  conditions such as chronic pain. However, opioid misuse can lead to  addiction, disability, overdose, and death. Studies have shown that  prescription opioids played a role in the emergence of the opioid epidemic  in the 1990s, in part, because of the overprescribing of opioids, such as  oxycodone and hydrocodone. The number of overdose deaths from all  opioids has grown by nearly 2.5 times over the last decade, from about  19,600 deaths in 2008 to 47,600 in 2017.", "Prior reports by GAO and by the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have discussed the  use of prescription opioids within federally funded programs, particularly  Medicare. For example, GAO reported on the need for additional  oversight of Medicare to reduce beneficiaries\u2019 risk of harm from  prescription opioid use. The HHS OIG also reported that Medicare Part  D paid for about $3.4 billion in prescription opioids in 2017, and nearly  one in three (14.1 million) Medicare Part D beneficiaries received at least  one prescription opioid that year. Of those beneficiaries, nearly 460,000  received high amounts of prescription opioids, and over 71,000 were at  serious risk of misuse or overdose. However, less is known about the  use of these opioids by individuals receiving benefits from the Social  Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Disability Insurance (DI) program. DI  generally provides benefits to individuals who can no longer work due to  qualifying impairments. Many individuals may apply for DI benefits  because of pain-related conditions, and may be taking prescription  opioids because of these conditions.", "You asked us to identify any correlation between prescription opioids and  rates of DI claims, and any related challenges for SSA in making DI  eligibility decisions.

Specifically,  we reviewed existing studies on the relationship between prescription  opioids and DI claims, as well as available data from SSA. In addition, we  analyzed county-level data on the rates of opioid prescriptions from CDC  and number of DI claims from SSA from 2006 through 2017, the most  recent year of data available at the time of our review. We used  aggregate data to illustrate nationwide trends over time. We also  examined variation among counties and conducted multiple regression  analyses to examine the relationship between opioid prescriptions and DI  claims, taking into account economic, demographic, and other factors.", "To examine how SSA considers prescription opioid misuse in its DI  eligibility decisions, we reviewed relevant information, interviewed  program staff, and reviewed DI case files. We reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and SSA policies as well as federal standards for  internal control. We also interviewed SSA headquarters officials and staff  involved in DI eligibility decisions in six offices in Alabama, Kentucky, and  West Virginia. We selected these three states primarily because of their  high rates of opioid prescriptions and drug overdose deaths and because  a relatively high percentage of their adult population received DI benefits.  In addition, we selected and reviewed 30 case files for DI beneficiaries  who had been identified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) as being at risk for prescription opioid misuse or abuse. We  selected the case files to review based on whether the beneficiary had  been evaluated by SSA for an identified substance use disorder, among  other factors. The case files we reviewed may not have contained any  evidence of prescription opioid misuse or abuse because of the  timeframes we used to select them. Specifically, we selected case files  for DI beneficiaries who had been allowed in or after 2013, but who were  identified as being at risk of prescription opioid misuse or abuse in 2017.  Because these beneficiaries may have been allowed as early as 2013,  they may not have had any issues with prescription opioid misuse or  abuse at the time SSA evaluated their claim (i.e., they may have  developed potential issues after being allowed benefits).

DI generally pays benefits to  individuals if they are unable to work due to qualifying impairments that  are expected to last at least 1 year or result in death. In fiscal year 2018,  SSA paid DI benefits to more than 10 million beneficiaries each month for  a total of about $144 billion that year. In addition to monthly financial  benefits, which averaged about $1,234 per disabled worker in 2018,  those eligible for DI also gain access to Medicare after a 2-year waiting  period, which can help pay for their medical costs, including prescription  opioids.", "Disabled workers claiming DI benefits must meet work and other  requirements to be considered eligible for DI. First, they must have  worked for a specified amount of time covered by Social Security as well  as worked within a specified timeframe before becoming disabled, based  on their age. If these work requirements are met, SSA will assess a  number of medical and vocational requirements, including whether the  claimant earned more than a set monthly amount, the severity of any  impairments they have, and whether they are able to continue working in  a similar or other capacity given their age, education, and prior work  history (see fig. 1).", "DI claimants may also apply concurrently for SSA\u2019s Supplemental  Security Income (SSI) program, which provides income to individuals who  are aged, blind, or disabled with limited income and resources.

Under  SSI, they may receive additional financial benefits as well as access to  Medicaid.", "Several different program staff are involved in processing DI claims. First,  staff in SSA field offices receive applications and determine whether  claimants meet nonmedical eligibility requirements, such as having a  sufficient work history. Claims for those who meet these requirements are  then forwarded to state government Disability Determination Services  (DDS) offices, where DDS staff review the claimant\u2019s eligibility based on  the medical and vocational requirements outlined in figure 1 above.  Specifically, DDS examiners assemble any medical and vocational  information for the claim. This can involve contacting a claimant\u2019s  treatment providers, and third parties such as family members, friends,  and employers, and referring the claimant for consultative exams, such as  with physicians or psychologists if recent treatment records are  unavailable. DDS examiners then confer with DDS medical consultants,  such as in-house or contracted physicians and psychologists, to  determine whether the claimant meets the law\u2019s requirements for having  a disability. DDS examiners use all of this information to decide whether  claimants are eligible for DI.", "Claimants who are dissatisfied with the initial DDS decision have several  opportunities to appeal. First, they generally may request a  \u201creconsideration\u201d of the claim, which is conducted by a DDS examiner  who was not involved in the original decision. Next, they may request a  hearing before an SSA administrative law judge, who may collect new  evidence and ask other witnesses, such as medical and vocational  experts, to testify at the hearing. If their claim is denied at this hearings  level, claimants may request that it be reviewed by the Appeals Council,  which is comprised of SSA administrative appeals judges and appeals  officers.

Researchers for this study noted that additional data and  analysis are needed to refine the results. A second study in 2018 did not  identify a direct relationship between opioid misuse and disability, but  found that they may have an indirect relationship because of other factors  such as having poor health, which may lead to unemployment due to  disability. Other studies have examined the relationship between  prescription opioids and employment, but not DI claims specifically. One  such study noted that, based on available data, it is difficult to separate  the effects of prescription opioid use and disability on employment  outcomes. The study noted further that disentangling the relationship  between prescription opioid use and disability is an area in need of  additional work.", "In addition to funding research, SSA collects some administrative data on  substance use among DI claimants, including use of prescription opioids.  However, these data have limitations for analyzing prescription opioid  use. Specifically, SSA collects administrative data on the medications  claimants report using when filing their claim, which may include  prescription opioids. However, these data may be incomplete because  claimants may not report all substances they use. Further, researchers  working on a study funded by SSA said analyzing these data is  challenging because many claimants manually enter the names of their  medications into an optional free-text field on their electronic applications  rather than selecting from a dropdown menu, and that these entries often  include misspellings or alternative names. SSA also collects  administrative data on whether its staff evaluated a substance use  disorder while processing a DI claim. However, SSA headquarters  officials told us that staff are not required to record this information in the  administrative data unless substance use disorders are the basis for a  denial. Further, these data only indicate whether a substance use  disorder involved alcohol or other drugs.

To illustrate, program staff described an example, under SSA\u2019s  policies, in which they would deny a claimant with a mental health  condition, such as depression, who also has a substance use disorder. In  particular, if staff determined that substance use was affecting the  claimant\u2019s depression, and their mental health would improve to the point  of non-disability in the absence of drugs or alcohol, SSA would deny the  claim.

Specifically, they said staff may be confused about  the policies for determining what is considered a medically  determinable impairment for substance use disorders. Officials said  there must be evidence of substance use that is consistent with the  general definition of a substance use disorder as defined in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. They said staff  may mistakenly interpret this requirement to mean that they need an  official diagnosis to conduct a DAA evaluation. In fact, SSA\u2019s  operations manual for determining DI eligibility may also cause  confusion. Though officials told us that SSA\u2019s policies do not require  an official diagnosis, the operations manual states that staff should  only conduct a DAA evaluation when \u201can acceptable medical source  establishes that a claimant is diagnosed with a substance use  disorder.\u201d SSA headquarters officials acknowledged that confusion  about when to conduct a DAA evaluation could result in evaluations  not being done when they should be, as well as claims being  evaluated for substance use disorders unnecessarily when they do  not meet the standards for being a medically determinable  impairment.", "Documenting the rationale for why substance use disorders did  not affect the claimant\u2019s impairment. SSA\u2019s policies for the DAA  evaluation process generally require staff to document sufficient  information about their evaluations so that a subsequent reviewer can  understand the rationale for the decision, which is in keeping with  federal standards for internal control. These policies also indicate  that a single statement documenting that \u201cDAA is not material\u201d to the  claimant\u2019s impairments is not sufficient, and that documentation  should be included in the determination and decision, or in other  appropriate documents for DDS staff. In the 15 case files in which  SSA had conducted a DAA evaluation, nine did not include a  documented rationale. For example, in one case file we reviewed, a  DDS examiner initially denied a claim for mental health issues after  determining that these issues would not be disabling in the absence of  the claimant\u2019s substance use disorders, which involved  benzodiazepines. An administrative law judge at the hearings level  later allowed the claim, but did not document a rationale for why the  claimant\u2019s substance use disorders did not affect the claimant\u2019s  impairments.", "SSA headquarters officials agreed that a documented rationale was  inappropriately missing in four of the nine case files mentioned above,  although they did not indicate why the documentation was missing.  For the remaining case files, while they agreed that there was no  documented rationale, they asserted that neither a DAA evaluation  nor a documented rationale was required. For example, for four of  these five case files, officials stated that the substance use disorder  was not established as a medically determinable impairment, that the  claimant\u2019s impairments were disabling by themselves regardless of  whether there was any history of substance use disorders, and that  the impairments were irreversible or could not improve to the point of  non-disability. Nonetheless, a DAA evaluation was conducted in these  case files, underscoring staff\u2019s confusion about when an evaluation is  necessary. Furthermore, regardless of whether a documented  rationale was required in these case files, such documentation, if  included, would ensure the rationale for the decision is clear to a  subsequent reviewer, a recommended practice in federal internal  control standards.", "SSA headquarters officials acknowledged that a poorly documented  rationale could lead to reversals or remands if staff conducting  appeals or quality reviews are unable to understand the decision. This  could result in increased processing time for those conducting  appeals and quality reviews, as well as for staff who may be required  to revisit their decision. For example, in one case file we reviewed, an  administrative law judge allowed a claim for mental health issues that  had previously been denied at the initial level as a result of the  claimant\u2019s substance use disorders involving prescription opioids,  alcohol, and marijuana. The case file was later randomly selected for  quality review by the Appeals Council, which remanded the case back  to the administrative law judge due, in part, to the lack of documented  rationale regarding the claimant\u2019s substance use disorders. As a  result of the remand, the administrative law judge held a new hearing  and issued a new decision that still allowed the claim, but provided a  rationale for the DAA decision.", "SSA headquarters officials told us about efforts that could help ensure  staff understand and follow policies for the DAA evaluation process. For  example, they discussed training on DAA evaluation and documentation  requirements. For DDS examiners, they said this training includes  presentation slides and videos on these topics. Similarly, for new  administrative law judges and other hearings-level staff, they said  mandatory trainings include a module on the DAA policies. While SSA  headquarters officials said they generally do not offer additional training  beyond this, they noted that DDS examiners and administrative law  judges are able to revisit the training materials and receive more local,  ongoing training and resource materials as needed.", "We found examples of local, ongoing training and resource materials on  the DAA evaluation process during our interviews in our three selected  states. For example, one DDS office we visited had developed a DAA  flowchart for its internal website, as well as a question and answer section  derived from existing SSA information. Another DDS office had developed  its own guidance specifically on documentation requirements for DAA  evaluations. DDS managers and examiners in this office said they had  sought clarification from the SSA office overseeing their region in  developing the guidance, which was used during a local training for  disability examiners in January 2019.", "In addition to training and guidance, SSA headquarters officials told us  that compliance with policies for the DAA evaluation process is examined  as part of the agency\u2019s larger quality review processes. These processes  are designed to ensure that cases are decided accurately. They include  national and local reviews of randomly selected decisions at the initial  level, as well as national reviews at the hearings level. Identified errors  are reported back to the respective offices for correction. However, these  reviews do not target claims involving substance use disorders. SSA  headquarters officials said the agency does not track how often they  review such claims at the initial level. DDS managers in the three  selected states who are involved in local quality reviews also told us that  such claims are not targeted for review.", "Despite SSA\u2019s efforts to train staff on the DAA requirements, provide  guidance, and conduct quality reviews that may cover DAA evaluations,  we found that confusion about implementing the policies remains and  staff are not always documenting the rationale for their evaluations as  required.

To select  case files, we used a dataset from CMS on Medicare Part D beneficiaries  that we matched with SSA data on DI beneficiaries. The CMS dataset  contained information on Medicare Part D beneficiaries who CMS  identified as being at risk of prescription opioid misuse or abuse in 2017.  CMS identifies beneficiaries as being at risk of prescription opioid misuse  or abuse if they received high amounts of opioids (had an average daily  morphine dose equivalent of 90 mg or more) and appeared to have  coordination of care issues (either had three or more opioid prescribers  and three or more opioid dispensing pharmacies, or five or more  prescribers regardless of the number of pharmacies) during a 6-month  period. We identified DI beneficiaries within this larger dataset of  Medicare Part D beneficiaries using an identifier in CMS\u2019s data. This  identifier signified that DI eligibility was a beneficiary\u2019s reason for  Medicare enrollment, since those eligible for DI may gain access to  Medicare after a 2-year waiting period. We then worked with SSA to  match these data on DI beneficiaries within CMS\u2019s dataset with SSA data.  Specifically, we obtained information for analysis from SSA\u2019s database on  various demographic characteristics of this population of DI beneficiaries,  including their sex, age, race, and impairments.

See appendix III for additional demographic and  other information on this population.", "From the DI beneficiaries we identified, we selected 30 case files to  review based on a number of claims characteristics related to potential  prescription opioid misuse and SSA\u2019s processing of the claim. First, we  only selected case files for individuals who had been allowed benefits  during or after 2013, when SSA formalized its policies for evaluating  substance use disorders, including prescription opioids. In addition, we  randomly selected 15 case files where the beneficiary had been  evaluated by SSA for an identified substance use disorder and 15 where  they had not. As part of the selection of 30 case files, we also randomly  selected 16 case files where the beneficiary had self-reported the use of a  prescription opioid and 14 where they had not, and 14 case files where  the beneficiary had their case reviewed for potential medical improvement  (called a continuing disability review) and 16 where they had not (these  characteristics were not mutually exclusive).", "To systematically collect information on how or whether SSA considered  potential prescription opioid misuse in each case file, we developed a  data collection instrument to conduct our review of them. We designed  the instrument to examine SSA\u2019s implementation of its process for making  DI eligibility decisions for claims involving substance use disorders,  including opioids not taken as prescribed. For example, the instrument  included questions about how SSA identifies and evaluates such  disorders when making decisions, any documentation of this process, and  how SSA reviews case files for potential medical improvement after  allowing benefits. The instrument was not intended to examine the  accuracy of decisions. In addition, we shared the instrument with SSA  officials in advance, who provided notes on where the needed information  could be found in the case files. Two GAO analysts independently  reviewed each case file using the instrument, then met to review coding  decisions and reconcile any differences between their reviews. We also  discussed the results of our review with SSA headquarters officials.  These officials provided comments on our observations for each case file,  which we took into consideration.", "Though we examined information on all of the case file characteristics  described above, we ultimately focused on SSA\u2019s implementation of its  process for evaluating the beneficiary for an identified substance use  disorder. We did not focus on SSA\u2019s implementation of its process for  examining whether the beneficiary had self-reported the use of a  prescription opioid. This is because the use of opioids as prescribed is not  considered a substance use disorder under SSA\u2019s policies. In addition,  we learned during our case file review that beneficiaries had multiple  opportunities to self-report such use that would not be captured in SSA\u2019s  administrative data, and that program staff also had multiple opportunities  to examine such use when collecting and reviewing medical evidence. In  addition, we did not focus on SSA\u2019s implementation of its process for  reviewing the beneficiary for potential medical improvement because we  learned during our case file review that substance use disorders seldom  factor into SSA decisions about whether to continue or cease DI benefits.  According to SSA, benefits typically continue unless evidence exists that  a beneficiaries\u2019 impairment has medically improved and that they are able  to return to work. SSA headquarters officials told us that staff would not  evaluate a substance use disorder during the continuing disability review  unless the beneficiary has medically improved and a new impairment that  may be affected by a substance use disorder is to be assessed.", "Several limitations exist with our review of case files. Because we  selected from a population of DI beneficiaries, the sample did not include  case files for claimants who were ultimately denied. However, we did not  see this as a significant limitation because SSA\u2019s policies regarding the  DAA evaluation are the same regardless of whether a claim is ultimately  allowed or denied. In addition, 16 of the 30 case files we reviewed had  been denied at the initial level before being allowed on appeal at later  adjudicative levels. In addition, the case files may not have contained any  evidence of prescription opioid misuse or abuse because of the  timeframes we used to select them. Specifically, we selected case files  for DI beneficiaries who had been allowed during or after 2013, but who  were identified as being at risk of prescription opioid misuse or abuse in  2017. Because these beneficiaries may have been allowed benefits as  early as 2013, they may not have had any issues with prescription opioids  at the time SSA evaluated their claim (i.e., they may have developed  potential issues after being allowed benefits). Lastly, because we  reviewed a non-probability sample of 30 case files, the results of our  review cannot be generalized to the larger population of DI beneficiaries.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2018 to January 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While we could have  potentially used an instrumental variable approach to establish a causal  relationship, we did not identify an appropriate instrument to conduct that  analysis. Moreover, individual-level data on opioid use among DI  claimants were not readily available.

In sensitivity  analyses, we did include county fixed effects in our models and found that  there was not a statistically significant relationship between rates of opioid  prescriptions and DI claims with these effects included.
