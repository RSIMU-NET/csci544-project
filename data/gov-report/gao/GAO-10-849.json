In fiscal year 2009, FIS conducted over 2 million investigations of varying types, making the organization a major steward of personal information on U.S. citizens. GAO was asked to (1) describe how OPM uses personally identifiable information (PII) in conducting background investigations and (2) assess the extent to which OPM's privacy policies and procedures for protecting PII related to investigations meet statutory requirements and align with widely accepted privacy practices. To address these objectives, GAO compared OPM and FIS policies and procedures with key privacy laws and widely accepted practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FIS, a component of OPM, conducts background investigations using extensive amounts of PII. Specifically, FIS collects PII from the individual being investigated, government agencies holding relevant data on the subject, and contacts familiar with the subject of the investigation. It uses this information during the four phases of the investigation process: (1) Questionnaire Submission, when requesting agencies submit a questionnaire completed by the individual who will be investigated; (2) Scheduling and Initiation, during which goals and milestones are set, automated information requests occur, and an investigator is assigned; (3) Investigation, during which an investigator gathers information from the automated requests and from interviews and prepares a report; and (4) Review, during which a reviewer determines if a report is complete before allowing it to be sent to the requesting agency. FIS has taken steps to incorporate key privacy laws and widely accepted privacy practices into policies and procedures for conducting background investigations. For example, field investigators are directed to limit collection of PII to only information relevant to an investigation, and several procedures are in place to ensure that such information is recorded as accurately as possible in OPM's systems. However, the agency has conducted limited oversight of FIS's development of privacy impact assessments (PIA), investigators' implementation of privacy protection guidance, and customer agencies' adherence to privacy agreements. A PIA is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system. It is required by the E-Government Act of 2002. Related Office of Management and Budget guidance emphasizes the need to identify and assess privacy risks in concert with developing a PIA. However, OPM's guidance for PIAs does not require that privacy risks be analyzed or mitigation strategies be identified for those risks. Consequently, OPM cannot be sure that potential risks associated with the use of PII in its information systems have been adequately assessed and mitigated. Additionally, widely accepted privacy practices call for accountability to ensure privacy-protection policies are implemented to safeguard personal information from potential risks. Such accountability includes monitoring to ensure proper implementation of privacy protection measures. However, although FIS tracks PII that is provided to and received from field investigators, it had not monitored investigators' adherence to its policies and procedures for protecting PII while investigations are underway. Further, while FIS has developed agreements with customer agencies related to the protection of PII contained in investigation case files, it does not monitor customer agencies' implementation of these policies, even though its agreements state it is responsible for doing so. Without oversight processes for monitoring investigators' and customer agencies' adherence to its PII protection policies, OPM lacks assurance that its privacy protection measures are being properly implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Director of OPM (1) develop guidance for analyzing and mitigating privacy risks in privacy impact assessments, and (2) develop and implement oversight mechanisms for ensuring that investigators properly protect PII and that customer agencies adhere to agreed-upon privacy protection measures.

Should FIS  receive a paper questionnaire, the information is manually entered into  PIPS. 3.  Once a questionnaire is received at FIPC, a physical case file is created  that contains the questionnaire, a summary sheet, and any  documentation provided as a supplement to the questionnaire. 4.

Goals and milestones are established for the initial security clearance  investigation to comply with statutory requirements. Investigation  timelines are based on provisions of the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which required adjudicative  agencies to develop plans to ensure that, to the extent practical,  determinations could be made on at least 90 percent of all applications  for a security clearance within 60 days, with no longer than 40 days  allotted for the investigation and 20 days allotted for the adjudication.  2.  PIPS requests information through a National Agency Check (NAC): a  set of queries sent to national record repositories, such as OPM, the  FBI, and Department of Defense (DOD) investigation databases; and a  fingerprint-based criminal history check through the FBI. Once the  agencies have manually or electronically checked their databases for  the information, the results are returned to FIS headquarters and  stored in PIPS or in the physical case file after being scanned into  PIPS.

FIS agreements with customer agencies limit how  background investigation reports may be used by stating that information  provided by FIS should be used only for the purpose of adjudication.  Additionally, all attempts to access case files within PIPS (e.g., viewing or  editing) are recorded in an automated log file. These logs are reviewed  daily by FIS personnel to identify unauthorized access attempts that  violate agency restrictions on use. This aligns with the principle that the  information should not be disclosed or used for anything other than the  specified purpose.", "Security safeguards. FIS uses a collection of security safeguards to  protect and control access to PII located physically at FIPC. Physical  security controls and processes include (1) screening individuals with  metal detectors and x-ray machines prior to entry to the facility; (2) using  electronically coded cards and badges to grant access to the room  containing hard copies of active case files; (3) checking manifests of case  files mailed to other facilities to ensure that the contents of the files have  not changed; and (4) ensuring the proper destruction of investigative  materials with locked disposal bins and supervised shredding by a FIS  official. FIS officials also reported that a number of information security  measures are used to protect personal information maintained in FIS  systems.  For example, FIS policy requires that access to PIPS is to be  limited to officials who are authorized by their respective agencies\u2019  security offices and have appropriate background investigations. The  system is also to restrict agency user access to information from cases  they have been specifically authorized to review. Furthermore, officials  stated that annual security assessments are conducted on all FIS systems  to ensure that they are compliant with governmentwide information  security control standards, including National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 and Federal Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2.

Such  oversight would align with the accountability principle, which states that  individuals controlling the collection or use of PII should be accountable  for ensuring the implementation of the Fair Information Practices.

Officials  from the agency\u2019s oversight groups responsible for federal and contract  investigators said they used other methods for determining investigators\u2019  adherence to PII protection requirements. For example, officials stated the  investigators are required to report to their supervisors daily on the case  information or other PII they have with them during the course of their  work. This is to account for the information they have on hand if there is a  loss or the investigator becomes incapacitated due to an accident or  medical emergency. The tallies provided by the investigators are intended  to allow their supervisors to account for all such information. In addition,  officials from FIS oversight units recently began conducting physical  audits of regional field offices to determine compliance with PII  requirements.", "Although these recent efforts may increase assurance that investigators  are adequately accounting for the investigative files in their possession, no  process currently exists to monitor investigators\u2019 compliance with FIS  privacy protection policies as they perform their field work.
