Their mission is to enhance the availability of mortgage credit across the nation during both good and bad economic times by purchasing mortgages from lenders (banks, thrifts, and mortgage bankers) that use the proceeds to make additional mortgage loans to home buyers. The enterprises issue debt to finance some of the mortgage assets they retain in their portfolios. Most mortgages purchased by the enterprises are conventional mortgages, which have no federal insurance or guarantees. Enterprise purchases are subject to a conforming loan limitthat currently stands at $300,700 for a single-unit home.", "The debt and mortgage assets in the enterprises\u2019 portfolios are on-balance sheet obligations (liabilities) and assets, respectively. A majority of the mortgages, however, are placed in mortgage pools to support mortgage- backed securities (MBS) that may be sold to investors or repurchased by the enterprises and held in their portfolios. MBS are conduits for collecting principal and interest payments from mortgages in the mortgage pools and passing payments onto MBS investors. The enterprises charge fees for guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest on MBS held by investors. MBS held by investors other than the enterprises are off- balance sheet obligations of the enterprises.", "The federal government\u2019s creation of and continued relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have created the perception in financial markets that the government will not allow the enterprises to default on their debt and MBS obligations, although no such legal requirement exists. As a result, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can borrow money in the capital markets at lower interest rates than comparably creditworthy private corporations that do not enjoy federal sponsorship. At least a portion of the financial benefits that accrue to the enterprises have been passed along to homeowners in the form of lower mortgage interest rates.", "During the 1980s, the government did provide limited regulatory and financial relief to Fannie Mae when the enterprise was experiencing significant financial difficulties; and in 1987, Congress authorized $4 billion to bail out the Farm Credit System, another GSE. Recognizing the potentially large costs that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to taxpayers, Congress passed the act, which established OFHEO as an independent regulator within HUD\u2014tasked with ensuring the enterprises\u2019 safety and soundness. OFHEO\u2019s director has broad independent authority to ensure that OFHEO fulfills its safety and soundness mission. For example, the director has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement actions regarding the safety and soundness of the enterprises without the review and approval of the Secretary of HUD.", "The act requires OFHEO to carry out its oversight function both by establishing and enforcing minimum capital standards (including the risk- based capital standard) and by conducting annual on-site safety and soundness examinations of the enterprises to assess their operations and financial condition. The act established the broad outlines of a stress test and mandated that OFHEO develop its stress test within those parameters to serve as the basis for the risk-based capital standards. The act requires the stress test to simulate situations that expose the enterprises to extremely adverse credit and interest rate scenarios over a 10-year period and to calculate the cash flows and the amount of capital the enterprises would need to continue to operate for the entire period. The stress test model must include upward and downward interest rate movements of up to 6 percentage points and assume a high level of credit risk (based on the worst cumulative credit loss for not less than 2 consecutive years in contiguous states encompassing at least 5 percent of the U.S. population). As required in the act, the stress test model that the agency developed estimates credit and interest rate risks, among other factors, and includes an additional 30 percent of that amount for management and operations risk. Also as required, it does not include new business assumptions. The act set a December 1, 1994, deadline for completion of the stress test and risk-based capital standards.", "HUD is the mission regulator of the enterprises.

Declining rates may also lower the enterprises\u2019 funding costs. In contrast, rising market interest rates create higher interest expenses for the enterprises as debt turns over. Prolonged periods of rising interest rates typically lead to a slowdown in prepayments and refinancing activity, because interest rates on new mortgages are higher than those on most of the previously originated mortgages. If funding costs rise and existing on- balance sheet mortgages at old, lower interest rates remain on the books, prolonged periods of losses and capital erosion can occur. Enterprise management can use callable debt and other financial instruments or strategies to mitigate interest rate risk and other potential losses. However, such managerial decisions will tend to lower future expected profits.", "OFHEO\u2019s current stress test, which assumes no new business over a 10- year period, simulates the impact of interest rate movements and economic conditions on the behavior of borrowers whose mortgages are held by the enterprises and therefore affect the enterprises\u2019 cash flows. The model requires that the mortgage holdings wind down over the 10- year period. The extent to which existing business winds down shows the importance of new business, because in practice the enterprises would be acquiring new mortgages to replace lost mortgages during the period.", "In the stress test model, the remaining mortgage balance (and existing business) depends on scheduled payments of principal, other prepayments, and defaults. Prepayments are sensitive to interest rate changes because lower rates accelerate prepayments and higher rates depress them. Default losses are sensitive to economic conditions, including loan-to-value ratios and seasoning, because loans with lower loan-to-value ratios and seasoned loans are less likely to default.", "OFHEO ran its model for us for a portfolio of newly originated 30-year fixed-rate single-family mortgages with 95 percent loan-to-value ratios. About 4.7 percent of a portfolio of newly originated loans would still be on the enterprises\u2019 books after 10 years in the declining interest rate environment mandated by the act. In the increasing rate environment mandated by the act, about 57.3 percent of a portfolio of newly originated loans would still be on the enterprises\u2019 books after 10 years. OFHEO also ran the model on other portfolios with different loan-to-value ratios and degrees of seasoning, with similar results in both the declining and increasing rate environments.

The simulations showed that, for a portfolio of newly originated single-family mortgages with a 95 percent loan-to-value ratio, defaults would account for a decline of about 19.5 percent of the original mortgage balances in the decreasing rate environment and a decline of about 16.2 percent of the original mortgage balances in the increasing rate environment.", "The enterprises could limit credit risk in several ways. For example, they could use more stringent underwriting standards, although such standards could limit the dollar volume of mortgages they are able to purchase and possibly affect their ability to support the residential mortgage market. For instance, requiring homeowners to make large down payments or purchase private mortgage insurance could make acquiring a mortgage more difficult for potential homeowners. Second, they could more aggressively monitor loans and work out problems with troubled loans. Third, the enterprises could mitigate the economic costs of defaults by raising the management guarantee fee they charge mortgage pools for providing credit insurance and managing the pools.

Generally speaking, risk and profit are positively related. For example, an enterprise can increase its expected profits by taking more risks, but taking greater risks can increase the possibility that the enterprise will not survive a stressful economic period due to losses incurred. An enterprise can increase its chances of surviving a stressful period by increasing its capital level, but such increases raise funding costs and reduce future expected profits.

Borrowers\u2019 behavior related to mortgage prepayment and default can be and is predicted in the stress test, based on statistical techniques that are applied to historic data. Although this prediction is subject to statistical measurement errors, these techniques can be used to extrapolate borrower behavior in a stressful environment. However, because managerial behavior is idiosyncratic, such techniques cannot be used to extrapolate managerial behavior in a stressful environment from behavior in more normal economic environments. For instance, overall management strategies dealing with both interest rate and credit risks could either exacerbate risk exposures or mitigate such risks to various degrees. OFHEO would lack criteria, both statistical and theoretical, to justify assumptions about these strategies. Therefore, OFHEO would have to speculate about managerial behavior to develop new business assumptions. In addition, because a significant proportion of the enterprises\u2019 mortgages either prepay or default over a 10-year period and are replaced by new business, the assumptions about new business could easily dominate the cash and capital flows in the stress test over the 10- year period.

HUD\u2019s analyses showed that incorporating new business resulted in higher capital requirements for the enterprises. HUD made two major assumptions that affected the result. First, HUD assumed that the enterprises would have difficulty determining exactly when a downturn would begin and projecting its length and severity. This assumption limited management\u2019s ability to mitigate risk.

Market discipline works best when firms fully and publicly disclose their financial conditions. Customers and creditors can then use the information to determine further interactions with the enterprises. In October 2000, the enterprises adopted six voluntary commitments aimed at increasing their disclosures. The commitments included, among other things, the issuance of subordinated debt and public disclosure of financial information. Enterprise officials stated that these commitments would improve transparency and market discipline because market participants could use the added information to better assess the financial condition of the enterprises. We acknowledge that financial disclosure as mandated by the voluntary accord may improve transparency. However, its impact on the enterprises and their customers or funding parties is limited if the enterprises are perceived to have implicit government backing. That is, other economic parties may believe that the federal government will ensure that the enterprises continue to operate and to perform satisfactorily on financial contracts such as loans and mortgage purchases. For this reason, while market discipline can play a role in curbing risky behavior by the enterprises, it also has its limitations. Supervisory review thus takes on more importance as a means for limiting inappropriate risk- taking behavior by the enterprises.", "The proposed revision of the Basle Accord recognizes the supervisory review process as one of three \u201cpillars\u201d that contribute to safety and soundness in the financial system. OFHEO\u2019s supervisory review includes examining the operations of the enterprises and taking the supervisory and enforcement actions necessary to ensure that the enterprises are operating safely and soundly. In conjunction with other elements of supervision, supervisory review can also help ensure that the enterprises maintain sufficient capital to support the risks they undertake. Further, it can encourage the enterprises to develop and use better risk-management techniques to address the risks associated with both existing and new business. Supervisory review can focus on internal approaches to capital allocation and internal assessments that reflect management\u2019s own expectations about future business opportunities and risks without the need for OFHEO to impose its own assumptions about new business.", "In addition, supervisory review allows OFHEO to address the enterprises\u2019 management structure and business approaches to ensure that risk- management techniques and internal controls are appropriate and are protecting the public interest. Risk-management practices that sufficiently limit the credit and interest rate risks associated with new business and adequate OFHEO supervision of those practices can reduce the chances that an enterprise will take on risky new business that could jeopardize its capital adequacy in a stressful economic environment. For example, adequate supervision could inhibit an enterprise\u2019s attempt to \u201cgrow\u201d its way out of a problem situation in a stressful environment by means such as lowering underwriting standards or relaxing risk-management controls that address interest rate risk. While adequate supervision is not guaranteed by the presence of OFHEO and its legal authorities, inclusion of speculative new business assumptions in the stress test\u2014based on plausible managerial behavior\u2014would not reduce the importance of adequate supervision.", "OFHEO has several legal authorities that help in carrying out supervisory responsibilities relating to safety and soundness. These authorities include informal supervisory actions; formal enforcement actions involving notice to the affected enterprise; hearing opportunities; and, if warranted, imposition of sanctions such as cease and desist orders or civil monetary penalties. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 mandates actions, known as prompt corrective actions (PCA), that depository institution regulators must take in response to specific capitalization levels. Similarly, the 1992 act contains PCA provisions that authorize and, depending on the level of undercapitalization, require OFHEO to take certain actions when an enterprise is undercapitalized.These mandates, which specify actions to be taken at certain levels of undercapitalization, limit the possibility that OFHEO might be lenient once an enterprise\u2019s capital cushion is impaired. OFHEO has issued regulations implementing the PCA provisions and establishing prompt supervisory responses to be taken based on specified noncapital developments. The director of OFHEO has broad discretion over measures that can be taken beyond these required actions. Such discretionary powers allow the director of OFHEO to respond when specific enterprise practices occur that could pose a safety and soundness concern."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Determining new business assumptions for inclusion in OFHEO\u2019s stress test is inherently speculative, and OFHEO would have to develop plausible scenarios for managerial behavior to make such a determination.

Thus, these assumptions could also determine whether the enterprises met or failed to meet the risk-based capital requirement. Adding new business assumptions would introduce more complexity to an already complex model and interfere with the public policy mandate that requires the model to be understandable and replicable.

In addition, OFHEO can use supervisory review in conjunction with the stress test to help limit the potential risks associated with new business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["OFHEO should not incorporate new business assumptions into its risk- based capital stress test.

Freddie Mac\u2019s written comments, which agreed with our conclusions and recommendation, appear in appendix III. Fannie Mae and OFHEO provided technical comments that were incorporated where appropriate. OFHEO officials also stated that OFHEO does not model or predict enterprise behavior in its current stress test, but does make assumptions to project enterprise behavior in a stylized way, consistent with the stress conditions. For example, they cited assumptions about enterprise new debt issues and operating expenses in the current stress test. Such assumptions, they stated, are necessary for a capital requirement that is appropriately sensitive to risk. The OFHEO officials stated that incorporating new business into the stress test would entail making assumptions that address additional complicated managerial decisions on the full range of enterprise activities. They added that, in contrast to the assumptions that project managerial behavior in the current stress test, the assumptions necessary to incorporate new business have the potential to unduly influence the capital requirement and make it less sensitive to current risks.", "We made revisions based on OFHEO\u2019s comments distinguishing between modeling or predicting enterprise behavior and developing reasonable assumptions for enterprise management. We agree with OFHEO officials that, compared to the current stress test, incorporating new business into the stress test would require assumptions that address additional complicated managerial decisions on the full range of enterprise activities. Our report notes, in particular, that the assumptions required to incorporate new business could dominate the capital requirement.", "We will send copies of this report to the Director of OFHEO, the Chief Executive Officer of Fannie Mae, and the Chief Executive Officer of Freddie Mac.

These purposes include (1) providing ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages allowing for mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families involving lower returns than those earned on other activities and (2) promoting access to mortgage credit throughout the nation, including in central cities, rural areas, and underserved areas. Moreover, the act requires the Secretary to establish annual goals for the enterprises\u2019 purchases of mortgages on low- and moderate-income housing; special affordable housing (housing for low-income families in low-income areas and for very low-income families); and housing in central cities, rural areas and other underserved areas. Based on the regulatory scheme established in the act, the Secretary of HUD could exercise these authorities during a stressful period in a way that might affect an enterprise\u2019s new business. For example, housing goals would require an enterprise to conduct new business. Forecasting these goals and the potential for other mission- related requirements and their impact on new business would be speculative.", "The charter for each enterprise states that the purpose of the enterprise is to provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages; to respond appropriately to the private capital market; to provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages (including activities relating to mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families, involving a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other activities) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing; and to promote access to mortgage credit throughout the nation (including central cities, rural areas, and underserved areas) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing.", "The numeric goals provisions of the 1992 act require the Secretary to consider the following factors in setting final housing goals for each of the three categories of housing: (1) national housing needs; (2) economic, housing, and demographic conditions; (3) the performance and effort of the enterprises in achieving the goals in previous years; (4) the size of the conventional mortgage market serving targeted borrowers relative to the size of the overall conventional mortgage market; (5) the ability of the enterprises to lead the industry in making mortgage credit available to targeted borrowers; and (6) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the enterprises.", "Although the last factor requires consideration of an enterprise\u2019s financial condition, nothing in the 1992 act suggests that the Secretary should refrain from establishing goals or taking other mission-related actions in the event of a stressful financial condition. However, we believe that the Secretary would not exercise mission and housing goal authorities in a way that would continue or increase an enterprise\u2019s financial stress, because doing so would undermine the financial safety and soundness requirements of the 1992 act and compromise the enterprise\u2019s ability to achieve its mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The Business of the Enterprises", "paragraphs": ["As table 2 shows, most of the enterprises\u2019 on-balance sheet assets are mortgages.
