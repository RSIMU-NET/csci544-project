In 2008, the U.S. President and other G20 leaders held their first summit in Washington, D.C., in part to establish a framework to help prevent financial crises. The G20 leaders established principles for financial regulatory reform and agreed on a series of financial reforms, which they have revised or expanded at subsequent summits. To implement their reforms, the G20 leaders generally have called on their national authorities\u2014finance ministries, central banks, and regulators\u2014and international bodies, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and standard setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In 2009, the G20 leaders established FSB to coordinate and promote implementation of the financial reforms, which typically involves standard setting bodies developing international standards (e.g., principles, policies, or guidance) and then jurisdictions voluntarily adopting rules or policies consistent with these standards, such as through legislation or regulations. As members of FSB and international standard setting bodies, U.S. federal authorities have actively helped formulate the standards that implement the G20 reforms and cover, among other things, banking, derivatives, and hedge funds.", "The United States and other jurisdictions have made progress implementing many of the G20 financial reform commitments, but most reforms have not been fully implemented by all jurisdictions. FSB and standard setting bodies collaboratively monitor and report on the implementation status of the G20 reforms. According to recent progress reports, the United States, like most FSB members, has implemented or is implementing G20 reforms that FSB designated as a priority based on their importance to global financial stability\u2014including higher capital standards, derivatives reforms, compensation practices, policy measures for systemically important financial institutions, and regimes for resolving failing financial institutions. However, implementation varies among jurisdictions. For example, according to a September 2013 progress report, only the United States reported having rules at least partly in effect to implement the G20 reforms requiring derivatives to be centrally cleared, traded on organized trading platforms, and reported to trade repositories, while many other jurisdictions reported having rules in effect for only some of these reforms or adopted or proposed legislation to implement the reforms. To promote and monitor the adoption of the international standards by each jurisdiction, such as to ensure a level playing field, FSB, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Basel Committee have established programs to review and assess their members' implementation of the standards. At the same time, legal, economic, and political factors can create implementation challenges for jurisdictions. For example, regulators in different jurisdictions may apply or interpret the standards differently. However, in some cases, inconsistent implementation of international financial standards could lead to certain activities migrating to less regulated jurisdictions (regulatory arbitrage) or adversely affect financial stability."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Cross-border interconnections in the financial markets and other factors  helped spread disruptions in the global financial system during the 2007- 2009 financial crisis and increased systemic risk at the national and  international levels.

Most importantly, such inconsistencies could  hinder or weaken the ability of national authorities or international bodies  to protect against developments affecting national and international  financial stability and help prevent or mitigate future financial crises.  Moreover, a regulator stated that inconsistent implementation could lead  to an unlevel playing field for financial institutions or regulatory arbitrage.  For example, financial markets or services could migrate to less-regulated  or unregulated jurisdictions. It also could impose a variety of avoidable  costs on financial institutions with negative consequences for customers,  investors, and national and global economies. For example, financial  institutions operating in multiple jurisdictions could be subject to  conflicting or duplicative rules and, thus, higher compliance costs.", "Some academics and industry associations also have noted that  complete global consistency across all financial regulations is not  necessarily possible or preferable. Two academics suggest that if  jurisdictions face significant limitations in their ability to reach agreement,  harmonization efforts might lead to agreement on only weak global  standards. An academic we interviewed said that harmonized  regulations across all jurisdictions may provide a level playing field but  could be problematic, in part by not providing jurisdictions with the  flexibility to respond to their differences. He also said that standardizing  regulations could cause financial institutions to behave in the same way  and unintentionally concentrate risk (e.g., holding the same types of  assets). Similarly, an industry association noted that international  consistency does not require uniformity but an appropriate level of  similarity, comparability, and predictability of regulatory outcomes across  jurisdictions. According to the association, international consistency also  means striking a balance between consistency and the need for sensible  local differences and supervisory discretion. In light of the potential for  inconsistent implementation in areas that may result in unnecessary  negative consequences, the review programs operated by FSB, IMF, and  international standard-setting bodies likely will play an important role in  addressing this issue. Indeed, some academics and industry associations  view FSB\u2019s peer reviews as an important mechanism for monitoring and  encouraging compliance with international financial standards. Moreover,  one academic suggests that the reviews may help deepen commitment to  the standards by domestic officials by holding member jurisdictions  accountable not only to an international body but also to each other.  However, some express concern about the potential effectiveness of FSB  peer reviews, in part because any of their recommendations, like the  international financial standards, are not binding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CFTC, FDIC, FSB, the Federal  Reserve, IMF, OCC, SEC, and Treasury, for their review and comment.  All of the agencies except for the Federal Reserve provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated, as appropriate. Treasury and  SEC provided written comments that we have reprinted in appendixes V  and VI, respectively.", "In commenting on our draft report, Treasury noted that the G20, FSB, and  international standard-setting bodies have been cooperating since the  financial crisis on advancing the international financial reform agenda and  strengthening the global financial system. Treasury further noted that the  United States has played a leadership role in designing and implementing  this agenda. Finally, Treasury agreed with the report that international  reform efforts are not complete. Treasury noted that it would continue to  work with other regulators to forge high-quality, compatible rules,  encouraging reforms in other jurisdictions as strong as those in the United  States, and would continue to promote greater consistency and  convergence.", "SEC noted that it welcomed GAO's review of the international reform  efforts and valued GAO\u2019s perspective in this area. SEC stated that the  report correctly notes that international standards are not legally binding  and rely on the decision of national authorities to implement the standards  (reflecting, among other considerations, appropriate respect for national  sovereignty). SEC also noted that it was pleased that the report  acknowledges that while negative consequences can flow from varying  degrees of implementation of international standards, there also can be  good reasons behind such differences, such as avoiding a movement to  less robust standards or the unintentional concentration of risks. SEC  agrees with the report\u2019s discussion that there may be reasons to take into  account variations in national legal and market structures and conditions,  including differences in economic development and enforcement  authority.", "SEC also comments on a number of specific issues in the report. SEC  noted that it does not share the view that international organizations  \u201cimplement\u201d international standards, nor should they have that authority.  Our report summarizes the international financial reform process, drawing  a clear line between the development of international standards under the  auspices of FSB or standard-setting bodies (or both) and the voluntary  adoption of rules or policies consistent with these standards by  jurisdictions, such as through legislation or regulations. SEC also noted  that interconnections permitted disruptions to spread quickly across  borders but was unsure that such interconnections increased systemic  risk as stated in our report. No single definition for systemic risk exists,  but systemic risk has been viewed as the possibility that a single event  could broadly affect the entire financial system, causing widespread  losses rather than just losses at one or a few institutions. As we recently  reported in January 2013, the 2007-2009 financial crisis illustrated the  potential for systemic risk to be generated and propagated outside of the  largest financial firms (such as by money market mutual funds), in part  because of interconnections not only between firms but also between  markets. SEC also noted the particular status of the accounting standard- setting bodies. In particular, both IASB and the Financial Accounting  Standards Board are independent, private-sector organizations. Although  the IASB is an FSB member, the legitimacy of the accounting standards  that these bodies set depends, among other things, on those bodies\u2019  ability to set accounting standards free from political interference. We  have added a clarifying note in figure 4 in appendix II to reflect this  comment. Finally, SEC noted that our report uses the term \u201cshadow  banking\u201d and it is not appropriate to use this term to refer to market-based  financing, which serves a credit intermediation function. Our report  discusses shadow banking, because it is one of the G20 financial reform  commitments\u2014expanding the regulatory perimeter, including  strengthening of the regulation and oversight of shadow banking. Our  report does not define shadow banking but rather uses FSB\u2019s Policy  Framework for Addressing Shadow Banking Risks in Securities Lending  and Repos (see appendix III, table 7) as a reference document.  According to FSB, this policy was intended to help strengthen oversight  and regulation of the shadow banking system. The policy notes that the  \u201cshadow banking system\u201d can broadly be described as \u201ccredit  intermediation involving entities and activities (fully or partially) outside  the regular banking system.\u201d Therefore, the use of the term shadow  banking is appropriate for this report.", "We are sending copies of this report to CFTC, FDIC, the Federal  Reserve, OCC, SEC, and Treasury, interested congressional committees  and members, and others.
