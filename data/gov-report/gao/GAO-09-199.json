It is critical that the military services effectively and efficiently manage DOD's secondary inventory to ensure that the warfighter is supplied with the right items at the right time and to maintain good stewardship over the billions of dollars invested in their inventory. GAO reviewed the Army's management of secondary inventory and determined (1) the extent to which on-hand and on-order secondary inventory reflected the amount needed to support current requirements and (2) causes for the Army having secondary inventory that exceeded current requirements or, conversely, for having inventory deficits. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Army data on secondary inventory (spare parts such as aircraft and tank engines) from fiscal years 2004 through 2007."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the 4-year period GAO examined, the Army had significantly more inventory than was needed to support current requirements. At the same time, the Army had substantial inventory deficits. GAO's analysis of Army data reflected an annual average of about $16.3 billion of secondary inventory for fiscal years 2004 to 2007, of which about $3.6 billion (22 percent) exceeded current requirements. On average, approximately 97 percent of the inventory value exceeding requirements was on hand and the remaining 3 percent was on order. Based on Army demand forecasts, inventory that exceeded current requirements had enough parts on hand for some items to satisfy several years, or even decades, of anticipated supply needs. Also, a large proportion of items that exceeded current requirements had no projected demand. The Army also had an annual average of about $3.5 billion of inventory deficits over this 4-year period. Army inventory did not align with current requirements over this period because of (1) a lack of cost-efficiency metrics and goals and (2) inaccurate demand forecasting. DOD's supply chain management regulation requires the military services to take a number of steps to provide for effective and efficient end-to-end materiel support. For example, the regulation directs the components to size secondary inventory to minimize DOD's investment while providing the inventory needed. Although the Army has supply support performance measures for meeting warfighter needs, it has not established metrics and goals that can measure the cost efficiency of its inventory management practices. Furthermore, the Army's demand forecasts have frequently been inaccurate. The Army uses a computer model to forecast its spare parts requirements, but when demand data are inaccurate or untimely, the result is a misalignment between inventory and current requirements. As a result, the Army has accumulated billions of dollars in excess inventory against current requirements for some items and substantial inventory deficits in other items. Without accurate and timely demand data, managers cannot ensure that their purchasing decisions will result in inventory levels that are sized to minimize DOD's investment needed to support requirements. The Army has acknowledged that challenges exist in its forecasting procedures and has begun to take steps to address shortcomings. In October 2008, the Army issued guidance directing managers to reduce the forecast period from 24 months to 12 months to better account for changes in the size of the force and the resulting changes in demands. The guidance also directs managers to update forecast models to match actual quantities of weapon systems being used in Southwest Asia; previous models were updated based on estimates that were not always timely or accurate. These two changes constitute steps toward improving the accuracy of demand forecasts, but GAO was unable to assess their effectiveness because this guidance was issued as GAO was completing its audit work. Also, the Army's recent designation of the Under Secretary of the Army as its chief management officer responsible for business transformation provides an opportunity for enhanced oversight of inventory management improvement efforts. Strengthening the Army's inventory management--while maintaining high levels of supply availability and meeting warfighter needs--could reduce support costs and free up funds for other needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The military services and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procure and  manage large supplies of spare parts to keep military equipment operating.  With U.S. military forces and their equipment in high demand, it is critical  that the services and DLA effectively and efficiently manage the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) secondary inventory to ensure that the  warfighter is supplied with the right items at the right time. Because the  military services and DLA are competing for available resources at a time  when the nation faces an increasingly constrained fiscal environment, it is  also imperative that they exercise good stewardship over the billions of  dollars invested in their inventory. DOD reported that the total value of its  secondary inventory as of September 30, 2007, was about $82.6 billion.  Since 1990, we have identified DOD inventory management as a high-risk  area due to its ineffective and inefficient inventory management practices  and procedures, and to its excessively high levels of inventory beyond  what is needed to support current requirements. These high levels of  inventory have included both on-hand and on-order inventory. Inventory  that is in DOD\u2019s possession is considered to be on hand. Inventory that is  not in DOD\u2019s possession but for which contracts have been awarded or  funds have been obligated is considered to be on order.", "In response to your request that we review the DOD components\u2019  secondary inventory, this report addresses the management of the Army\u2019s  secondary inventory.

However, we did not  include the Army\u2019s Communication and Electronics Command (CECOM) in  our analysis because the information system used to manage secondary  inventory was not able to provide item-specific data for the period of our  review. We determined the total number of items that had more or less than  enough inventory to satisfy current requirements, and for each of these items  we also determined the number and value of parts that were more or less  than needed to satisfy current requirements. In presenting the value of  inventory in this report, we converted then-year dollars to constant fiscal year  2007 dollars using DOD Operations and Maintenance price deflators. To  determine the primary causes for the Army having inventory that exceeded  current requirements or having inventory deficits, we selected a random  probability sample of inventory items that met these conditions and sent  questionnaires to Army inventory personnel who are responsible for item  management. Because we used a random probability sample, the results of  our analysis can be projected to all Army items that met our selection criteria.  To gain additional understanding about the management of secondary  inventory, we interviewed Army inventory personnel to discuss some items in  more detail. Appendix I provides further information on our scope and  methodology. We conducted this performance audit from February 2008  through January 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

To ensure efficient and  effective supply chain management, the regulation also calls for the use of  metrics to evaluate the performance and cost of supply chain operations.  These metrics should, among other things, monitor the efficient use of  DOD resources and provide a means to assess costs versus benefits of  supply chain operations. However, the regulation does not prescribe  specific cost metrics and goals that the services should or must use to  track and assess the efficiency of their inventory management practices.", "According to Army officials, the Army has processes and controls for  efficiently managing secondary inventory and fulfilling the DOD  regulation. First, Army officials stated that they use a number of metrics to  determine whether the Army provides the inventory needed, including  customer wait time, back orders, stock availability, and the not- mission- capable supply rate, which counts the number of vehicles or aircraft that  cannot perform the Army\u2019s mission due to a lack of parts. Second, the  Army uses a cost differential model to determine the appropriate level of  inventory to maintain in order to achieve a desired performance goal. The  model is based on a number of variables, including procurement costs,  holding costs, frequency of demand, implied stockage cost, and the  probability of future demand. Army officials also stated that cost  minimization is integral in the formulas used to compute requirements.  Third, the Army assesses the effectiveness of inventory by evaluating the  Army Working Capital Fund. Specifically, if sales from the fund to  customers match the values of inventory purchased, then inventory  purchases have been cost effective.", "While these methods may be effective management tools, we found that  the Army has not established metrics and goals for measuring the cost  efficiency of its inventory management.

When the Army invests in the  purchase of inventory items that become excess to its requirements, these  funds are not available to meet other military needs. Taking steps to  reduce the high levels of inventory exceeding requirements could help to  ensure that DOD is meeting supply performance goals at least cost. Among  other things, cost-efficiency metrics and goals that reveal the existence of  inventory excesses and deficits could provide a basis for effective  management and oversight of inventory reduction efforts. Much of the  inventory that exceeded current requirements or had inventory deficits  resulted from inaccurate demand forecasts. To its credit, the Army has  evaluated the unpredictability of demand and has taken steps that it  believes will enhance flexibility in adapting to fluctuations in demand.  Implementation of the plan, evaluation of the results, and continued  monitoring could also assist in addressing this long-standing problem.  Finally, since inventory management is part of the Army\u2019s broader  business operations and transformation, it is reasonable to expect the  newly established chief management officer to exercise some level of  oversight of inventory management improvement efforts taken by the  Army. Strengthening the Army\u2019s inventory management\u2014while  maintaining high levels of supply availability and meeting warfighter  needs\u2014could reduce support costs and free up funds for other needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management of the Army\u2019s secondary inventory, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army  to take the following three actions:    Establish metrics and goals for tracking and assessing the cost  efficiency of inventory management and incorporate these into existing  management and oversight processes.", "Evaluate the effectiveness of changes to demand forecasting procedures  that were set forth in the Army\u2019s October 2008 guidance, including  measuring the impact on reducing inventory that exceeds requirements,  and based on that evaluation, take additional actions as appropriate to  identify and correct systemic weaknesses in forecasting procedures.", "Monitor the effectiveness of providing item managers with operational  information in a timely manner so they can adjust modeled  requirements as necessary.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of the Army direct the Army\u2019s Chief  Management Officer to exercise oversight of Army inventory management  improvements to align improvement efforts with overall business  transformation and to reduce support costs. This oversight role should not  replace or eliminate existing operational oversight responsibilities for  inventory management that are exercised by other Army offices, but  should ensure that the Army maintains a long-term focus for making  systemic improvements where needed and for strategically aligning such  changes with overall transformation efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments on a draft of this report, DOD agreed with three of  our recommendations and disagreed with one recommendation. On the  basis of DOD\u2019s comments, we have modified one of our recommendations.  The department\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Army establish metrics  and goals for tracking and assessing the cost efficiency of inventory  management. However, DOD did not provide information on planned  corrective actions. According to DOD, the Army has already established  inventory metrics and readiness goals which it evaluates during periodic  reviews. DOD also stated that the Army\u2019s primary inventory goals are to  achieve high stock availability and low non-mission-capable supply rates  for its warfighting systems and capabilities, and that the Army has current  inventory metrics that mirror those in commercial inventory management.  While the metrics cited by DOD in its response may be useful tools for  assessing cost efficiency, we could not determine on the basis of our  review that the Army was using these or other metrics to track and assess  cost efficiency and to make management decisions aimed at improving  cost efficiency. DOD, in its written comments, also did not provide  information on how the Army may be using existing metrics to improve  cost efficiency. Therefore, we continue to believe that the Army should  place a greater emphasis on setting cost efficiency goals, measuring  progress, and establishing accountability for cost efficiency through its  existing management and oversight processes.", "DOD concurred with our recommendations that the Army evaluate the  effectiveness of changes to demand forecasting procedures that were set  forth in the Army\u2019s October 2008 guidance and that the Army monitor the  effectiveness of providing item managers with operational information in a  timely manner. According to DOD, the Army will evaluate the  effectiveness of its corrective actions beginning in August 2009, again in  February 2010, and periodically thereafter during quarterly reviews. We  believe this action is responsive to these recommendations.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of the Army  direct the Army\u2019s Chief Management Officer to exercise oversight of Army  inventory management improvements to align improvement efforts with  overall business transformation and to reduce support costs. DOD stated  that inventory oversight is the operational responsibility of the Army\u2019s Life  Cycle Management Commands and appropriately assigned under the  combined oversight of the Army G-4, the Assistant Secretary of the Army,  Financial Management and Comptroller, and the Army Materiel Command.  DOD also stated that the Under Secretary of the Army, as the Chief  Management Officer, at the department-level, synchronizes strategic  systems and processes across the enterprise. We do not dispute the need  to maintain existing oversight responsibilities for Army inventory  management, and we have modified our recommendation to make this  clear. However, we disagree with DOD\u2019s position that the Army\u2019s Chief  Management Officer should not have an oversight role. First, the existing  combined oversight shared by Army staff and the Army Materiel Command  may not be sufficient to ensure long-term change. As we stated previously,  for the 4-year period of our review, the Army\u2019s inventory exceeded current  requirements by $3.6 billion. While we are encouraged that the Army has  taken steps designed to improve inventory management, these steps have  occurred only recently compared to the systemic challenges related to  inventory management that we have reported on since the 1990s. Given  the substantial value of the Army\u2019s inventory, exercising oversight of  inventory management is essential, and assigning additional oversight  responsibility to a department-level official, such as the Chief Management  Officer, could ensure that a continuous focus is maintained. Additionally,  since the Army\u2019s Chief Management Officer operates at the department- level and is responsible for synchronizing strategic systems and processes  across the enterprise, this individual would be uniquely suited to exercise  oversight as part of the Army\u2019s broader business transformation efforts.", "Finally, directing the Army\u2019s Chief Management Officer to exercise  oversight of Army inventory management improvement efforts could make  oversight operations more uniform across the Department of Defense. In  its written response to our review of the Navy\u2019s inventory management,  DOD stated that the Navy is developing a business transformation  implementation strategy to align with Office of the Secretary of Defense  actions in this area, and that the Navy will determine the appropriate role  its Chief Management Officer should exercise in inventory management  oversight.

Our  analysis did not include the Army\u2019s Communication and Electronics  Command (CECOM) because the information system used to manage  secondary inventory was not able to provide item-specific data for the  period of our review. Stratification reports serve as a budget request  preparation tool and a mechanism for matching assets to requirements.  Our analysis was based on analyzing the Army\u2019s item stratifications within  the opening position table of the Central Secondary Item Stratification  Reports. To validate the data in the budget stratification reports, we  generated summary reports using electronic data and verified our totals  against the summary stratification reports obtained from the Army. The  Army secondary inventory data are identified by unique stock numbers for  each spare part, such as an engine for a particular vehicle, which we refer  to as unique items. The Army may have in its inventory multiple quantities  of each unique item, which we refer to as individual parts. We calculated  the value of each unique item by multiplying the quantity of the item\u2019s  individual parts by the item\u2019s unit price, which is the latest acquisition cost  for the item.", "After discussing the results with Army officials, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis and  findings. Upon completion of the data validation process, we revalued the  Army\u2019s secondary inventory items identified in its budget stratification  summary reports because these reports value useable items and items in  need of repair at the same rate, and do not take into account the repair  cost of repairing broken items. We computed the new value for items in  need of repair by subtracting repair costs from the unit price for each item.  We also removed overhead charges from the value of each item. In  presenting the value of inventory in this report, we converted then-year  dollars to constant fiscal year 2007 dollars using Department of Defense  (DOD) Operations and Maintenance price deflators.", "We consider the Army to have inventory exceeding current requirements if  it has more inventory than is needed to satisfy its requirements based on  the opening position table of the Army\u2019s budget stratification report.  Collectively, these requirements are referred to by DOD as the  \u201crequirements objective,\u201d defined as the maximum authorized quantity of  stock for an item. However, if the Army has more inventory on hand or on  order than is needed to satisfy its requirements, it does not consider the  inventory beyond the requirements to be unneeded. Instead, the Army  uses the inventory that is beyond its requirements to satisfy future  demands over a 2-year period, economic retention requirements, and  contingency retention requirements. Only after applying inventory to  satisfy these additional requirements would the Army consider that it has  more inventory than is needed and would consider this inventory for  potential reutilization or disposal. In commenting on our past reports,  DOD and the other services have disagreed with our definition of  inventory that was not needed to satisfy current operating requirements  because it differed from the definition that is used for the inventory budget  process. We do not agree with the Army\u2019s practice of not identifying  inventory used to satisfy these additional requirements as excess because  it overstates the amount of inventory needed to be on hand or on order by  billions of dollars. The Army\u2019s requirements determination process does  not consider these additional requirements when it calculates the amount  of inventory needed to be on hand or on order, which means that if the  Army did not have enough inventory on hand or on order to satisfy these  additional requirements, the requirements determination process would  not result in additional inventory being purchased to satisfy these  requirements. We consider the Army to have inventory deficits if levels of  on-hand and on-order inventory are insufficient to meet the requirements  objective.", "To determine the extent to which the Army\u2019s on-order and on-hand  secondary inventory reflects the amount of inventory needed to support  requirements, we reviewed DOD and Army inventory management  guidance, past GAO products on DOD and Army inventory management  practices for secondary inventory items, and other related documentation.  We also created a database which compared the Army\u2019s current inventory  to its current requirements and computed the amount and value of  secondary inventory exceeding or not meeting current requirements.  Additionally, to understand whether the inventory not needed to support  requirements had improved in relation to its years of supply, we calculated  the number of supply years a given item would have based on its quantity  and demand at the time of stratification in September 2005, September  2006, and September 2007.", "We developed a survey to estimate the frequency of reasons why the Army  maintained items in inventory that were not needed to support  requirements or that did not meet requirements. The survey asked general  questions about the higher assembly (component parts) and/or weapon  systems that the items support, and the date of the last purchase. In  addition, we asked survey respondents to identify the reason(s) for having  inventory that exceeded current requirements or had an inventory deficit.  We provided potential reasons as responses from which they could select  based on reasons identified in some of our prior work. Since the list was  not exhaustive, we provided an open-ended response option to allow other  reasons to be provided. In addition to expert technical review of the  questionnaire by an independent methodologist, we conducted pretests  with Army managers from TACOM and AMCOM prior to sending out the  final survey instrument. We revised the survey instrument accordingly  based on findings from the pretests.", "We sent this questionnaire electronically to specific Army managers in  charge of sampled unique items at two of the Army\u2019s inventory control  point locations in Huntsville, Alabama and Warren, Michigan.

Based on our analysis of  the Army stratification data, for fiscal year 2007, there were 26,535 unique  items with on-hand inventory not needed to meet requirements, and 3,687  unique items with on-order inventory not needed to meet requirements.  These categories identified a combined value of $4.4 billion of inventory  not needed to meet requirements. All of these items met our criteria to be  included in our study population of items not needed to meet  requirements. Additionally, based on our analysis of stratification data, all  of the 14,785 unique items with inventory deficits, valued at $3.4 billion,  met our criteria to be included in our deficit study population.", "We sent 216 electronic questionnaires\u2014one questionnaire for each item in  the sample\u2014to the 131 Army managers identified as being responsible for  these items. Four of the items in our sample were determined to be out of  scope, because three items did not have item managers and had low  quantities and values associated, and one item was randomly selected at  two commands, so the item was removed from one command and left for  the other command with a higher quantity to answer.", "Table 10 divides TACOM and AMCOM\u2019s on-hand excess, on-order excess  and deficit inventory into three substratum, each by the amount of supply  for Fiscal Year 2007.

These are intervals  that would contain the actual population values for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population.", "In addition to sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any  questionnaire may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted,  in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how  the data are entered into a database or were analyzed can introduce  unwanted variability into the questionnaire results. We took steps in the  development of the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data  analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. We reviewed each  questionnaire to identify unusual, incomplete, or inconsistent responses  and followed up with Army item managers by telephone and e-mail to  clarify those responses. In addition, we performed computer analyses to  identify inconsistencies and other indicators of errors and had a second  independent reviewer for the data analysis to further minimize such error.", "To determine reasons for the types of answers given in the questionnaires,  we held 30 face-to-face discussions with Army inventory managers, of  which 14 were in our sample.
