To conduct these studies, GAO reviewed key agency documents and government-wide employment data and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials and managers, as well as subject matter specialists."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Serious human capital shortfalls are undermining the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) ability to provide veterans with quality and timely services. Over the past two decades, GAO has identified major challenges with VA human capital practices. For example, in March 2019, GAO found large staffing shortages, including physicians and registered nurses, at the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) 172 medical centers. In December 2016, GAO found that high attrition, increased workload, and burnout among VHA's human resources (HR) staff, along with ineffective internal controls to support its HR operations, have impeded VHA's ability to serve the nation's veterans (see figure).", "Continued leadership attention to addressing GAO's recommendations could help VA better execute its mission. GAO has made numerous recommendations to VA, 40 of which were designated as priorities because they could significantly improve VA's operations. Twelve of the 40 were aimed at strengthening VA's human capital management efforts. Of these, six have been addressed. However, VA still needs to take additional actions on the other six, such as developing a modern and effective performance management system. Beyond these priority recommendations, VA can use key talent management strategies that GAO has identified for acquiring, incentivizing, and engaging employees and thus be more competitive for a high-performing workforce in a tight labor market.", "Some of the challenges facing VA are part of a larger set of human capital issues affecting government as a whole. Although Congress, the Office of Personnel Management, and individual agencies have made improvements in recent years, human capital management in general remains a high-risk area because of mission-critical skills gaps within the federal workforce. Structural issues impede the ability of agencies to recruit, retain, and develop workers, including outmoded position classification and pay systems, ineffective recruiting and hiring processes, and challenges in dealing with poor performers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has designated 40 of its prior recommendations to VA as priorities for implementation.

VA operates one of the largest health care delivery  systems in the nation and provides billions of dollars per year in benefits  and services to veterans and their families. However, the department and  two of its components, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the  Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), face serious and long-standing  problems with management challenges and problems with veterans'  access to care and disability compensation benefits. In multiple reports,  we have found that mission-critical skills gaps and a lack of effective  strategic human capital management have limited VA\u2019s ability to carry out  its vital mission to serve and honor America\u2019s veterans.", "VA needs a strong workforce to provide quality and timely care to  veterans, but over the past two decades, we and others have expressed  concern about certain VA human capital practices. In February 2015, we  added managing risks and improving veterans\u2019 health care to our list of  federal high-risk areas. Since then, VA has made some progress in  ensuring its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently to  improve veterans\u2019 timely access to health care and to ensure the quality  and safety of that care.", "My remarks today focus on (1) some of the key human capital  management challenges facing VA and its components\u2014especially at its  largest component, VHA\u2014and the impact those challenges are having on  VA\u2019s essential mission; (2) specific recommendations and talent  management strategies we have identified in our prior work that VA can  leverage to recruit and retain a high-performing workforce in a highly  competitive labor market; and (3) how a number of the human capital  challenges that VA is facing are part of a broader set of government-wide  human capital problems that are also jeopardizing the missions of other  federal agencies.", "The bottom line is that both VA-specific human capital and government- wide structural issues are hampering VA from acquiring and retaining the  talent it needs to fill vacancies and serve veterans. VA-specific human  capital issues include such difficulties as recruiting and retaining clinical  and human resources (HR) staff at VHA. Government-wide structural  issues include a federal personnel system that is, in many ways, unable  to meet the requirements of today\u2019s federal work and workforce.", "Nevertheless, VA can take, and in some cases is already taking, a  number of steps to strengthen its human capital management efforts but  more work is needed. VA will need continued leadership attention and  strong congressional oversight. Other steps will be required within VA to  fully implement our open recommendations and mitigate any newly  emerging problems.", "This testimony is based on our recent work on VA issued since 2017, as  well as our work on government-wide strategic human capital  management issued between July 2014 and July 2019. For the VA  studies, among other things, we reviewed key agency documents and  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials and managers in  headquarters as well as in several medical facilities across the country.  For the government-wide human capital work, among other things, we  reviewed government-wide employment data and interviewed officials  from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and subject matter  specialists from think tanks, academia, government employee unions,  and other areas.

As we have long reported, there is a direct link between the  effectiveness of an agency\u2019s personnel management efforts and its ability  to carry out its mission. Addressing challenges in areas such as disaster  response, homeland security, economic stability, and numerous other  complex and evolving issues requires a skilled federal workforce able to  work seamlessly with other agencies, levels of government, and  nongovernmental entities.", "In our March 2019 report, we identified key trends in agency operations  and attitudes toward work that are affecting how federal work is done and,  consequently the skills and competencies that workers will need to  accomplish agency missions. Agencies will need to apply appropriate  talent management strategies that are adapted to these trends to recruit,  develop, and retain a high-performing workforce and better meet their  missions (see fig. 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staffing Challenges at VA Are Systemic, Long-Standing, and Undermining Its Mission", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two decades, we and others have expressed concern about  certain human capital practices at VA and its components. For example,  in November 2018, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General identified leadership  and workforce investment as a major management challenge. The  Inspector General noted that the root cause for many of the issues it  identified at VA was poor and unstable leadership as well as staffing  shortages. Similarly, in May 2019, we reported that leadership turnover  impeded VA\u2019s ability to address a number of management challenges we  identified such as managing acquisitions, managing risk, and improving  veterans\u2019 health care.", "At VHA, we found that serious human capital shortfalls are undermining  its ability to meet the health care needs of veterans. Key examples from  our prior work include the following:  In March 2019, we reported that VHA\u2019s 172 medical centers have  large staffing shortages, including physicians, registered nurses,  physician assistants, psychologists, and physical therapists, as well  as HR specialists and assistants.", "As of December 2018, VA reported an overall vacancy rate of 11  percent at VHA medical facilities, including vacancies of over 24,000  medical and dental positions and around 900 HR positions.", "In July 2016, we found that losses in VHA\u2019s five clinical occupations  with the largest staffing shortages, including physicians, registered  nurses, and psychologists, increased from about 5,900 employees in  fiscal year 2011 to about 7,700 in fiscal year 2015. Voluntary  resignations and retirements were the primary drivers. VHA\u2019s exit  survey indicated that advancement issues or dissatisfaction with  certain aspects of the work, such as concerns about management and  obstacles to getting the work done, were commonly cited as the  primary reasons people left.", "In December 2016, we found that several problems combined to  impede VHA\u2019s ability to improve delivery of health care services to  veterans. These problems include high attrition (often involving  transfers to other federal agencies), increased workload, and burnout  among VHA\u2019s HR staff. Another issue is a lack of effective internal  control practices to support HR operations such as information  systems that meet operational needs (see fig. 2).", "In our preliminary findings in a forthcoming report on the extent to which  succession planning policies and procedures at VA and its components  are consistent with key leading practices, we have identified several  concerns. For example, according to VA officials, the agency has not  produced a department-wide succession plan since 2009 due to  leadership turnover. Department-wide, around 30 percent of VA  employees on board as of September 30, 2017, will become eligible to  retire in the next 5 years.", "Effective succession planning can help VA ensure it has a pipeline of  talent to meet current and future mission requirements. In our prior work,  we noted that effective succession planning is more than filling existing  vacancies with people that have the same occupational skills and  competencies. Rather, succession planning focuses on current and future  needs and develops pools of high-potential staff to meet the  organization\u2019s mission over the long term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Leadership Attention to Implementing Our Prior Recommendations and Other Talent Management Strategies Could Help VA Better Serve Veterans", "paragraphs": ["We have designated 40 of our prior recommendations to VA as priority  recommendations because, upon implementation, they may have an  especially significant impact on VA\u2019s operations. Twelve of these priority  recommendations are aimed at strengthening VA\u2019s human capital  management efforts and will help address VA\u2019s challenges in such areas  as recruiting and retaining doctors and nurses, performance  management, and employee misconduct. To date, VA has implemented  six of these priority recommendations, but needs to take additional action  on the other six. While VA agreed or partially agreed with and is taking  steps to implement five of these remaining priority recommendations, it  disagreed with one related to developing a process to accurately count all  physicians at each VA medical center because it does not believe this  affects its ability to assess workload. Nevertheless, we continue to believe  that VHA needs a systematic process to identify all physicians working at  VA medical centers as part of the agency\u2019s efforts to monitor and assess  workload. The six unimplemented priority recommendations are for VA  to  1.  develop a process to accurately count all physicians providing care at  each VA medical center (recommended in 2017),  2.  develop a modern and effective performance management system in  which VA managers make meaningful distinctions in employees\u2019  performance ratings (recommended in 2016),  3.  ensure that ratings-based performance awards are administered in a  manner that is consistent with leading practices (recommended in  2016),  4.  develop a plan to implement a modern information technology system  to support employee performance management processes  (recommended in 2016),  5.  collect complete and reliable misconduct and associated disciplinary  action data (recommended in 2018), and  6.  ensure that employees who report wrongdoing are treated fairly and  protected against retaliation (recommended in 2018).", "We will continue to monitor VA\u2019s progress in implementing these and our  other open recommendations.", "Beyond these specific recommendations, VA and other agencies can use  talent management strategies to better compete for critical positions in a  tight labor market and to help meet agency missions. In our prior work we  noted that while these strategies are not an exhaustive list, collectively  they suggest basic steps that agencies can take within existing authorities  to address the demographic and technological trends affecting work that  are discussed earlier in this statement. These strategies include:", "Align human capital strategy with current and future mission  requirements. With shifting attitudes toward work, technological  advances, and increased reliance on nonfederal partners, agencies  need to identify the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to  current and future demands. Key practices include identifying and  assessing existing skills, competencies, and skills gaps.", "Acquire and assign talent. To ensure agencies have the talent  capacity to address evolving mission requirements and negative  perceptions of federal work (e.g., that it is too bureaucratic), agencies  can cultivate a diverse talent pipeline, highlight their respective  missions, recruit early in the school year, support rotations, and  assign talent where needed.", "Incentivize and compensate employees. While federal agencies  may struggle to offer competitive pay in certain labor markets, they  can leverage existing incentives that appeal to workers\u2019 desire for  schedules and locations that provide work-life balance.", "Engage employees.

As  we noted in our March 2019 update of government high-risk areas, the  federal government faces long-standing challenges in strategically  managing its workforce. We first added strategic human capital  management to our list of high-risk government programs and operations  in 2001. Although Congress, OPM, and individual agencies have made  improvements since then, strategic human capital management remains  a high-risk area because mission-critical skills gaps within the federal  workforce pose a high risk to the nation. Of the 34 other high-risk areas  on our 2019 High-Risk List, skills gaps played a significant role in 16 of  the areas, including information technology management and  acquisitions, strengthening management functions at the Department of  Homeland Security, and, as noted above, veterans\u2019 health care at VA.", "While causes for these skills gaps related to high-risk areas vary, they  often occur because of a shortfall in talent management activities such as  robust workforce planning or training. Additionally, the changing nature  of federal work and the high percentage of employees eligible for  retirement have the potential to produce gaps in leadership and  institutional knowledge and could threaten to aggravate the problems  created from existing skills gaps. For example, 31.6 percent of permanent  federal employees who were on board as of September 30, 2017 will be  eligible to retire in the next 5 years, with some agencies having  particularly high levels of employees eligible to retire.", "High-performing organizations have found that the full life cycle of human  capital management activities needs to be fully aligned and focused on  the cost-effective achievement of an organization\u2019s mission. These  activities include workforce planning, recruitment, on-boarding,  compensation, engagement, succession planning, and retirement  programs.", "Further, adding to agencies\u2019 staffing challenges is the fact that much has  changed since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Classification  Act of 1949 laid the foundation of much of today\u2019s federal personnel  system. Agencies\u2019 missions have evolved and employees\u2019 expectations  of work and the workplace are changing.
