Those doing the sponsoring are called petitioners; those benefiting from the sponsoring are called beneficiaries. If USCIS approves the petition, overseas beneficiaries must also file a visa application with the Department of State to enter the United States. In January 2002, USCIS started to conduct background security checks on all petitioners in addition to the beneficiaries. These background checks revealed that some of the petitioners had convictions for criminal sex offenses; further, some of those criminal sex offenders were filing family-based petitions for children (those under the age of 21). This report addresses the number of convicted sex offenders who filed family-based petitions in fiscal year 2005 based upon a computer match of USCIS data with individuals in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Sex Offender Registry and discusses USCIS's and the Department of State's framework for disclosing a sponsor's criminal sexual background to the beneficiary. DHS, the Department of State, and the Department of Justice reviewed a draft of this report.

Immigration law does not prohibit convicted sex offenders from petitioning to bring their spouses, fiances, or children into the United States and generally USCIS cannot deny a petition based solely on the fact that the petitioner is a convicted sex offender. The sex offenders were convicted of at least 411 sex-related crimes, including sexual assault and rape, according to data in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Sex Offender Registry. At least 45 convictions involved crimes against children. While most beneficiaries were spouses and fiances, criminal sex offenders petitioned for at least 60 children. According to USCIS and Department of State officials, an exception to the Privacy Act of 1974 gives them authority to disclose a petitioner's criminal sex offender history if there are \"compelling circumstances affecting the health and safety\" of the beneficiary. For certain noncitizen beneficiaries, disclosure of the petitioner's criminal background information is now mandatory based on new authority granted to USCIS and the Department of State. The International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 (IMBRA) requires disclosure of a U.S. citizen's criminal background information, including sex crimes, to certain prospective immigrants, essentially noncitizen fiances, but some spouses and minor children as well. Mandatory disclosure is not required for beneficiaries not covered by IMBRA, though these beneficiaries may receive information about a petitioner's criminal background on a discretionary basis under the Privacy Act exception. GAO estimates that IMBRA's mandatory disclosure requirement will cover about 20 percent of family-based beneficiaries based on fiscal year 2005 data. On May 3, 2006, USCIS issued interim guidance to its adjudicators on when it may be appropriate to disclose information related to a petitioner's criminal history under the \"compelling circumstances\" exception to the Privacy Act.

In addition, U.S. citizens, but not lawful permanent  residents, can petition for noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s and their children. If  USCIS approves the petition, the noncitizen relative or fianc\u00e9(e), called  the beneficiary, can then apply to enter or remain in the United States.

The NSOR is a national database that compiles data furnished by  the states from their sex offender registries. As of December 2005, the  NSOR contained data on approximately 413,000 sex offenders. The FBI is  required by federal law to maintain this registry to track the whereabouts  and movement of convicted sex offenders who have been (1) convicted of  a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor, (2) convicted of a  sexually violent offense, or (3) who are \u201csexually violent predators.\u201d We  matched several data elements that were the same in both data sets, such  as name, date of birth, or Social Security number, to provide a high level of  assurance that the petitioner in the USCIS database was the same person  as the sex offender in the NSOR.

USCIS is generally responsible for administering the  citizenship and immigration services of the United States. Most foreign  nationals living abroad who wish to immigrate to the United States must  obtain a visa through the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Consular  Affairs.", "U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, that is, petitioners, can  request or petition USCIS to allow certain relatives to immigrate to the  United States. As the first step in a two step process, petitioners must file a  family-based petition with USCIS. U.S. citizens and lawful permanent  residents may file a Form I-130 for an alien relative, such as a wife or child,  to immigrate to the United States. U.S. citizens (but not lawful permanent  residents) may also petition to bring a noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e) to the United  States by filing a Form I-129F with USCIS.

The purpose of these petitions is to establish the petitioner\u2019s  relationship to the family member or fianc\u00e9(e) who wishes to immigrate to  the United States. USCIS adjudicators are to review petitions and make  determinations, in accordance with immigration law, on whether to  approve or deny petitions. If a petition is approved, the second step in the  process is to determine whether the noncitizen is admissible under  immigration law to enter or remain in the United States. If the noncitizen is  overseas, USCIS will send the approved petition to the State Department  and a State Department consular officer will determine whether to issue a  visa to the noncitizen.  If the noncitizen is already in the United States in a  nonimmigrant status, such as a visitor or student, when the petition is  approved, a USCIS adjudicator will determine whether to allow the  noncitizen to change, or \u201cadjust,\u201d his/her status to that of a lawful  permanent resident.", "As part of its review, USCIS conducts background security checks on  petitioners as well as noncitizen beneficiaries. These background checks  were instituted for national security purposes such as identifying terrorists  or terrorist threats, and for public safety reasons, such as identifying  human rights violators or aggravated felons. According to USCIS officials,  background security checks were conducted on all beneficiaries prior to  September 11. As of January 2002, however, background security checks  were required to be conducted on all petitioners, including U.S. citizens, as  well as beneficiaries.", "USCIS adjudicators conduct background security checks using the  Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS), which is a multi-agency  computer system of lookouts for terrorists, drug traffickers, and other  such criminal types. IBIS contains numerous database files and interfaces  with sources such as the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center. The  NCIC contains various data, including data on violent gangs and terrorists,  immigration violators, and the National Sex Offender Registry. During a  background check, if an IBIS query returns a \u201chit\u201d where the name and  date of birth information entered returns a positive response from one or  more of the databases, and it appears the petitioner may have a criminal  background, USCIS adjudicators are to forward this information to a  Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) officer within USCIS.  FDNS officers are to conduct further system searches for verification of  the criminal hits. After researching and summarizing the criminal data on  the petitioner, FDNS officers are to notate their findings in a resolution  memorandum and send the memo back to the adjudicator responsible for  the file. Assuming the petitioner cannot be referred to law enforcement or,  in the case of a lawful permanent resident, deported, the adjudicator then  continues the review and accepts or denies the petition based on whether  there appears to be a valid relationship between the petitioner and the  beneficiary.", "The FBI NCIC NSOR is a compilation of state registration information  about sex offenders.

There may be additional convicted sex  offenders who filed family-based petitions. For example, we could not  determine with a high degree of confidence whether 53 petitioners that  had the same name and date of birth as a person in the NSOR were the  same individuals because there were no additional data items, such as  Social Security number or address, that we could match. Therefore, we did  not include these additional 53 petitioners in our count because it is  possible that two people could have the same name and date of birth.", "The 398 sex offenders filed a total of 420 petitions. Figure 1 shows the type  of beneficiaries for which petitions were filed by convicted sex offenders.  USCIS data indicate that 371 (88 percent) of the beneficiaries were  spouses and fianc\u00e9(e)s, 33 (8 percent) were unmarried children under   21 years old, and 16 (4 percent) were classified as other relatives. We do  not know, however, what percentage of unmarried children under 21 years  old were minors under the federal criminal code, which defines a minor as  under 18 years old for purposes of certain child sexual offenses. In  addition, certain relatives of the primary beneficiary, such as unmarried  children, under 21 years old, of the noncitizen spouse or fianc\u00e9(e), called  derivative beneficiaries, may also immigrate with the beneficiary.  However, USCIS\u2019s data system only includes information on the primary  beneficiary, not on any derivative beneficiaries. Therefore, our data  underestimate the actual number of beneficiaries. For example, in addition  to the 33 unmarried children under 21 years of age that were the primary  beneficiaries of sex offenders, the State Department provided us data from  its visa processing system indicating that there were at least an additional   27 children who were derivative beneficiaries associated with fianc\u00e9(e)  petitions.  Both USCIS and State Department data together total at least   60 unmarried children under 21 years of age.", "As shown in table 1, some of the sex offenders have been convicted of  multiple sex crimes. The 398 sex offenders were convicted of at least   411 sex offenses, including sexual assault, rape, and child molestation,  according to conviction data contained in the NSOR. At least 45 of the  convictions were for sex offenses against children. It is possible that  more than 45 convictions involved sex offenses against children, but this  number could not be determined based on the conviction description in  the registry. For example, the conviction description for 217 of the   411 convictions, or 53 percent, is \u201csex offense.\u201d In addition, 14 petitioners  were classified as sexual predators. Consistent with statute, the NSOR  classifies \u201csexual predator\u201d as an offender who has been convicted of a  sexually violent offense and suffers from a mental abnormality or  personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory  sexually violent offenses again. These 14 sexual predators filed a total of  17 petitions. As of December 2005, 9 of the 17 petitions filed were  approved and 8 were pending.

The review and ultimately the approval of such petitions  centers on whether the facts stated in the petition are true and whether  there exists the requisite relationship between the petitioner and the  beneficiary. It is possible that a petitioner\u2019s criminal history may be  relevant to the question of whether the petitioner has established the  requisite relationship.

The USCIS  petitioner data file contained records on 667,023 individuals who filed  petitions for noncitizen relatives, such as a spouse or child, and 66,658  individuals who filed petitions for noncitizen fianc\u00e9(e)s in fiscal year 2005.  The FBI\u2019s NCIC National Sex Offender Registry contained data on the  412,773 convicted sex offenders as of December 2005.", "The USCIS and FBI data files contained seven common data elements:   (1) name (2) date of birth, (3) Social Security number, (4) street address,  (5) city, (6) state, and (7) ZIP code that we could attempt to match in order  to determine which petitioners were registered sex offenders. The name  and date of birth were always present in both datasets, but in some cases  the other data elements in either the USCIS or FBI dataset were either  missing or not entered correctly.  In order to increase the possibility of a  valid match, we first applied acceptable data-cleaning steps. For example,  we eliminated certain extraneous characters from the names and  addresses, such as dashes, periods and hyphens and other nonessential  characters that would otherwise impede our matching. In addition, we  corrected for certain obvious typographical errors, such as typing a zero  instead of the letter O.", "We conducted our match in two steps. In the first step, we matched cases  on name and Social Security number since the Social Security number is  considered a unique identifier. For our purposes, if the name and Social  Security number were the same in both cases, we considered it a match. In  the second step, after eliminating those we matched based on name and  Social Security number, we matched the remaining records on name and  date of birth. It is possible for two people to have the same name and date  of birth. Therefore, to be deemed a match for our purposes, the name, date  of birth, and several data elements needed to match to provide a high level  of assurance that the petitioner and the registered sex offender were the  same person. For example, if the name, date of birth and street address,  city, and ZIP code were the same, we considered it a match. We also  analyzed the USCIS data set to determine the number of petitioners that  may have filed more than one petition to arrive at the number of unique  sex offenders.", "To determine the reliability of the USCIS data, we observed how petitioner  data are entered into the USCIS data system, interviewed relevant USCIS  officials and staff, reviewed pertinent documents, and performed  electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness. To  determine the reliability of the FBI\u2019s Convicted Sexual Offender Registry  File, we interviewed FBI officials and system programmers knowledgeable  about the data, reviewed pertinent information regarding the FBI\u2019s sex  offender registry, and performed electronic testing for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted our work from August 2005 through June 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above, Michael Dino, Assistant Director, Carla Brown,  Christine Davis, Katherine Davis, Darryl Dutton, Lemuel Jackson, and  James Ungvarsky were key contributors to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
