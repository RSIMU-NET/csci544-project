Serious financial issues can negatively affect unit readiness. According to DOD, servicemembers with severe financial problems risk losing security clearances, incurring administrative or criminal penalties or, in some cases, face discharge. Despite increases in compensation and DOD programs on personal financial management (PFM), studies show that servicemembers, particularly junior enlisted personnel, continue to report financial difficulties. GAO assessed (1) the extent deployment impacts the financial condition of active duty servicemembers and their families, (2) whether DOD has an oversight framework for evaluating military programs designed to assist deployed and non-deployed servicemembers in managing their finances, and (3) the extent junior enlisted servicemembers receive required PFM training."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The financial conditions of deployed and non-deployed servicemembers and their families are similar, but deployed servicemembers and their families may face additional financial problems related to pay. In both a 2003 DOD-wide survey and non-generalizable focus groups that GAO conducted on 13 military installations in the United States and Germany, servicemembers who were deployed reported similar financial conditions as those who were not deployed. Some of GAO's focus group participants also noted that they--like Army Reservists in GAO's 2004 report, Military Pay: Army Reserve Soldiers Mobilized to Active Duty Experienced Significant Pay Problems--had not received their $250 family separation allowance each month during their deployment. Pay record data showed that almost 6,000 deployed servicemembers had received more than the prescribed $250 in January 2005, and 11 of them received a $3,000 catch-up, lump sum payment--the equivalent of 12 months of the allowance. This pay problem was due, in part, to service procedures being confusing and not always followed. Families who do not receive this allowance each month may experience financial strain caused by additional expenses such as extra childcare. DOD lacks an oversight framework--with results-oriented performance measures and reporting requirements--for evaluating the effectiveness of PFM programs across the services. DOD's 2002 human capital strategic plan stated that a standardized evaluation system for PFM programs is a desired goal; however, DOD does not currently have such a system. In 2003, GAO reported that DOD had included evaluative reporting measures in a draft of its PFM instruction to the services. However, the final PFM instruction issued by DOD in 2004 did not address outcome measures or contain a requirement that the services report program results to DOD because the services objected to these additional reporting requirements. Without a policy requiring evaluation and a reporting relationship between DOD and the services, DOD and Congress do not have the visibility or oversight needed to address issues related to the PFM programs. Some junior enlisted servicemembers are not receiving PFM training that is required in service regulations. While each of the services implements PFM training differently, all of the services have policies requiring that PFM training be provided to junior enlisted servicemembers. Moreover, the extent to which the PFM training is not received is unknown because most of the services do not track the completion of PFM training at the service level. Only the Army collected installation-level data and could provide a service-wide estimate of PFM training completed by junior enlisted servicemembers. Senior Army officers said PFM training had not been a priority given the need to prepare for current operations. Top-level DOD officials have repeatedly stated that financial issues directly affect servicemembers' mission readiness and should be addressed. Therefore, units whose servicemembers do not receive required PFM training risk jeopardizing their ability to meet mission requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The finances of servicemembers and their families have been an ongoing  concern of Congress and the Department of Defense (DOD), especially in  light of more frequent deployments to support the war on terrorism and  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  DOD\u2019s Social Compact, which is part of  DOD\u2019s human capital strategic plan, notes that mission readiness and  quality of life depend on whether servicemembers use their financial  resources responsibly.  Some adverse effects that may result when  servicemembers experience serious financial problems include loss of  security clearances, criminal or non-judicial sanctions, or adverse  personnel actions including possible discharge from the military.   Servicemembers with serious financial issues may also adversely impact  the readiness of the unit.  For example, servicemembers\u2019 financial  problems may take the servicemembers and possibly their unit  commanders away from their primary duties in order to address problems  with creditors.  In a 2002 report to Congress, the Navy identified an  estimated $250 million in productivity and salary losses due to  servicemembers\u2019 poor personal financial management.", "Congress and DOD have taken steps to decrease the likelihood that  deployed and non-deployed servicemembers will experience financial  problems.  Since 1999, DOD has requested and Congress has granted  annual increases in military basic pay for all active duty servicemembers  and increases in special pays and allowances for deployed  servicemembers, such as the family separation allowance and hostile  fire/imminent danger pay.  In addition, out-of-pocket housing expenses for  active duty military members living in private-sector housing have  decreased since 1999.  Also, the military has developed personal financial  management (PFM) programs to provide servicemembers with financial  literacy training, financial counseling, and other assistance to avoid or  mitigate the adverse effects associated with personal financial problems.", "Despite the added compensation and the assistance provided through the  PFM programs, studies in recent years by DOD and others show that active  duty servicemembers continue to report financial problems.  For example,  a 2002 study noted that 20 percent of junior enlisted servicemembers  reported that they struggled to make ends meet financially and another 4  percent regarded themselves as \u201cin over their heads\u201d with respect to their  finances.", "The information in this report supplements our February 2004 report to you  on bankruptcies among active duty servicemembers.  As agreed with your  office, this report answers three questions: (1) To what extent does  deployment impact the financial condition of active duty servicemembers  and their families? (2) Does DOD have an oversight framework for  evaluating military programs that assist both deployed and non-deployed  servicemembers in managing their personal finances? and (3) To what  extent are junior enlisted servicemembers receiving required personal  financial management training?  We also are reporting on the prevalence  and effect of predatory lending on servicemembers to fulfill your request  for information on the financial conditions of active duty servicemembers.", "In conducting this review, we limited the scope of our work to active duty  servicemembers, particularly those recently returning from deployments.   Emphasis was also given to junior enlisted servicemembers, since DOD  and service officials have indicated that this subgroup is more likely to  encounter financial problems.  Numerous methods were used to gather and  assess information for this work.  We examined DOD, service, and  installation policies on PFM program requirements, as well as management  guidance provided in the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993.  In addition, we reviewed reports by GAO, other congressional  research offices, DOD, and other organizations.  We constructed, pre- tested, and administered an e-mail survey to 225 installation-level PFM  managers.  During site visits to 13 military installations located in the  United States and Germany, we requested documents pertaining to the  implementation and evaluation of each installation\u2019s PFM programs, and  we used structured interviews to gather data from a variety of personnel on  the 13 installations: command leaders, the manager of the PFM programs,  financial counselors, DOD civilian and military attorneys in the Judge  Advocate General corps, chaplains, and staff from the relief/aid societies;  and separate discussion groups composed of 232 officers, senior enlisted  personnel, and junior enlisted personnel who had recently returned from  deployment and 112 who had not deployed, as well as 76 spouses of  servicemembers who had not deployed or had recently returned from a  deployment to address all three questions. While information from these  discussion groups is not generalizable to the entire DOD population of  active duty servicemembers, it provides context for findings in the report.   The in-depth information about the PFM programs on the 13 installations  was supplemented with information obtained from 3 group discussions  with a total of 50 personnel affiliated with the PFM programs while they  attended a November 2004 conference.  We obtained and reviewed other  information such as service and installation PFM training materials and  installation accreditation reports.  We reviewed and analyzed DOD\u2019s 2003  active duty survey to obtain information on the impact of deployment on  servicemembers\u2019 finances.  The March 2003 survey had a response rate of  35 percent.  DOD has conducted and reported on research to assess the  impact of this response rate on overall estimates.  They found that, among  other characteristics, junior enlisted personnel (E1 to E4), servicemembers  who do not have a college degree, and members in services other than the  Air Force were more likely to be non-respondents.  We have no reason to  believe that potential non-response bias not otherwise accounted for by  DOD\u2019s research is substantial for the variables we studied in this report.   Therefore, we concluded the data to be sufficiently reliable to address our  objectives. Further details regarding our scope and methodology are  presented in appendix I.

The expenses include extra  childcare costs, automobile maintenance, or home repairs the deployed  servicemember would normally do while home.  Hostile fire/imminent  danger pay provides special pay for \u201cduty subject to hostile fire or  imminent danger\u201d and is designed to compensate servicemembers for  physical danger.  Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and many other  nearby countries have been declared imminent danger zones.

Among other  things, the PFM programs provide financial literacy training to  servicemembers, particularly to junior enlisted personnel during their first  months in the military.  The group-provided financial literacy training is  supplemented with other types of financial management assistance, often  on a one-on-one basis.

For example, an Army  regulation states that soldiers must file a DD Form 1561 (Statement to  Substantiate Payment of Family Separation Allowance) to substantiate  eligibility to receive the allowance, along with a copy of the travel voucher  to indicate the period of entitlement\u2014which implies family separation  allowance is received after deployment because substantiating documents  are generally provided upon completion of travel with a voucher.  The  Army\u2019s pay manual, however, states that only a DD Form 1561 is required to  receive family separation allowance.  Officials at the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service and Army Finance Office stated that, although they  were following this regulation, they were requiring the DD Form 1561 prior  to departure so soldiers could receive family separation allowance during  deployment, which is contrary to the Army regulation.  In contrast,  Defense Finance and Accounting Service procedures for Air Force  servicemembers state that servicemembers may substantiate eligibility to  receive family separation allowance prior to departure, using the travel  order and the DD Form 1561.  By using the travel order, Air Force  servicemembers can receive family separation allowance during  deployment.  However, elsewhere in the Defense Finance and Accounting  procedures, it notes that most Air Force members are paid family  separation allowance upon returning from deployment.  In April 2003, Air  Force officials attempted to clear up any confusion over how Air Force  personnel should initiate payments of family separation allowance, by  sending a message to a Defense Finance and Accounting official stating  that family separation allowance paperwork should be filed before  servicemembers depart for deployment.  Despite this subsequent change,  Air Force servicemembers in our June 2004 focus group noted that they  had not received the family separation allowance during their deployments.

The longer-term  problems might include negative information about the late payments  being entered in one\u2019s financial credit report, which could make it more  difficult or expensive for servicemembers to obtain credit in the future.   Similarly, limited access to telephones or Internet can have negative  financial effects such as (1) delaying or preventing contact with a creditor  when a financial issue arises, (2) making it impossible to electronically  transfer money from a financial institution to a creditor, and (3) incurring  overdraft expenses because the spouse could not be informed in a timely  manner about a cash advance that the servicemember requested.", "Individuals in our focus groups suggested that the access to Internet and  telephones may not be the same across the pay grades and services.  For  example, some servicemembers noted that deployed junior enlisted  personnel sometimes had less access to Internet than did senior deployed  personnel, making it difficult for the former to keep up with their bills.  In  addition, some Army servicemembers told us that they (1) could not call  stateside toll-free numbers because the numbers were inaccessible from  overseas or (2) incurred substantial costs\u2014sometimes $1 per minute\u2014to  call stateside creditors.  In contrast, Air Force servicemembers in Germany  said that the cost of calls to stateside creditors from Iraq or Afghanistan  was not an issue for them because the Air Force had provided telephone  calling cards that could be used to make such calls free of charge.", "Failure to avoid or promptly correct financial problems can result in  negative consequences for servicemembers.  This includes increased debt  for servicemembers, bad credit histories, and poor performance of their  duties when distracted by financial problems.  In addition, servicemembers  who cannot stay on top of their finances, while deployed, may require  assistance from officials in their chain of command to address financial  problems, which takes those officials from their normal military duties.

Delays in responding to creditors can result in  serious consequences, including bad credit ratings for the servicemembers  and adverse effects on unit readiness and morale.", "While DOD states in its Social Compact that a standardized evaluation  system to measure the effectiveness of the PFM programs is a desired goal,  the department does not have an oversight framework that includes the  performance measures and reporting requirements needed to fully measure  results from its programs.  In addition, the absence of evaluation and  reporting requirements in DOD\u2019s newly issued instruction on personnel  financial management suggests that DOD will continue to have limited  visibility and oversight over the PFM programs and little ability to require  standardized assessments of the PFM programs.  These deficiencies, in  turn, will limit Congress\u2019 ability to address issues related to DOD\u2019s PFM  programs.", "While DOD and service officials have acknowledged that the lack of PFM  training sets the stage for servicemembers having financial difficulties  later, high deployment levels limit the time available for some  servicemembers to take the PFM training.  The absence of servicewide  systems for monitoring the completion of this required training could result  in some servicemembers never being provided such training if they are  unable to take it at the prescribed time.  Moreover, the lack of a monitoring  system also will hamper efforts to improve PFM training since it will be  impossible to establish a measurable relationship between whether or not  someone completed training and how well they subsequently managed  their finances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Actions", "paragraphs": ["To address issues related to servicemembers\u2019 financial management, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to take the following four actions:  Take the necessary steps, in conjunction with the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service and the services, to ensure servicemembers receive  family separation allowances on a monthly basis during deployments.   These steps might include those recommended in our prior review of  Army Reserve pay, such as clarifying and simplifying procedures and  forms implementing family separation allowance entitlements or having  DOD and the operational components of the services work together to  ensure family separation allowance entitlement eligibility form is  received by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to start the  allowance when the servicemember is entitled to it.", "Identify and implement, with the services, steps that can be taken to  allow deployed servicemembers better communications with creditors.

Emphasis was placed on servicemembers who had returned  from a deployment within the last year because these individuals were  most likely to have recent personal knowledge of deployment-related  financial issues, as well as familiarity with financial issues of  servicemembers serving on installations in the United States.  During the  course of our work, we visited 13 installations with high deployment levels,  as identified by service officials (see table 4).  During these site visits to  installations in the United States and Germany, special emphasis was given  to ascertaining the financial conditions of junior enlisted servicemembers  because DOD and service officials have reported that this subgroup is more  likely to encounter financial problems.", "To address the extent to which there is a financial impact of deployment on  active duty servicemembers and their families, we reviewed and analyzed  laws, policies, and directives governing military pay, such as the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation 7000.14R, Volume 7A, as well as documents related to the tax  treatment of military pay, including the Internal Revenue Service Armed  Forces\u2019 Tax Guide: For Use in Preparing 2003 Returns.  We also reviewed  and analyzed GAO reports on military compensation and deployment and  reports from other agencies, including DOD, the Congressional Research  Service, and the Congressional Budget Office.  We contacted the Federal  Trade Commission to ascertain what data were available through Military  Sentinel on servicemembers\u2019 financial conditions and complaints.  We  conducted focus groups and surveyed servicemembers and spouses and  held individual interviews with PFM program managers, non- commissioned officers, and legal assistance attorneys at installations we  visited to obtain their perspectives on the impact of deployment on  servicemembers.  We also compared and contrasted results of our survey  of servicemembers and spouses with data obtained through DOD-wide  active duty surveys from 2003 for face validity and to identify trends and  other indicators of financial impact.  We assessed the reliability of survey  data that DOD uses to obtain information on the financial conditions of  servicemembers and their families.  The March 2003 survey had a response  rate of 35 percent.  DOD has conducted and reported on research to assess  the impact of this response rate on overall estimates.  They found that,  among other characteristics, junior enlisted personnel (E1 to E4),  servicemembers who do not have a college degree, and members in  services other than the Air Force were more likely to be non-respondents.   We have no reason to believe that potential non-response bias not  otherwise accounted for by DOD\u2019s research is substantial for the variables  we studied in this report.  Therefore, we concluded the data to be  sufficiently reliable to address our objectives. Additional perspectives  regarding the financial impact of deployment were obtained in interviews  with DOD and service policy officials.  Still other perspectives were  obtained from installation officials using the structured interviews and an  e-mail survey to all PFM program managers.  This information was  supplemented with information obtained from three group discussions  with a total of 50 personnel affiliated with the PFM programs while they  attended a November 2004 conference.  We also reviewed family separation  allowance data from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for  servicemembers who were deployed and receiving imminent danger pay in  January 2005.", "To facilitate the data gathering process for all three questions, we  developed and pre-tested four types of data collection instruments.  The  content of the instruments was identified through review of policies,  reports, and other materials, and from interviews with DOD and service  officials.", "Structured questionnaires and focus group protocols were used to  increase the likelihood that the questions were asked and procedures  were conducted in a standardized manner, regardless of which GAO  analyst conducted the interviews and focus groups during the 13 site  visits.  While the interviews and focus groups provided valuable  qualitative data to illustrate important issues, the findings were not  generalizeable to the population of all active duty servicemembers  because of the small non-random samples of personnel who  participated in the data collection sessions.", "Separate structured interview protocols were created for seven types  of officials: installation commanders, PFM program managers, senior  non-commissioned officers (E8 to E9), legal assistance attorneys,  chaplains, command financial specialists, and officials representing  service relief/aid societies.  While some of the questions were the  same or very similar for some issues, the content of the structured  interviews was tailored to the type of official interviewed.", "A single focus group protocol, with seven central questions and  follow-up questions, was used to solicit information from each of the  four types of homogeneous groups: junior enlisted servicemembers  (E1 to E4), non-commissioned officers (E5 to E9), company-grade  officers (O1 to O3), and spouses of servicemembers who had  recently returned from deployments.", "An anonymous survey was administered at the beginning of each  focus group to obtain specific, sensitive (e.g., financial difficulties  experienced by the servicemembers and their families) information  that focus group participants might not feel comfortable discussing  with other servicemembers present.  Administering the survey before  the focus group questions were asked allowed us to quantify  participants\u2019 perspectives and situations, without the  servicemembers being influenced by the subsequent discussions.", "An e-mail survey was administered to the DOD-wide population of 225  PFM program managers identified by service officials.  The response  rate for the survey was 74 percent.

In  addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2002 report on Personal and Family Financial  Management Programs submitted to the House of Representatives Armed  Services Committee.  The Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  provided model criteria for determining the adequacy of the oversight  framework.  We gathered perspectives about the outcome measures to  evaluate the PFM programs from DOD and service-level officials, along  with responses from the previously mentioned discussion groups at the  November 2004 conference and the DOD-wide survey of PFM managers.   We reviewed and analyzed data related to the effectiveness of the PFM  programs from DOD-wide active duty survey conducted in 2003.  We also  reviewed accreditation reports for installation PFM programs, where  available, and other materials documenting the use or effectiveness of PFM  programs.

Servicemembers who participated in the focus  groups were divided into three types of groups: junior enlisted personnel  (E1 to E4), mid-grade and senior enlisted personnel (E5 to E9), and junior  officers (O1 to O3).

How has deployment affected military families financially in  your unit? 1.a. Other reason deployment affects families financially (N=13)", "Example: Financial problems stem from relationship problems.", "Many Marines file for divorce when they return from a deployment.", "Example: Another sailor said they have to buy a lot of supplies, such  as stocks of deodorant and other toiletries, to take on the  deployment.  The government does not pay for those supplies. 1.b. Better financially \u2013 increased income (N=13)", "Example: A soldier stated that his family was barely making ends  meet when he left for a deployment.  However, when he returned, his  wife had paid off all of the bills and saved some of the money.  He and  his wife look forward to deployments as a way to catch up on  expenses and savings.", "Example: Some cited receiving additional hazardous/combat duty  pay and attendant tax exemptions during deployment as reasons for  the financial benefits. In addition, some servicemembers mentioned  that they no longer had to pay rent and incur related household  expenses such as food and other household goods while deployed.  The additional money allowed families to pay off debts and  outstanding bills. 1.c. Worse financially \u2013 increased needs (e.g., childcare and  transportation) (N=12)", "Example: Deployment worsens some servicemembers\u2019 finances  because childcare expenses increased.  In many instances, to avoid  having childcare expenses, one parent will work during the day and  one during the night.  When the servicemember deploys, the  remaining spouse must find suitable daycare for the children.  This is  an added expense the deployment forces on the family.", "Example: During a deployment there are more expenses because the  spouse has to pay for things that the servicemember would usually  do personally, like house and car repairs. 1.d. Worse financially \u2013 other (N=11)", "Example: The military encourages soldiers to obtain a power of  attorney before they deploy, but the power of attorney gives the  spouse access to all of the soldier\u2019s finances.  In many cases, the  spouse has used this power to spend all of the soldier\u2019s money.  One  soldier returned from his deployment to find that he only had $80 left  in his bank account.", "Example: One unmarried soldier said he was 5 months behind in  paying his bills because he\u2019s single and did not have anyone to help  him while he was deployed. 1.e. No change financially because of deployment (N=11)", "Example: Overall, servicemembers are not really making more  money when they are deployed.  The additional pay and allowances  make up for the increased spending that a family must do when the  servicemember is not at home.", "Example: Another servicemember stated that she was a single parent  and had to send her child back to the west coast with her parents.   She stated she came out about even financially because the extra  money she made was spent on the additional expenses to care for her  son. 1.f. Effect issue \u2013 servicemember has dependents (N=11)", "Example: Single parents face an entirely different set of issues during  a deployment. For example, in many cases, the member will be the  only parent for a child; therefore, when that member is deployed  long-term childcare must be arranged.  In most situations, the  member will arrange for an immediate or extended family member to  assume the childcare responsibilities.", "Example: Some Navy servicemembers said that the status of  personal finances during a deployment will vary based on the marital  status of the sailor.  For example, sailors with dependents will collect  more entitlements than those who are single. 1.g. Worse financially \u2013 increased wants (N=11)", "Example: Some soldiers were buying expensive cars with their  deployment pays.  However, when the servicemembers returned  from deployment to their regular pay they were not able to afford  their deployment standards of living because the increase in income  and tax free status no longer applied.", "Example: The spouse may be depressed during the deployment and  spend the money the soldier is being paid.  In these cases, they have  no one around telling them to save it or to pay the bills.  They shop to  fight the depression and to make themselves feel better. 1.h. Better financially \u2013 other (N=10)", "Example: In some cases, the family\u2019s finances actually improve  because the spouse takes control of the bills during the deployment.", "Example: Another participant stated that she and her husband are  more financially responsible now compared to when they were  younger.  Thus, they are able to benefit more from the monetary  benefits of deployment. 1.i. Effect issue \u2013 personal ability to manage money (N=9)", "Example: Poor post-deployment spending habits (e.g., buying a new  expensive car) of some single servicemembers caused them to lose  extra income earned during deployment.  This left them with more  debt than before they left for the deployment.", "Example: In many cases, it is when the soldier returns from the  deployment that families will get into financial troubles.  During the  deployment, there is a significant increase in pay and an increase in  spending.  After the deployment, the servicemember\u2019s pay returns to  normal and the family may have trouble dealing with the loss of  income, which can encourage increased debt. 1.j. Effect issue \u2013 servicemember does not have dependents (N=7)", "Example: Single servicemembers seemed to fare better financially  because they do not incur the same expenses as married couples,  such as childcare and transportation costs.  The single member is  more likely to be living with roommates and when deployed, he/she  only has a small amount to pay for rent.  The married servicemember,  on the other hand, still has a mortgage to pay back home, along with  the additional expenses previously mentioned.", "Example: Single servicemembers are better off financially because  they only have to take care of themselves financially. 1.k. Effect issue \u2013 where deployed (N=6)", "Example: The effect on finances depends on the location to which a  servicemember is deployed.  The pay and allowances that a soldier  receives vary from location to location.  In some places, soldiers can  make a lot of money; in others, they will not.", "Example: The financial impact of deployment depends on where an  officer was deployed.  In South Korea, servicemembers pay taxes and  do not receive extra pay, as did those who served in combat zones.  In  addition, individuals deployed to South Korea lost their Basic  Allowance for Housing, even though they needed it while deployed.   The officer needed to live off base because of a lack of housing on  base there.  This meant paying for two households, one on  deployment and one for the spouse and children at home. 1.l. Worse financially \u2013 loss of income (N=5)", "Example: Some spouses mentioned that they know of some soldiers  that had to give up their second jobs when they left on the  deployment and the loss of this income had a big impact on the  family\u2019s finances.", "Example: While at their home station, sailors collect commuted  rations, also referred to as comrats.  Commuted rations are a pay  allowance given to sailors to cover the cost of meals incurred off  base when they are not serving on and eating aboard the ship.  When  a sailor goes out to sea, the commuted rations payments are stopped  and sea pay is started.  Also, a sailor is entitled to Career Sea special  pay, or sea pay, at a monthly rate of up to $750.  The actual amount of  sea pay varies based on the sailor\u2019s rank and number of years served  and can range from $70 to $750 a month.  However, younger sailors  do not have enough time accrued on their sea pay clock to make up  for the loss of commuted rations pay.  Therefore, some families will  actually lose money during the deployment. 1.m. Better financially \u2013 decreased expenses (N=5)", "Example: At some deployment locations, there is nowhere to spend  the extra income.  There are no bars, no daily expenses like gasoline,  and no phone bills.  Yet the Marines are being paid the additional  entitlements and pay.", "Example: One participant said she thought her family\u2019s finances were  in better shape during her husband\u2019s deployment because he was not  able to spend the extra money he earned and the family was able to  save more money while he was deployed. 2. Could you tell me about servicemembers you know who have  gone through any financial difficulties such as declaring  bankruptcy, falling behind on bills, or having a car or appliance  repossessed? 2.a. Overspending/bad money management (N=13)", "Example: There were servicemembers who ran into severe financial  problems after they returned from deployment due to overspending  and overextending themselves financially while they were deployed.", "Example: Another participant said that he knew of a few junior  enlisted servicemembers who spent all their money on expensive  cars and other things, once they returned from deployment.  They did  not save any of the extra money they received. 2.b. Other experiences with financial difficulties (N=13)", "Example: One airman experienced a situation in which a creditor   would not accept the automatic money transfer that was set up  before the deployment.", "Example: One soldier\u2019s ex-wife took him to court while he was  deployed in an attempt to obtain additional child support money.   Because of the additional entitlements and pay that the soldier was  collecting, the court increased the payments to match.  The soldier  was unable to return home or communicate to prevent the action or  mediate in the situation. 2.c. Defense Finance and Accounting Service errors (N=11)", "Example: One of the airmen had a series of late payments during a  deployment because Defense Finance and Accounting Service did  not process an allotment correctly and the money was not getting  sent to the correct place.", "Example: Almost all of the airmen knew someone who did not have  their pay entitlements stopped after returning from the deployment.   In most instances, Defense Finance and Accounting Service was  continuing to pay the entitlement for several months; unfortunately,  once the problem was resolved, Defense Finance and Accounting  Service took back the amount owed in one lump sum.  This left the  airmen with paychecks amounting to zero dollars. 2.d. Communication problems  (lack of Internet/e-mail/mail/phone)  (N=10)", "Example: A servicemember stated that a major issue with  deployment was not being able to pay bills on time because the  infrastructure down range (combat zone) was not immediately set up  to deliver/send mail.", "Example: During deployments, the junior enlisted personnel do not  have as much access to the Internet as the senior Marines.  This can  have a negative impact on their ability to access their checking and  other financial accounts, thereby impacting their ability to manage  their finances. 2.e. Difficulty maintaining checkbook/finances (N=10)", "Example: Many servicemembers have the mentality that because  they earn the money it is theirs to manage.  When the soldier is at  home, he or she controls the finances; and when the soldier leaves,  the spouse does not know how to handle the bills, finances, or  budget.", "Example: In many situations, single sailors may not have someone  back home to take care of their bills or manage their finances. 2.f. Car repossessed (N=9)", "Example: Some soldiers spent their money quickly after they  returned from the deployment and bought expensive cars.  In a few  instances, these cars were repossessed because the soldiers could  not make the monthly payments.", "Example: A soldier stated that some servicemembers\u2019 allotments  were not processed, which resulted in their cars being repossessed.   This also left the servicemembers with a bad credit rating. 2.g. Did not experience financial difficulties during deployment  (N=6)", "Example: A participant stated he knew of very few soldiers who were  negatively affected financially because of deployment.", "Example: Those who fared well with their finances had relationships  with helpful people/spouses who were able to manage their finances  for the servicemembers while they were deployed. 2.h. Fell behind in bills (N=6)", "Example: A servicemember said that he and his spouse had fallen  behind on paying their bills.", "Example: A soldier said that a servicemember\u2019s phone was  disconnected because his spouse went to another state to visit  relatives for 2 months and the phone bill was not paid. 2.i. Bankruptcy (N=5)", "Example: Participants stated that they had heard of very few  servicemembers who had to file for bankruptcy as a result of  deployment.", "Example: One of the officers was aware of a sergeant who had to file  bankruptcy upon returning from deployment.  During the  deployment, the sergeant\u2019s spouse spent all of the extra money and  took out \u201ca ton\u201d of additional debt. 2.j. Problems with government credit card (N=4)", "Example: The government travel card causes more problems than  other cards.  Sailors are traveling back to back with several  deployments and take out back to back debts.  The Travel Processing  Center may not process the travel claims in 10 days like they are  supposed to, so people are running up debt on the government travel  card that they cannot pay off.", "Example: Sometimes servicemembers have had to pay (their  government travel card bill) with their own money while waiting for  funds to be provided/reimbursed by the government.  This takes  money out of their household and can affect their credit rating.  It can  take up to 2 months to get their money from the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service. 3. During your deployment, how did servicemembers in your unit  handle situations when there were financial problems at home? 3.a. Used in-theatre resources (chain of command, e-mail, Internet)  (N=10)", "Example: Soldiers had to go through their chain of command to take  care of some of their financial situations and the issues were resolved  with the assistance of the chain of command.", "Example: Most of the other participants said they had a non- commissioned officer log them onto the Internet to check on their  bills, and this helped them. 3.b. Used resources at home (family support center, family readiness  officer) (N=8)", "Example: There are many people on base that help spouses during  the deployment. The key volunteers group that meets once or twice a  week is a good resource for the families to use if they need assistance  during the deployment.", "Example: On Air Force bases, there is an abundance of assistance for  servicemembers with financial problems.  Information is provided  through:  First Term Airman Center, Personal Financial Counseling,  Air Force Aid Society, Air Force Assistance Fund, First Sergeants,  Finance, and the Judge Advocate General.  These are some of the  resources available to servicemembers for finance-related issues. 3.c. Other financial problems on homefront (N=5)", "Example: Sometimes a single servicemember will leave advance rent  checks for the landlord of the apartment and the landlord will  deposit all of the checks at once, which results in overdrafts for the  servicemember.", "Example: There are many instances of spouses back home that spend  all of the additional income that the Marine is making during the  deployment.  When the Marine returns, he or she will find all of their  money gone and nothing to show for it. 3.d. Waited until they got home (N=5)", "Example: Some participants said they just waited to handle the  problems until after they returned home if they do not have anyone  to help them and the situation had not been brought to the  command\u2019s attention.   They did not want the command involved in  their finances.", "Example:  In instances where the servicemember\u2019s spouse spends all  of the money, the member normally is not able to do anything until he  or she returns from the deployment. 4. What kind of financial assistance does your service or the  military need to take care of financial problems when people are  deployed? 4.a. Pre-deployment briefs (more information or briefs before  deployment notice received) (N=11)", "Example: More financial awareness training prior to the deployment  would have helped alleviate many problems that individuals  experienced.  The current 2-minute brief is not enough.", "Example: Even though the base legal office offers a will and power of  attorney class every Tuesday, some Marines are unable to attend.   The information in the classes needs to be incorporated into the pre- deployment briefings. 4.b. Other kinds of financial assistance needed (N=9)", "Example: Small groups, such as married servicemembers with  children or single servicemembers, should be given specific attention  or focus when information on finances is distributed because the  different groups have different needs when it comes to finances.", "Example: The First Term Airmen Center should give out warnings to  new airmen about which lenders around base are good to work with  and which ones are not so good.  4.c. Sustained training (provided throughout career) (N=7)", "Example: Financial training should occur upfront and be proactive\u2014 not be reactive, like it is now.  Currently, classes are required only if  the soldier has written bad checks.", "Example: More overall financial education is needed.  One soldier  was enlisted for 5 years before he got any formal financial  management training, and that was only because he got in trouble.   Education is the key in improving financial management. 4.d. Early training (boot camp, Advanced Individual Training)  (N=6)", "Example: The military needs to provide more financial training in  basic/boot camp to include in-depth discussions of allotments,  deductions, and leave and earnings statements.  One soldier said he  did not know what a leave and earnings statement was until he came  to his unit.", "Example: Financial training courses should be incorporated into  basic training or technical school.  By conducting this training early,  DOD may have an impact on initial purchase decisions made by  servicemembers. 5. What kinds of experiences have your fellow servicemembers or  subordinates had with predatory lenders? 5.a.Other issues regarding experiences with predatory lenders  (N=13)", "Example: Business representatives will tell young Marines that they  can buy an item for a certain amount each month.  They keep the  Marine focused on the low monthly payments and not on the interest  rate or the term of the loan.", "Example: Some Marines feel that a business would not take  advantage of them because they are in the military.  This leads them  to be more trusting of the local businesses than they should be,  which in turn, leads the businesses to take advantage of them. 5.b. Predatory lender used \u2013 car dealers (N=11)", "Example: Most of the participants stated that the car dealerships  around the base were the worst predatory lenders because they  charge high interest rates and often provide cars that are \u201clemons.\u201d   They said that most of the sales people at the dealerships are former  military who know how to talk to servicemembers to obtain the  members\u2019 trust.  The servicemember does not expect this.", "Example: One captain had a Marine in his unit who signed a contract  with a car dealer for a loan with 26 percent interest rate.  The captain  took the Marine to the Marine Credit Union and got him a new loan  with 9.5 percent interest rate. 5.c. Predatory lender used \u2013 payday lenders (N=10)", "Example: A master sergeant got caught in the check-cashing cycle.", "He would write a check at one payday lender in order to cover a  check written at another lender during a previous week.", "Example: One participant told us that when he was a younger Marine  he got caught up with a payday lender.  The problem did not resolve  itself until he deployed and was not able to go to the lender anymore. 5.d. Reason for using predatory lender \u2013 get fast cash and no hassle  (N=10)", "Example: People use payday lenders because they are quick and  easy.  All the soldiers have to do is to provide their leave and earnings  statement and they get the money.", "Example: Most of the participants say they know people who have  used a payday lender, and those soldiers use them because they have  bad credit and can get quick cash. 5.e. Predatory lender targeting \u2013 close proximity and clustering  around bases (N=9)", "Example: It is almost impossible to be unaware of lenders and  dealerships because many are clustered in close proximity to the  installation.  They also distribute flyers and use pervasive advertising  in local and installation papers.", "Example: The stores and car lots near the installation use signs that  say \u201cE1 and up approved\u201d or \u201call military approved\u201d to get the  attention of the military servicemembers. 5.f. Command role when contacted by creditors (N=8)", "Example: The non-commissioned officers offer to go with the junior  enlisted to places like car dealers; but the young soldiers do not take  them up on these offers.", "Example: One participant said that debt collectors do call his house  and the command.  He noted that one lender called him nine times in  one day and his Chief Petty Officer eventually asked the lender to  stop harassing his sailor. 5.g. Predatory lender targeting \u2013 advertising in installation/local  newspaper (N=7)", "Example: Soldiers are being targeted by predatory lenders in a  variety of ways; for example, flyers are left on parked cars at the  barracks, advertising is done at installation functions, and words  such as \u201cmilitary\u201d are used on every piece of advertising to make the  servicemember believe that the company is part of or supported by  the military.  The servicemember would normally trust lenders  associated with the military.", "Example: Most predatory lenders have signs that say \u201cmilitary  approved\u201d or have commercials that say the same thing or \u201cE1 and  above approved.\u201d 5.h. Reason for using predatory lender \u2013 urgent need (N=6)", "Example: Many soldiers use payday lenders because they are in a  bind for money and they know these lenders can provide quick cash.", "Example: Soldiers will use a payday lender because they need money  for a child, the kids, the house payment, etc.  In many cases, it does  not matter why they need it; they just need it.  So, they go where they  can get cash the fastest and the easiest way possible. 5.i. Predatory lender used \u2013 furniture/rent-to-own (N=6)", "Example: One of the participants stated that he had obtained a loan  to purchase a new washer and dryer.  The loan had a 55 percent  interest rate and the appliances cost a lot more than they should  have.", "Example: Rent-to-own businesses are widely used by soldiers.  One  soldier paid $3,000 for an $800 washer and dryer set. 5.j. No problem with predatory lenders (N=5)", "Example: There have not been any problems with predatory lenders  lately.  The state of Florida has been using legislation to shut them  down.", "Example: The participants said that they had never encountered an  officer that had to use payday lenders or predatory lenders.  Most of  the officers\u2019 problems come when they have a bitter divorce. 5.k. Reason for using predatory lender \u2013 other reasons (N=5)", "Example: One soldier stated that his credit was so bad that he had no  other option but to use high interest rate lenders.  He stated that, \u201cI  have bad credit and I will always get bad credit.\u201d", "Example: One participant said he has several friends that use payday  lenders because they are E1s or E2s and don\u2019t make much money. 5.l. Predatory lender targeting \u2013 employing former military members  (N=4)", "Example: The people running and working for the predatory  businesses are usually former military servicemembers.  They will  use their knowledge of the system to take advantage of Marines.", "Example: Many times the predatory lenders are veterans, former  Marines, or retirees.  The participant said that by using these types of  people, it gives the younger Marines a false sense of trust and then  the lenders will take advantage of the servicemember or \u201cstab them  in the back.\u201d 5.m. Reason for using predatory lender \u2013 command will not know  financial conditions (N=3)", "Example: When a soldier needs money, a payday loan can be used  without notifying the chain of command.  Any of the Army forms of  assistance require a soldier to obtain approval from \u201ca dozen people\u201d  before they can get any money.", "Example: The most significant reason that people use payday lenders  is privacy.  The spouses stated that if you try to obtain assistance  through the Air Force, you must use the chain of command to obtain  approval.  By doing so, everyone in the unit will know your business. 6. What types of financial services have fellow servicemembers  and/or subordinates in your unit used? 6.a. Service relief/aid societies (N=13)", "Example: Servicemembers are often reluctant to approach Army  Emergency Relief Society because they have to complete too much  paperwork.  Some have concerns that their superiors will find out  that they used these services and superiors may think this is a sign of  weakness or failure on the part of the servicemember.", "Example: One soldier stated that he used the Army Emergency Relief  Society because he did not have good credit and needed $1,400 as a  security deposit.  He said they gave him a loan and that he is paying  them back at $60 per month. 6.b. Other types of services used/aware of (N=13)", "Example: Assistance is available for Marines with financial problems.   For example, there is a Key Volunteers Network made up of enlisted  and officers\u2019 wives.", "Example: One of the sailors was having financial problems and did  not want the command to know, so he sought help from the Federal  Credit Union.  The credit union was able to help with the $50,000 he  had accumulated in debt.  They contacted the lenders for him and  told them not to contact anyone in the command about the problem.   The debt was re-organized and repayment began.  All of this was  accomplished without the help of the Navy. 6.c. Community service center/family support center\u2019s personal  financial managers (N=13)", "Example: Some servicemembers who have problems have received  help from Army Community Services.  Army Community Services  does not provide money or loans but does give some household items  such as pots and pans and these items do provide some help to those  in financial trouble.", "Example: When supervisors recognize a subordinate is having  financial problems, most of them will refer the subordinate to the  family support center for counseling, budget planning, and basic  personal finance skills like balancing a checkbook. 6.d. DOD Financial Readiness Campaign/services\u2019 Internet resources  (N=11)", "Example: None of the participants had heard of the Financial  Readiness Campaign.", "Example: Only one of the 11 participants was aware of the Financial  Readiness Campaign.  The servicemember that did know about it  said that the information was difficult to sort through and may not be  helpful to those without a basic knowledge of finances. 6.e. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (N=9)", "Example: One airman said that he used the Servicemembers Civil  Relief Act to reduce his total indebtedness during his deployment.  In  fact, after returning from the deployment, the credit companies kept  the interest rates at 6 percent or less.", "Example: One of the participants talked about how he used the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to get out of a lease prior to  deployment. 6.f. No services used or not aware that any service was used (N=7)", "Example: One participant said that there are financial services  available but because they are not very well advertised, many  servicemembers do not know about them.", "Example: The spouse stated she was not aware of any available  assistance programs because information about programs does not  get communicated well at the installation. 6.g. Legal office (N=6)", "Example: There is a legal office that can review purchase contracts  while the sailor is at home and a legal assistance attorney onboard  ship who can provide assistance.", "Example: Sometimes the family at home cannot take care of financial  issues, even if they have power of attorney.  The best solution is to  obtain help from the on base legal office. 6.h. Command financial specialists (N=5)", "Example: Soldiers have used the command financial specialist within  their units to receive counseling, training, and information.", "Example: Most of the participants said that they had a command  financial specialist in their unit but did not use these individuals,  primarily because of a lack of trust.  They said that if a  servicemember talked about financial problems with these people, it  would end up through the chain of command.  If someone were to  see a servicemember in the command financial specialist\u2019s office,  then they would know/assume the servicemember had a financial  problem. 7. Is there additional assistance that could be provided to  servicemembers or subordinates by the chain of command or  DOD to improve the financial condition of military families? 7.a. Additional financial management training at installation and  throughout career (N=13)", "Example: Some of the participants said the briefings provided to  soldiers during base \u201cin processing\u201d are too quick.  They normally  last about 10 minutes and that is not enough time to discuss financial  matters.", "Example: There should be financial management training points  throughout a sailor\u2019s career.  For example, basic training, Advanced  Individual Training, reenlistment, and then annual recurring training. 7.b. Other additional assistance (N=12)", "Example: A soldier stated that the offices that provide finance  information are closed when the servicemembers get off work.  Their  hours should be longer because the soldiers\u2019 unit will not allow them  time off to go to the finance centers just to browse and acquire  general financial information.", "Example: The military credit unions should be combined into one  institution.  No more Marine, Navy, or Army Federal Credit Unions,  just one large credit union.  This would lead to more lending power  and better interest rates. 7.c. More money (N=10)", "Example: All military members should get pay raises.  The pay  increase should be significant and not just a few dollars every  paycheck.  People are dying every day for their country, so they  should get paid well.", "Example: Servicemembers, particularly in the junior enlisted ranks,  should be given more pay. 7.d. Improve timeliness/accuracy of Defense Finance and Accounting  Service (N=7)", "Example: Make the finance office provide more timely  reimbursement for vouchers.  One soldier just got back from Iraq and  said that currently, it takes the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service about 6 months to pay the voucher.", "Example: The deployment actually messes up the servicemember\u2019s  paychecks.  When starting the deployment, the addition of certain  pay and allowances and the subtraction of other allowances are  never done quickly and efficiently.  Defense Finance and Accounting  Service is always either overpaying or underpaying the Marine.   When they overpay, they take the money back in one shot, not over a  period of time. 7.e. Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board/off-limits list (N=7)", "Example: When the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board does  put a business on the off-limits list, the word is not put out and it is  never enforced.", "Example: The Navy needs to blacklist places that practice predatory  lending.  One participant, who is a legal officer in her unit, does  provide a list of places to avoid to her sailors when they check in  even though she is not allowed to do this.  She does not understand  why the Navy is allowed to tell sailors not to go to a porn shop, but is  not supposed to tell them not to go to predatory lenders.  The Navy  needs some type of list of businesses that have done questionable  things.  It does not necessarily have to be an \u201coff-limits\u201d list. 7.f. Care packages (N=6)", "Example: It is common for spouses to send care packages to soldiers  during a deployment.  The expense of shipping these packages is  significant.  In addition, they generally include items for friends of  soldiers who do not have spouses or families sending items.", "Example:  Care packages can be expensive for the family, especially  when they have to send equipment that is not supplied by the  military. 7.g. Improve Internet access during deployment (N=5)", "Example: Navy should have better Internet access on the ships.  They  could provide Internet access in the library.  Right now the junior  enlisted have to ask officers to log them on.", "Example: The Navy needs to increase the number of computers on  ships and the access to the Internet.  It is not beneficial to have  Internet-based resources if no one can access the Internet during a  deployment.  Furthermore, when the sailors are at home station, the  work computers are used for work and not for personal use.   Therefore, the sailors still cannot access information on the Financial  Readiness Campaign."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources Available to Assist Servicemembers with Financial Issues", "paragraphs": ["Several resources exist to assist servicemembers with financial issues.

In contrast, Navy personnel receive 16 hours of PFM training  during Advanced Individual Training.  The Marine Corps and the Air Force,  on the other hand, begin training servicemembers on financial issues at  their first duty stations.", "Events, such as deployment or a permanent change of station, can trigger  additional financial management training for servicemembers.  The length  of this additional training and the topics covered can vary by installation  and command.  Also, unit leadership may refer servicemembers for  financial management training or counseling if the unit command is made  aware of an individual\u2019s financial problems.
