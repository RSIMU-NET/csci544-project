These heightened responsibilities required changes to the Deepwater implementation plan to provide the assets with greater operational capabilities. To address these needs, in 2002, the Coast Guard began a multiyear acquisition program to replace or modernize its deepwater assets that is currently estimated to cost $19 to $24 billion. More recently, it began studying options for replacing or modernizing the assets more rapidly in an effort to avoid some of the costs that might be involved in keeping aging assets running for longer periods. This report addresses three questions related to this effort: (1) How has the condition of the Coast Guard's deepwater legacy assets changed during fiscal years 2000 through 2004? (2) What actions has the Coast Guard taken to maintain, upgrade, and better manage its deepwater legacy assets? and (3) What are the management challenges the Coast Guard faces in acquiring new assets, especially if a more aggressive acquisition schedule is adopted?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Available Coast Guard condition measures indicate that the condition of most Coast Guard legacy aircraft and cutters generally declined during fiscal years 2000-2004, but these measures are inadequate to capture the full extent of the decline in the condition with any precision. GAO's field visits and interviews with Coast Guard staff, as well as reviews of other evidence, showed significant problems in a variety of asset systems and equipment that are not currently captured in the Coast Guard's condition measures. The Coast Guard has already taken actions to help keep its deepwater legacy assets operational. For example, to help meet mission requirements, Coast Guard staff are performing more extensive maintenance between deployments, but even so, aircraft and cutters continue to lose mission capabilities. Responding to these continued concerns, as well as to matters raised during this review and in prior GAO reports, the Coast Guard has begun to explore additional strategies and approaches to better determine and improve the mission capabilities of its legacy assets. These actions include (1) developing a more proactive approach for prioritizing maintenance and capability enhancement projects needed on its legacy assets; (2) developing measures that more clearly demonstrate the extent to which assets' conditions affect mission capabilities; and (3) for one command, proposing a new strategy to sustain one of its oldest classes of cutters. These ongoing efforts, while promising, are too new to allow GAO to assess whether they will allow the Coast Guard to better determine and improve the mission capabilities of its legacy assets. If the Coast Guard adopts a more aggressive acquisition schedule, it will likely continue to face a number of challenges to effectively manage the Deepwater program. GAO has warned that the Coast Guard's acquisition strategy of relying on a prime contractor (\"system integrator\") to identify and deliver the assets needed carries substantial risks. GAO found that well into the contract's second year, key components for managing the program and overseeing the system integrator's performance had not been effectively implemented. While the Coast Guard has been addressing these problems--for example, putting more emphasis on competition as a means to control costs--many areas have not been fully addressed. A more aggressive acquisition schedule would only heighten the risks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard\u2019s Integrated Deepwater System (or Deepwater)  acquisition program has experienced several changes since its inception in  2002. The Deepwater program is intended to be a long-term (20-year)  replacement or modernization of certain legacy assets, many of which are  at or approaching the end of their estimated service lives. As originally  conceived, Deepwater was designed around producing aircraft and cutters  that would function in the Coast Guard\u2019s traditional at-sea roles, such as  interdicting illicit drug shipments or rescuing mariners from difficulty at  sea. The events of September 11, 2001, changed all of that. Suddenly, the  missions for these assets expanded to include a greater emphasis on ports,  waterways, and coastal security. These heightened responsibilities forced  the Coast Guard to revise its Deepwater implementation plan to provide  the replacement assets with greater operational capabilities. Further  change has come more recently with the Coast Guard asserting that its  deepwater legacy assets are \u201cfailing at an unsustainable rate\u201d and  examining options for accelerating their replacement, thereby avoiding  some of the costs that might be involved in upgrading these assets  sufficiently to keep them running for longer periods.", "These changes have created some uncertainty about how the Deepwater  program is developing. In its fiscal year 2006 budget request, the  Administration is requesting $966 million for the Deepwater program\u2014 $242 million more than Congress appropriated for the program for fiscal  year 2005. Part of this request ($239.5 million) is for maintenance and  upgrades to some deepwater legacy assets, a majority of which are  scheduled to be part of the Deepwater solution. The fiscal year 2005  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act required the  Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a revised Deepwater  implementation plan in conjunction with its fiscal year 2006 budget  request. However, with respect to pending fiscal year 2006 appropriations,  the House Appropriations Committee considered the Coast Guard\u2019s  implementation plan submission to be incomplete and recommended  reducing the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2006 Deepwater budget request of  $966 million by nearly 50 percent. In late May 2005, the Coast Guard  submitted further documentation to the committee in an effort to comply  with the act\u2019s requirements. In June 2005, the Senate Appropriations  Committee expressed concern about the lack of information concerning  the Deepwater plan in the fiscal year 2006 budget request but  recommended funding of $905.6 million for the program for fiscal year  2006.  As of early July 2005, the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2006  appropriation was still pending.", "This report, which focuses on the condition of deepwater legacy assets  and the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition and management challenges, is aimed at  providing information about some of these issues. We presented our  preliminary observations on these matters in recent testimony. This  report adds further details on the condition of the assets, as well as  updated information on Coast Guard initiatives to better sustain these  assets until they are replaced or upgraded. Specifically, our report  addresses three issues related to these considerations:    How has the condition of the Coast Guard\u2019s deepwater legacy assets  changed during fiscal years 2000 through 2004?", "What actions has the Coast Guard taken to maintain, upgrade, and better  manage its deepwater legacy assets?", "What are the management challenges the Coast Guard faces in acquiring  new assets, especially if a more aggressive acquisition schedule is  adopted?", "To address these objectives, we analyzed data and condition measures  used by the Coast Guard for determining deepwater legacy assets\u2019  condition, reviewed Coast Guard actions to maintain and upgrade legacy  assets and their systems, and met with operations and maintenance staff  at U.S. Coast Guard headquarters and other Coast Guard facilities selected  to provide coverage of each type of deepwater legacy aircraft and each  class of deepwater legacy cutter. In addition, we met with Deepwater  program staff, performance monitors, and contractor staff and reviewed  documentation to verify the improvements the Coast Guard is making in  its management of the Deepwater acquisition. We conducted our work  between July 2004 and June 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  governmental auditing standards. Appendix I describes our objectives,  scope, and methodology in greater detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security within the  Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard is responsible for  homeland and nonhomeland security missions, including ensuring security  in ports and waterways and along coastlines, conducting search and  rescue missions, interdicting drug shipments and illegal aliens, enforcing  fisheries laws, and responding to reports of pollution. The deepwater fleet,  which consists of 186 aircraft and 88 cutters of various sizes and  capabilities, plays a critical role in all of these missions. As shown in table  1, the fleet includes fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and cutters of varying  lengths.", "Some Coast Guard deepwater cutters were built in the 1960s.  Notwithstanding extensive overhauls and other upgrades, a number of the  cutters are nearing the end of their estimated service lives. Similarly, while  a number of the deepwater legacy aircraft have received upgrades in  engines, operating systems, and sensor equipment since they were  originally built, they too have limitations in their operating capabilities.", "In 1996, the Coast Guard began developing what came to be known as the  Integrated Deepwater System (IDS) acquisition program as its major effort  to replace or modernize these aircraft and cutters. This Deepwater  program is designed to replace some assets\u2014such as deteriorating  cutters\u2014with new cutters and upgrade other assets\u2014such as some types  of helicopters\u2014so they can meet new performance requirements.", "The Deepwater program represents a unique approach to a major  acquisition in that the Coast Guard is relying on a prime contractor\u2014the  system integrator\u2014to identify and deliver the assets needed to meet a set  of mission requirements the Coast Guard has specified. In 2002, the Coast  Guard awarded a contract to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS) as  the system integrator for the Deepwater program. ICGS has two main  subcontractors\u2014Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman\u2014that in turn  contract with other subcontractors. Rather than using the traditional  approach of replacing classes of ships or aircraft through a series of  individual acquisitions, the Coast Guard chose to employ a \u201csystem of  systems\u201d acquisition strategy that would replace its deteriorating  deepwater assets with a single, integrated package of new or modernized  assets. This system-of-systems approach is designed to provide an  improved, integrated system of aircraft, cutters, and unmanned aerial  vehicles to be linked effectively through systems that provide command,  control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance,  reconnaissance, and supporting logistics. The Deepwater program\u2019s three  overarching goals are to maximize operational effectiveness, minimize  total ownership cost, and satisfy the customer\u2014the operational  commanders, aircraft pilots, cutter crews, maintenance personnel, and  others who will use the assets.", "The revised Deepwater schedule calls for acquisition of new assets under  the Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater program to occur over an approximately 20- year period at an estimated cost of $19 billion to $24 billion. By 2007, for  example, the Coast Guard is to receive the first 418-foot National Security  Cutter, which will have the capability to conduct military missions related  to homeland security. Current plans call for 6 to 8 of these cutters to  replace the 12 existing 378-foot cutters. However, in order to carry out its  mission effectively, the Coast Guard will also need to keep all of the legacy  assets operational until they can be replaced or upgraded.", "We have been reviewing the Deepwater program for several years,  pointing out difficulties and expressing concern over a number of facets of  the program. In our 2001 report, we identified several areas of risk for  Deepwater. First, the Coast Guard faced potential risk in the overall  management and day-to-day administration of the contract. At the time, we  reported on the major challenges such as developing and implementing  plans for establishing effective human capital practices, having key  management and oversight processes and procedures in place, and  tracking data to measure system integrator performance. In addition, we  expressed concerns about the potential lack of competition during the  program\u2019s later years and the reliance on a single system integrator for  procuring the Deepwater assets. We also reported there was little evidence  that the Coast Guard had analyzed whether the approach carried any  inherent risks for ensuring the best value to the government and, if so,  what to do about them.", "We reviewed the program again in 2004 and found many of the same  concerns. Specifically, we reported that key components needed to  manage the program and oversee the system integrator\u2019s performance had  not been effectively implemented. The Coast Guard\u2019s primary tool for  overseeing the system integrator, the integrated product teams (IPTs)  were struggling to effectively collaborate and accomplish their missions  because of changing membership, understaffing, insufficient training, and  inadequate communication among members. Also, the Coast Guard had  not adequately addressed the frequent turnover of personnel in the  program and the transition from existing assets to those assets that will be  part of the Deepwater program moving forward. Further, the Coast  Guard\u2019s assessment of the system integrator\u2019s performance in the first year  of the contract lacked rigor, and the factors that formed the basis for the  award fee determination were supported only by subjective performance  monitor comments and not by quantifiable measures. This resulted in the  system integrator receiving a high performance rating and an award fee of  $4.0 million out of a maximum of $4.6 million despite documented  problems in schedule, performance, cost controls, and contract  administration.", "At the time of our March 2004 report, the Coast Guard had begun to  develop models to measure the extent to which Deepwater was achieving  operational effectiveness and reduced total ownership cost, but it had not  made a decision as to which specific suite of models would be used.  Further, Coast Guard officials were not able to project a time frame for  when the Coast Guard would be able to hold the contractor accountable  for progress toward the goals of maximizing operational effectiveness,  minimizing total ownership cost, and customer satisfaction. Furthermore,  the Coast Guard had not measured the extent of competition among  suppliers of Deepwater assets or held the system integrator accountable  for taking steps to achieve competition. The Coast Guard\u2019s lack of  progress on these issues has contributed to our concerns about the Coast  Guard\u2019s ability to rely on competition as a means to control future  programmatic costs.", "Finally, we found that the Coast Guard had not updated the Deepwater  integrated acquisition schedule despite numerous changes, making it  difficult to determine the degree to which the program was on track with  its original plan. In response to these concerns, we made a number of  recommendations to improve Deepwater management and oversight of the  system integrator. The Coast Guard welcomed our observations and  concurred with our recommendations and has begun to take actions to  address them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legacy Assets Show Declining Condition, but Measures Are Imprecise and Fail to Capture Impact on Mission Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard condition measures show that the condition of most  deepwater legacy assets generally declined between 2000 and 2004, but the  Coast Guard\u2019s available measures are inadequate to capture the full extent  of the decline in the condition of deepwater assets with any degree of  precision and are insufficient for determining the impact on mission  capabilities. Further, other evidence we gathered, such as information  from discussions with maintenance and operations personnel, points to  conditions that may be more severe than the available measures indicate.  The Coast Guard acknowledges that it needs better condition measures,  but it has not yet finalized or implemented such measures. The Coast  Guard anticipates having the new measures finalized by the end of 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard\u2019s Condition Measures Show General Decline in Condition of Deepwater Assets, with Some Fluctuations", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 2000 through 2004, the Coast Guard\u2019s various condition  measures showed a general decline, although there were year-to-year  fluctuations (see table 2). For deepwater legacy aircraft, a key summary  measure of the condition\u2014the availability index (the percentage of time  aircraft are available to perform their missions)\u2014showed that except for  the HU-25 medium-range surveillance aircraft, the assets continued to  perform close to or above fleet availability standards over the 5-year  period. In contrast, other condition measures for aircraft, such as cost per  flight hour and labor hours per flight hour, generally reflected some  deterioration. For cutters, a key summary measure of condition\u2014percent  of time free of major casualties\u2014fluctuated but generally remained well  below target levels. The number of major casualties generally rose from  fiscal years 2000 through 2003 and then dropped slightly in fiscal year  2004. (Appendix II provides further details on condition measures for  each of the deepwater legacy aircraft and cutters.)", "Another, albeit less direct, measure of an asset\u2019s condition is deferred  maintenance\u2014the amount of scheduled maintenance on an asset that  must be postponed in order to pay for unscheduled repairs. Such deferrals  can occur when the Coast Guard does not have enough money to absorb  unexpected maintenance expenditures and still perform all of its  scheduled maintenance, thus creating a backlog. For example, in spring  2004, while on a counterdrug mission, the 210-foot cutter Active  experienced problems in the condition of its flight deck that were to be  corrected during its scheduled depot-level maintenance. However,  because of a shortage of maintenance funds, the maintenance was  deferred and the flight deck was not repaired. As a result, the cutter lost all  shipboard helicopter capability, significantly degrading mission readiness.", "As table 3 shows, deferred maintenance does not show a clear pattern  across all classes of deepwater legacy assets. For the deepwater legacy  aircraft, the overall amount of estimated deferred maintenance increased  each year during fiscal years 2002 through 2004, from $12.3 million to  about $24.6 million. However, most of the increase came for one type of  asset, the HH-60 helicopter, and the increase came mainly from deferring  maintenance past the 48-month interval requirement\u2014thereby increasing  the scheduled maintenance workload\u2014and not from having to divert  money to deal with unscheduled maintenance. For the deepwater cutters,  the amount of estimated deferred maintenance increased from fiscal year  2002 to 2003, but then it dropped significantly in fiscal year 2004. The  decrease in fiscal year 2004 came mainly because the Coast Guard  received supplemental funding allowing it to address both scheduled and  unscheduled maintenance. Thus, the drop in the estimate of deferred  maintenance costs for fiscal year 2004 is not necessarily an indicator that  the condition of the legacy assets was improving; it could be the result of  the Coast Guard having more money to address the maintenance needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Condition Measures Not Sufficiently Robust to Link Condition with Impact on Mission Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["At the time we began our work, the Coast Guard\u2019s measures generated  some limited information on the condition of its legacy assets, but the  measures were not sufficiently robust to link the assets\u2019 declining  condition to degradation in mission capabilities or performance. As a  result, the picture that emerges regarding the condition of the deepwater  legacy assets based on current Coast Guard condition measures should be  viewed with some caution. While there is no systematic, quantitative  evidence sufficient to demonstrate that deepwater legacy assets are  \u201cfailing at an unsustainable rate,\u201d as the Coast Guard has asserted, this  does not mean the assets are in good condition or have been performing  their missions safely, reliably, and at levels that meet or exceed Coast  Guard standards. We identified two factors that need to be considered to  put these condition measures into proper context.", "The first factor deals with limitations in the measures themselves. Simply  put, the Coast Guard\u2019s measures of asset condition do not fully capture the  extent of the problems. As such, they may understate the decline in the  legacy assets\u2019 condition. More specifically, the Coast Guard measures we  assessed focus on events, such as equipment casualties or flight mishaps,  but do not measure the extent to which these and other incidents degrade  mission capabilities. The following is an example in which Coast Guard  measures we assessed are not sufficiently robust to systematically capture  degradation in mission capabilities:    The 378-foot cutter Jarvis recently experienced a failure in one of its  two main gas turbines shortly after embarking on a living marine  resources and search and rescue mission. While Jarvis was able to  accomplish its given mission, albeit at reduced speed, this casualty  rendered the cutter unable to respond to any emergency request it  might have received\u2014but did not in this case\u2014to undertake a mission  requiring higher speeds, such as drug interdiction. The Coast Guard  condition measures are not robust enough to capture these distinctions  in mission capability.", "The second factor that needs to be kept in mind is the compelling nature  of the other evidence we gathered outside of the Coast Guard\u2019s condition  measures. This evidence, gleaned from information collected during our  site visits and discussions with maintenance personnel, indicated  deteriorating and obsolete systems and equipment as a major cause of the  reduction in mission capabilities for a number of deepwater legacy aircraft  and cutters. Such problems, however, are not captured by the Coast  Guard\u2019s condition measures. One example of this involves the HH-65  short-range recovery helicopter. While this helicopter consistently  exceeded availability standards established by the Coast Guard over the   5-year period we examined, it is currently operating with engines that have  become increasingly subject to power failures, which may potentially  render the fleet unable to meet mission requirements. As a result, Coast  Guard pilots employ a number of work-arounds, such as dumping fuel or  occasionally leaving the rescue swimmer on scene if the load becomes too  heavy. Further, because of increasing safety and reliability problems, the  Coast Guard has also implemented a number of operational restrictions\u2014 such as not allowing the helicopter to land on helipads\u2014to safeguard crew  and passengers and prevent mishaps until all of the fleet\u2019s engines can be  replaced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions to Better Manage Legacy Assets Are Under Way, but Effects Will Not Be Known for Some Time", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has already undertaken two main types of actions to  keep its legacy assets operational: developing a compendium of  information for making decisions regarding maintenance and upgrades  needed, and performing increasingly more maintenance on these assets  between deployments. These efforts are likely helping to prevent a more  rapid decline in the condition of the assets, but the condition of these  assets has nonetheless generally continued to worsen. In response to both  the continued decline in the condition of its legacy assets, as well as to  various observations we have made to the Coast Guard about its need to  develop more objective information on mission capability needs and more  precise condition measures, the Coast Guard has begun to undertake  additional efforts. These additional efforts include developing a  knowledge-based model to provide more objective data on where to best  spend budget dollars to achieve the greatest enhancements in mission  capabilities, improving the condition measures it uses to more clearly  quantify the impact declining conditions have on mission capabilities, and,  at the Pacific Area Command, applying new business rules and strategies  to better sustain the 378-foot high-endurance cutters through 2016.

Among other things, this  compendium consolidates information needed to make planning and  budgeting decisions regarding maintenance and upgrades to sustain legacy  assets. Its purpose is to serve as a tool for senior Coast Guard  management in setting priorities and planning budgets. From this strategic  document, the Coast Guard has identified a number of upgrades to  improve the capabilities of the deepwater legacy aircraft and cutters. The  most recent compendium (for fiscal year 2006) lists more than $1 billion  worth of upgrades to the deepwater legacy assets. The planned upgrades  identified in the compendium that have been approved and received initial  funding account for an estimated $856 million the Coast Guard anticipates  it will need to complete those projects. The approved upgrades for  deepwater legacy assets are shown in table 4.", "Among the projects already begun is the re-engining of the HH-65  helicopters to address safety and reliability concerns. The Coast Guard is  also upgrading several other aviation systems in an effort to improve  aircraft capabilities. Enhancements are also planned for certain classes of  deepwater cutters. For example, during fiscal year 2005, the Coast Guard  is beginning a maintenance effectiveness project on the 210-foot and   270-foot cutters. This project includes replacing major engineering  subsystems with the goal of extending the cutters\u2019 service lives until their  replacement by the Offshore Patrol Cutter. Of the $856 million total  estimated costs needed for the planned upgrades to the deepwater legacy  assets listed above, $215 million has been allocated through fiscal year  2005, and the Coast Guard has requested another $217.3 million in its fiscal  year 2006 budget.

For example, due to the aging main landing gear on the  HH-65 helicopter, Coast Guard official stated that maintenance crews  spend extensive time servicing, troubleshooting and fixing them in pre- deployment maintenance. Comparable accounts were given by personnel  working on cutters. For example, officers of the 270-foot cutter Northland  told us that because of dated equipment and the deteriorating condition of  its piping and other subsystems, crew members have to spend increasingly  more time and resources while in port to prepare for their next  deployment. While we could not verify these increases in time and  resources because the Coast Guard does not capture data on these  additional maintenance efforts, the need for increasing amounts of  maintenance was a message we consistently heard from the operations  and maintenance personnel with whom we met.", "Such efforts are likely helping to prevent a more rapid decline in the  condition of these deepwater legacy assets, but it is important to note that  even with the increasing amounts of maintenance, these assets are still  losing mission capabilities because of deteriorating equipment and system  failures. For example, in fiscal year 2004, the 378-foot cutter Chase lost   98 counterdrug mission days because of a number of patrol-ending  casualties\u2014including the loss of ability to raise and lower boats and run  major electrical equipment\u2014requiring $1.2 million in emergency  maintenance.

We found  this was an important step for the Coast Guard to take because it links  legacy asset investments to asset capabilities, mission priorities, and goals  so that the Coast Guard can better decide how limited budget dollars  should be spent. The Coast Guard has recently begun to apply the  principles behind such a strategy to (1) better prioritize the projects  needed to upgrade legacy assets that will be part of the Deepwater  program and (2) obtain the greatest overall mix of capabilities for its  assets within its budget in order to maximize mission performance. The  tool it is developing is called the Capital Asset Management Strategy  (CAMS).", "CAMS, once fully implemented, is expected to help the Coast Guard to  better manage its assets by linking funding decisions to asset condition.  Unlike the Coast Guard\u2019s current compendium, CAMS is designed to  provide analyses on the capability trade-offs for upgrades and  maintenance projects across asset classes, thereby allowing the Coast  Guard to determine which combination of projects will provide the most  capability for the dollars invested. For example, when Coast Guard  officials are trying to decide among potential project upgrades such as an  HC-130 weather radar replacement, an HH-65 sliding cabin door  replacement, or a 110-foot patrol boat fin stabilizer replacement, CAMS,  once fully implemented, could provide the officials with a recommended  mix of project upgrades that would achieve the greatest capability  enhancements based on the available budget.", "CAMS analyses are to be based on legacy asset condition and readiness  data, asset retirement and replacement timelines, asset degradation  estimates, project production rates, cost data, and mission utility rankings.  Mission utility rankings will grade an asset\u2019s importance to specific  missions, such as search and rescue or counterdrug operations. Rankings  may also be assigned to an asset\u2019s critical subsystems or may be altered  based on an asset\u2019s geographic location. For example, a 378-foot cutter  may be critical to the success of fisheries patrols in the Pacific but may not  be as important for alien/migrant interdiction operations in the Caribbean.  However, according to Coast Guard headquarters officials, the Coast  Guard remains cautious about employing such a strategy because an  investment strategy of this nature could lead to cutters that are no longer  multmission capable and are unable to respond to an emergency due to  reduced capabilities. In addition, the Coast Guard plans to rank its  missions within CAMS based on their relative importance. Each of these  elements is to form the basis for recommendations regarding which  combination of upgrade and maintenance projects will provide the  greatest enhancements to fleet capabilities.", "According to Coast Guard staff, CAMS recommendations are not a  replacement for the existing budget development process, but rather are  to augment and make more consistent the information currently provided  to decision makers. Because the recommendations are to be based, in part,  on user assumptions, CAMS recommendations are to be reviewed by  several internal Coast Guard officials before any final funding requests are  made. Further, in order to prevent user \u201cgaming\u201d\u2014making assumptions in  such a way as to ensure a positive recommendation or outcome for a  particular project\u2014the Coast Guard is developing a series of job aids,  manuals, and training courses to ensure data integrity and consistency.", "Coast Guard officials expect to have CAMS fully implemented by  September 2005 and intend to use it while developing the Coast Guard\u2019s  fiscal year 2008 budget submission.

On the basis of our inquiries  and a series of discussions we held with cognizant Coast Guard officials,  the Coast Guard has begun developing improved measures to more  accurately capture data on the extent to which its deepwater legacy assets  are degraded in their mission capabilities. However, because these  measures have not been finalized or fully implemented, we were unable to  assess their effectiveness.

As part  of this measure, the Coast Guard is developing mission criticality codes,  which would rank the degree of importance of each piece of a cutter\u2019s  equipment to each possible mission that the cutter could perform. These  codes would then be linked to electronic casualty reports for each cutter,  which would provide the cutter engineers and operators with information  on the impact that the equipment casualties would have on each possible  mission. This casualty report/mission criticality linkage will then be  factored into the calculation of the percent of time fully mission capable  measure for each cutter class and mission type. Coast Guard officials  could then review this measure to determine, for example, the degree of  capability that its 270-foot medium endurance cutter fleet has to conduct  search and rescue missions at any given time. We agree that measures like  this are needed\u2014and as soon as possible.", "According to Coast Guard officials, while the availability index will remain  the Coast Guard\u2019s primary measure for aircraft condition and operational  readiness, the Coast Guard is working to improve its dispatch reliability  index measure, which provides causal information on delayed, aborted, or  canceled missions. The Coast Guard can use the dispatch reliability  index\u2014in conjunction with data captured by unit-level and depot-level  maintenance staff and entered into the Coast Guard\u2019s Electronic Aircraft  Logbook and Aviation Logistics Management Information System,  respectively\u2014to determine which components and systems are failing  most frequently and thus causing degradation in aircraft availability and  mission performance.

Pacific Area officials have recognized that a  different approach to maintaining and sustaining legacy cutters may be  needed since they are dependent on 378-foot cutters for meeting missions,  such as defense operations and fisheries patrols. As a first step, Pacific  Area officials have undertaken an initiative applying what they refer to as  \u201cnew business rules and strategies\u201d to better maintain the 378-foot high- endurance cutters through 2016, when they are scheduled to be fully  replaced by National Security Cutters. Under the original Deepwater  proposal, the final 378-foot cutter was to be decommissioned in 2013, but  by 2005, that date had slipped to 2016. To help keep these cutters running  through this date, Pacific Area officials are applying such rules and  strategies as (1) ensuring that operations and maintenance staffs work  closely together to determine priorities, (2) recognizing that maintaining  or enhancing cutter capabilities will involve trade-off determinations, and  (3) accepting the proposition that with limited funding not all cutters will  be fully capable to perform all types of missions as they near the end of  their useful lives. Pacific Area officials believe that in combination, these  rules and strategies will result in more cost-effective maintenance and  resource allocation decisions\u2014recognizing that difficult decisions will still  have to be made to balance maintenance and operations.  However,  according to Coast Guard headquarters officials, if such strategies are  employed, careful planning must occur to avoid placing a cutter in an  operational emergency where it is incapable of adequately responding.", "One example of the bridging strategies Pacific Area officials are exploring  is the development of what Pacific Area officials refer to as a \u201cclass within  a class\u201d approach. Under this strategy, the individual cutters within the  378-foot high-endurance cutter fleet would be designated to perform  specific mission types based on an assessment of their condition and  mission capabilities. Cutters possessing full mission capabilities could be  assigned to the more demanding defensive operations, while cutters in  poorer condition and less than fully capable would be assigned to less  demanding missions, such as fisheries enforcement. According to Pacific  Area officials, this strategy is designed to more effectively spend the  maintenance funds available for the 378-foot cutters, since current funding  levels for the 378-foot cutters make it very difficult for Pacific Area to  maintain all 10 of its 378-foot cutters as fully mission capable.", "Pacific Area Command\u2019s new initiative has the potential for assisting the  Coast Guard in making more informed choices regarding the best use of  their resources, but according to Pacific Area officials, the approach will  likely require that the Coast Guard allocate additional maintenance funds.  Further, because the approach has not been fully implemented, it is too  soon to tell whether the approach will provide the results intended. Coast  Guard headquarters officials stated that before such a strategy can be  implemented further analysis is required, to include: (1) determining the  estimated savings associated with creating multiple 378-foot cutter  classes; (2) analyzing other cost saving concepts, such as  decommissioning cutters or rotating crews; (3) obtaining further  information on the effect on Coast Guard mission readiness; and   (4) assessing the operational risk associated with operating cutters that  are no longer multimission capable.

This analysis is intended to  help determine what gaps exist between needed skills and existing skills  and to develop a plan to bridge these gaps. The Coast Guard has also taken  some short-term steps to improve Deepwater program staffing, hiring  contractors to assist with program support functions, shifting some  positions from military to civilian to mitigate turnover risk, and identifying  hard-to-fill positions and developing recruitment plans specifically for  them.

As of January 2005, 244 positions were assigned to the program, with   206 of these filled, resulting in a 16 percent vacancy rate. A year ago,   209 staff were assigned to the program. Further, the new human capital  plan removes a performance goal that measured the percentage of billets  filled at any given time. Coast Guard officials stated that the prior plan\u2019s  goal of a 95 percent or higher fill rate was unduly optimistic and was a  poor measure of the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to meet its hiring goals. For  example, billets for military personnel who plan to rotate into the program  in the summer are created at the beginning of the budget year, leading the  measure to count those positions as vacant from the beginning of the  budget year until summer. Other performance measures that were  included in the prior plan to measure progress in human capital issues  have also been removed. For example, to help ensure that incoming  personnel received acquisition training and on-the-job training, a billet was  included in the prior plan to serve as a floating training position that  replacement personnel could use for a year before the departure of  military incumbents. The Coast Guard did not fund this position, and the  new plan removes the billet. According to the Coast Guard, these  measures were removed because the revised Deepwater plan focuses on  the long-range strategic human capital issues associated with the  execution of the acquisition over the entire period, whereas the prior plan  had a short-term operational focus.

Recent assessments by  Coast Guard performance monitors show this to be an area of concern.  Coast Guard officials have expressed concern about whether the system  integrator is appropriately considering human capital in systems  engineering decisions. The system integrator is required to develop a  workforce management plan for Deepwater, as well as \u201chuman factors  engineering\u201d plans for each Deepwater asset and for the overall system of  systems. The Coast Guard rejected the contractor\u2019s workforce  management plan and several of the proposed human factors engineering  plans as being inadequate. The rejections were due, in part, to the lack of  an established and integrated system-level engineering approach that  shows how issues relating to human capabilities and limitations of actually  performing with the system will be approached. One performance monitor  noted that as of late 2004, requirements for staffing and training of  maintenance facilities and organizations had yet to be determined.

In addition to providing for greater  synergies between air, sea, sensor and communications assets and  equipment, the system-of-systems approach was to yield cost savings  when compared with a traditional acquisition approach. Although the  Coast Guard initially established a cost baseline consistent with the  program management plan\u2019s approach, the Coast Guard has not updated it  to reflect changes made to the system integrator\u2019s cost estimate baseline,  and therefore is not being used to evaluate the contractor\u2019s progress in  holding down total ownership cost. As a result, the cost baseline being  used to measure total ownership cost is not the Coast Guard\u2019s, but rather  is the system integrator\u2019s own cost estimate.

Although the  Deepwater program has undergone a number of alterations since the  contract was awarded in 2002, the Coast Guard has not studied whether  the system-of-systems approach is still more cost effective as opposed to a  traditional acquisition approach.

Some of these problems, such as those on the  378-foot cutters, are included in the compendium the Coast Guard uses to  set sustainment priorities and plan budgets, but the Coast Guard has not  allocated funds because the problems pertain to assets that are among the  first to be replaced.

Table 21 provides a summary of the key maintenance  measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustainment Issues", "paragraphs": ["The average age of the patrol boats is 16.4 years. A number of the 110-foot  patrol boats have experienced significant hull deterioration. To combat  these corrosion problems and add other capabilities to the 110-foot patrol  boats, the Coast Guard developed the Hull Sustainment Project (HSP) and  the 123-foot patrol boat conversion program.", "The HSP was implemented to replace all deteriorated hull plates and  structural members. The selected patrol boats were gutted, sandblasted,  and thoroughly inspected, and all metal wasted beyond 15 percent was  renewed. As of early June 2005, 9 of the original 49 110-foot patrol boats  had completed the HSP. The Coast Guard believes that all remaining   110-foot patrol boats that have not had their hulls strengthened or  replaced will eventually require such work. The Coast Guard is currently  preparing a business case analysis in order to use $49.2 million in fiscal  year 2005 supplemental appropriations for a 110-foot patrol boat MEP.  This project would include hull sustainment work.  In addition to the HSP, 8 patrol boats deemed to be among those in the  worst condition were placed in the 123-foot conversion program. The  Coast Guard had the option to place an additional 4 patrol boats (for a  total of 12) in the 123-foot conversion program but has decided not to  exercise this option. This program was implemented to renew the  deteriorated hull structure and to add additional capability. Among the  expected capability improvements are:   enhanced and improved command, control, communications,  computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities;    stern launch/recovery capability for the Short Range Prosecutor; renovation of some berthing areas, including relocation of aft berthing  to a location forward and nonadjacent to the engine room; and   renewing the pilot house to include a 360-degree bridge.", "As of early June 2005, 7 of the 8 patrol boats have completed the  conversion, and 5 converted patrol boats are operational (Matagorda,  Metompkin, Padre, Attu, and Vashon, with all patrol boats currently  under operating restrictions). The first patrol boat to come out of the  conversion process, the Matagorda, was delivered to the Coast Guard in  March 2004 but experienced a number of problems that prevented it from  becoming operational until February 2005. Specifically, upon delivery, the  Coast Guard identified several discrepancies with the original  performance specifications. One such discrepancy was the inability of the  patrol boat to simultaneously launch or recover the short-range prosecutor  while towing another vessel. In September 2004, Matagorda experienced  hull buckling, and repairs were completed in December 2004. However,  while en route from the shipyard to Key West, Florida, Matagorda  encountered a storm, causing damage to the primary radar system and  new cracks in the hull. These problems were resolved, and Matagorda  began patrols in early February 2005. Additionally, the contractor that  performed the work is applying lessons learned from the Matagorda  conversion to the other patrol boats still undergoing conversion. Further,  the contractor has increased the number of quality assurance personnel  from one to four to improve oversight of the conversion process.", "The Coast Guard top 10 list mentions several maintenance concerns, in  addition to hull corrosion, that have negatively affected the condition of  the 110-foot patrol boats. These include difficulties in obtaining parts for  the fin stabilizer system, steering spaces holding moisture (which leads to  rust and corrosion), and exhaust piping leaks. In addition, the Coast Guard  has stated that mechanical and electrical subsystems need to be upgraded  or replaced if the patrol boats are to operate for another 10 to 15 years,  even the newly converted 123-foot patrol boats."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Contact", "paragraphs": ["Margaret Wrightson, Director (415) 904-2200."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgment", "paragraphs": ["Steven Calvo, Christopher Conrad, Adam Couvillion, Michele Fejfar,  Geoffrey Hamilton, Julie Leetch, Michele Mackin, Stan Stenersen, and  Linda Kay Willard."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Related Products", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard\u2019s Acquisition Management: Deepwater Project\u2019s  Justification and Affordability Need to Be Addressed More Thoroughly,  GAO/RCED-99-6 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 26, 1998)", "Coast Guard: Budget Challenges for 2001 and Beyond,   GAO/T-RCED-00-103 (Washington, D.C.: March 15, 2000)", "Coast Guard: Progress Being Made on Deepwater Project, but Risks  Remain, GAO-01-564 (Washington, D.C.: May 2, 2001)", "Coast Guard: Actions Needed to Mitigate Deepwater Project Risks,   GAO-01-659T (Washington, D.C.: May 3, 2001)", "Coast Guard: Strategy Needed for Setting and Monitoring Levels of  Effort for All Missions, GAO-03-155 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 12, 2002)", "Coast Guard: Comprehensive Blueprint Needed to Balance and Monitor  Resource Use and Measure Performance for All Missions, GAO-03-544T  (Washington, D.C.: March 12, 2003)", "Contract Management: Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater Program Needs  Increased Attention to Management and Contractor Oversight,  GAO-04-380 (Washington, D.C.: March 9, 2004)", "Coast Guard: Replacement of HH-65 Helicopter Engine, GAO-04-595  (Washington, D.C.: March 24, 2004)", "Coast Guard: Key Management and Budget Challenges for Fiscal Year  2005 and Beyond, GAO-04-636T (Washington, D.C.: April 7, 2004)", "Coast Guard: Deepwater Program Acquisition Schedule Update Needed,  GAO-04-695 (Washington, D.C.: June 14, 2004)", "Coast Guard: Observations and Agency Priorities in Fiscal Year 2006  Budget Request, GAO-05-364T (Washington, D.C.: March 17, 2005)", "Coast Guard: Preliminary Observations on the Condition of Deepwater  Legacy Assets and Acquisition Management Challenges, GAO-05-307T  (Washington, D.C.: April 20, 2005)", "Coast Guard: Preliminary Observations on the Condition of Deepwater  Legacy Assets and Acquisition Management Challenges, GAO-05-651T  (Washington, D.C.: June 21, 2005)"], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
