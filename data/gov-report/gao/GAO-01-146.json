Immigration services, which involve regulating  permanent and temporary immigration to the United States, include  granting legal permanent residence status, nonimmigrant status (e.g.,  tourists and students), and naturalization. Corporate services include  records management, financial management, personnel management, and  inventory management support for INS activities.", "INS' IT assets play a significant role in (1) receiving and processing  naturalization and other benefit applications, (2) processing immigrants  and nonimmigrants entering and leaving the United States, and  (3) identifying and removing people who have no lawful immigration status  in the United States. For example, the Computer-Linked Application  Information Management System (CLAIMS 4) is a centralized case  management tracking system, that offers support for a variety of tasks  associated with processing and adjudicating naturalization benefits.

For  example, INS obligated $14.5 million in fiscal year 2000 to continue  development of CLAIMS 4, which supports the processing of applications  and petitions for immigrant benefits and is intended to fully replace  CLAIMS 3. In addition, INS obligated about $18 million in fiscal year 2000 to  further deploy its Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), which  includes the deployment of intelligent computer aided detection systems,  unattended ground sensors, and fixed cameras along the northern and  southern borders to provide around-the-clock visual coverage of the  border.

Further, LMI noted  that while INS' System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) manual provides a  good model for systems development projects, OIRM did not consistently  follow it, often bypassing key SDLC phases.", "Similarly, in July 1999, the Justice Inspector General (IG) reported that  (1) estimated completion dates for some INS IT projects had been delayed  without explanation for the delays, (2) project costs continued to spiral  upward with no justification for how funds are spent, and (3) projects were  nearing completion with no assurance that they would meet performance  and functional requirements.", "Recognizing the need to address these weaknesses, INS established an  Operational Assessment Team to analyze reported weaknesses and  recommend specific actions to address them. The Operational Assessment  Team validated the deficiencies identified in the LMI and Justice IG reports  and identified additional ones. For example, the team found that system  requirements were not consistently collected, recorded, documented,  tracked, and controlled. To illustrate, of 105 projects reviewed by the team,  fewer than 50 percent had documented requirements and most of the  requirements that had been documented were not current.", "Further, in August 2000, we reported that INS did not have an enterprise  architecture to guide the development and evolution of its information  systems.

It is required by the Clinger-Cohen Act and is  a recognized practice of successful public and private sector organizations.  INS had initiated some limited efforts to document its current architecture,  but it had not yet begun developing a target architecture or a plan to move  from the current to the target environment. Moreover, INS had not yet  established the management structure and controls to develop the  architecture.

In particular, the Clinger-Cohen Act  requires that the head of each agency implement a process for maximizing  the value of the agency's IT investments and for assessing and managing  the risks of its acquisitions.

These  maturity stages represent steps toward achieving stable and mature  investment management processes. As agencies advance through the  model's stages, their capability to manage IT increases. Each stage builds  upon the lower stages and enhances the organization's ability to manage its  investments. With the exception of the first stage, each maturity stage is  composed of critical processes that must be implemented and  institutionalized for the organization to satisfy the requirements of that  stage. These critical processes are further broken down into key practices  that describe the types of activities that an agency should be engaged in to  successfully implement each critical process. An organization that has  these critical processes in place is in a better position to successfully invest  in IT.

As  part of the ITIM assessment method, INS conducted a self-assessment of its  IT investment management activities using the ITIM framework. In its self- assessment, INS indicated whether it executed each of the key practices in  stages two through five. INS asserted that it executed many of the key  practices within stages two and three but only four key practices in all of  stages four and five.

In addition, while INS indicated that it has  adequate resources to develop complete portfolio selection criteria, it has  not designated a working group to create and modify the criteria.
