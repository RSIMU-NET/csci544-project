FDA also has broad responsibilities for postmarket surveillance of devices, including oversight of recalls. A recall involves the correction or removal of a product from the market and is an important remedial action that can mitigate the risks associated with a defective or unsafe medical device. In recent years, GAO has identified a wide variety of concerns related to FDA's ability to fulfill its mission of protecting the public health and added FDA's oversight of medical products, including devices, to its list of high-risk areas. This statement provides an update on FDA's actions in response to a recommendation made in GAO's report, Medical Devices: FDA Should Take Steps to Ensure That High-Risk Device Types Are Approved through the Most Stringent Premarket Review Process ( GAO-09-190 , January 15, 2009).

High-risk devices include those which are implantable or life sustaining. In 2009, GAO recommended that FDA expeditiously take steps to issue regulations for the device types classified as high risk that are currently allowed to enter the market via the 510(k) process. Since then, FDA has set strategic goals to address these device types, but has issued a final rule regarding the classification of only one device type. As of April 1, 2011, FDA's action on the 26 remaining types of high-risk devices was incomplete. Thus, these types of devices--such as automated external defibrillators and implantable hip joints--can still enter the U.S. market through the less stringent 510(k) process. GAO found that, since its report was issued in January 2009, FDA has cleared at least 67 510(k) submissions that fall within these high-risk device types. FDA has taken some additional steps to enhance premarket device safety since GAO's 2009 report was issued--for example, it commissioned the Institute of Medicine to conduct an independent review of the premarket review process--but it is too early to tell whether any forthcoming changes will enhance public health. GAO's preliminary analysis shows that, from 2005 through 2009, firms initiated 3,510 voluntary medical device recalls, an average of just over 700 per year. Although FDA maintains extensive information on each recall, it has not been routinely analyzing recall data that would allow it to explain trends in recalls over time, thus missing an opportunity to proactively identify and address the risks presented by unsafe devices. GAO's preliminary work also identified several gaps in the medical device recall process that limited recalling firms' and FDA's abilities to ensure that the highest-risk recalls were being implemented in an effective and timely manner. GAO found that firms frequently were unable to correct or remove all devices subject to the highest-risk recalls. GAO's preliminary findings indicate that FDA lacks clear guidance for overseeing recalls which has led to inconsistencies in FDA's assessments of whether individual recalls were implemented effectively. Consequently, FDA officials examining similar situations sometimes reached opposite conclusions regarding whether recalls were effective. In addition, FDA had not established thresholds for assessing whether firms effectively completed recalls by correcting or removing a sufficient number of recalled devices. Further, GAO determined that FDA's decisions to terminate completed recalls--that is assess whether firms had taken sufficient actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the problems that led to the recalls--were frequently not made within its prescribed time frames. Finally, GAO found that FDA did not document its justification for terminating recalls. Taken together, GAO's preliminary work suggests that the combined effect of these gaps may increase the risk that unsafe medical devices could remain on the market."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you examine issues related to medical  device safety.

To  determine the steps FDA has taken in response to our 2009  recommendation, we analyzed information from FDA databases and  obtained information on actions taken from FDA\u2019s Web site and FDA  officials. For our ongoing work on medical device recalls, we obtained  information from FDA\u2019s Recall Enterprise System on all voluntary recalls  initiated and reported to FDA from January 1, 2005, through December 31,  2009. We then used this information to determine, among other things, the  number of recalls initiated per year; the number of recalls by recall risk  levels; and status of the recalls. In addition, we examined FDA\u2019s oversight  of 53, or 40 percent, of all high-risk recalls that were initiated from   January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009. For each of these 53 recalls,  we obtained and reviewed the case files which documented firms\u2019 and  FDA\u2019s actions. We reviewed key documents such as information from the  firms on the causes of the recalls, the firms\u2019 actions to prevent  reoccurrence of similar problems, the recall notifications firms sent out to  customers, and FDA\u2019s correspondence with firms. As part of our review,  we reviewed whether firms and FDA followed FDA\u2019s procedures for  implementing and overseeing the recalls.

These reviews are:    Premarket approval or PMA process: The manufacturer must submit  evidence, typically including clinical data, providing reasonable assurance  that the new device is safe and effective. The PMA process is the most  stringent type of premarket review. A successful submission results in  FDA\u2019s approval to market the device.", "Premarket notification or 510(k) process: Premarket notification is  commonly called \u201c510(k)\u201d in reference to section 510(k) of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, where the notification requirement is  listed. The manufacturer must demonstrate to FDA that the new device is  substantially equivalent to a device already legally on the market that does  not require a PMA. For most 510(k) submissions, clinical data are not  required and substantial equivalence will normally be determined based on  comparative descriptions of intended device uses and technological  characteristics, and may include performance data. A successful  submission results in FDA\u2019s clearance to market the device.", "In general, class I and II device types subject to premarket review are  required to obtain FDA clearance through the 510(k) process, and class III  device types are required to obtain FDA approval through the more  rigorous PMA process. With the enactment of the Medical Device  Amendments of 1976, Congress imposed requirements under which all  class III devices would be approved through the PMA process before being  marketed in the United States. However, certain types of class III devices  that were in commercial distribution in the United States before May 28,  1976, (called preamendment device types) and those determined to be  substantially equivalent to them may be cleared through the less stringent  510(k) process until FDA publishes regulations requiring them to go  through the PMA process or reclassifies them into a lower class. Between  1976 and 1990, FDA issued regulations requiring some class III device  types to go through the PMA process, but many class III device types  continued to be reviewed through the 510(k) process. The Safe Medical  Devices Act of 1990 required FDA (1) to re-examine the preamendment  class III device types for which PMAs were not yet required to determine if  they should be reclassified to class I or II or remain in class III and (2) to  establish a schedule to promulgate regulations requiring those  preamendment device types that remain in class III to obtain FDA  approval through the PMA process. Accordingly, all class III devices are  eventually to be reviewed through the PMA process.", "In our January 2009 report, we found that although Congress envisioned  that all class III devices would be approved through the more stringent  PMA process, the agency\u2019s actions to make this the case were incomplete.

We recommended that FDA  expeditiously take steps to issue regulations for each class III device type  allowed to enter the market through the 510(k) process, including to   (1) reclassify each device type into class I or class II, or requiring it to  remain in class III, and (2) for those device types remaining in class III,  require approval for marketing through the PMA process.

FDA defines a recall as a firm\u2019s removal or correction of a  marketed product that FDA (1) considers to be in violation of the laws it  administers, and (2) against which the agency would initiate legal  actions. Nearly all medical device recalls are voluntarily initiated by a  recalling firm, usually the manufacturer of the device. To initiate a  voluntary recall, a firm notifies those who have received, purchased, or  used the device. The firm may be asked to provide FDA with information  such as the reason for the correction or removal of the device, an  assessment of the health hazard associated with the device, and the  volume of product in distribution and proposed strategy for conducting  the recall. The strategy should contain details on the firm\u2019s plan for  ensuring that its customers and device users correct or remove the device  according to the firm\u2019s instructions. FDA\u2019s role is generally to oversee a  firm\u2019s management of a recall. As part of its oversight, FDA reviews and  recommends changes to the recall strategy and assigns one of three recall  classifications\u2014class I, II, or III\u2014to indicate the relative degree of health  hazard posed by the product being recalled. For a class I recall, FDA has  determined that there is a reasonable probability that use of, or exposure  to, the product could cause serious adverse health consequences or death.  Class II recalls are those for which FDA has determined that the use of, or  exposure to, the product could cause temporary or medically reversible  adverse health consequences or that the probability of serious adverse  health consequences is remote. For class III recalls, FDA has determined  that use of, or exposure to, a device is not likely to cause adverse health  consequences. FDA advises the recalling firm of the assigned recall  classification; and posts information about the recall in its weekly  enforcement report.", "It is important to note that FDA\u2019s device and recall classification schemes  carry opposite designations. The potential degree of health risk associated  with device classes is designated from class III (high) to class I (low),  while the potential risk associated with recall classes is designated from  class I (high) to class III (low).", "FDA also monitors the progress of a recall and verifies whether the  recalling firm has effectively implemented the recall strategy. FDA  requests that a recalling firm periodically provide the monitoring district  with status reports that provide updates on the progress of recalls. FDA  district staff also conduct audit checks to confirm that the recalling firm  has properly corrected or removed devices from the market, in  accordance with the recall strategy. Once the firm believes it has  completed the recall\u2014that is, done everything as outlined in the recall  strategy\u2014it should submit a recall termination request to the monitoring  district office. As part of the termination decision, FDA should assess  whether the firm has taken sufficient corrective actions to prevent a  reoccurrence of the problem that led to the recall. For class I recalls, FDA  district staff review a firm\u2019s request, and if they agree, send a recall  termination request to headquarters. For class II and III recalls, FDA  district staff make the final termination decision. According to FDA\u2019s  procedures, FDA should terminate a recall within 3 months after the firm  completes the recall."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Taken Some Actions in Response to Our Recommendation to Strengthen the Premarket Review Process, but Concerns About the 510(k) Process Remain", "paragraphs": ["FDA has begun to take steps to address our 2009 recommendation about  class III devices that are still allowed to enter the U.S. market through the  less stringent 510(k) process, but progress has been limited.

Some recalls involved hundreds of thousands of disposable  products, while others involved a small number of life-sustaining  implantable devices. Recalling firms were often unable to correct or  remove all devices. This was because firms either could not locate some of  the customers or device users, or these customers or device users could  not locate the devices subject to recall.

In this case,  based on adverse event reports that screws in its spinal fixation system  were becoming loose post-operatively, the firm decided to recall the  device in December 2005. The firm implemented its recall, and removed all  devices. The firm indicated that it developed a corrective action plan for  the screw problem, and relaunched the device in April 2006. It then  requested termination from FDA in May 2006. FDA followed up on this  request by leaving three voice mail messages with the firm and received no  response. The agency sent out a request for information a year later, in  May 2007. In June 2007, the company again indicated that the recall was  complete, and requested termination. In September 2007, FDA conducted  an inspection of the company\u2019s manufacturing facility, and found that  while the recall was complete, the corrective action was not adequate.  Over the course of the next 2 years, the firm worked with FDA to get  revisions to the device approved, but eventually agreed to a second recall  for the revised device. This recall was initiated in May 2009.
