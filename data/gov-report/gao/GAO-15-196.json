Further, EAEF has not yet  complied with the provisions in the grant agreement related to public  communications, such as those requiring EAEF to acknowledge the U.S.  government\u2019s financial contribution. While both Funds have demonstrated  their commitment to ensuring that U.S. funds are not used for prohibited  purposes, neither Fund has incorporated vetting requirements for  individuals and organizations into its corporate policies.

In its written comments, reprinted in  appendix II, USAID concurred with our four recommendations and  indicated the steps it was taking to implement each of them. Specifically,  regarding our recommendation to establish a process to better manage  cash advances, USAID stated that going forward the program  representative would share Fund quarterly financial reports with the office  of the Chief Financial Officer. In response to our recommendation  pertaining to performance monitoring, USAID stated that it would work  with each Fund to meet a revised deadline of the first quarter of 2015 to  submit a completed performance monitoring plan. With regard to our  recommendation pertaining to public communications, EAEF confirmed to  USAID that it would meet all related requirements going forward,  including proposing a logo in the first quarter of 2015. Lastly, the  Chairmen of both Funds confirmed to USAID that they would propose  amendments to their corporate policies to include the vetting procedures  to their respective Boards.", "In its written comments, reprinted in appendix III, TAEF agreed with our  findings and provided some additional information.
