Attention to this subject became more acute due to the widely publicized case of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy who died as a result of an untreated infected tooth that led to a fatal brain infection. Deamonte had health coverage through Medicaid, a joint federal and state program that provides health care coverage, including dental care, for millions of low-income children. Deamonte had extensive dental disease and his family was unable to find a dentist to treat him. GAO was asked to examine the extent to which children in Medicaid experience dental disease, the extent to which they receive dental care, and how these conditions have changed over time. To examine these indicators of oral health, GAO analyzed data, by insurance status, from two nationally representative surveys of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). This statement summarizes the resulting report being released today, Medicaid: Extent of Dental Disease in Children Has Not Decreased, and Millions Are Estimated to Have Untreated Tooth Decay (GAO-08-1121). In commenting on a draft of the report, HHS acknowledged the challenge of providing dental services to children in Medicaid, and cited the agency's related activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Dental disease remains a significant problem for children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid. Nationally representative data from the 1999 through 2004 NHANES surveys--which collected information about oral health through direct examinations--indicate that about one in three children in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay, and one in nine had untreated decay in three or more teeth. Projected to 2005 enrollment levels, GAO estimates that 6.5 million children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay. Children in Medicaid remain at higher risk of dental disease compared to children with private health insurance; children in Medicaid were almost twice as likely to have untreated tooth decay. Receipt of dental care also remains a concern for children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid. Nationally representative data from the 2004 through 2005 MEPS survey--which asks participants about the receipt of dental care for household members--indicate that only one in three children in Medicaid ages 2 through 18 had received dental care in the year prior to the survey. Similarly, about one in eight children reportedly never sees a dentist. More than half of children with private health insurance, by contrast, had received dental care in the prior year. Children in Medicaid also fared poorly when compared to national benchmarks, as the percentage of children in Medicaid who received any dental care--37 percent--was far below the Healthy People 2010 target of having 66 percent of low-income children under age 19 receive a preventive dental service. Survey data on Medicaid children's receipt of dental care showed some improvement; for example, use of sealants went up significantly between the 1988 through 1994 and 1999 through 2004 time periods. Rates of dental disease, however, did not decrease, although the data suggest the trends vary somewhat among different age groups. Younger children in Medicaid--those aged 2 through 5--had statistically significant higher rates of dental disease in the more recent time period as compared to earlier surveys. By contrast, data for Medicaid adolescents aged 16 through 18 show declining rates of tooth decay, although the change was not statistically significant."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you further examine concerns related to  the adequacy of dental services for children in Medicaid. My testimony will  provide a summary of our report for the subcommittee, which you are  releasing today, entitled Medicaid: Extent of Dental Disease in Children  Has Not Decreased, and Millions Are Estimated to Have Untreated Tooth  Decay. This report provides information following the May 2007 and  February 2008 subcommittee hearings investigating concerns related to  the provision of dental services to children in Medicaid. These hearings  investigated the circumstances of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy with  Medicaid coverage who did not receive timely and needed dental care and  who died as a result of an untreated infected tooth that led to a fatal brain  infection. As you know, Medicaid\u2014the joint federal and state program that  provides health care coverage for millions of low-income individuals\u2014 provides comprehensive dental coverage for enrolled children. Concerns  raised at the hearings about low-income children\u2019s oral health, including  the extent that children in Medicaid experience dental disease and receive  dental care, are not new. GAO reviews conducted in the late 1990s  highlighted the problem of chronic dental disease and the factors that  contribute to low use of dental care by low-income populations, including  children in Medicaid.", "Our new work examined two aspects of children\u2019s oral health: the extent  to which children in Medicaid experience dental disease and the extent to  which they receive dental care. We also assessed how these conditions  have changed over time. Our work provides information from national  health surveys on key indicators of the oral health status of children in  Medicaid, specifically, the rate of dental disease and their receipt of dental  care, and changes in these indicators over time.", "In carrying out this work, we analyzed data from a survey conducted by  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014the National  Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES, which is  administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC)  National Center for Health Statistics, obtains nationally representative  information on the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population  through direct physical examinations, including dental examinations, and  interviews. The dental examinations include a dentist\u2019s assessment of  tooth decay and the presence of dental sealants, and the interviews  include questions on various health and demographic characteristics,  including information on insurance status. To assess how the rate of  dental disease experienced by children in Medicaid has changed over time,  we compared NHANES data from 1999 through 2004 with NHANES data  from 1988 through 1994. We analyzed results from three different groups  based on their health insurance status: children with Medicaid, children  with private health insurance, and uninsured children. The group of  children with private insurance included both children with dental  coverage and children without dental coverage, while the group of  uninsured was children who had neither health insurance nor dental  insurance.", "To assess how receipt of dental care has changed over time, we also  analyzed data from another HHS survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel  Survey (MEPS). MEPS is administered by HHS\u2019s Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality (AHRQ). MEPS obtains nationally representative  information on Americans\u2019 health insurance coverage and use of health  care, including information on receipt of dental care such as how often  participants see a dentist and whether they have experienced problems  accessing needed dental care. Our MEPS analysis was based on surveys  conducted in 2004 and 2005 (the most recent data available). To assess  changes in receipt of dental care over time, we compared the data from  2004 and 2005 with MEPS data from 1996 and 1997. We analyzed the MEPS  data using the same three insurance groups as we used for the NHANES  data. To estimate the number of children in each Medicaid category with a  given condition, we applied certain proportions from NHANES or MEPS  data to an estimate of the 2005 average monthly Medicaid enrollment of  children aged 2 through 18 (20.1 million children). Finally, we obtained  information on oral health and the Medicaid population from CDC and  from dental associations and experts including the Children\u2019s Health  Dental Project and the Medicaid/SCHIP Dental Association. The work for  our report was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards from December 2007 through September  2008. A detailed explanation of our methodology is included in the report.", "In summary, dental disease and inadequate receipt of dental care remain  significant problems for children in Medicaid. Nationally representative  survey data from 1999 through 2004 indicate that about one in three  children aged 2 through 18 in Medicaid had untreated tooth decay, and one  in nine had untreated decay in three or more teeth. Projecting the survey  results to the 2005 average monthly Medicaid enrollment of 20.1 million  children, we estimate that 6.5 million children aged 2 through 18 in  Medicaid had untreated tooth decay. Children in Medicaid remain at  higher risk of dental disease compared to children who have private health  insurance; children in Medicaid were almost twice as likely to have  untreated tooth decay.", "Survey data from 2004 and 2005 showed that only about one in three  children in Medicaid aged 2 through 18 had received dental care in the  prior year; about one in eight children reportedly never sees the dentist.

For example, comparison of survey data from  1988 through 1994 to more recent data from 1999 through 2004 showed  that the percentage of children aged 6 through 18 in Medicaid with at least  one dental sealant increased nearly threefold, from 10 percent in 1988  through 1994 to 28 percent in 1999 through 2004. However, over the same  time periods, dental disease in the overall Medicaid population aged 2  through 18 did not decrease, although the data suggest the trends vary  somewhat among different age groups. Younger children\u2014those aged 2  through 5\u2014had statistically significant higher rates of dental disease in the  more recent time period examined as compared to earlier surveys. By  contrast, data for adolescents\u2014children in Medicaid aged 16 through 18\u2014 show declining rates of tooth decay, although the change was not  statistically significant.", "In commenting on a draft of our report, HHS provided comments from  three component agencies: CMS, CDC, and AHRQ. CMS acknowledged the  challenge of providing dental services to children in Medicaid, as well as  all children nationwide, and cited a number of activities undertaken by  CMS in coordination with states. CDC commented that trends in dental  caries (tooth decay) vary by age group and for primary versus permanent  teeth. We revised our report to further clarify the trends by age group and  added information on CDC\u2019s findings in the general population. AHRQ  commented that its own work on dental use, expenses, dental coverage,  and changes had not been cited and sought additional clarification on the  methodology used to analyze the data. We revised our report to cite  AHRQ\u2019s findings on dental services for children and to further describe  our methodology.

Left untreated, the pain and  infections caused by tooth decay may lead to problems in eating, speaking,  and learning. Tooth decay is almost completely preventable, and the pain,  dysfunction, or on extremely rare occasion, death, resulting from dental  disease can be avoided (see fig. 1). Preventive dental care can make a  significant difference in health outcomes and has been shown to be cost- effective. For example, a 2004 study found that average dental-related  costs for low-income preschool children who had their first preventive  dental visit by age 1 were less than one-half ($262 compared to $546) of  average costs for children who received their first preventive visit at age 4  through 5.", "The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that  each child see a dentist when his or her first tooth erupts and no later than  the child\u2019s first birthday, with subsequent visits occurring at 6-month  intervals or more frequently if recommended by a dentist. The early initial  visit can establish a \u201cdental home\u201d for the child, defined by AAPD as the  ongoing relationship with a dental provider who can ensure  comprehensive and continuously accessible care. Comprehensive dental  visits can include both clinical assessments, such as for tooth decay and  sealants, and appropriate discussion and counseling for oral hygiene,  injury prevention, and speech and language development, among other  topics. Because resistance to tooth decay is determined in part by  genetics, eating patterns, and oral hygiene, early prevention is important.  Delaying the onset of tooth decay may also reduce long-term risk for more  serious decay by delaying the exposure to caries risk factors to a time  when the child can better control his or her health behaviors.", "Recognizing the importance of good oral health, HHS in 1990 and again in  2000 established oral health goals as part of its Healthy People 2000 and  2010 initiatives. These include objectives related to oral health in children,  for example, reducing the proportion of children with untreated tooth  decay. One objective of Healthy People 2010 relates to the Medicaid  population: to increase the proportion of low-income children and  adolescents under the age of 19 who receive any preventive dental service  in the past year, from 25 percent in 1996 to 66 percent in 2010.", "Medicaid, a joint federal and state program that provides health care  coverage for low-income individuals and families; pregnant women; and  aged, blind, and disabled people, provided health coverage for an  estimated 20.1 million children aged 2 through 18 in federal fiscal year  2005. The states operate their Medicaid programs within broad federal  requirements and may contract with managed-care organizations to  provide Medicaid benefits or use other forms of managed care, when  approved by CMS. CMS estimates that as of June 30, 2006, about   65 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received benefits through some form  of managed care. State Medicaid programs must cover some services for  certain populations under federal law. For instance, under Medicaid\u2019s  early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) benefit,  states must provide dental screening, diagnostic, preventive, and related  treatment services for all eligible Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dental Disease and Inadequate Receipt of Dental Care Remain Significant Problems for Children in Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["Children in Medicaid aged 2 through 18 often experience dental disease  and often do not receive needed dental care, and although receipt of  dental care has improved somewhat in recent years, the extent of dental  disease for most age groups has not.

The proportion of children in Medicaid who experienced tooth  decay increased from 56 percent in the earlier period to 62 percent in more  recent years.
