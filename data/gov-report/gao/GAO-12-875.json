TSA, within DHS, has responsibilities for general aviation security, and developed AFSP to ensure that foreign students enrolling at flight schools do not pose a security threat. GAO was asked to assess (1) TSA and general aviation industry actions to enhance security and TSA efforts to obtain information on these actions and (2) TSA efforts to ensure foreign flight students do not pose a security threat. GAO reviewed TSA analysis comparing FAA data from January 2006 to September 2011 on foreign nationals applying for airman certificates with AFSP data, and interviewed 22 general aviation operators at eight airports selected to reflect geographic diversity and variations in types of operators.

For example, TSA requires that certain general aviation aircraft operators implement security programs. Aircraft operators under these programs must, among other things, develop and maintain TSA-approved security programs. TSA has also conducted outreach to the general aviation community to establish a cooperative relationship with general aviation stakeholders. In 2008, TSA developed a proposed rule that would have imposed security requirements on all aircraft over 12,500 pounds, including large aircraft that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) analysis has shown could cause significant damage in an attack. In response to industry concerns about the proposed rule\u0092s costs and security benefits, TSA is developing a new proposed rule. Officials from all six industry associations GAO spoke with stated that TSA has reached out to gather industry\u0092s input, and three of the six associations stated that TSA has improved its efforts to gather input since the 2008 notice of proposed rulemaking.", "TSA vets foreign flight student applicants through its Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP), but weaknesses exist in the vetting process and in DHS\u0092s process for identifying flight students who may be in the country illegally. From January 2006 through September 2011, more than 25,000 foreign nationals had applied for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman certificates (pilot\u0092s licenses), indicating they had completed flight training. However, TSA computerized matching of FAA data determined that some known number of foreign nationals did not match with those in TSA\u0092s database, raising questions as to whether they had been vetted. In addition, AFSP is not designed to determine whether a foreign flight student entered the country legally; thus, a foreign national can be approved for training through AFSP after entering the country illegally. A March 2010 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flight school investigation led to the arrest of six such foreign nationals, including one who had a commercial pilot\u0092s license. As a result, TSA and ICE jointly worked on vetting names of foreign students against immigration databases, but have not specified desired outcomes and time frames, or assigned individuals with responsibility for fully instituting the program. Having a road map, with steps and time frames, and assigning individuals the responsibility for fully instituting a pilot program could help TSA and ICE better identify and prevent potential risk.

We  chose these dates because they reflect the time frame after the publication of our previous report on general aviation security.", "To assess the extent to which TSA has ensured that foreign flight  students seeking flight training in the United States do not pose a security  threat, we reviewed our recent reports related to DHS vetting, and  documentation related to TSA procedures for conducting security threat  assessments of AFSP candidates. We also reviewed documentation on  TSA compliance procedures for flight schools participating in the AFSP  program and reviewed summary statistics for fiscal year 2005 through  fiscal year 2011 on flight school compliance compiled by TSA. We  spoke to TSA inspection officials to discuss common issues associated  with compliance inspections and efforts to address compliance  deficiencies. We evaluated TSA\u2019s efforts to assess risk for the AFSP  against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We  also obtained data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airmen  registry on foreign nationals who had applied for FAA airman certificates  (private, recreational, or sport certificates) for the period January 2006  through September 2011 and provided the data to TSA so that the  agency could conduct a matching process to determine whether the  foreign nationals in the FAA airmen registry were in the AFSP database  and whether they had been successfully vetted through AFSP. We  selected these dates because 2006 was the first full year after TSA  assumed responsibility for AFSP from the Department of Justice, and  September 2011 was the end of the fiscal year for our reporting period.

TSA officials attribute the increase  in compliance to a better understanding of security program requirements  by operators, and to increased TSA outreach. Agency data illustrate that  the reasons for noncompliance among aircraft operators varied. For  example, in fiscal year 2011, inspectors found that Private Charter aircraft  operators did not always provide advance notice to the Federal Security  Director of upcoming private charter operations or of subsequent changes  or additions, which occurred in 7 percent of 424 inspections for this item.  Program compliance violations detected by inspectors were sometimes  resolved either by counseling with the aircraft operator or by initiating an  investigation of the incident, which could result in TSA issuing a warning  notice or civil penalties being assessed.", "In addition to taking steps to obtain information on security measures  enacted by general aviation aircraft operators that fall under TSA security  programs, the agency has also taken steps to obtain information on  security measures implemented by general aviation airport operators.  Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Act required TSA to, among other  things, develop a standardized threat and vulnerability assessment  program for general aviation airport operators and implement a program  to perform such assessments on a risk management basis. To help  comply with the act\u2019s requirement, TSA distributed a survey in 2010 to  approximately 3,000 general aviation airports to identify any  vulnerabilities at the airports, and received responses from 1,164 (39  percent) of the airports. In this survey, airport officials were asked to  respond to questions on security measures implemented by the general  aviation airport operators, such as whether hangar doors were secured  when unattended, and whether the airport had closed-circuit camera  coverage for hangar areas. This survey also included questions about the  types of perimeter fencing and physical barriers installed, as well as the  type of security measures in use at these airports. The survey found that,  while most general aviation airports had initiated some security  measures, the extent to which different security measures had been  implemented varied by airport. For example, survey results indicated that  more than 97 percent of larger general aviation airports responding to the  survey had developed an emergency contact list, but less than 19 percent  had developed measures to positively identify passengers, cargo, and  baggage. The survey also found that nearly 44 percent of airports  responding to the survey required security awareness training for all  tenants and employees and more than 48 percent of airports had  established community watch programs.", "According to TSA officials, the results of the survey were analyzed to  identify the general strengths and weaknesses in the general aviation  community, and to show an overall picture of general aviation security  measures at a national and regional level. In addition, TSA officials said  that the information collected in the survey can be used to help determine  a plan of action to mitigate security concerns at general aviation airports.  For example, TSA used the survey to identify approximately 300 airports  that it considers to be higher risk and could therefore be prioritized to  receive security grants, should they become available. TSA officials  added that information from the survey allowed the agency to establish a  baseline for security measures in place at general aviation airports.", "In addition to the survey, TSA also gathers information on security  measures implemented by operators through outreach activities its  inspectors conduct at general aviation airports, designed to establish a  cooperative relationship with general aviation airport stakeholders and  encourage voluntary adoption of security enhancements.

Rather, the agency has  developed informal mechanisms for obtaining information on security  measures enacted by these operators, such as outreach conducted by  TSA inspectors, and has contacted general aviation industry associations  to obtain this information as well as obtain information on the concerns of  these operators regarding costs and other challenges associated with  potential security requirements.", "As previously mentioned, TSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for  a Large Aircraft Security Program in October 2008, which would have  resulted in all general aviation aircraft larger than 12,500 pounds,  including those not currently covered under existing security programs,  being subject to TSA security requirements and inspections. However,  industry associations and others expressed concerns about the extent to  which TSA obtained industry views and information in the proposed rule\u2019s  development. They also questioned the security benefit of the proposed  rule and stated that it could negatively affect the aviation industry given its  broad scope. For example, officials from three of the six industry  associations we interviewed stated that many of the proposed rule\u2019s  measures, such as having third-party contractors conduct inspections of  private aircraft operators for a fee, would impose substantial logistical and  cost burdens on the general aviation industry. These association officials  added that any revised rule that TSA develops must take into account the  security measures already put in place by general aviation aircraft  operators as well as the costs associated with implementing any  additional security measures.", "TSA managers responsible for general aviation security operations stated  that, in response to these concerns, the agency was revising the  proposed rule to make it more focused and risk-based, and that the  agency plans to issue a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in  late 2012 or early 2013. Further, officials from all six of the industry  associations we interviewed stated that TSA has reached out to industry  in developing its new rule and three of the six associations stated that  TSA has performed a better job of reaching out to industry in its ongoing  development of the new rule than it did with the rule it proposed in 2008.  For example, the vice president from one association stated that as part  of its development of its supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking,  TSA has more actively sought information on these security measures,  which better allows the agency to ensure the requirements would impose  as limited a burden as possible while maximizing security.

To determine whether  foreign nationals applying for FAA airman certificates had previously  applied to AFSP and been vetted by TSA, we obtained data from FAA\u2019s  airmen registry on foreign nationals who had applied for airman  certificates and provided these data to TSA so that the agency could  conduct a matching process to determine whether the foreign nationals in  the FAA airmen registry were in TSA\u2019s AFSP database and the extent to  which they had been successfully vetted through the AFSP database.  The results of our review of TSA\u2019s analyses are as follows:", "TSA\u2019s analysis indicated that some of the 25,599 foreign nationals in  the FAA airmen registry were not in the TSA AFSP database,  indicating that these individuals had not applied to the AFSP or been  vetted by TSA before taking flight training and receiving an FAA  airman certificate.", "TSA\u2019s analysis indicated that an additional number of the 25,599  foreign nationals in the FAA airmen registry were also in the TSA  AFSP database but had not been successfully vetted, meaning that  they had received an FAA airman certificate but had not been  successfully vetted or received permission from TSA to begin flight  training.", "As stated previously, TSA continuously vets all new and existing FAA  airmen certificate holders against the Terrorist Screening Database,  which would include the foreign nationals identified through TSA\u2019s  analysis. However, this vetting does not occur until after the foreign  national has obtained flight training. Thus, foreign nationals obtaining  flight training with the intent to do harm, such as three of the pilots and  leaders of the September 11 terrorist attacks, could have already  obtained the training needed to operate an aircraft before they received  any type of vetting.", "In commenting on the results of the analysis, TSA\u2019s Program Manager for  AFSP could not explain with certainty why some of the foreign nationals  applying for FAA airman certificates may not have been vetted though  TSA\u2019s security threat assessment process. The Program Manager stated,  however, that certain individuals can receive exemptions from the vetting  requirement as a result of a Department of Defense (DOD) attach\u00e9  endorsement at a U.S. embassy or consulate overseas.", "TSA takes steps to help ensure that foreign nationals are obtaining  security threat assessments prior to beginning flight training. Specifically,  TSA regulations require flight training providers to maintain  documentation on foreign nationals who receive AFSP approval to begin  flight training as well as documentation on those who are taking flight  training under DOD endorsements. Similarly, TSA standard operating  procedures for inspectors indicate they should review documentation over  the course of their inspections of the flight training provider, including  documentation indicating the foreign national was approved for flight  training under AFSP and, if available, the DOD endorsement letter that  informs them of the status of the foreign national in question as a DOD  endorsee, which would exempt them from receiving a security threat  assessment under AFSP. Our review of compliance data from TSA\u2019s  PARIS database for fiscal year 2011 found that TSA inspectors have  encountered and documented instances where foreign nationals  attending flight school presented to the flight training provider DOD  endorsement letters, which would indicate they are exempt from security  threat assessment requirements.

In general, the inspection process requires  inspectors to, among other things, review documents maintained by the  flight training provider, including the flight training records of both U.S.  citizens and alien flight students, and also ensure that foreign students  have registered with TSA\u2019s AFSP database and were granted permission   The results of the inspections are to be  to begin flight training from TSA.reported in TSA\u2019s PARIS database consistent with the reporting  requirements of the work plan and other TSA guidance.

TSA officials attribute the increase in compliance to a better understanding of AFSP requirements by flight  training providers, among other things. Agency data also illustrate that the  reasons for noncompliance among providers varied. For example, in  fiscal year 2011, the reasons for noncompliance included violations such  as missing photographs of foreign students, which occurred in 9 percent  of 1,800 inspections for this item. In 7 percent of about 2,800 inspections,  providers did not document and retain employee records related to  completion of the required Security Awareness Training. When inspectors  checked for retention of records of U.S. citizenship by the flight training  provider, the provider was not in compliance in about 5 percent of the  nearly 2,800 inspections performed in this area. Compliance violations  detected by inspectors were sometimes resolved either by counseling  with the flight training provider or by initiating an investigation of the  incident, which could result in civil penalties being assessed.", "As part of its compliance inspection process, TSA inspectors also review  records of documentation provided by U.S. citizens applying for flight  training, which are maintained by flight training providers. TSA regulations  governing AFSP require individuals claiming U.S. citizenship to provide  one of the following documents, among other information, to flight training  providers before accessing flight training: a valid, unexpired U.S. passport an original or government-issued birth certificate original certificate of birth abroad and a government-issued picture original certificate of U.S. citizenship with raised seal and government- original U.S. Naturalization Certificate with raised seal and  government-issued picture identification.", "Flight school personnel are required to review the credentials presented  by individuals claiming U.S. citizenship and to maintain records, and TSA  inspectors, as part of the inspection process, review these records to  ensure flight training provider compliance with regulatory requirements.

However, as we reported, the level of  access that TSA credentialing programs have to the Department of  Justice\u2019s FBI criminal history records is the level of access accorded for  noncriminal-justice purposes (i.e., equal to that of a private company  doing an employment check on a new applicant, according to TSA),  which limits TSA in accessing certain criminal history data related to  charges and convictions. TSA said that it had been difficult to effectively  and efficiently conduct security threat assessment adjudication of criminal  history records because of the limited access it has as a noncriminal  justice-purpose requestor of criminal history records\u2014and that this  limitation had increased the risk that the agency was not detecting  potentially disqualifying criminal offenses. We reported that while TSA  was seeking criminal justice-type access to FBI systems, the FBI reported  that it is legally unable to provide this access. The FBI and TSA were  collaborating on options, but had not identified the extent to which a  potential security risk may exist under the current process, and the costs  and benefits of pursuing alternatives to provide additional access.", "In December 2011, we recommended that TSA and the FBI conduct a  joint risk assessment of TSA\u2019s access to criminal history records. DHS  concurred with this recommendation and indicated it would work with the  Department of Justice to assess the extent of security risk, among other  things, and evaluate the costs and benefits of each alternative. In  response to our recommendations, the FBI reported that it was pursuing  several strategies to provide TSA with access to the most complete  criminal history information available for noncriminal justice-related  purposes, including reaching out to states that do not provide criminal  history records for noncriminal justice purposes as well as working to  develop technical solutions. As of February 2012, TSA officials indicated  that they are continuing to work with the FBI to address our  recommendation.", "TSA officials responsible for overseeing security threat assessments  stated that the process for conducting criminal history record checks for  AFSP is substantively the same as that used for other TSA screening and  credentialing programs. While there is no information indicating that any  foreign nationals seeking flight training should not have been allowed to  do so because of unidentified criminal offenses, we believe that TSA  should continue to work with the FBI on joint risk assessments of TSA\u2019s  access to criminal history records for credentialing programs, including  AFSP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Immigration Violations", "paragraphs": ["There have been instances of overstays or other immigration-related  violations for foreign nationals taking flight training in the United States,  most notably for three of the September 11 hijackers.

AFSP was implemented  to help address such security concerns. As previously discussed, as part  of AFSP, TSA conducts security threat assessments for foreign nationals  requesting flight training in the United States. According to TSA officials,  the purpose of the security threat assessment, which includes a check of  the Terrorist Screening Database and a criminal history records check, is  to determine whether the foreign national requesting flight training  presents a security threat; the checks are not designed to determine  whether an applicant is in the country legally. As part of the security threat  assessment, TSA also conducts reviews of DHS\u2019s TECS database to  determine if any negative immigration-related information is associated  with the foreign national seeking flight training. However, TSA officials  acknowledged that it is possible for a foreign national to be approved by  TSA through AFSP and to complete flight training after entering the  country illegally or overstaying his or her allotted time to be in the country  legally.", "In 2010, ICE investigated a Boston-area flight school after local police  stopped the flight school owner for a traffic violation and discovered that  he was in the country illegally. Twenty-five of the foreign nationals at this  flight school had applied to AFSP and had been approved by TSA to  begin flight training after their security threat assessment was completed;  however, the ICE investigation and our subsequent inquiries revealed the  following issues:", "Eight of the 25 foreign nationals who received approval by TSA to  begin flight training were in \u201centry without inspection\u201d status, meaning  they had entered the country illegally.", "Six of these foreign nationals were later arrested by ICE as a  result of the investigation.

Specifically, he was a certified Airline Transport Pilot (cargo pilot) and  a Certified Flight Instructor. However, he had never received a TSA  security threat assessment or been approved by TSA to obtain flight  training. He had registered with TSA as a flight training provider under  AFSP.", "Further, TSA data indicated that an additional foreign national  arrested as a result of this flight school investigation for \u201centry without  inspection\u201d had previously completed flight training through an airline.", "According to the AFSP program manager, TSA reviews TECS to  determine if the student has prior immigration violations, including  overstays. However, the program manager stated that this TECS review  is not designed to determine how long the student is authorized to stay in  the country or whether the student had entered the country legally.  Rather, if the TECS review indicates that the foreign national has  previous immigration-related violations, such as overstaying the  authorized period of admission, TSA is to conduct additional TECS  queries to determine if the individual is eligible to receive flight training.  Further, according to TSA, prospective flight students may apply for  AFSP before entering the United States, rendering moot the question of  whether the foreign national had entered the country legally or  overstayed.", "The AFSP program manager stated that even though the foreign  nationals were later found to be overstays, at the time of the review and  adjudication of their security threat assessments, they were determined to  be in legal status. According to TSA, none of the individuals that TSA  processed and approved under AFSP had derogatory information within  TECS, and visa overstay information is contained within TECS. However,  ICE data we reviewed indicated that 16 of the 17 foreign nationals  associated with the flight school who were found by ICE to be in overstay  status at the time of the investigation had already been in overstay status  at the time they received AFSP approval to begin flight training. This  includes the 4 foreign nationals who were able to obtain FAA airman  certificates. Further, the AFSP program manager stated that foreign  nationals who may have entered the country illegally but who did not have  prior immigration violations, did not have a criminal history, or were not on  the terrorist watch list, could be successfully vetted through an AFSP  security threat assessment and approved to receive flight training. The  program manager added that under the current AFSP process, TSA  cannot always determine at the time of application if an individual entered  the United States \u201cwithout inspection\u201d (illegally) because applicants can  apply to AFSP more than 180 days prior to the start date of training and  applicants are not necessarily in the United States at the time of  application.", "Senior officials from TSA and ICE stated that the agencies have initiated  a process in which TSA and ICE check the names of AFSP applicants  against the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US- VISIT) program\u2019s Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) to  help address this gap, as well as to identify foreign nationals taking flight  training who become overstays. Specifically, in March 2011, TSA vetted  a list of current alien flight students in TSA\u2019s AFSP database against  names in USVISIT\u2019s ADIS to determine if any were potential overstays.  This review resulted in the identification of 142 possible overstays. In May  2011, TSA provided ICE with the results of its analysis, and ICE vetting  further reduced the list of possible overstays to 22. In September and  October of 2011, ICE initiated 22 investigations based on the results of  this analysis, which resulted in three arrests.", "According to TSA and ICE officials, this initial matching of names in the  AFSP database against ADIS was conducted once to give the agencies  an indication of how many foreign nationals seeking flight training in the  United States may be in violation of their immigration status and what the  workload associated with conducting such matches would be. Information  from this review could then be used to initiate investigations of individuals  suspected of being in the country illegally either by overstaying their  allotted time in the country or who may have entered the country illegally.  The TSA and ICE officials added, however, that such a process would  have to be conducted more regularly to systematically identify foreign  nationals taking flight training who may be in violation of their immigration  status or who may have entered the country illegally. They stated that  establishing a more regular process of matching names of foreign  nationals in the AFSP database against ADIS would allow the agencies to  better identify foreign nationals seeking flight training who have violated  the terms of their admission as well as those who have entered the  country illegally.", "However, several issues related to how a name matching program would  work are being considered, such as which agency would vet names in the  AFSP database against ADIS, and how frequently names associated with  potential violations would be provided to ICE. ICE and TSA officials stated  that they have not specified desired outcomes or time frames, or  established performance measures to evaluate the success of the  program. Standards for program management state that specific desired  outcomes or results should be conceptualized, defined, and documented  in the planning process as part of a road map, along with the appropriate   The standards  steps and time frames needed to achieve those results.also call for assigning responsibility and accountability for ensuring the  results of program activities are carried out.

Key to  the effectiveness of this effort is the ability of TSA to conduct meaningful  security threat assessments on foreign nationals seeking flight training to  help determine whether these individuals pose a security threat.  However, as shown in TSA\u2019s analysis, there are discrepancies between  the data found in FAA\u2019s airmen registry and TSA\u2019s AFSP database,  raising questions about whether some foreign nationals with airman  certificates (pilot\u2019s licenses) have completed required security threat  assessments.

While this is a beneficial practice,  we believe that it would be preferable for TSA to vet prospective flight  students before they begin flight training, rather than after they have  completed training and received a pilot\u2019s certificate and are thus capable  of flying an aircraft. In addition, while TSA vets the names of new  certificate holders against the Terrorist Screening Database on a daily  basis, the AFSP vetting process includes additional criminal history  records checks and a check for derogatory immigration-related  information. To help improve the AFSP vetting process, DHS also stated  that TSA signed a memorandum of understanding with FAA in February  2012 to exchange data. The memorandum, which FAA signed in March  2012, outlines a process for FAA to provide certain data from its airmen  registry on a monthly basis, via encrypted e-mail and password protected,  to a designated point of contact within TSA, and authorizes TSA to use  the data to ensure flight training providers are providing TSA with  applicant/candidate information in order to conduct the appropriate  background check prior to flight instruction. This is an important first step  toward addressing our recommendation, provided that TSA uses the data  to identify instances where foreign nationals receive FAA airman  certificates without first undergoing a TSA security threat assessment,  identifies reasons for these occurrences, and strengthens controls to  prevent future occurrences, as we recommended.", "In response to our recommendation that TSA and ICE collaborate and  develop a plan with time frames for assessing the results of a pilot  program to check TSA AFSP data against information DHS has on  applicants\u2019 admissibility status, and to institute that pilot program if it is  found to be effective, DHS stated that TSA will prepare a plan by  December 31, 2012, to assess the results of the pilot with ICE to  determine the lawful status of the active AFSP population.

(2) To what  extent has TSA ensured that foreign flight students seeking flight training  in the United States do not pose a security threat?", "To address these questions, we examined laws and regulations\u2014 including provisions of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act  (ATSA), Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of  2007 (9/11 Commission Act), and TSA regulations governing aircraft  operators and the Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP)\u2014related to the  security of general aviation operations. We also interviewed  representatives from six industry associations based on their participation  in TSA\u2019s Aviation Security Advisory Committee and on their focus on  general aviation security issues: the American Association of Airport  Executives, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, Experimental Aircraft  Association, General Aviation Manufacturers Association, National Air  Transportation Association, and National Business Aviation Association.  We also interviewed officials from TSA\u2019s Office of Security Operations,  Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and Office of Security Policy and  Industry Outreach, as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In  addition, we conducted site visits and interviewed representatives from a  nonprobability sample of 22 general aviation operators located at selected  airports\u2014including 5 private operators that operate at least one aircraft  weighing more than 12,500 pounds, 7 private charter operators that also  perform as private operators, and 10 flight schools\u2014to observe and  discuss security initiatives implemented. We selected these airports  based on geographic dispersion (Southern California, North Texas, and  Central Florida) as well as variation in the types of general aviation  operations present (such as charter and private operations) and size of  aircraft based at each airport. Because we selected a nonprobability  sample of operators to interview, the information obtained cannot be  generalized to all general aviation operators. However, the interviews  provided important perspective to our analysis and corroborated  information we gathered through other means.", "To identify actions TSA and general aviation aircraft operators have taken  to enhance security and how TSA has obtained information on the  implementation of the operators\u2019 actions, we examined documentation on  TSA\u2019s inspection processes for monitoring aircraft operators\u2019  implementation of security programs, including the Transportation  Security Inspector Inspections Handbook, the National Investigations and  Enforcement Manual, and the Compliance Work Plan for Transportation  Security Inspectors. We also reviewed documentation related to aircraft  operators\u2019 implementation of voluntary security initiatives not covered by  TSA security programs, such as guidance for TSA personnel who  conduct outreach to general aviation operators. We reviewed a report  conducted on behalf of DHS examining the potential damage that could  be caused by different types of general aviation aircraft. We also  reviewed the methodology and assumptions associated with this report  and found them to be reasonable and well documented. Also, we  reviewed National Safe Skies Alliance\u2019s General Aviation Airport  Vulnerability Assessment, which contains survey data on security  measures implemented from a sample of general aviation airports, and  TSA\u2019s General Aviation Airport Vulnerability Briefing. We also interviewed  TSA officials on efforts to interact with general aviation associations as a  means to obtain information on security initiatives implemented by private  general aviation operators, including the agency\u2019s interaction with  members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. We also  interviewed TSA Federal Security Directors and Transportation Security  Inspectors whose areas of operation encompass the airports we selected,  as well as airport officials responsible for security at each airport. Finally,  we reviewed TSA data from fiscal years 2005 through 2011 on the  compliance of general aviation operators and flight training providers that  fall under TSA security programs with program requirements. We chose  these dates because they reflect the time frame after the publication of  our previous report on general aviation security. For example, we  obtained compliance data for general aviation operators covered under  the Twelve-Five and Private Charter standard security programs stored in  TSA\u2019s Performance and Results Information System (PARIS) for fiscal  years 2005 through 2011. We identified the frequency that aircraft  operators and flight training providers were reported to be in compliance  with program requirements. As part of this work, we assessed the  reliability of TSA data in PARIS by interviewing TSA officials and  reviewing documentation on controls implemented to ensure the integrity  of the data in the database and found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for use in this report.", "To assess the extent to which TSA has ensured that foreign flight  students seeking flight training in the United States do not pose a security  threat, we reviewed our recent reports related to DHS security threat  assessment processes, and TSA guidance related to procedures for  conducting security threat assessments of several agency programs,  including AFSP. We interviewed TSA officials who perform security  threat assessments and inspections of flight training providers for AFSP  to better understand program operations. To determine whether foreign  nationals applying for FAA airman certificates had previously applied to  AFSP and been vetted by TSA, we obtained from FAA data on foreign  nationals from FAA\u2019s Comprehensive Airmen Information System, also  known as the airmen registry. Specifically, we obtained FAA airmen  registry data, including names and dates of birth, on 25,599 foreign  nationals applying for their first FAA airman private pilot certificate, sport  pilot certificate, or recreational pilot certificates from January 2006  through September 2011. We selected these dates because 2006 was  the first full year after TSA assumed responsibility for AFSP from the  Department of Justice and September 2011 was the end of the fiscal year  for our reporting period. The data did not include information on foreign  nationals applying for FAA airman certificates based on an existing  foreign airmen certificate issued by another government, thus ensuring  that the data we obtained were for foreign nationals who had obtained  flight training in the United States and therefore would have been required  to have applied for vetting under AFSP. We provided the FAA airmen  registry data to TSA so that the agency could conduct a matching process  to determine whether the foreign nationals in the FAA airmen registry  were in the AFSP database and the extent to which they had been  successfully vetted through AFSP. As stated previously, TSA receives  FAA airmen registry data on a daily basis; however, given the specific  parameters we specified for matching FAA airmen registry data against  the AFSP database, we provided TSA with airmen registry data we had  obtained from FAA to allow for easier review and analysis of TSA results.  We found the FAA and TSA data and the approach, methodology, and  results of the data matching process to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We used the results of TSA\u2019s analysis to identify whether  foreign nationals in the FAA airmen registry were not in the AFSP  database, and therefore not approved for flight training through AFSP, as  well as foreign nationals who were in the FAA airmen registry and were in  the AFSP database, but had not been successfully vetted though AFSP.  As part of this work, we also assessed the reliability of data in the FAA  airmen registry as well as data in the AFSP database by interviewing FAA  and TSA officials, and reviewing documentation on controls implemented  to ensure the integrity of the data in the database and found both to be  sufficiently reliable for use in this report.", "We also spoke to TSA inspection officials to discuss common issues  associated with compliance inspections and efforts to address  compliance deficiencies. We reviewed documentation on TSA compliance  procedures for flight training providers participating in the AFSP program  and reviewed summary statistics for the period fiscal year 2005 through  fiscal year 2011, on flight school compliance compiled by TSA. We also  performed an analysis on compliance data for flight training providers. We  ascertained the reliability of AFSP inspection results derived from PARIS,  by interviewing TSA officials and reviewing documentation on controls  implemented to ensure the integrity of the data in the database, and  found the inspection data sufficiently reliable for use in this report. We  also spoke with cognizant TSA and ICE officials to discuss the pre-pilot  initiative under way with ICE to detect foreign nationals registered with  AFSP who overstayed their period of admission in the country or entered  the country illegally. We also reviewed documentation from an ICE  investigation related to a Boston-area flight training provider. We  compared the names of foreign nationals ICE identified in this  investigation with the names of AFSP candidates assigned to the flight  school, to ascertain which of the AFSP candidates had undergone a  security threat assessment and passed, but were subsequently found via  the ICE investigation to have either overstayed their admission period or  entered the country without inspection. We also evaluated TSA\u2019s efforts  to assess risk for the AFSP against Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2011 through July 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
