The proposals GAO studied treat DI beneficiaries similar to Old-Age and Survivor Insurance beneficiaries. However, the circumstances facing disabled workers differ from those facing retired workers. The differences between disabled workers and retired workers suggest that Social Security reform proposals should be viewed not only in light of their effects on retired workers but also explicitly for their effect on disabled beneficiaries and their families."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although much has been written about the effects of reform on the  solvency of the Social Security program and on the benefits of retired  workers, little attention has been directed to the effects of reform  proposals on the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program or on  the benefits that disabled beneficiaries and their families receive. Yet, in  1999, disabled beneficiaries and their families accounted for about 17  percent of all Social Security beneficiaries. These 7.4 million beneficiaries  included disabled workers, families of disabled workers, and adult disabled  children who were dependents of disabled, deceased, or retired workers.", "You asked us to assess the potential effects of Social Security reform  options on the solvency of the DI trust fund and the benefits disabled  beneficiaries receive. In this report, we analyze both the potential effects of  comprehensive Social Security reform proposals on the solvency of the DI  trust fund and on the benefits disabled beneficiaries receive and the likely  contribution that individual proposal provisions would make to these  effects. You also asked us to examine the potential implications of Social  Security reform for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program,  which provides significant income support for low-income individuals with  disabilities.", "In response to your request, we analyzed the five Social Security reform  proposals that we have previously reviewed. These proposals include that  of President Clinton as well as four of the proposals discussed in the 106th  Congress: Archer-Shaw, Kolbe-Stenholm (H.R. 1793), Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux- Grassley (S. 1383), and Kasich. In these proposals, we identified 11 major types of provisions and examined their effect on trust fund solvency and DI  benefits. We compared the benefits under these reform proposals with  benefits under two alternative current-program scenarios that also achieve  trust fund solvency: one that would maintain current benefits while  increasing payroll taxes and another that would maintain current payroll  tax rates while reducing benefits.", "To analyze the effects of Social Security reform on DI trust fund solvency,  we used estimates produced by the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA)  Office of the Chief Actuary as well as our estimates using the SSASIM  policy simulation model. We also used the SSASIM model to examine the  effects of these reforms on benefits that disabled beneficiaries receive. Our  estimates using the SSASIM model are based on the intermediate  assumptions reported in the 1999 Social Security Trustees Report because  the Office of the Chief Actuary has scored only a few of the proposals we  studied using the assumptions in the 2000 Social Security Trustees Report.", "We analyzed the effects of Social Security reform on the Old-Age and  Survivors Insurance (OASI) program as well as on the DI program because  the solvency estimates are generally available for the combined programs  only and because many disabled beneficiaries receive benefits from the  OASI program. For example, more than 90 percent of the adult disabled  children who receive Social Security benefits are dependents of deceased  or retired workers and therefore receive OASI benefits. Disabled workers  who have reached retirement age and their dependents receive benefits  from the OASI program because DI benefits are automatically converted to  retirement insurance benefits at the normal retirement age (NRA).", "Because little information is available about the earnings levels and work  history of DI beneficiaries, we assumed the best possible case for disabled  beneficiaries. Such an assumption would generally provide an upper limit  to the benefits that most disabled beneficiaries could expect to receive  under the Social Security reform proposals. We assumed they work full- time until they receive disability benefits. We also assumed they received  earnings equal to either the average economywide earnings of men or 45  percent of the average earnings of men. Following the approach taken in  the Report of the 1994-96 Advisory Council on Social Security, we chose a  low administrative cost for the individual account (IA), implicitly assuming  a centralized system of recordkeeping and a limited number of investment  options. We assumed that individuals self-annuitized by drawing down the  balance in the IAs through periodic withdrawals. As a result, the benefit  income for the disabled beneficiaries whom we studied in this report will  clearly be greater than that for disabled beneficiaries with intermittent or  less than full-time employment who pay annuitization costs and relatively  higher administrative costs on their IAs.", "We conducted our work between September 1999 and November 2000 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Working-age adults with disabilities may obtain cash benefits from a  number of private and public programs.

However,  in 1996, only 26 percent of private sector employees had long-term  disability coverage under employer-sponsored private insurance plans.  Thus, the DI program is an important provider of monthly benefits to  workers who are no longer able to work because of a severe long-term  disability.", "Most Social Security disabled beneficiaries, including disabled workers and  their dependents, receive benefits from the DI program. However, adult  disabled children who are dependents of deceased or retired workers, and  disabled workers who have reached retirement age and their dependents,  receive monthly benefits from the OASI program. In 1999, about 6.5  million beneficiaries received DI cash benefits totaling about $51.3 billion,  while about 38.0 million beneficiaries received OASI cash benefits totaling  about $334.4 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Benefits Available Under Current Law", "paragraphs": ["Benefits for both OASI and DI beneficiaries are based on the application of  the Social Security benefit formula to the worker\u2019s average monthly  lifetime earnings.

Because monthly benefits for DI and OASI beneficiaries are based on the  same benefit formula, any change in this formula, as has been proposed in  some Social Security reform plans, could affect benefits disabled workers  as well as retired workers receive. Both DI and OASI monthly benefits will  also be affected by other proposed Social Security reform changes, such as  decreases in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). However, only OASI  monthly benefits are affected by proposed changes in the retirement age.", "Under current law, the age at which an individual is first eligible to receive  full retirement benefits, or NRA, is gradually increasing from 65 to 66 for  those who turn 62 in 2005 and to 67 for those who turn 62 in 2022. Benefits  retired workers take before NRA are subject to an actuarial reduction.  Benefits taken by workers who postpone retirement and work between  NRA and age 70 are increased through a delayed retirement credit for each  month retirement is delayed. The benefit formula is weighted in favor of  workers with lower earnings, so that benefits replace a larger proportion of  their earnings. Benefits are adjusted each year, based on increases in the  Consumer Price Index (CPI) in order to account for inflation.", "Auxiliary benefits are paid to eligible dependents and are 50 percent of the  Social Security benefit that the disabled or retired worker receives, subject  to a maximum family limit on benefits. Upon the death of an insured  worker, the eligible spouse receives 100 percent of the worker\u2019s benefit  (subject to reduction for age) and the eligible surviving child receives 75  percent of the benefit.", "Individuals who receive low levels of DI or OASI benefits can supplement  them with benefits from SSI. The SSI program, which was authorized in  1972 under title XVI of the Social Security Act, is funded through general  revenues and provides monthly benefits to aged, blind, and disabled  individuals who have income and resources below specified thresholds.  The DI and SSI programs use the same criteria and procedures for  determining disability. However, unlike DI beneficiaries, SSI recipients do  not need to have a work history to qualify for benefits. The maximum  federal SSI monthly benefit in 1999 was $500 for an individual. This  monthly benefit level is reduced, depending on a recipient\u2019s income and  other sources of support, such as Social Security benefits. In 1999, 36  percent of SSI recipients also received Social Security benefits from either  OASI or DI. The average federal monthly benefit in 1999 was $249 for the  aged, $351 for the blind, and $364 for the disabled. In addition to the federal  SSI benefits, some states provide supplemental benefits that are intended  to reflect regional differences in living costs.", "Social Security is financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis, which means  that the Social Security payroll taxes that current workers pay are used to  pay for current benefits. In 1999, there were approximately 3.4 workers for  every beneficiary, but this number is projected to fall to 2.1 by 2030.", "Because of this change in the ratio of workers to beneficiaries, and other  factors, the Social Security trust funds will have a projected financial  shortfall or funding gap of approximately $3 trillion over the next 75 years.  According to estimates in the 2000 Trustees Report, the OASI trust fund is  projected to have sufficient funds to fully finance benefits until 2039, while  the DI trust fund is projected to have sufficient funds to fully finance  benefits until 2023. After the trust funds are exhausted\u2014that is, after 2039  for the OASI trust fund and 2023 for the DI trust fund\u2014the annual tax  revenues of the trust funds are expected to be sufficient to cover only  about 70 percent of annual expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Social Security Reform Proposals Address Solvency by Affecting the Level and Structure of Benefits", "paragraphs": ["In order to address the solvency of the trust funds, a number of Social  Security reforms have been proposed.

However, it explicitly refers to disabled workers when it discusses  distributions from the IAs. Workers can receive distributions from their IAs  when they become entitled to either DI or OASI benefits.", "The Kasich proposal does not explicitly refer to disabled beneficiaries  when discussing changes in benefits or the establishment of IAs, although  disability benefits are affected by the provisions in the Kasich proposal.

Benefits of both disabled and retired workers are affected by reductions in  the COLA. However, the provision in both proposals that increases the  benefit computation period amends a clause in the Social Security Act that  refers only to retired workers. The provision increasing the retirement age  affects only the benefits of retired workers. Under both proposals, the  restrictions on IA distributions refer to receipt either at retirement age or at  the attainment of a particular level of funds in the IA. Under the Gregg- Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley proposal, the insurance benefit is reduced by an  offset related to the amount of contributions to the IA.

The actuarial balance as  calculated by the Office of the Chief Actuary is the difference between the  present value of the Social Security program\u2019s revenues and costs over a 75- year period and is expressed as a percentage of taxable payroll. If  revenues exceed costs, the actuarial balance is positive; if costs exceed  revenues, the actuarial balance is negative, indicating a deficit. In 1999,  under current law, the Social Security program faced an actuarial deficit  equal to 2.07 percent of taxable payroll. This figure represents the amount  of the payroll tax rate increase in 1999 that would establish actuarial  balance in the Social Security trust funds over the subsequent 75 years. In  other words, increasing the payroll tax rate from the current 12.4 percent to  14.47 percent of payroll would establish actuarial balance in the trust  funds.", "The Office of the Chief Actuary provides annual estimates of the actuarial  balance for the combined OASI and DI trust funds under current law and,  when requested by the Congress or the executive branch, estimates of the  actuarial balance under reform proposals. The estimates of the actuarial  balance under current law and each of the reform proposals we studied are  presented in table 4. The actuaries estimated that the trust funds\u2019 deficit of  2.07 percent of taxable payroll under current law would either be sharply  reduced or become a surplus for the combined trust funds under the  reform proposals we studied. A surplus in the combined trust funds could  mean a surplus in one trust fund and a deficit in the other. However, a  reallocation of payroll tax rates between the two funds would be expected  in this case.", "The President\u2019s proposal would reduce the actuarial deficit but is not  expected to eliminate it. This would be achieved through general fund  transfers every year from 2011 to 2050 and by allowing some limited  investment in equities, which have a higher rate of return than do the  government bonds in which the trust funds have traditionally been  invested. Estimates for two other proposals result in a small surplus for  the combined trust funds. The Kolbe-Stenholm proposal would generate its  surplus through benefit cuts and general fund transfers. In the Archer- Shaw proposal, general fund transfers would finance the contributions to  the IAs that the proposal would establish. The proceeds from these  accounts would be transferred to the trust funds when benefits are  received. The proposal also calls for reducing payroll taxes in response to  the additional trust fund revenue expected to accrue from the proceeds of  these IAs.", "The other proposals we examined would result in larger estimated  actuarial surpluses for the combined trust funds. The Kasich proposal  would accomplish this by reducing the initial level of insurance benefits  and then further decreasing insurance benefits by a fixed percentage for  each year of contribution to an IA, as well as by borrowing from the general  fund. The Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley proposal would achieve its  surplus through a mix of benefit cuts and revenue transfers that would  offset the loss of trust fund revenues resulting from the redirection of a  portion of the payroll taxes to the IAs.", "The reform proposals we studied differ in the magnitude of the stipulated  transfers from general revenue. Transfers are smaller under the Kolbe- Stenholm and Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley proposals, which contain a  number of provisions to achieve solvency by changing benefits or  revenues. Under the Kolbe-Stenholm proposal, general revenue transfers  range from 0.03 percent of taxable payroll in 2000 to 0.80 percent of taxable  payroll in 2060. General revenue transfers under the Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux- Grassley proposal range from 0.6 percent of taxable payroll in 2000 to 1.2  percent of taxable payroll in 2060. General revenue transfers are larger  under the proposals with fewer alternative provisions for attaining  solvency. Under the Kasich proposal, for example, the magnitude of the  transfers ranges from 1.17 percent of taxable payroll in 2000 to 1.57 percent  of taxable payroll around 2030. Under the President\u2019s proposal, transfers  range from a high of 2.41 percent of taxable payroll to a low of 0.52 percent  of taxable payroll between 2011 and 2050.

According  to the Office of the Chief Actuary, both provisions would be expected to  have a positive effect on the solvency of the DI trust fund. The Archer-Shaw  proposal calls for a gradual transfer of the income from the IA balances,  which are financed from general revenue, to the trust funds. In the case of  disabled workers, the income from the IA balances would be transferred to  the DI trust fund. This provision also would have a positive effect on the DI  trust fund. The Kasich proposal contains three provisions that would have  a positive effect on DI trust fund solvency: the indexing of benefits to  prices rather than to wages, which reduces benefits; the reduction in  benefits for individuals who opt to contribute a portion of their payroll tax  to an IA; and the borrowing of funds from general revenue. The loss of  payroll tax revenue associated with individuals opting for IAs would  increase the DI trust fund\u2019s deficit, and the general fund loans are designed  to compensate for this.", "Both the Kolbe-Stenholm and the Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley proposals  contain multiple provisions that would affect DI trust fund solvency.  Provisions that reduce the COLA and change the PIA formula so as to  reduce benefits for disabled workers lower program costs and, therefore,  improve the actuarial balance for the DI program.

Even provisions that  appear to be focused on retirement benefits can have an effect on the DI  trust fund. For example, increasing the retirement age also increases the  age at which disability insurance benefits are converted to retirement  insurance benefits. As a result, disability beneficiaries remain on the DI  program longer, increasing costs to the DI program.", "We were able to use the SSASIM model to estimate the effects on solvency  of certain of the provisions in the reform proposals.

The remaining three reform proposals\u2014Kasich, Kolbe-Stenholm, and  Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley\u2014would affect the levels of insurance  benefits DI and OASI beneficiaries receive by changing the PIA formula for  calculating initial benefits, reducing the COLA, raising the retirement age,  or increasing the number of years of earnings used in computing benefits.  How a beneficiary\u2019s total benefit income (reduced insurance benefits plus  IA income) under these three proposals compares with the benefits  received under a maintain-benefits scenario or a maintain-tax-rates  scenario depends both on the extent of the decrease in the insurance  benefits and on the amount of income received from the IA.", "Our maintain-benefits scenario achieves solvency through increased  payroll taxes while current-law benefits are maintained. Our maintain-tax- rates scenario achieves solvency through benefit reductions while holding  current payroll tax rates at today\u2019s levels.

For the IAs in our analysis, we assumed that individuals would have  portfolios with a smaller percentage invested in equities as they got older.

Under these proposals, it is possible that the IA  income might compensate for the decline in insurance benefits resulting  from other provisions.

The reductions in benefits resulting from the decline in the  COLA and the changes in the PIA formula are so great that the income from  the IA would be insufficient to completely compensate for this loss for the  disabled-worker beneficiaries with the selected characteristics that we  examined. Disabled workers with low earnings and their dependents would  receive greater benefit income under the Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley  proposal than under the maintain-benefits solvency scenario.

Consequently, benefit income for dependents of disabled or retired  workers would be reduced under the Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley,  Kasich, and Kolbe-Stenholm proposals not only because of reductions in  the insurance benefit but also because it does not include income from  individual accounts.

To see how the income received from the IA  would vary by age of first receipt of DI benefits, we compared the income  received from the IA by workers who began receiving DI benefits at  different ages. Figures 9 and 10 provide the net addition of the IAs to  benefit income\u2014that is, the addition to benefit income after reductions are  made in the insurance benefit in response to the income from the IA.  Figures 9 and 10 indicate that the income received from the IA increases  with the age of first receipt of DI benefits. The later that DI benefits are  received, the greater the number of years in the labor force, the number of  years funds are deposited in the IA, and the number of years the IAs accrue  compound interest. The addition of IA income to benefit income across  ages would be greatest under the Kolbe-Stenholm proposal, which would  not reduce the insurance benefit in response to the income received from  the IA. The Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley proposal would reduce the  insurance benefit by an amount that reflects the present value of the  government contributions to the IA plus the interest that would have  accrued had these contributions been invested at the interest rate earned  by the OASDI trust funds.

For the beneficiaries who receive  only Social Security and not SSI, the previously mentioned decrease in  benefit income would lower unearned income, which would make some  eligible for SSI benefits. This would increase both the number of  beneficiaries and the cost to the program. However, the full effect on SSI  would not be felt immediately because most of the individual provisions  within these proposals are to be phased in over time and in many cases are  not to be completely in effect until 2020.

However, most disabled beneficiaries with the  characteristics we studied would receive lower benefits under reform than  under a solvency scenario that maintained current-law benefits while  raising payroll taxes. This reduction in benefits under reform to levels  below that of current law would occur even though we assumed an optimal  set of conditions for disabled beneficiaries: full-time work until receipt of  DI benefits and low administrative costs and no annuitization costs for the  IAs. Consequently, the typical DI beneficiary could receive lower benefits  than the DI beneficiaries with the selected characteristics we studied.", "The proposals we studied treat DI beneficiaries similarly to OASI  beneficiaries. However, the circumstances facing disabled workers differ  from those facing retired workers. For example, the disabled worker\u2019s  options for alternative sources of income, especially earnings-related  income, to augment the reduced benefits are likely to be more limited than  are those for the retired worker. Further, DI beneficiaries are entering the  program at younger ages and remaining in the program in most cases until  death or retirement. Thus, disabled beneficiaries could be subject to these  reductions in benefits for many years. They will also have smaller balances  in their IAs because of fewer working years in which to make IA  contributions and accrue compounded interest. In addition, under several  proposals, disabled beneficiaries cannot gain access to income from  individual accounts until they reach retirement age. These differences  between disabled and retired workers suggest that Social Security reform  proposals should be viewed not only in light of their effects on retired  workers but also explicitly for their effect on disabled beneficiaries and  their families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SSA. In commenting on this report, the  agency noted that we addressed an important topic that has until now  received little attention. Specifically, SSA highlighted two points in our  report as being important for policy makers considering changes to Social  Security: that individual accounts might not fully offset Social Security  insurance benefit reductions for some beneficiaries and that SSI benefits  might increase as they compensate for the decline in DI benefits resulting  from Social Security reform. However, the agency had some concerns  about our use of a \u201cbest case\u201d scenario to estimate the effects of policy  options and about the assumptions underlying this \u201cbest case\u201d scenario,  citing specifically earnings levels, life expectancy, and investment return  assumptions that SSA thought did not reflect the actual situation of  disabled beneficiaries. On the basis of these concerns, the agency  suggested that we give the report balance by adding a \u201cworst case\u201d  scenario. SSA also expressed concern regarding our focus on lifetime  benefits, a measure that it believes does not adequately reflect living  standards at specific points in time. Finally, SSA suggested that we include  a measure reporting on money\u2019s worth or internal rates of return in our  table 1 that compares costs and benefits of Social Security reform  proposals.

We did not examine \u201cworse case\u201d  scenarios because the \u201cbest case\u201d scenario demonstrates that most DI  beneficiaries would be adversely affected by the reform proposals we  analyzed. While including the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario SSA suggested could  provide a specific lower limit to a range of possible benefit outcomes, that  lower limit would be useful only if accompanied by an evaluation of the  adequacy of that benefit level, which is beyond the scope of this report.", "In building a \u201cbest case\u201d scenario, we used the earnings of men because  they tend to have higher earnings than women do. To examine low-wage  earners, we simulated workers who earn 45 percent of average earners,  which is the standard low level of earnings the Office of the Chief Actuary  uses. Benefits declined at this earnings level as they would for workers  earning even less. We assumed individuals lived until 79 because almost  one-third of individuals first receiving DI benefits at age 45 live that long,  and the number of these individuals is significant enough to warrant study.  With respect to SSA\u2019s concern about our use of an equity return of 7  percent, we note that this is a figure currently used in projections, including  those of the Office of the Chief Actuary. We chose not to adjust for risk  because there is no one risk-adjusted measure that everyone agrees is the  best measure, and we believed that our analysis would be more clearly  understood with the simplifying \u201cbest case\u201d assumptions.", "With respect to SSA\u2019s concern with our focus on lifetime benefits, we  acknowledge that we do not address the issue of variations across plans in  living standards before retirement age resulting from differences in  account access rules.

Kasich reduces  all three brackets, the 0.90 bracket as well as the 0.15 and 0.32 brackets.  These reductions apply to both disabled and retired workers and their  dependents. This is why benefits for lower earners under Kasich\u2019s PIA  provision are below those calculated in the maintain-tax-rates scenario.

These earnings are based on the national average annual earnings of  covered workers with earnings. Using 1998 data from SSA, we compared  our choice of earnings levels with the earnings levels of actual new  beneficiaries. We did so by calculating the DI benefit corresponding to our  selected earnings levels and comparing these benefit levels with the  distribution of benefits actual DI beneficiaries received in 1998. We found  that about 42 percent of all new beneficiaries in 1998 received benefits that  correspond to earnings that are less than 45 percent of average earnings,  about 38 percent of new beneficiaries received benefits corresponding to  earnings that are between 45 percent of average earnings and average  earnings, and about 20 percent of new beneficiaries received benefits  corresponding to earnings that are greater than the average level.", "We analyzed how the reforms affected individuals with three different ages  of first receipt of DI benefits (35, 45, and 55) to compare the experiences of  people disabled at younger ages with those disabled at older ages.

In 1999, 19.3 percent of men\u2019s new  benefits were awarded to individuals younger than 40, 24 percent to those  in their 40s, and 40 percent to those in their 50s.

For new  awardees younger than 35, mental disorders accounted for 34 percent  while diseases of the musculoskeletal system accounted for 11 percent.

However, little  information is available on the wages, earnings histories, and periods of  nonwork of the disabled. This makes it difficult to choose a \u201ctypical\u201d  earnings level and earnings pattern for them. The benefit income for our  \u201cbest case\u201d disabled individuals will clearly be greater than that for  disabled individuals receiving lower earnings from intermittent and less  than full-time employment.

Thus, differences in benefit income  across individuals would be the result of differences in reform proposals  and not the result of differences in individual characteristics. Because of  the possibility that actual disabled individuals might have a lower life  expectancy than we assumed for our simulation, we asked SSA\u2019s Office of  the Chief Actuary to send us death rates for men who were born in 1986  and began receiving DI benefits at age 45.

The Council  considered an option to create IAs alongside the Social Security system  with a centralized system of recordkeeping and limited investment choices.  The estimate of 0.105 percent of assets was a consensus of the Council  members. We also assumed that individuals do not annuitize but, rather,  draw down the balance in the IA through periodic withdrawals.  Consequently, the balance in the account is not reduced by the costs  associated with purchasing an annuity. We also assumed that individuals  know how long they are going to live and thus determine the schedule of  periodic withdrawals so as to use up the entire balance in the IA by the  time they die.
