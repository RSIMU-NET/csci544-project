The Army is responsible for the medical care of all military animals, including MWDs. Questions have been raised as to whether MWDs' experiences during deployment may result in conditions that pose future health challenges. Based on those questions, a House Report accompanying the proposed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to assess end-of-service veterinary care for MWDs.", "This report examines (1) how DOD tracks information about MWDs, and how many MWDs were adopted, transferred, or euthanized over the past 5 years (2011-2015); (2) prevalent medical conditions of adopted MWDs for 2014 and 2015; and (3) what assistance is available for individuals who adopt MWDs.", "GAO obtained and analyzed data from the three systems used to track information on MWDs, observed system demonstrations, interviewed Air Force and Army officials, and reviewed related documentation.

According to an Air Force official, the number of MWDs adopted or transferred over the past 5 years (2011 through 2015) varied based on changes in deployment needs. The number of euthanized MWDs varied to a lesser extent.", "Based on medical data available for 421 of 772 MWDs adopted during 2014 and 2015, GAO found that the most prevalent medical conditions included skin and dental issues. An Army veterinarian told GAO that these medical conditions are unlikely to result in MWDs' removal from service as these conditions generally can be treated or resolved. Other prevalent medical conditions, such as arthritis, are associated with musculoskeletal issues, which are more likely to result in MWDs' removal from service. The veterinarian told us these types of musculoskeletal issues are common in breeds maintained by the MWD program, which include Labrador Retrievers, Belgian Malinois, and German Shepherd dogs.", "While owners of adopted MWDs are responsible for the costs of veterinary care, some assistance with these costs is available through nonprofit organizations, such as the U.S. War Dogs Association. Individuals with access to DOD medical care\u2014such as active-duty servicemembers and their dependents\u2014may also purchase care for their adopted MWDs at veterinary clinics located at military installations.

Currently, MWDs serve as extensions of military law enforcement, and  assist with the detection and tracking of drugs, explosives, and physical  threats to servicemembers. The Air Force\u2019s 341st Training Squadron at  Joint Base San Antonio, Texas is responsible for procuring and assigning  all MWDs for the military and transporting them to military installations.  The Air Force also trains a majority of the MWDs, although the other  military services\u2014Army, Navy, and Marine Corps\u2014may also provide  training for the MWDs assigned to them. The U.S. Army Medical  Command\u2019s Public Health Command Regions and subordinate Public  Health Activities are responsible for the veterinary care of all military- owned animals, including MWDs. As of October 2016, about 1,800  MWDs were in service.", "MWDs may be removed from service when they can no longer perform  their duties due to medical or behavior problems, are no longer needed  by the military, or under other circumstances. When MWDs are removed  from service, they can be placed for adoption, either to a private party,  such as a former handler, or by transfer to a law enforcement agency, or  euthanized for health or behavior reasons. Once MWDs have been adopted or transferred, DOD is no longer responsible for them, including  their medical care.", "Questions have been raised as to whether the environments or situations  that MWDs are exposed to during deployment may result in conditions  that pose future health challenges once the MWD is removed from  service. Based on those questions, House Report 114-537,  accompanying the proposed version of the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, included a provision  for us to assess end-of-service veterinary care for MWDs. This report  examines (1) how DOD tracks information about MWDs, and how many  MWDs were adopted, transferred, or euthanized over the past 5 years  (2011-2015); (2) prevalent medical conditions of adopted MWDs for 2014  and 2015; and (3) what assistance is available for individuals who adopt  MWDs.", "To determine how DOD tracks information about MWDs, and how many  were adopted, transferred, or euthanized over the past 5 years (2011- 2015), we interviewed relevant Air Force and Army officials, reviewed  data from the systems used to track information about MWDs, and  reviewed relevant documentation related to these systems. Additionally,  we visited Joint Base San Antonio, Texas and observed demonstrations  of the following three systems: 1) the Working Dog Management System  (WDMS)\u2014the computer system used to manage the full life cycle of  MWDs, 2) the Central Repository\u2014paper copies of records for MWDs  that have been removed from service, and 3) the Remote Online  Veterinary Record (ROVR)\u2014the electronic medical record system for all  military animals that have been treated by a military veterinarian. We  also reviewed data on the number of MWDs that were adopted,  transferred, or euthanized over the past 5 years and interviewed Air Force  officials about how reports with these data for 2011 and 2012 were  compiled for Congress, and how data for 2013-2015 were obtained from  WDMS and verified. Based on our review of the data, relevant  documentation, and interviews with relevant officials, we determined the  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objective.", "To describe prevalent medical conditions of adopted MWDs for 2014 and  2015, we obtained and analyzed available medical information for these  MWDs from ROVR. To do this, we obtained identification numbers for  the MWDs that were adopted during this time from WDMS and used this  information to identify electronic medical records in ROVR. We  specifically focused on electronic medical records that had \u201cmaster  problem lists,\u201d which are lists of diagnosed medical conditions. We  obtained electronic medical records with master problem lists as available  for MWDs that were adopted in 2014 and 2015. According to Army  officials who maintain the database, while all MWDs had hard-copy  medical records with master problem lists prior to the implementation of  ROVR, some MWDs adopted in 2014 and 2015 may not have had  electronic medical records or master problem lists for the following  reasons:  1.  According to Army officials, only active MWDs had their hard copy  medical records scanned into ROVR when it was initially  implemented. As a result, MWDs that had been designated for  adoption at that time do not have electronic medical records.  2.  When hard-copy medical records were scanned into ROVR, certain  types of information, such as master problem lists, had to be manually  transcribed. However, according to Army officials, this did not always  occur, and as a result, some of the MWDs that were adopted in 2014  and 2015 had electronic medical records that did not include master  problem lists.", "Our analysis is not generalizable to all MWDs that were adopted during  this time because we did not have electronic medical records with master  problem lists for all of the MWDs adopted in 2014 and 2015. However,  based on our review of ROVR, verification of the data, and interviews with  Army officials, we determined that the data on medical conditions that we  obtained from the electronic medical files with master problem lists were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objective. We also  interviewed the chief of staff of a network of private veterinary hospitals in  New Jersey, as well as representatives from a national network of private  veterinary hospitals to discuss the potential costs for treating MWDs for  the prevalent medical conditions we identified. The chief of staff from  the network of private veterinary hospitals in New Jersey also provided us  with estimated costs of preventative care needed for older MWDs.", "In order to determine what assistance is available for individuals who  adopt MWDs, we interviewed relevant nonprofit organizations that provide  assistance for adopted MWDs. To identify what types of veterinary  services are available through the military, we interviewed officials with  the Army\u2019s Public Health Center and the DOD MWD Veterinary Services  Office at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas and reviewed relevant  documentation about the availability of veterinary services for privately  owned animals, including adopted MWDs.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to March 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The handler is responsible for maintaining  contact with the Kennel Master and updating this contact information, if  needed. In the event that multiple handlers are interested in adopting the  MWD, the Unit Commander of the entity that owns the MWD is  responsible for determining which handler is in the best interest of the  MWD. Air Force officials told us that in these cases, the most recent  handler would typically adopt the MWD.", "Air Force officials told us that they are in the process of updating their  adoption policy. For example, the new policy outlines a method for  recording whether or not the MWD was adopted by a former handler.  They also told us they plan to update the MWD service record to include  a checkbox to indicate whether the MWD was adopted by a handler, and  that these service records will be scanned into WDMS.
