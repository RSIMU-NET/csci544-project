As of April 2012, DOT has executed 27 TIFIA credit agreements for 26 projects with project sponsors such as state DOTs and transit agencies. Overall, DOT has provided nearly $9.1 billion in credit assistance through 26 loans and one loan guarantee. By mode, there are 17 highway, 5 transit, and 4 intermodal projects. Most projects have a total cost of over $1 billion. DOT monitors individual credit agreements but does not systematically assess whether its TIFIA portfolio as a whole is achieving the program\u0092s goals of leveraging federal funds and encouraging private co-investment. DOT has identified goals and objectives for the TIFIA program, but its limited use of performance measures makes it difficult to determine the degree to which the program is meeting these goals and objectives. Given that DOT already collects project data, it could use these data to better evaluate the program\u0092s overall progress toward meeting its goals.", "In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, DOT used a competitive two-step process to evaluate and invite projects to apply for TIFIA credit assistance to address the considerable increase in demand for the program. First, a multimodal team scored and grouped letters of interest (LOI) using statutory criteria. Second, a group of senior DOT staff reviewed the LOIs based on the criteria and other factors, like available budget authority, and invited a subset to apply\u0097the next step in securing TIFIA assistance. While recent applicants were satisfied with many aspects of the process, they also indicated, along with legal and financial advisors, that the selection process lacks transparency and creates uncertainty in their ability to implement projects. For example, some recent applicants told us it is difficult to understand what characteristics DOT uses to measure how well a project meets each criterion. DOT officials said the agency is taking steps to improve its evaluation process, but since many of the changes were initiated in 2012, it is too soon to tell if they will address recent applicants\u0092 concerns.", "Several factors influence whether project sponsors seek TIFIA assistance. More than 30 of 36 recent applicants we surveyed cited TIFIA\u0092s repayment options (like deferring repayments for 5 years after project completion), low interest rate, and flexible structure (i.e., ability to subordinate TIFIA repayment) as important in their decision to seek assistance. To date, sponsors from 17 states have never sought TIFIA assistance. State DOT respondents from these states cited various reasons for this, including lack of eligible projects and state-imposed borrowing restrictions. Many of these state DOTs indicated that regardless of options for modifying the program, they have no plans to seek TIFIA assistance.", "Several options to change the TIFIA program have been proposed by, among others, Congress and DOT; these options include increasing the program\u0092s funding, increasing the portion of costs that may be covered by TIFIA from 33 percent to 49 percent of project costs, and modifying the selection process.

For the past 3 years, demand for credit assistance has  exceeded the program\u2019s budget resources by a factor of more than 10 to  1.

In addition, we interviewed DOT officials on TIFIA program  goals and performance measures, the selection and evaluation of  projects, the demand for the program, and proposed options to modify  TIFIA. We also interviewed project sponsors, including those that  received credit assistance in California, Colorado, Florida, Texas, and  Virginia, the 5 states with the most TIFIA awards; the state DOTs in North  Carolina and Iowa; private concessionaires, private sector entities that  have entered into agreements with public agencies to allow greater  private sector participation in the delivery and financing of transportation  projects; and legal and financial advisors that have been involved in  securing TIFIA credit assistance to learn about their experience with the  TIFIA program, including the application process, oversight and  monitoring of credit assistance, future demand for the program, and  proposed options to change the program.", "In addition, we surveyed all state departments of transportation and all  recent applicants that submitted an LOI to the TIFIA program in fiscal  years 2010 and 2011 using a web-based survey. The survey recipients  fell into four categories: (1) state DOTs from states from which no  sponsor had ever applied to the TIFIA program, (2) state DOTs from  states for which a sponsor had applied to the TIFIA program but not in  recent years\u2014that is, 2010 or 2011, (3) state DOTs who had recently  applied to the TIFIA program, and (4) other non-state DOT organizations,  such as transit agencies, who had recently applied to the TIFIA program.  Survey respondents were presented with different questions in the survey  depending on their past experience with the TIFIA program and whether  they were state DOTs. In general, the survey topics included the factors  contributing to organizations\u2019 decisions about whether to seek TIFIA  assistance, satisfaction with the process for submitting an LOI to the  TIFIA program, opinions on proposed modifications to the TIFIA program,  potential future demand for the TIFIA program, and characteristics of the  state DOTs. We distributed a link for the survey to 83 organizations by e- mail and also subsequently e-mailed and telephoned nonrespondents to  encourage a higher response rate. We received completed surveys from  66 respondents (80 percent). Of the 66 completed responses, 16 were  state DOTs from states with no TIFIA experience, 14 were from state  DOTs from states with no recent TIFIA experience, 12 were from state  DOTs that were recent applicants, and 24 were from non-state DOT  organizations that were recent applicants.", "To determine options that had been proposed to change the TIFIA  program, we reviewed the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act  of 2012, as reported out by the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act  (MAP-21), as passed by the Senate. We also reviewed other  reauthorization proposals and documents prepared by, among others,  DOT and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation  Officials (AASHTO).

The  Highway Trust Fund is the principal source of funding for federal aid  highway programs and is funded through motor fuel and other highway  use taxes. Grants for transit projects are distributed as part of the federal  transit program through a collection of formula-based and discretionary  programs and are funded primarily by the Mass Transit Account of the  Highway Trust Fund. Supplementing these federal programs is a  collection of financing methods that allow project sponsors\u2014such as state  DOTs and transit agencies\u2014to borrow money through bonds, loans, or  other mechanisms. State DOTs and other project sponsors can raise  money in the bond market through, for example, revenue bonds backed  by anticipated project revenues like tolls; bonds backed by future federal  transportation funds, such as Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles  (GARVEE) or Grant Anticipation Notes (GAN); or general obligation  bonds backed by the full faith and credit of a state or municipality. Project  sponsors may also seek private investment through bank debt, private  equity, or private activity bonds. Through TIFIA, DOT provides loans or  other credit assistance to sponsors of surface transportation projects.

In this role, DOT identifies five key objectives for  the TIFIA program:  facilitate projects with significant public benefits; encourage new revenue streams and private participation;  fill capital market gaps for secondary (subordinate) capital; be a flexible, \u201cpatient\u201d investor willing to take on investor concerns  about investment horizon, liquidity, predictability, and risk; and  limit federal exposure by relying on market discipline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TIFIA Credit Assistance Terms and Eligibility Requirements", "paragraphs": ["DOT provides TIFIA credit assistance in three forms: direct loans, loan  guarantees, and standby lines of credit.

Lines of credit can supplement project revenues during the first  10 years of project operations. In addition, DOT can defer the first TIFIA  repayment until 5 years after substantial completion of a project, and  most project sponsors avail themselves of this option. Other credit  assistance terms include that (1) TIFIA assistance may provide no more  than 33 percent of total project costs, (2) senior debt has an investment- grade credit rating (Baa3/BBB- or higher), and (3) TIFIA assistance can  be subordinate to the project\u2019s senior debt, meaning that senior creditors  may receive project revenues ahead of DOT. According to DOT officials,  the TIFIA program is one of the few federal credit programs in which  federal assistance routinely takes a subordinate position to other,  nonfederal lenders with respect to cash flows.

After demand exceeded available budget resources, DOT  terminated the open application process and instituted an annual, fixed- date solicitation process for sponsors to submit LOIs for credit assistance.

Highway projects account for a majority of all  LOIs submitted to TIFIA program. According to DOT data, highway  projects\u2014such as building new roads and replacing bridges\u2014accounted  for about 60 percent of the 182 LOIs submitted to the TIFIA program from  1999 to 2012. Transit and intermodal projects\u2014such as building new  transit systems and constructing parking garages and facilities linking  various transport modes near airports\u2014account for 18 percent and 10  percent of all LOIs, respectively. In addition, rail, ferry, and ITS projects  account for 4 percent, 2 percent, and 1 percent of LOIs during this time,  respectively. However, no projects in these three modes have received  TIFIA assistance to date. Over the history of the program, the average  total cost of projects seeking TIFIA assistance has been $1.2 billion.

The average total cost of  projects receiving TIFIA credit assistance is $1.4 billion. According to  DOT, TIFIA assistance can help advance large-scale projects that  otherwise might be delayed or deferred because of size or complexity,  and as such, TIFIA projects to date have mainly been large-scale  projects. On average, TIFIA assistance accounts for 24 percent of total  project costs, about 9 percent less than the 33 percent currently permitted  by law.", "To a lesser extent, TIFIA has also been used for transit and intermodal  projects. Four intermodal projects have received credit assistance,  including the Reno ReTRAC project in Nevada, which includes rail and  roadway improvements to improve freight capacity and address  environmental and safety concerns. Five transit projects have received  TIFIA assistance. The Tren Urbano project in Puerto Rico, for example,  constructed a new, fixed-guideway transit system to relieve congestion in  the San Juan area. DOT officials told us that the balance of projects is  becoming more diverse in terms of mode. They noted that sponsors of  transit projects have been slower to use TIFIA assistance in the past,  primarily because transit projects have access to low-cost municipal debt  and do not generate revenue in excess of their operating costs to repay  assistance. Moreover, it can be difficult to integrate TIFIA assistance with  federal funding for transit provided through the New Starts program. However, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, DOT invited the sponsors of 12  projects to apply for TIFIA assistance, which is the next stage in securing  TIFIA assistance, 4 of which were transit projects.", "The Federal Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) New Starts program, part of the Capital  Investment Grant program, is the federal government\u2019s primary financial resource for  supporting new major transit capital projects that are locally planned, implemented, and  operated, such as light rail and bus rapid transit. the private equity accounts for about 17 percent of total project costs.  Defining private participation more broadly, 17 projects with active credit  agreements include either private equity or debt. The average private  investment for projects with active credit agreements, including equity and  debt, is 37 percent of total project costs. The North Tarrant Express, for  example, is a public-private partnership between the Texas Department  of Transportation and a private concessionaire\u2014NTE Mobility Partners\u2014 to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain a 13-mile section of  highway in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Project funds include $426 million  in equity from NTE Mobility Partners and $398 million from private activity  bonds. These two sources of private investment account for about 40  percent of the project\u2019s total cost. Projects with credit agreements  typically pledge user fees or dedicated tax revenue to repay TIFIA  assistance. For 16 credit agreements, user fees like tolls are pledged to  repay assistance, while for 8 credit agreements, tax-backed revenue  streams like local sales taxes are pledged to repay assistance. The  remaining 3 credit agreements use other dedicated revenues, like  availability payments, to repay assistance.", "As of April 2012, DOT reported that it has provided nearly $9.1 billion\u2014 $8.5 billion through direct loans and $600 million in loan guarantees\u2014to  projects at a budgetary cost of about $654 million. The budgetary cost of  TIFIA assistance is the total credit subsidy for all projects, with the credit  subsidy, as noted earlier, being the estimated long-term cost to the  government of providing assistance calculated on a net present value  basis, excluding administrative costs. As such, the credit subsidy reflects  the estimated risk of the loan or assistance. According to DOT, the  original credit subsidy cost for credit agreements ranges from less than 1  percent to over 15 percent of the amount of TIFIA assistance. Projects  that pledge user fees tend to have higher subsidy costs and, thus,  generally entail greater risk to the federal government because actual  usage and fees for a project (such as traffic and toll revenue on a new  road) may not meet projections, particularly early in its operation.

Six project  sponsors have retired their TIFIA credit agreements through early  repayment, by refinancing the loan, or because of expiration of the credit  agreement in the case of a loan guarantee. For example, the Puerto Rico  Highway and Transportation Authority refinanced its TIFIA loan for the  Tren Urbano project with tax-exempt debt about 3 years after DOT fully  disbursed the loan.

These circumstances, according to DOT, required the  agency to establish a process that allows the agency to choose amongst  best-qualified projects in each fiscal year instead of accepting eligible  projects on a first-come, first-served basis as was the case when the  program was undersubscribed.", "DOT\u2019s process for competitively selecting amongst LOIs involved two  steps; first, DOT convened a multimodal team to assess, score, and  group projects using statutory criteria, and second, DOT used a team of  senior-level staff\u2014called the executive leadership team\u2014to review the  multimodal team\u2019s assessments and invite select project sponsors to  submit an application for credit assistance (see fig. 5).", "The multimodal team\u2014composed of staff from different DOT modal  administrations\u2014individually assessed each LOI against the statutory  criteria to assign preliminary scores. Multimodal team members read and  assigned each LOI a numeric score of 0 to 4 for each of the six criteria,  with 0 indicating that a project was not consistent with a criterion and 4 indicating that a project was most consistent with a statutory criterion.While the funding notices defined each of the statutory criteria, they did  not describe specific project qualifications or benefits that would merit a  higher or lower score. Additionally, multimodal team members did not use  any guidance beyond the funding notices to delineate what the possible  range of scores signified in terms of project qualifications and benefits.  DOT officials said that evaluators relied primarily on content in the  submitted LOIs, as well as their own modal expertise as necessary, to  evaluate projects. Each LOI contained information to describe the project  and its proposed financial plan, identify the proposed borrower, explain  how the TIFIA statutory selection criteria are met, and describe the  benefits of the proposed project and its use of TIFIA assistance.", "To finalize their individual scores for each LOI, multimodal team members  compared LOIs with one another to determine the relative merits of each  project when assigning scores. For example, if an LOI received a  preliminary score of 3.5 for the private participation criterion, but when  compared with other projects in its cohort appeared less well aligned with  the private participation criterion, its score would be lowered to reflect its  relative rank among the LOIs. Also, multimodal team members met over  several weeks to discuss and compare LOIs in an effort to help ensure  reliability in scoring across team members. To arrive at a final score for  each LOI, individual team members\u2019 final scores were combined for each  criterion and a cumulative weighted total score based on assigned  weights in regulation was calculated for each project.", "Last, the multimodal team rank ordered the LOIs by the total score and  grouped them into three categories\u2014A, B, and C. DOT officials said that  the multimodal team grouped LOIs based on natural breaks in the  numerical scores. LOIs placed in category A were those that scored the  highest numerically, and thus were considered to be the most consistent  with the statutory criteria. Table 2 details the category grouping for LOIs  by fiscal year.", "As shown in table 2, there was a threefold increase in the number of  category A LOIs from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011. DOT officials  attributed this increase to higher-quality LOI submissions as well as  improved project readiness of resubmitted projects. For projects that  submitted an LOI in fiscal year 2011, 10 of the 34 had previously  submitted an LOI in 2010. For projects that submitted an LOI in fiscal year  2012, 16 of 26 had applied in either fiscal year 2010 or 2011.", "After the multimodal team grouped LOIs and provided a briefing about its  assessment of all projects to the executive leadership team, this second  team reviewed the projects and selected a subset of the category A  projects to advance. According to DOT officials, in its review of projects,  the executive leadership team was not aware of the scoring or ranking  distinctions amongst LOIs in the category because numerical scores  assigned by the multimodal team were removed. Instead, only basic  project information, including high-level project summaries and category groupings (A, B, or C), were provided to the executive leadership team.Similar to the multimodal team evaluation, the executive leadership team  did not use any guidance beyond the funding notice in its review of LOIs  and relied primarily on content in the LOIs to score projects. However, in  some cases, the team sought clarification from DOT staff, including  FHWA division offices in various states, to gather additional information  on a project\u2019s readiness, like its status in the environmental review  process.", "In the fiscal year 2012 funding notice DOT further clarified that it would use factors like  budget authority and geographic dispersion to select from amongst highly rated projects. encompasses factors like the project\u2019s progress in completing  environmental review requirements\u2014was an important consideration in  picking among projects that were consistent with the statutory criteria,  particularly in 2011, when there were a higher number of category A  LOIs. As a result of its review, the executive leadership team invited 4  projects in fiscal year 2010 and 8 projects in fiscal year 2011 to submit a  full TIFIA application. (See table 3.)", "Overall, this two-step process ensured that projects invited to apply were  from among the highest-scoring LOIs overall\u2014that is, from category A\u2014 but did not ensure that the projects selected were those that scored the  highest numerically by the multimodal team. According to DOT officials,  relying on numerical scores alone could provide a false sense of precision  in selecting projects to advance. To date, because only category A  projects are forwarded, no category B or C projects from the multimodal  team evaluation have advanced over category A projects in the executive  leadership team evaluation. DOT officials said that while there are no  specific requirements to do so, the executive leadership team has only  considered advancing LOIs in category A.", "After the executive leadership team has invited the sponsors of projects  to apply for credit assistance, project sponsors must submit a full TIFIA  application, after which DOT conducts a full evaluation of the application  and makes a recommendation to the Credit Council. Then, the Secretary  of Transportation makes the final decision on whether to approve a  project to receive TIFIA credit assistance. Six of the 12 of the project  sponsors that were invited to apply in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 have  not yet submitted an application to DOT but all are still pursuing TIFIA  loans. (See table 4.)", "DOT officials and project sponsors that had executed TIFIA credit  agreements said that the amount of time it takes for sponsors to complete  the application and negotiation process varies by project. Several  factors\u2014such as the status of a project\u2019s environmental review, the  complexity of the project\u2019s finance and delivery approach, and changes to  the project\u2014can influence the length of these processes. According to  DOT, sponsors of four invited projects that have not yet submitted an  application are completing work to comply with federal environmental  requirements. Also, some project sponsors we spoke with said that the  TIFIA application and negotiation processes can be longer for projects  that have more complex financial plans, such as having a less frequently  used revenue stream or relying on future state appropriations. For  example, after being invited to apply, one sponsor we interviewed had to  complete the process to select a private concessionaire for the project;  then, since submitting the TIFIA application, the sponsor has been  working with the TIFIA office regarding uncertainty around appropriations  from the state legislature before beginning the negotiation process.", "For projects not invited to apply, staff from the TIFIA office provided  feedback to sponsors on their LOIs upon request. According to DOT  officials, the primary aim of feedback is to explain how the LOI performed  against each criterion. In addition, feedback included information on how  a project sponsor could improve an LOI for resubmission, such as  explaining that it needs to provide more details on specific project  benefits. However, through this feedback, a project sponsor is not  informed about the numeric scoring or ranking of its LOI relative to other  LOIs. In some cases, DOT officials said that the feedback provided  indicated that there was nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with a project\u2019s LOI but that it  was not invited to apply given the strength of the pool of LOIs submitted  in that round."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TIFIA Selection Process Could Benefit from Greater Transparency", "paragraphs": ["While project sponsors and other stakeholders we interviewed were  satisfied with many aspects of DOT\u2019s selection process, they cited two  areas of the TIFIA selection process that they found to be less  satisfactory\u2014DOT\u2019s application of selection criteria and the uncertainty of  the timing of the process. Twenty-seven of the 36 recent TIFIA applicants  that responded to our survey indicated that they were satisfied with DOT\u2019s  explanation of the application process in funding notices, and 28 of the  recent applicants reported that the LOI format allowed them to provide  sufficient detail about their project. In addition, several applicants told us  that the TIFIA selection process was fairly simple to understand and not  overly burdensome, and many applicants and advisors we interviewed  told us that they found the TIFIA staff to be very cooperative and helpful.  Moreover, many recent applicants told us that they appreciated that DOT  gave feedback to the sponsors of unsuccessful LOIs.", "DOT provided these clarifications beginning in fiscal year 2010 in the annual TIFIA  funding notices. The livability, economic competitiveness, and safety clarifications are part  of the National or Regional Significance criterion and sustainability and state of good  repair clarifications are part of the Environment criterion. unclear how one qualified project is selected over another in the  competitive process. In addition, one recent applicant we interviewed said  that it does not know what characteristics DOT looks for or uses to  determine if a project does or does not meet a criterion, particularly for  the livability clarification in national or regional significance. Some recent  applicants also indicated that the LOI evaluation and selection process  remained unclear, even after receiving feedback from DOT. Of the 21  recent applicants that indicated they received feedback, 8 reported that it  was slightly or not at all useful in understanding the scoring of their  LOIs\u2014the primary aim of feedback.", "Several financial and legal advisors as well as private concessionaires we  interviewed also said that there is a lack of transparency in the application  of the criteria. These advisors indicated that DOT could be more  transparent about the selection criteria and scoring process it uses to  select projects. As we reported previously regarding competitively  selected funding programs, were DOT to make additional information on  its selection decisions publicly available, potential applicants would have  better information on how to create and submit well-developed projects.  When such information is not made available, DOT may invite speculation  that projects were selected for reasons other than merit.", "In addition, recent applicants and financial and legal advisors we  interviewed said the timing of the LOI evaluation and selection process is  inconsistent from year to year and therefore creates uncertainty.  Specifically, several applicants and advisors we interviewed told us that  the inconsistent timing in both the dates of the release of DOT\u2019s funding  notice and LOI submission deadline, as well as the announcement of the  outcome of the selection process, contributes to this uncertainty.Because TIFIA projects are typically high-cost projects with multiple  funding and financing streams, the uncertainty about when a project can  submit an LOI and more importantly, when a project can count on a TIFIA  credit agreement to fill a funding gap, can affect the financial feasibility of  these projects. For example, one financial advisor said that because the  current LOI process occurs only once per year, it makes it difficult to plan  and to coordinate with other vital project planning pieces, like state  budget cycles, environmental reviews, and private investors\u2019 timelines. If  a project sponsor misses the solicitation for a particular year, it has to wait  another year to submit an LOI. The uncertainty as to when the outcome of  the selection process will be announced can also affect projects.  According to one financial advisor, project delays can affect construction  costs or public support for the project, among other things. DOT officials  said that the timing of the annual solicitation is due, in part, to receiving  budget authority for the TIFIA program on a year-to-year rather than a  multiyear basis. On the basis of feedback from fiscal year 2010  applicants, DOT has also tried to shorten the LOI evaluation and selection  process in subsequent years so that applicants learn outcomes sooner.  For fiscal year 2010, this process, measured from the date LOIs were due  to the announcement of which LOIs were invited to apply, took about 6  months, but for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the process took 5 months  and 4 months, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Is Taking Steps to Improve the LOI Evaluation Process", "paragraphs": ["DOT has made changes to try to improve the LOI evaluation process  since returning to a competitive fixed-date selection process. In particular,  DOT officials said that they are applying best practices from other DOT  discretionary programs such as the TIGER program and learning from  past rounds of TIFIA solicitations. The changes include the following:  In fiscal year 2011, DOT increased its documentation of key decisions  for the LOI evaluation and selection process. For each LOI, the  multimodal team summarized its deliberations on the extent to which  a project met each statutory criterion in a standard form. In addition, to  aid in providing feedback to unsuccessful applicants, TIFIA office staff  produced an internal memo to document the multimodal team\u2019s  rationale for LOI scores and grouping as well as the executive  leadership team\u2019s concurrence with these evaluations.", "In fiscal year 2012, DOT made changes to the LOI evaluation process  at the multimodal team level. Specifically, the team assigned  qualitative scores\u2014\u201dnot aligned,\u201d \u201csomewhat aligned,\u201d \u201cwell aligned,\u201d  and \u201cvery well aligned\u201d\u2014rather than numeric scores to LOIs for each  criterion. According to DOT officials, these changes facilitate  discussion within the team and accelerate progress to consensus on  project scores and impressions. In addition, DOT officials said the  qualitative scores are more reflective of the actual evaluation process  than the numeric scoring system used in past rounds of solicitation  and prevent the team from focusing too heavily on the numeric  scores.", "In fiscal year 2012, DOT further clarified the TIFIA funding notice. In  particular, DOT included the two statutory selection criteria that had  not been considered as part of the LOI selection process for fiscal  year 2010 or 2011\u2014creditworthiness and consumption of budget  authority. It also stated that in selecting LOIs to advance, it may give  priority to projects that enhance the geographic diversity of the TIFIA  portfolio and may consider the project\u2019s readiness and timeline to  proceed to financial close. DOT officials said it did so as part of its  efforts to improve its communication of the criteria and selection  process to applicants through the funding notices over time.", "For fiscal year 2012, DOT invited the sponsors of five projects to  apply for TIFIA credit assistance. In addition, in response to concerns  raised by project sponsors as well as the lack of certainty about future  funding levels associated with the TIFIA program because of the  absence of a long-term surface reauthorization, DOT officials said that  an expedited review process would be created for additional highly- rated projects if TIFIA budgetary resources are significantly increased  based on the President\u2019s Budget Request for fiscal year 2013.", "Since many of DOT\u2019s changes to the selection process occurred in the  fiscal year 2012 TIFIA solicitation, it is too soon to know whether these  changes will address the transparency and uncertainty concerns raised  by recent applicants and financial and legal advisors. DOT officials said  that they will continue to explore other changes to the process, such as  creating additional internal guidance on scoring projects or changing  feedback. Additionally, DOT officials said that the variety of TIFIA projects  by size and mode could make it difficult for DOT to specify how particular  benefits translate to a score for an LOI. For instance, in 2010 sponsors  submitted LOIs for projects that varied greatly in terms of benefits, size,  and mode, as exemplified by the $360 million Southeast Waterfront  project\u2014a 5-mile bus, auto, bicycle, and pedestrian corridor that is part of  a redevelopment project in San Francisco\u2014and the $1.5 billion Goethals  Bridge project\u2014the replacement of a existing bridge connecting New  York and New Jersey.

According to DOT officials, the major benefits of TIFIA are that it can be a  patient, flexible lender and can help a sponsor secure a portion of the  project\u2019s lending to attract other financing. For example, one project  sponsor said that deferring payment for 5 years after substantial  completion is very important for new toll road projects to allow time for  usage to grow and thus revenues to ramp up after opening. Beyond  favorable repayment terms, TIFIA assistance can be subordinate to other  debt, meaning that this other debt may receive project revenue ahead of   All six  DOT except in the case of bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation.of the private concessionaires we interviewed said that this structure is a  key benefit of the program, as it can help improve their ability to raise  senior debt. Many project sponsors we spoke to also cited TIFIA\u2019s  relatively low interest rate as a main benefit of the program. The interest  rate of TIFIA assistance is based on U.S. Treasury securities of a similar  maturity and, since 2008, these Treasury rates have been lower than  municipal bond interest rates.", "To a lesser extent, recent applicants we surveyed cited several other  factors as important in their decision to seek TIFIA assistance in fiscal  years 2010 and 2011. (See table 6.)", "For instance, survey responses indicate that the TIFIA program can  provide financing to projects that is unavailable in the financial markets,  particularly for projects with unproven revenue streams. For example, one  project sponsor we interviewed that received a TIFIA loan said that  obtaining subordinate debt in the financial markets would have been  prohibitively expensive, since the project was a new toll road. In addition,  the ability of TIFIA to help accelerate the delivery of projects was also  important among recent applicants. Officials from the Florida Department  of Transportation estimated that its TIFIA loan helped accelerate  completion of the Miami Intermodal Center by 10 years. Two other project  sponsors we interviewed said TIFIA plays an important role in  accelerating not only the projects for which they received assistance but  other major capital projects too, as TIFIA assistance helps free up funds  for other projects.", "However, our survey also indicated that some states have neither sought  nor plan to seek TIFIA assistance. In states where sponsors have never  sought TIFIA assistance, the extent to which certain factors affected state  DOTs\u2019 decisions to not seek credit assistance varied, but many of these  state DOTs indicated that they have not submitted LOIs because they (1)  do not have projects that meet the eligibility requirements including the  required cost threshold, (2) get financing from other source(s), or (3) have  state restrictions on borrowing funds for transportation projects.table 7.)", "Regarding lack of eligible projects, one state DOT indicated in the survey  that a lack of dedicated revenues or private investment prevents TIFIA  from being a viable option for rural states now and in the future. Several  financial and legal advisors we interviewed also said that some states  lack projects that are large enough to benefit from the TIFIA program. For  the TIFIA program, a sponsor must pay a $50,000 application fee if  invited to apply after the LOI stage. Then, if selected to receive  assistance, the TIFIA borrower must pay a transaction fee, typically  between $300,000 and $400,000, to cover the costs incurred by DOT to  negotiate and execute the credit agreement, like costs for external  advisors. Borrowers can also incur additional costs from hiring their own  advisors and obtaining a credit rating for the project. Therefore, the cost  of applying for TIFIA may outweigh the benefits of TIFIA for lower-cost  projects.", "Moreover, DOT officials as well as several financial advisors, a private  concessionaire, and an industry association we spoke to said that the  TIFIA program may be better suited to states with more urban populations  and a greater need for large-scale projects. States with sponsors that  have never sought TIFIA assistance tend to have a smaller portion of  their population living in urban areas\u2014that is, areas with a total  population of 50,000 or more\u2014than states with sponsors that have  sought TIFIA assistance. DOT officials said that to date, TIFIA projects  have been located in states with large urban areas that have major  transportation needs and can more easily charge tolls or generate other  project revenues.", "Based on our survey, it is unlikely that many of the states that have not  sought TIFIA assistance will seek such assistance in the future. Of the 16  state DOTs from states that have never sought assistance that responded  to our survey, only 1 indicated that it anticipated seeking TIFIA assistance  in the next 5 years. In addition, most of these state DOTs indicated that  changes to the program\u2014such as making more funds available for the  program or increasing the portion of project costs that TIFIA assistance  could cover\u2014would have somewhat or little to no increase on the  likelihood that they would seek TIFIA assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future TIFIA Demand Exists, but Its Magnitude Is Difficult to Gauge", "paragraphs": ["According to our interviews with DOT, project sponsors, advisors, and  private concessionaires, overall demand for the TIFIA program is likely to  continue. However, the magnitude of this demand is difficult to estimate  because it is influenced by a variety of external factors like changes to  interest rates, use of public-private partnerships, and state fiscal  conditions.", "Changes to the TIFIA interest rate relative to municipal debt interest rates  could considerably affect the demand for TIFIA credit assistance. For the  last 3 fiscal years, sponsors submitted LOIs for credit assistance totaling  more than 10 times what the program\u2019s current budget authority can  support. Several legal and financial advisors we interviewed said that  many project sponsors sought TIFIA in recent years because of  depressed market conditions and attractive TIFIA interest rates, relative  to interest rates on municipal debt, and a few of these advisors and one  industry association said that demand for TIFIA will likely decrease if  TIFIA interest rates become less attractive relative to municipal debt  interest rates. The relatively low TIFIA interest rates made the program  attractive to a greater number of sponsors, even those with access to  other financing options. For example, one recent applicant we interviewed  said that in the past, TIFIA was a more expensive finance option than  issuing its own debt, and its interest in TIFIA during the last few years is  primarily driven by the program\u2019s relatively low interest rates. The  applicant noted that should interest rates on TIFIA loans increase in the  future, it will likely seek financing in the private capital markets.", "Two other factors will influence the demand for TIFIA assistance.", "Greater use of public-private partnerships and other alternative project  delivery approaches could result in a greater demand for TIFIA credit  assistance. Many private concessionaires we interviewed said that  TIFIA is an important financing tool for public-private partnerships.  According to DOT officials, TIFIA credit assistance has been part of  the financing package for most large-scale public-private partnership  projects in the United States in recent years. In addition, some states,  like Colorado and Virginia, have set up offices to facilitate public- private partnerships, so sponsors in such states may be more likely to  use this approach given this support.", "State-specific conditions will also influence the demand for TIFIA  assistance. As federal and state fuel taxes may not be a sustainable  long-term source of transportation funding, state DOTs may make  greater use of finance tools like TIFIA to deliver projects. We have  previously reported that state and local governments face persistent  and long-term fiscal pressures.", "At the same time, estimates to  repair, replace, or upgrade aging transportation infrastructure\u2014as well  as expand capacity to meet increased demand\u2014top hundreds of  billions of dollars. As a result, DOT anticipates more demand for the  TIFIA program as states and localities look to leverage limited funds.  One state we interviewed, for example, said that pay-as-you-go  funding\u2014a more traditional means of funding transportation  infrastructure whereby a sponsor builds projects in phases or  increments as funds are available\u2014no longer keeps pace with  infrastructure needs. Therefore, the state DOT has turned to TIFIA to  help finance big, high-cost projects that need federal assistance to  advance. Looking ahead, 15 of the 42 state DOTs that responded to  our survey indicated that they have projects for which they will likely  seek TIFIA in the next 5 years. Most of these state DOTs (13) have  sought TIFIA assistance in the past and indicated that they are likely  to seek TIFIA for 1-5 projects, while a few indicated they are likely to  seek TIFIA for 6-10 projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options Proposed to Modify the TIFIA Program", "paragraphs": ["With the pending reauthorization of the surface transportation programs,  the tight budgetary environment, and the increase in demand for TIFIA,  government and industry officials have proffered options to modify the  program.

Based on our interviews with select project sponsors, financial  and legal advisors, and others, as well as our survey of state DOTs and  recent applicants, we identified several recurring options that have been  proposed to modify the TIFA program. Some options require  congressional action to implement, while others would require DOT to  change program-level policies. Each option has advantages and  disadvantages, and thus implementing any of these options would require  policy trade-offs. Moreover, some options could affect the overall demand  for the program and the sphere of projects that could apply for or benefit  from TIFIA.", "Table 8 provides a list of proposed options to modify the TIFIA program in  the surface transportation reauthorization bills and the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2013 budget.", "Two proposed changes, increasing the amount of authorized budget  authority and allowing project sponsors to pay fees to contribute to the  credit subsidy cost, could potentially allow the TIFIA program to provide  more assistance to projects.", "Increase amount of authorized budget authority. Members of Congress,  DOT, and others have proposed increasing the amount of authorized  budget authority to cover the subsidy costs for the TIFIA program.  Proposals vary from increasing this amount to $1 billion, as in the  reauthorization bills, to a smaller increase of $500 million proposed in  DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget. Congressional support for an increase in  authorized budget authority for TIFIA is rooted in the program\u2019s ability to  leverage funds and stretch federal dollars further than a traditional grant  program. These proposals represent significant increases to TIFIA\u2019s  current annual authorized budget authority of $122 million. Proposals to  increase the amount of authorized budget authority for the TIFIA program  occur during an austere federal budget environment. The Budget Control  Act of 2011 places limits on discretionary spending for the next 10 fiscal  years. As a result, an increase in one area of discretionary spending,  like the TIFIA program, requires a decrease in another area of  discretionary spending.", "Increasing the amount of authorized budget authority is strongly  supported by recent applicants we surveyed as well as legal and financial  advisors we interviewed. For example, 32 out of 36 recent applicants that  responded to our survey strongly support expanding funding for the TIFIA  program. An increase in funding would likely allow the program to provide  more credit assistance, in terms of the number of projects receiving credit  assistance or the amount of credit assistance provided to each project.  An increase in funding could also allow the program to come closer to  meeting the current demand for the program, which is more than 10 times  what the current budget authority could support. However, DOT officials  and other stakeholders told us that an increase in funding would need to  be accompanied by an increase in administrative resources. According to  project sponsors and other stakeholders, the TIFIA office has been very  responsive and helpful, but a few said that response time has slowed in  recent years. With increased funding, DOT would likely see an increase in  the number of applications to review, credit agreements to negotiate, and  credit agreements to monitor. DOT officials said they are prepared to  adjust staffing levels in the event that Congress provides the TIFIA  program with an increase in authorized budget authority as is proposed in  the surface transportation reauthorization bills. Further, DOT officials said  that an increase in TIFIA funding may require DOT to reexamine how it  manages the program\u2014such as how it selects projects and negotiates  credit agreements\u2014and issue new regulations.", "Allow sponsors to pay fees to contribute to the credit subsidy cost of  assistance. H.R. 7 would mandate that DOT allow project sponsors to pay  fees to reduce the credit subsidy cost of assistance if DOT funds run  out. According to DOT, current law allows but does not require DOT to  let the approved sponsor pay a fee to reduce the credit subsidy cost of  the project in the event that there is insufficient budget authority to fund  credit assistance for a selected TIFIA project. Over the life of the TIFIA  program, three project sponsors have paid fees to reduce the credit  subsidy cost of their TIFIA assistance; all three cases occurred after the  program became oversubscribed in fiscal year 2008.", "Among recent applicants we surveyed and project sponsors we  interviewed, many supported this program change. Supporters of this  option said that given the high demand for TIFIA credit assistance and  limited budget authority, allowing project sponsors to pay fees to cover  the credit subsidy cost when DOT\u2019s budget authority runs out would allow  more eligible projects to be built and reduce the oversubscription of the  program. However, DOT previously decided against instituting this option  more broadly through a pilot program in 2010. DOT officials told us that  while allowing project sponsors to pay fees to cover the credit subsidy  cost provides flexibility, especially when demand outpaces budget  authority, it complicates the negotiation of credit agreements. While DOT  would have to follow its subsidy estimation methodology to determine a  project sponsor\u2019s fee, the project sponsor may want to negotiate the fee.  Project sponsors we interviewed said that for this option to work, DOT  would need to provide them with more information on how the credit  subsidy cost is calculated. Under FCRA, OMB is responsible for subsidy  cost estimates.

OMB retains the responsibility  and final approval of subsidy cost estimates. Given these complexities,  this option may be difficult to implement, though it could be done relatively  quickly.

DOT officials told us that for other DOT credit programs,  such as the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF)  program, project sponsors are required to pay fees towards the credit  subsidies for loans because they do not have budget authority for this  purpose, but the RRIF program has a statutory limit on total outstanding  credit assistance.the government\u2019s exposure to financial losses.

For example,  several project sponsors said that for very large infrastructure projects,  finding a combination of federal, state, and private financing can be  difficult. Those that do not support this option expressed concern that it  would reduce the incentive to find private and other nonfederal financing  and potentially reduce market discipline that comes from other lenders to  projects. For example, several stakeholders we interviewed said that  increasing the percentage of total project costs that TIFIA can finance  could result in project sponsors substituting TIFIA credit assistance for  private debt or private equity investments. Others expressed concern that  increasing the share of costs TIFIA covers would potentially reduce the  availability of TIFIA assistance, especially if Congress does not increase  budget authority for the TIFIA program.", "Moreover, increasing the portion of costs covered by TIFIA could  decrease the program\u2019s ability to achieve one of its key goals\u2014leveraging  federal funds. DOT officials told us that changing the statute to increase  the TIFIA share could reduce the number of projects supported (for a  given amount of budget authority) and reduce the leveraging of federal  funds as project sponsors seek more financing through TIFIA rather than  other sources. Currently, DOT estimates that each $10 million in budget  authority can provide up to $100 million in TIFIA credit assistance and  leverage $300 million in transportation infrastructure investment. If the  limit on TIFIA assistance were increased to 49 percent, this same amount  of budget authority could leverage about $200 million in transportation  infrastructure investment.

Eliminating or waiving the nonsubordination clause could  address some issues identified by financial advisors and credit ratings  agencies we interviewed. For example, the TIFIA nonsubordination  clause can be difficult to integrate with existing terms for outstanding  bonds secured by the same revenue stream. If the nonsubordination  clause is triggered due to project bankruptcy or insolvency, project  sponsors must make special arrangements to ensure this bond covenant  is not violated. However, despite these issues, many project sponsors  and legal and financial advisors said that the nonsubordination clause  provides an important protection to taxpayers.

For the TIFIA program, the  nonsubordination clause is used to lessen the risk to the federal  government. While the nonsubordination clause can cause issues for  borrowers, DOT officials said that they can work with borrowers to try to  address financial difficulties before they must legally invoke the clause.  For example, DOT can defer invoking the nonsubordination clause for up  to a year after a missed payment, but to date no sponsor has missed a  payment. In addition, DOT officials told us that removing the  nonsubordination clause would increase the federal government\u2019s risk  because it would lower the likelihood of recovering funds. According to  DOT officials, the nonsubordination clause facilitated its involvement in  bankruptcy discussions for the South Bay Expressway and, as a result,  DOT expects to recover, through the restructuring of the project\u2019s debt  and assumption of the loan by SANDAG, up to 100 percent of the original  loan value.

DOT supports retaining the statutory criteria to use in selecting projects to  receive credit assistance. In this way, the TIFIA program would continue  to provide assistance to projects that meet DOT\u2019s national transportation  goals. DOT officials added that just because a project is creditworthy  does not ensure that it will have positive transportation benefits. Further,  modifying or eliminating the selection criteria could be implemented in  several ways, each entailing different trade-offs.

While fostering public-private partnerships, for example, is one of the  selection criteria for the current TIFIA program, projects without a public- private component are still eligible to apply.

DOT previously reported that based on its use of an annual,  fixed-date application process from 1999 to 2001, project sponsors may  have been applying for assistance prematurely in response to the limited  application window. DOT switched to an open application process to  allow sponsors to apply based on a project\u2019s schedule.

DOT officials told us the fixed-date application cycle is currently a  necessity because of limited resources; however, if they had more funds  to pay the credit subsidy costs for credit assistance, they would prefer to  use an open application system that allows a sponsor to seek TIFIA when  it best fits a project\u2019s schedule.", "Importantly, returning to an open application cycle removes the  competitive nature of the TIFIA program. If the TIFIA program\u2019s  authorized budget authority remains at current levels or does not meet  total demand, a project\u2019s order in line would determine whether it receives  assistance, not its relative merit.

However, demand for the program surged, in  part because of the tightening of commercial credit markets and low  federal treasury interest rates. TIFIA is increasingly becoming a more  recognized approach for filling funding and financing gaps for complex  transportation projects that can help to mitigate mobility and other  transportation issues in many congested urban areas in the United  States. DOT, project sponsors, legal and financial advisors, and other  stakeholders in the transportation industry have expressed strong support  for the program, and Members of Congress have recently developed  several reauthorization proposals aimed at greatly increasing the  authorized budget authority for the program and modifying other aspects  of the program to make it more accessible. DOT has taken some steps to  monitor and assess the program through its project oversight and credit  monitoring of individual TIFIA credit agreements and, early in the  program\u2019s tenure, by tracking and reporting on the private investment and  leveraging effect of TIFIA to gauge its progress in meeting program goals.  However, since that time, DOT has not publicly reported on these or other  measures to assess the program as a whole. Without other measures in  place going forward, Congress will not have the complete and aggregated  data needed to make informed decisions about the program\u2019s size and  structure.", "Additionally, in response to increased demand for the program and  multiple extensions of the surface transportation reauthorization over the  last 3 years, DOT has had to adapt its process for selecting projects,  focusing its review of projects on applicants\u2019 LOIs and selecting projects  based on their relative merits. The new process, whereby DOT balances  a limited program budget authority with selecting projects that are most  consistent with the statutory selection criteria, is a work in progress. In  response to feedback from applicants and lessons from this and other  discretionary programs, DOT has taken steps to make the TIFIA selection  process transparent by publicizing the selection criteria and other factors  that contribute to project selection and providing feedback to  unsuccessful applicants, and many think these steps have been useful.  However, many recent applicants and financial and legal advisors that  assist applicants in developing projects still feel that the process lacks  transparency, making it difficult for them to advance well-developed LOIs.  While federal agencies rarely publicly disclose the reasons for their  selection decisions in a competitive review process, the considerable  demand for TIFIA and changes to the selection process suggest that  publicly disclosing additional information about how selection decisions  are made would better enable potential applicants to identify how DOT is  using the statutory criteria to select projects and develop effective LOIs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the implementation of the TIFIA program and enable  Congress and DOT to better assess program performance, we  recommend that the Secretary of Transportation further develop and  define performance measures to monitor and evaluate progress toward  meeting the program\u2019s goals and objectives.", "To ensure that future project selections in the TIFIA program are  transparent to Congress, applicants, and the public, we recommend that  the Secretary of Transportation better disclose information, through  notices of funding availability or other program guidance, regarding how  DOT evaluates and selects projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment.

To  describe the characteristics and results of the TIFIA program, we  analyzed DOT data on past letters of interest (LOI) and applications for  assistance to describe the projects that sought credit assistance. We also  analyzed data on the projects receiving TIFIA credit agreements through  April 2012 to describe these projects, including mode of transport, total  cost, amount of TIFIA assistance, amount of private investment, and  geographic location. For mode of transport, we used DOT\u2019s available  characterizations for all projects with credit agreements and for LOIs for  fiscal year 2011, while for the remaining LOIs we determined the mode  for projects by applying DOT\u2019s characterization scheme. When  considering the amount of private investment, we followed DOT\u2019s  convention established in its 2002 report to Congress on TIFIA. Namely,  (1) the project must feature investor-held debt or equity and (2) the  investment return must be derived from project-generated revenues or  other revenues levied specifically to support the project. We only included  active credit agreements\u2014those for which sponsors had not repaid or  refinanced their credit agreements\u2014as we did not have complete  information on the funding sources for all the retired credit agreements.

To assess DOT\u2019s process for  selecting projects, we compared DOT\u2019s process with statute, regulations,  and guidance; GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government; and, as appropriate, past GAO work on federal credit  assistance and grant programs.", "In addition, we gathered and analyzed data on state-level characteristics,  such as federal highway apportionments and whether states have  legislative restrictions on borrowing, to determine whether such  characteristics were correlated to past demand for the TIFIA program.
