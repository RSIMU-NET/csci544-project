Based on GAO's prior reviews and recommendations, GAO has concluded that progress in DOD's overall approach to business defense transformation is needed to confront problems in other high-risk areas, including supply chain management. DOD has taken several actions intended to advance business transformation, including the establishment of new governance structures and the issuance of an Enterprise Transition Plan aligned with the department's business enterprise architecture. As a separate effort, DOD has been developing a strategy--called the \"To Be\" logistics roadmap--to guide logistics programs and initiatives across the department. The strategy would identify the scope of logistics problems and capability gaps to be addressed and include specific performance goals, programs, milestones, and metrics. However, DOD has not identified a target date for completion of this effort. According to DOD officials, its completion is pending the results of the department's ongoing test of new concepts for managing logistic capabilities. Without a comprehensive, integrated strategy, decision makers will lack the means to effectively guide logistics efforts, including supply chain management, and the ability to determine if these efforts are achieving desired results. DOD has taken a number of actions to improve supply chain management, but the department is unable to demonstrate at this time the full extent of its progress that may have resulted from its efforts. In addition to implementing audit recommendations, DOD is implementing initiatives in its supply chain management improvement plan. However, it is unclear how much progress its actions have resulted in because the plan generally lacks outcome-focused performance metrics that track progress in the three focus areas and at the initiative level. DOD's plan includes four high-level performance measures, but these measures do not explicitly relate to the focus areas, and they may be affected by many variables, such as disruptions in the distribution process, other than DOD's supply chain initiatives. Further, the plan does not include overall cost metrics that might show efficiencies gained through the efforts. Therefore, it is unclear whether DOD is meeting its stated goal of improving the provision of supplies to the warfighter and improving readiness of equipment while reducing or avoiding costs. Over the last 5 years, audit organizations have made more than 400 recommendations that focused specifically on improving certain aspects of DOD's supply chain management. About two-thirds of the recommendations had been closed at the time GAO conducted its review, and most of these were considered implemented. Of the total recommendations, 41 percent covered the focus areas in DOD's supply chain management improvement plan: requirements forecasting, asset visibility, and materiel distribution. The recommendations addressed five common themes--management oversight, performance tracking, planning, policy, and processes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have focused attention on the  performance of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) supply chain  management in support of deployed U.S. troops.

Moreover, the investment  of resources in the supply chain is substantial, amounting to more than  $150 billion a year according to DOD. As a result of weaknesses in DOD\u2019s  management of supply inventories and responsiveness to warfighter  requirements, supply chain management has been on our list of high-risk  federal government programs since 1990.

We have stated that, overall, DOD\u2019s plan  addressing supply chain management is a good first step toward putting  DOD on a path toward resolving long-standing supply chain management  problems, but that the department faces a number of challenges and risks  in fully implementing its proposed changes across the department and  measuring progress.", "In response to your Committee\u2019s request, we have continued to monitor  DOD\u2019s progress toward resolving supply chain management problems.  Specifically, this report discusses (1) the integration of supply chain  management with broader defense business transformation and strategic  logistics planning efforts and (2) the extent to which DOD is able to  demonstrate progress toward improving supply chain management. In  addition, we developed a baseline of recommended improvements to  DOD\u2019s supply chain management that have been made over the past 5  years.", "Our discussion of the integration of supply chain management with broader  defense business transformation efforts is based primarily on our prior  reports and testimonies. We obtained information from officials in the  Office of the Secretary of Defense on their efforts to develop an  overarching strategy to guide departmentwide logistics programs and  initiatives. We met regularly with DOD and OMB officials to discuss the  overall status of the supply chain management improvement plan, the  implementation schedules of the plan\u2019s individual initiatives, and the plan\u2019s  performance measures. We visited and interviewed officials from U.S.  Transportation Command, the Defense Logistics Agency, the military  services, and the Joint Staff to gain their perspectives on improving supply  chain management. In developing a baseline of recommended supply chain  management improvements, we surveyed audit reports issued between  October 2001 and September 2006 by our office, the Department of Defense  Office of the Inspector General (DOD-IG), and the military service audit  agencies. We selected this time period because it corresponds with the  onset of recent military operations that began with Operation Enduring  Freedom. For each audit recommendation contained in these reports, we  determined its status and focus. In analyzing the status of  recommendations, we determined whether DOD or the component  organization concurred with the recommendations, whether the  recommendations were closed, and whether closed recommendations had  been implemented. We determined that the data we obtained from the  DOD-IG and the service audit agencies were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. In analyzing the focus of recommendations, we identified those  addressing three specific areas\u2014requirements forecasting, asset visibility,  and materiel distribution\u2014as well those addressing other supply chain  management concerns. We selected these three focus areas as the  framework for our analysis based on our prior work in this high-risk area  and because DOD has structured its supply chain management  improvement plan around them. While we included recommendations by  non-audit organizations in our analysis, we did not determine the extent to  which DOD concurred with or implemented them because their status is  not systemically tracked. Additional information on our analysis, including  further explanation of the terms used in describing the status of  recommendations, is discussed in the scope and methodology section.

Accurately forecasted supply  requirements are a key first step in buying, storing, positioning, and  shipping items that the warfighter needs. DOD describes asset visibility as  the ability to provide timely and accurate information on the location,  quantity, condition, movement, and status of supplies and the ability to act  on that information. Distribution is the process for synchronizing all  elements of the logistics system to deliver the \u201cright things\u201d to the \u201cright  place\u201d at the \u201cright time\u201d to support the warfighter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements to Supply Chain Management Are Linked with Overall Defense Business Transformation and Completion of a Comprehensive, Integrated Logistics Strategy", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s success in improving supply chain management is closely linked  with its overall defense business transformation efforts and completion of  a comprehensive, integrated logistics strategy.

We have concluded that  progress in DOD\u2019s overall approach to business transformation is needed to  confront other high-risk areas, including supply chain management. DOD\u2019s  overall approach to business transformation was added to the high-risk list  in 2005 because of our concern over DOD\u2019s lack of adequate management  accountability and the absence of a strategic and integrated action plan for  the overall business transformation effort. Specifically, the high-risk  designation for business transformation resulted because (1) DOD\u2019s  business improvement initiatives and control over resources are  fragmented; (2) DOD lacks a clear strategic and integrated business  transformation plan and investment strategy, including a well-defined  enterprise architecture to guide and constrain implementation of such a  plan; and (3) DOD has not designated a senior management official  responsible and accountable for overall business transformation reform  and related resources.", "In response, DOD has taken several actions intended to advance  transformation. For example, DOD has established governance structures  such as the Business Transformation Agency and the Defense Business  Systems Management Committee. The Business Transformation Agency  was established in October 2005 with the mission of transforming business  operations to achieve improved warfighter support and improved financial  accountability. The agency supports the Defense Business Systems  Management Committee, which is comprised of senior-level DOD officials  and is intended to serve as the primary transformation leadership and  oversight mechanism. Furthermore, in September 2006, DOD released an  updated Enterprise Transition Plan that is intended to be both a business  transformation roadmap and management tool for modernizing its business  process and underlying information technology assets. DOD describes the  Enterprise Transition Plan as an executable roadmap aligned to DOD\u2019s  business enterprise architecture. In addition, as required by the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, DOD is studying the  feasibility and advisability of establishing a Deputy Secretary for Defense  Management to serve as DOD\u2019s Chief Management Officer and advise the  Secretary of Defense on matters relating to management, including defense  business activities.", "Business systems modernization is a critical part of DOD\u2019s transformation  efforts, and successful resolution of supply chain management problems  will require investment in needed information technology. DOD spends  billions of dollars to sustain key business operations intended to support  the warfighter, including systems and processes related to support  infrastructure, finances, weapon systems acquisition, the management of  contracts, and the supply chain. We have indicated at various times that  modernized business systems are essential to the department\u2019s effort in addressing its supply chain management issues. In its supply chain  management improvement plan, DOD recognizes that achieving success in  supply chain management is dependent on developing interoperable  systems that can share critical supply data. One of the initiatives included  in the plan is business system modernization, an effort that is being led by  DOD\u2019s Business Transformation Agency and includes achieving materiel  visibility through systems modernization as one of its six enterprisewide  priorities.", "Improvements in financial management are also integrally linked to DOD\u2019s  business transformation. Since our first report on the financial statement  audit of a major DOD component over 16 years ago, we have repeatedly  reported that weaknesses in business management systems, processes, and  internal controls not only adversely affect the reliability of reported  financial data, but also the management of DOD operations. Such  weaknesses have adversely affected the ability of DOD to control costs,  ensure basic accountability, anticipate future costs and claims on the  budget, measure performance, maintain funds control, and prevent fraud.  In December 2005, DOD issued its Financial Improvement and Audit  Readiness Plan to guide its financial management improvement efforts.  The Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan is intended to  provide DOD components with a roadmap for (1) resolving problems  affecting the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of financial information;  and (2) obtaining clean financial statement audit opinions. It uses an  incremental approach to structure its process for examining operations,  diagnosing problems, planning corrective actions, and preparing for audit.  The plan also recognizes that it will take several years before DOD is able  to implement the systems, processes, and other changes necessary to fully  address its financial management weaknesses. Furthermore, DOD has  developed an initial Standard Financial Information Structure, which is  DOD\u2019s enterprisewide data standard for categorizing financial information.  This effort focused on standardizing general ledger and external financial  reporting requirements.", "While these steps are positive, defense business transformation is much  broader and encompasses planning, management, organizational  structures, and processes related to all key business areas. As we have  previously observed, business transformation requires long-term cultural  change, business process reengineering, and a commitment from both the  executive and legislative branches of government. Although sound  strategic planning is the foundation on which to build, DOD needs clear,  capable, sustained, and professional leadership to maintain continuity  necessary for success. Such leadership would provide the attention  essential for addressing key stewardship responsibilities\u2014such as strategic  planning, performance management, business information management,  and financial management\u2014in an integrated manner, while helping to  facilitate the overall business transformation effort within DOD.

However, DOD currently lacks an overarching logistics strategy. In  December 2005, DOD issued its \u201cAs Is\u201d Focused Logistics Roadmap, which  assembled various logistics programs and initiatives associated with the  fiscal year 2006 President\u2019s Budget and linked them to seven key joint  future logistics capability areas. The roadmap identified more than $60  billion of planned investments in these programs and initiatives, yet it also  indicated that key focused logistics capabilities would not be achieved by  2015.

Moreover, outcome-focused performance metrics show  results or outcomes related to an initiative or program in terms of its  effectiveness, efficiency, impact, or all of these. To track progress toward  goals, effective performance metrics should have a clearly apparent or  commonly accepted relationship to the intended performance, or should be  reasonable predictors of desired outcomes; are not unduly influenced by  factors outside a program\u2019s control; measure multiple priorities, such as  quality, timeliness, outcomes, and cost; sufficiently cover key aspects of  performance; and adequately capture important distinctions between  programs. Performance metrics enable the agency to assess  accomplishments, strike a balance among competing interests, make  decisions to improve program performance, realign processes, and assign  accountability. While it may take years before the results of programs  become apparent, intermediate metrics can be used to provide information  on interim results and show progress towards intended results. In addition,  when program results could be influenced by external factors, intermediate  metrics can be used to identify the program\u2019s discrete contribution to the  specific result.", "DOD\u2019s plan does include four high-level performance measures that are  being tracked across the department, and while they are not required to do  so, these measures do not explicitly relate to the focus areas.

For example, implementing RFID at  a few sites at a time has only a very small impact on customer wait time.  However, variables such as natural disasters, wartime surges in  requirements, or disruption in the distribution process could affect that  measure.

Some of the necessary data reside in  the Global Transportation Network while other data reside in the Standard  Army Retail Supply System. These two databases must be manually  reviewed and merged in order to obtain the information for accurate  receipt processing performance measures.

The official indicated that six outcome measures were chosen for  the initial effort: on-time delivery, order fulfillment cycle time, perfect order  fulfillment, supply chain management costs, inventory days of supply, and  forecast accuracy. Furthermore, the specific supply chains to be reviewed  will be recommended by the various DOD components and approved by an  executive committee. According to the same DOD official, the contractor  will be looking at the specific supply chains approved and the industry  equivalent; and a set of performance scorecards mapping the target supply  segment to average and best-in-class performance from the comparison  population will be developed for each supply chain and provided to the  component. This assessment is a good step but it is too early to determine  the effectiveness of this effort in helping DOD to demonstrate progress  toward improving its supply chain management.", "Further, we noted that DOD has not provided cost metrics that might show  efficiencies gained through supply chain improvement efforts.

The fewest recommendations were made in the  focus area of distribution, accounting for just 6 percent of the total. Other  inventory management issues accounted for most of the other  recommendations. In addition, a small number of recommendations, less  than 1 percent of the total, addressed supply chain management issues that  could not be grouped under any of these other categories. In further  analyzing the recommendations, we found that they addressed five  common themes\u2014management oversight, performance tracking, policy,  planning, and processes. Table 1 shows the number of audit  recommendations made by focus area and theme.", "Most of the recommendations addressed processes (38 percent),  management oversight (30 percent), or policy (22 percent), with  comparatively fewer addressing planning (7 percent) and performance  tracking (4 percent). The management oversight theme includes any  recommendations involving compliance, conducting reviews, or providing  information to others. For example, the Naval Audit Service recommended  that the Office of the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command should  enforce existing requirements that ships prepare and submit Ship  Hazardous Material List Feedback Reports and Allowance Change  Requests, whenever required. The performance tracking theme includes  recommendations with performance measures, goals, objectives, and  milestones. For example, the Army Audit Agency recommended that  funding for increasing inventory safety levels be withheld until the Army  Materiel Command develops test procedures and identifies key  performance indicators to measure and assess its cost-effectiveness and  impact on operational readiness. The policy theme contains  recommendations on issuing guidance, revising or establishing policy, and  establishing guidelines. For example, the DOD-IG recommended that the  Defense Logistics Agency revise its supply operating procedures to meet  specific requirements. The planning theme contains recommendations  related to plan, doctrine, or capability development or implementation, as  well as any recommendations related to training. For example, the Army  Audit Agency recommended the Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia  implement a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan that encompasses all  requirements of the prime vendor contract. The largest theme, processes,  consists of recommendations that processes and procedures should be  established or documented, and recommendations be implemented.

For example, the Center for Strategic and International Studies  and the Defense Science Board suggested the creation of a departmentwide  logistics command responsible for end-to-end supply chain operations. In  July 2005, the Center for Strategic and International Studies issued a report,  \u201cBeyond Goldwater-Nichols: U.S. Government and Defense Reform for a  New Strategic Era,\u201d which addressed the entire U.S. national security  structure, including the organization of logistics support. In this report, the  study team acknowledged that recent steps, such as strengthening joint  theater logistics and the existence of stronger coordinating authorities  have significantly increased the unity of effort in logistical support to  ongoing operations. However, according to the study, much of this reflects  the combination of exemplary leadership and the intense operational pull  of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and has not been formalized and  institutionalized by charter, doctrine, or organizational realignment. It  further noted that the fact that a single Distribution Process Owner was  needed to overcome the fragmented structure of DOD\u2019s logistical system  underscores the need for fundamental reform. The study team  recommended the integration of the management of transportation and  supply warehousing functions under a single organization such as an  integrated logistics command.

In this assessment,  issued in February 2006, the Defense Science Board suggested that each  segment in the supply chain is optimized for that specific function. For  example, in the depot shipping segment of the supply chain, packages are  consolidated into truck-size loads in order to fill the trucks for efficiency.  Yet, optimizing each segment inevitably suboptimizes the major objective  of end-to-end movement from source to user. The Defense Science Board  report further indicated that although the assignment of the U.S.  Transportation Command as the Distribution Process Owner was an  important step towards addressing an end-to-end supply change, it did not  go far enough to meet the objective of an effective supply chain. The  necessary step is to assign a joint logistics command the authority and  accountability for providing this essential support to global operations.", "Unlike recommendations made by audit agencies, DOD does not  systematically track the status of recommendations made by non-audit  organizations.

DOD estimated that the logistics strategy would be  completed 6 months after it completes the logistics portfolio test case in  the spring of 2007. DOD did not address whether it would take steps to  ensure the supply chain management improvement plan and component- level logistics plans are synchronized with the department\u2019s overall  logistics strategy.

DOD stated that these linkages will be completed as  part of full implementation of each initiative. We are pleased that the  department recognized the need for linking outcome-focused metrics with  the individual initiatives and the three focus areas in its supply chain  management improvement plan. However, it is unclear from DOD\u2019s  response how and under what timeframes the department plans to  implement this goal.  As we noted in the report, DOD lacks outcome- focused performance metrics for supply chain management, in part  because one of the challenges is obtaining standardized, reliable data from  noninteroperable systems.  In addition, initiatives in the supply chain  management plan are many years away from full implementation.  If DOD  waits until full implementation to incorporate outcome-based metrics, it  will miss opportunities to assess progress on an interim basis.

We selected this time period because it  corresponds with recent military operations that began with the onset of  Operation Enduring Freedom and, later, Operation Iraqi Freedom. We  surveyed audit reports issued by our office, the DOD-IG, the Army Audit  Agency, the Naval Audit Service, and the Air Force Audit Agency.", "For each audit recommendation contained in these reports, we determined  its status and focus. To determine the status of GAO recommendations, we  obtained data from our recommendation tracking system.

In evaluating agency comments on our reports,  we have noted instances where DOD agreed with the intent of a  recommendation but did not commit to taking any specific actions to  address it. For the purposes of this report, we counted these as concurred  recommendations. We also noted whether the recommendation was open,  closed and implemented, or closed and not implemented. In a similar  manner, we worked with DOD-IG and the service audit agencies to  determine the status of their recommendations. We verified with each of  the audit organizations that they agreed with our definition that a  recommendation is considered \u201cconcurred with\u201d when the audit  organization determines that DOD or the component organization fully  agreed with the recommendation in it entirety and its prescribed actions,  and \u201cpartially concurred with\u201d is when the audit organization determines  that DOD or the component organization agreed to parts of the  recommendation or parts of its prescribed actions. Furthermore, we  verified that a recommendation is officially \u201cclosed\u201d when the audit  organization determines that DOD or the component organization has  implemented its provisions or otherwise met the intent of the  recommendation; when circumstances have changed, and the  recommendation is no longer valid; or when, after a certain amount of time,  the audit organization determines that implementation cannot reasonably  be expected. We also verified that an \u201copen\u201d recommendation is one that  has not been closed for one of the preceding reasons.
