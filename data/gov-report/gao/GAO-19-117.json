Although VA signed its first project agreement under the program in April 2017, VA has not yet established a framework for effective design of the pilot program. Specifically, VA's pilot program design is not aligned with four of five leading practices for designing a well-developed and documented pilot program. VA has begun to implement one leading practice by improving its efforts to communicate with relevant stakeholders, such as including external stakeholders in key meetings. However, the VA offices involved have not agreed upon and documented clear, measurable objectives for the pilot program, which is a leading practice. Further, VA has not developed an assessment methodology or an evaluation plan that would help inform decisions about whether or how the pilot approach could be expanded. While VA officials said they intend to develop these items as tasks for the newly formed CHIP-IN steering committee, they have no timeline for doing so. Without clear objectives and assessment and evaluation plans, VA and Congress may have difficulty determining whether the pilot approach is an effective way to help address VA's infrastructure needs.", "To date, the CHIP-IN pilot suggests that donation partnerships could improve construction projects, but identifying donors and establishing a team for the pilot program have presented challenges. Officials from VA and the donor group for the first pilot project\u2014an ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska\u2014said they are completing the project faster than if it had been a standard federal construction project, while achieving potential cost savings by using private sector practices. However, VA officials said it is challenging to find partners to make large donations with no financial return, and VA's lack of marketing and philanthropic development experience exacerbates that challenge. VA and the donor group agreed that a dedicated team of individuals with relevant expertise could facilitate the pilot's implementation. The new CHIP-IN steering committee could serve this purpose, but it lacks documented roles and responsibilities. Establishing a team with clear roles and responsibilities and identifying both available and needed staff resources could assist VA in partnering with additional donors and creating new opportunities to meet veterans' needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that VA: (1) establish pilot program objectives, (2) develop an assessment methodology and an evaluation plan, and (3) document roles and responsibilities and identify available and needed staff resources.

Further, our prior work has identified instances of VA facility  construction experiencing cost overruns totaling hundreds of millions of  dollars and schedule delays exceeding several years.", "In December 2016, a pilot program was enacted that helps to address  VA\u2019s infrastructure needs by allowing VA to partner with and accept  donations from non-federal entities to construct or improve some facilities.  Specifically, the Communities Helping Invest through Property and  Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016 (CHIP-IN Act) authorizes  VA to accept donated real property, such as buildings, from non-federal  entities. The legislative history suggests that Congress was seeking innovative ways to help VA meet its pressing infrastructure needs. CHIP- IN donations can include an already constructed facility or construction of  a facility on either VA property or donated property. Examples of non- federal entities that can make donations under the pilot include state or  local authorities, a donor or donor group, limited liability corporations, or  tax-exempt organizations. The CHIP-IN Act allows VA to use funds that  have already been appropriated for a particular facility\u2019s construction  project to assist a donor of real property and improvements with  financing, designing, or constructing the facility. VA may accept up to five  donations through the pilot program, which is authorized through 2021.  As of September 2018, VA has entered into a formal agreement for one  CHIP-IN project\u2014the construction of an ambulatory care center on the  VA medical center\u2019s campus in Omaha, Nebraska (Omaha project). This  agreement created a partnership between VA and a nonprofit corporation  formed by a donor group in Omaha (Omaha donor group). In this case,  the donor, in consultation with VA, is leading the project\u2019s design and  construction efforts and will donate the completed facility to VA. VA plans  to use this facility to provide various outpatient services, including primary  care and certain surgical services.

In 2011, VA  allocated $56 million for the design of the replacement medical center  in Omaha, which had a total estimated cost of $560 million. However,  VA officials told us that given the agency\u2019s backlog of construction  projects, the replacement medical center was not among its near-term  projects. In the meantime, according to VA officials and the Omaha  donor group, they discussed a change in the scope of the project\u2014 from the original plan of a replacement medical center to a smaller- scope project for a new ambulatory care center\u2014that could potentially  be constructed using the existing appropriation of $56 million plus a  donation from the Omaha donor group.", "Another factor was the Congress\u2019s and VA\u2019s broader interest in  testing innovative approaches to meeting VA\u2019s infrastructure needs.

As such, formal  efforts to establish the pilot through the CHIP-IN steering committee were  in initial stages at the time of our review.

Scalability is  connected to other leading practices for pilot design, as discussed above.  For example, criteria to measure scalability should provide evidence that  the pilot objectives have been met, and the evaluation\u2019s results should  inform scalability by showing whether and how the pilot could be  expanded or how well lessons learned from the pilot can be incorporated  into broader efforts.", "VA officials have begun to implement this leading practice by considering  the pilot as a means of testing the viability of the donation partnership  approach; however, plans for assessing scalability have not been fully  defined and documented.

Similarly, ORP officials told us they are first considering scalability in  terms of whether the CHIP-IN donation approach is an effective or  feasible way of delivering VA projects. These officials said scalability will  be largely determined by whether all five authorized projects can be  executed before authorization for the CHIP-IN pilot program sunsets. For  example, if VA can find four additional projects and execute donation  agreements before the pilot\u2019s authority expires, then potentially VA could  seek congressional reauthorization to extend the program beyond the 5- year pilot. ORP officials are also considering scalability in terms of any  changes to the program, such as incentives for donors, that could  potentially increase its effectiveness. However, ORP officials explained  that scalability may be limited because the types of projects that can be  accomplished with the CHIP-IN donation approach may not be the  projects that are most needed by VA. Along with other pilot design topics,  the CHIP-IN steering committee intends to discuss scalability at a future  meeting, but it is not clear when that discussion will occur.

As  discussed below, the donation commitment aspect of the pilot can be  a challenge. When interested entities contact VA to request  information on the CHIP-IN pilot, VA officials told us they find the  entities are often surprised by the donation commitment. For example,  two entities that responded to VA\u2019s RFI told us they were not clear  about the donation requirement or the expected level of donation, or  both. One respondent did not understand the pilot required a  donation and would not provide an opportunity for a financial return on  investment. Another respondent indicated that when they asked VA  for clarification about the expected project\u2019s scope, personnel from a  headquarters office and the local VA medical center could not fully  answer their questions. VA officials acknowledged these challenges  and said they have changed their outreach efforts to focus on certain  potential CHIP-IN locations, rather than RFIs aimed at a broader  audience. Further, VA officials said that when speaking with potential  donors going forward, they plan to involve a small group of officials  who are knowledgeable about the pilot and its donation approach.", "Internal communication. While VA initially experienced some  challenges in ensuring that all relevant internal stakeholders have  been included in the pilot\u2019s implementation, according to officials, the  agency has taken recent steps to address this concern and involve  appropriate internal offices. For example, officials from the Capital  Asset Management Office said they could have assisted ORP in  narrowing the list of potential projects in the RFIs but were not  consulted. Later, after revising the marketing approach, ORP reached  out to the Capital Asset Management Office and other relevant offices  for help in determining priority locations for additional CHIP-IN  projects, according to an ORP official. Officials from the Capital Asset  Management Office told us that with improved engagement they were  able to participate more actively in discussions about the pilot. In  addition, initial plans for the CHIP-IN steering committee did not  include VHA representation. However, in summer 2018 ORP  expanded the planned steering committee to include VHA  representatives, a plan that some other VA offices told us is needed to  ensure that the pilot addresses the agency\u2019s healthcare needs and  that VHA offices are informed about pilot efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CHIP-IN Pilot Suggests That Donation Partnerships Can Improve Project Implementation, but Challenges Include Identifying Donors and Establishing Responsibilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA and Omaha Donor Group Agree That the CHIP-IN Donation Approach and Private Sector Practices Have Improved the Omaha Project\u2019s Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Based on the experience with the Omaha project, the CHIP-IN donation  approach can result in potential cost and time savings\u2014through the  leveraging of private-sector funding, contracting, and construction  practices\u2014according to VA officials and the Omaha donor group.

For example, when assessing the safety and physical-security  risk, the donor group and VA identified a location where two sides of  the facility will not have direct exposure to the public or roadway  traffic. Prohibiting exposure to roadways on two sides of the facility  will mean spending less money to harden (i.e., protect) the facility  against threats such as vehicular ramming. According to VA officials,  using the combined standards did not compromise security on the  Omaha project.", "Involving the general contractor early on in the design for the Omaha  project, an approach VA does not typically take, contributed to both  time and cost savings. VA officials told us that engaging the general  contractor during the project\u2019s design stage allowed the project to  begin more quickly and was also helpful in obtaining information about  costs and keeping the project within budget. However, VA officials  said that depending on the project and contracting method used, it  might not be possible to apply this contracting practice to VA  construction projects outside of the pilot program.", "A private-sector design review method helped to save time. The  Omaha donor group used a software package that allowed all design- document reviewers to simultaneously review design documents and  then store their comments in a single place. VA officials said this  approach was more efficient than VA\u2019s typical review method and cut  about 18 weeks from the project\u2019s timeline. VA officials also said use  of this software was a best practice that could be applied to VA  construction projects more broadly. In addition, the donor group and  VA employed fewer rounds of design reviews than VA typically uses;  this streamlining also helped to save time during the design process,  according to VA officials.", "Further, VA officials said that the CHIP-IN donation approach can allow  VA to address projects more quickly because they are addressed outside  of VA\u2019s typical selection and funding process. For example, VA officials  told us that because of the agency\u2019s current major construction backlog,  using the CHIP-IN donation approach allowed work on the Omaha project  to begin at least 5 years sooner than if the CHIP-IN approach had not  been used. The Omaha project\u2019s priority was low relative to other  potential projects, so that it was unlikely to receive additional funding for  construction for several years. For example, one agency official noted  that even if the project was at the top of VA\u2019s priorities, there is a backlog  of 20 major construction projects worth $5 billion ahead of it\u2014meaning  the Omaha project would probably not be addressed for at least 5 years.  VA officials also told us that as they consider future CHIP-IN projects,  they are looking for other projects that, like the one in Omaha, are  needed, but may not be a top priority given available funding and could  be moved forward with a private sector donation. In addition, use of the  CHIP-IN donation approach and decision to pursue an ambulatory care  center contributed to an earlier start on a project to address veterans\u2019  needs. However, as mentioned earlier, VA officials said that future  construction projects will be necessary to address some needs that were  part of the original replacement medical center plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Agreed That Relying on Philanthropic Donations and Identifying Donors Is a Challenge to Establishing Pilot Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["A main challenge to establishing pilot partnerships is the reliance on large  philanthropic donations, according to VA officials, the Omaha donor  group, and RFI respondents. In general, the potential donor pool may not  be extensive given the size of the expected donations\u2014in some cases  tens or hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014and the conditions under which  the donations must be made. For example, as discussed earlier, VA  officials said that when interested entities contact them about the pilot,  they are often surprised by the donation commitment. When we spoke  with two entities that responded to VA\u2019s RFI, one told us that they \u201ccould  not afford to work for free\u201d under the pilot while another told us that  developers are more likely to participate in the pilot if they see an  incentive, or a return on their financial contribution. Also, VA officials told  us that some potential project locations have not received any  appropriations\u2014making the projects\u2019 implementation less appealing to  potential donors. The Omaha donor group noted that a VA financial  contribution at or above 50 percent of a project\u2019s estimated cost is  essential for demonstrating the agency\u2019s commitment and for leveraging  private-sector donations.", "To address challenges involving the philanthropic nature of the pilot, ORP  officials told us that VA has tried to identify strategies or incentives that  could encourage donor involvement. For example, the CHIP-IN steering  committee is considering what incentives might be effective to encourage  greater participation. One ORP official told us that such incentives could  include potential naming opportunities (that is, authority to name items  such as facility floors, wings, or the actual facility), although offering such  incentives may require changes in VA\u2019s authority. Further, because it  may be difficult to secure donations for larger, more costly projects, some  VA officials, donor group representatives, and one RFI respondent we  spoke to suggested that VA consider developing less costly CHIP-IN  projects\u2014giving VA a better chance of serving veterans by filling gaps in  service needs. Other VA officials, however, said they wanted to focus on  larger projects because the pilot allows only five projects.", "Another challenge is that VA generally does not possess marketing and  philanthropic development experience. VA officials told us that this makes  the inherent challenge of finding donors more difficult. While VA officials  have used the assistance of a nonprofit entity that has marketing  expertise, they also said that going forward it would be helpful to have  staff with relevant marketing and philanthropic development experience to  assist with identifying donors. VA officials said this expertise could  possibly be acquired through hiring a contractor, but funding such a hire  may be difficult within their existing resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CHIP-IN Team Lacks Documented Roles and Responsibilities and Has Limited Available Staffing", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, the CHIP-IN pilot presents an uncharted approach  to VA\u2019s implementation of projects, and using CHIP-IN has aspects of an  organizational transformation in property acquisition for the agency  because it leverages donation partnerships and streamlines VA\u2019s typical  funding process. We have found that a key practice of organizational  transformation includes a dedicated implementation team to manage the  transformation process  and that leading practices for cross-functional  teams include clear roles and responsibilities, and committed members  with relevant expertise. VA officials and Omaha donor group  representatives acknowledged that a dedicated CHIP-IN team could help  focus pilot implementation\u2014and that no such team existed within the  agency. ORP officials told us that the newly formed CHIP-IN steering  committee would provide the necessary leadership for pilot  implementation. They anticipate that a working group will be part of the  committee and serve as a dedicated team for the pilot. However, as  discussed below, roles and responsibilities have not been defined and  staff resource decisions have not been made.", "Clear and documented roles and responsibilities. Several VA officials  told us that responsibility for managing the overall pilot effort had not  been assigned, and that they had different interpretations of which office  had responsibility for leading the pilot. Some officials identified ORP as  the leader, while others thought it was CFM or the Center for Strategic  Partnerships. One CFM official told us that a clear definition of  responsibilities is needed under the pilot along with a dedicated office or  person with the ability to make decisions when an impasse across offices  exists. Similarly, a senior VHA official told us that leadership roles and  responsibilities for the pilot are not fully understood within the agency,  which has made establishing partnerships under the pilot a challenge. For  example, both VA officials and Omaha donor group representatives  identified the lack of a senior-level leader for the pilot as a challenge and  emphasized the need for strong pilot leadership going forward. Now that  a CHIP-IN steering committee is being formed to provide pilot leadership,  ORP officials intend to discuss committee members\u2019 roles and  responsibilities. This discussion was planned for the first committee  meeting but was rescheduled for the next meeting in October 2018. ORP  officials, however, told us that they do not expect to assign individual  members\u2019 roles and responsibilities until a future date. VA officials did not  have a timeline for when committee or individual members\u2019 roles and  responsibilities would be formally documented.", "ORP officials said that roles and responsibilities for the pilot have not  been defined because after enactment of the CHIP-IN Act, their first  priority was to engage the Omaha donor group and negotiate an agreement. Later, after the Omaha project was progressing, ORP officials  said they turned their attention to formalizing the pilot program and  identifying additional donation partnerships. While it is important to  concentrate on completion of individual projects, it is also important to  plan for the overall pilot\u2019s implementation\u2014to help ensure that the pilot\u2019s  purpose and goals are met and in a timely manner. We have found that  clarifying roles and responsibilities is an important activity in facilitating  strong collaboration and building effective cross-functional teams. In  addition, we have found that articulating roles and responsibilities is a  powerful tool in collaboration and that it is beneficial to detail such  collaborations in a formal, written document.", "Committed team members. Various VA offices and staff members have  worked on the CHIP-IN pilot in addition to their other responsibilities, but  several VA officials told us the resources currently dedicated to the pilot  are insufficient. During our review, an ORP official told us that two ORP  staff each spent about 4 to 6 hours per week on the pilot, as collateral  duties. However, since that time, one of these two staff members has left  the agency. A senior VA official told us that ORP and the Center for  Strategic Partnerships could each use two to three more dedicated staff  members to work solely on the pilot. While one ORP official said that  additional staff would likely be assigned after other CHIP-IN projects are  identified, a Center for Strategic Partnerships official said a specified  percentage of staff time should be dedicated now to identifying potential  donors. As mentioned above, VA officials told us they anticipate a  working group will be part of the CHIP-IN steering committee and will  serve as the dedicated team to implement the pilot. However, VA has not  yet documented how it will staff the working group, including how it will  obtain the needed expertise within its existing resources.", "According to one VA official, staff had not been initially dedicated to the  pilot because the CHIP-IN Act did not provide resources to fund a  dedicated team for the pilot, so VA has needed to implement the pilot  within its existing resources. This VA official also told us that they were  not certain VA could support a dedicated team with existing resources.  Another official indicated that VA would need to consider how to  incorporate CHIP-IN into the agency\u2019s operations if the pilot program  were expanded beyond the initial pilot and then dedicate needed resources. Dedicating a strong and stable implementation team is  important to ensuring that the effort receives the focused, full-time  attention needed.", "Team members with relevant knowledge and expertise. As previously  discussed, VA officials told us that it would be helpful for a CHIP-IN team  to include stakeholders with certain expertise, such as marketing and  philanthropic development experience. In addition, representatives from  the Omaha donor group said going forward, proactive public relations  expertise is needed from VA headquarters (in particular, for external  communications outside of the partnership) to quickly and positively  address any incidents that could negatively impact VA\u2019s ability to  encourage donor participation in the pilot at the local level. For example,  in the event of critical news reports about a local VA facility, such as what  occurred in Omaha, donor group representatives said that additional  public relations support would be helpful. VA officials also told us that a  CHIP-IN team should be a collaborative effort across several offices.  Specifically, one senior VA official said a cross-functional team with  representation from ORP, CFM Operations, the Center for Strategic  Partnerships, VHA, and the Office of Asset Enterprise Management  (which has budget and finance expertise) would be useful in focusing and  implementing the pilot. Leading practices for cross-functional teams  include having members with a wide diversity of knowledge and  expertise.", "Having a dedicated team or working group that consists of committed  members with clear roles and responsibilities could assist VA in  implementing the CHIP-IN pilot. For example, the working group could  focus time and attention on strengthening design of the pilot program as a  whole, instead of implementing projects on a piecemeal basis. Further,  clearly identifying and documenting roles and responsibilities could help  relevant stakeholders define and agree upon pilot objectives as well as an  assessment methodology and evaluation plan.
