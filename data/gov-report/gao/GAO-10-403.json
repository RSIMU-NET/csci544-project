Benefits vary by MA plan and may include coverage for services not available in traditional Medicare. To ensure MA plan benefit package designs do not discriminate against beneficiaries in poor health with high expected health care costs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reviews and approves all benefit packages yearly. GAO examined (1) MA plan benefit packages by average health status of plans' enrolled beneficiaries, (2) distribution and characteristics of MA plans by average beneficiary health status, and (3) CMS's process for ensuring that benefit packages do not discriminate with respect to health status. Using 2008 data on beneficiaries' expected health care costs, the most recent data available, GAO sorted 2,899 plans enrolling 7.5 million beneficiaries into three groups: good health (below-average expected costs), average health, and poor health (above-average expected costs). GAO then analyzed MA plan benefit packages by health group and reviewed CMS documentation and interviewed agency officials on CMS's benefit package review process. GAO did not determine whether plans structured benefit packages in response to enrolled beneficiaries' health status or beneficiaries in particular health groups chose plans because of the benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, plans in the good health group generally had lower premiums, higher cost sharing for certain services, and fewer additional benefits than plans in the poor health group. Almost half of the plans in the good health group did not have an MA premium for medical or drug coverage, while about one-fifth of plans in the poor health group had no MA premium. Plans in the good health group had higher cost sharing, weighted by enrollment, for inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility stays, and renal dialysis than plans in the poor health group. Plans in the good health group were more likely to have an out-of-pocket (OOP) maximum, but the average OOP maximum for plans in that group, weighted by enrollment, was 55 percent higher than that for plans in the poor health group. Comprehensive dental and hearing aid benefits were more likely to be included in the benefit packages for beneficiaries in the poor health group of plans whereas fitness benefits were more likely to be included in the benefit packages for beneficiaries in the good health group of plans. Forty-three percent of plans were in the good health group, 37 percent in the average health group, and 20 percent in the poor health group. Twenty-nine percent of MA beneficiaries were in plans in the good health group, 55 percent in plans in the average health group, and 16 percent in plans in the poor health group. Among the five largest companies sponsoring MA plans, beneficiary health varied: one sponsor had 17 percent of its beneficiaries in plans in the good health group and 17 percent in plans in the poor health group; another sponsor had 49 percent of beneficiaries in plans in the good health group and less than 1 percent in plans in the poor health group. Average beneficiary health status also varied by other factors, such as plan type and plan size. CMS has revised its process for reviewing MA plans for the likelihood of discrimination. It developed a new methodology for setting cost-sharing thresholds--criteria used to identify benefit packages likely to discriminate against certain beneficiaries. For contract year 2010, CMS contacted all MA plans with benefit packages identified as likely to discriminate, and all plans subsequently met cost-sharing thresholds. The new methodology for setting cost-sharing thresholds allowed higher cost sharing for some services relative to 2009. For example, among plans without an OOP maximum or one above $3,400 for 2010, allowed cost sharing for a typical inpatient mental health stay doubled, from $61 per day to $130 per day, and allowed cost sharing for a typical skilled nursing facility stay increased from $53 to $70 per day, compared to 2009. In comments on a draft of this report, CMS noted that GAO's findings are consistent with the agency's experience. CMS also stated that, prior to contract year 2010, it targeted for cost-sharing reductions plans with the most egregious cost sharing and often reduced cost-sharing amounts, but to amounts that were still above the thresholds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly one out of every four Medicare beneficiaries is enrolled in a  Medicare Advantage (MA) plan\u2014an alternative to original Medicare fee- for-service (FFS)\u2014in which private insurance plans offer health care  coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. As of December 2009, nearly   11 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in approximately 4,700  plans offered by 188 MA organizations (MAO). Medicare payments to MA  plans were approximately $109.7 billion in fiscal year 2009. In addition to  covering services paid for under Medicare FFS, many MA plans offer  additional benefits, such as vision, hearing, or dental care and MA plans  typically have premiums lower than those of Medicare supplemental  policies purchased by FFS beneficiaries (known as Medigap). MA  beneficiaries generally have an array of plans to choose from, each with  different coverage, premiums, and cost sharing\u2014the portion of medical  expenses that the beneficiary is responsible for paying out-of-pocket  (OOP).", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that  administers the Medicare program\u2014pays MA plans a fixed amount to  cover each beneficiary and oversees plan benefit designs. CMS adjusts  payments to plans using risk scores, which estimate the expected health  care costs of the beneficiaries enrolled in a plan. Risk scores are  developed from data on individuals\u2019 demographics and diagnoses. As a  result, MA plans receive relatively lower payments for beneficiaries who  are healthier than average, and relatively higher payments for beneficiaries  who are sicker than average.", "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) reported that  Medicare\u2019s risk-adjustment methodology may tend to set payments too  low for beneficiaries in poor health, who tend to have high expected  health care costs, and set payments too high for the healthiest  beneficiaries who tend to have low expected health care costs. As a  result, MAOs may have a financial incentive to discourage new or  continued enrollment of beneficiaries in poor health. It is possible that  some MAOs could do this through the design of their plan benefit  packages. For example, a plan that charges relatively high cost-sharing  amounts for certain services commonly used by beneficiaries in poor  health may prove particularly undesirable to them. MA plans have  flexibility in designing their benefit packages, but (1) they must provide all  Medicare-covered services except hospice care, (2) their overall cost- sharing requirements must be actuarially equivalent or lower than those  under Medicare FFS, and (3) they cannot discriminate on the basis of  health status. By law, CMS may not approve MA plan benefit packages if  their designs are likely to substantially discourage enrollment of certain  beneficiaries. To determine whether an MA plan benefit package is likely  to substantially discourage enrollment of certain beneficiaries, CMS  reviews cost sharing for certain services for which excessively high cost  sharing could be considered discriminatory.", "We reported in 2008 that 2007 cost sharing for certain services, such as  home health and inpatient hospital stays, was higher in some MA plans  than in Medicare FFS. However, we have not previously examined how  plan benefit design varied among MA plans by average beneficiary health  status. Therefore, you asked that we review MA plan benefit designs,  enrollment patterns, and related CMS oversight. This report examines   (1) benefit packages of MA plans by average health status of plans\u2019  enrolled beneficiaries, (2) the distribution and characteristics of MA plans  by average beneficiary health status, and (3) CMS\u2019s process for ensuring  that MA plan benefit packages are not discriminatory with respect to  health status.", "To address these issues, we focused on four types of MA plans that  together accounted for nearly all of MA enrollment in 2009\u2014health  maintenance organizations (HMO), private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans,  local preferred provider organizations (PPO), and regional PPOs. We  included special needs plans (SNP), which are allowed to limit enrollment  to a targeted beneficiary population; SNPs can be HMOs, local PPOs, or  regional PPOs. After certain exclusions, we analyzed data for 2,899 plans  (including 621 SNPs), offered by 192 MAOs that enrolled 74 percent of all  MA beneficiaries\u20147.5 million\u2014as of July 2008. Of the 973,923  beneficiaries enrolled in SNPs, over two-thirds were in plans that targeted  enrollment to dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014those entitled to both Medicare  and Medicaid. In some of our analyses, we reported our results for SNPs  separately in order to highlight the distinct characteristics of such plans.", "Using CMS\u2019s 2008 plan-level risk score data by county, the most recent  data available, we categorized the average health status of MA plans as  good, average, or poor in the areas that they served. Risk scores are based  on beneficiaries\u2019 projected health care costs, which CMS develops using  demographic information and diagnosis codes. At the plan level, risk  scores indicate the average health status of the plans\u2019 beneficiaries.  Because the overall Medicare population may be healthier in some  geographic areas than in others, we calculated an indexed (relative) health  risk score for each plan as the ratio of an MA plan\u2019s risk score to the  overall Medicare average risk score in each county. We then averaged  each plan\u2019s indexed risk score across the counties that comprised the  plan\u2019s service area, weighted by July 2008 enrollment. With 1.00 as the  average risk score for all Medicare beneficiaries\u2014in FFS and MA\u2014we  placed the MA plans in one of three groups.", "Good health group: MA plans with an average indexed risk score less  than 0.90, meaning the projected health care costs for the average  beneficiary in the plan were at least 10 percent lower than those for an  average Medicare beneficiary living in the plan\u2019s service area.", "Average health group: MA plans with an average indexed risk score  between 0.90 and 1.10, meaning the projected health care costs for the  average beneficiary in the plan were within 10 percent of those for an  average Medicare beneficiary living in the plan\u2019s service area.", "Poor health group: MA plans with an average indexed risk score greater  than 1.10, meaning the projected health care costs for the average  beneficiary in the plan were at least 10 percent higher than those for an  average Medicare beneficiary living in the plan\u2019s service area.", "To compare the benefit packages of MA plans by the average health status  of plans\u2019 enrolled beneficiaries, we analyzed CMS plan benefit package  (PBP) data for contract year 2008 (as the risk score data used in our  analysis is based on MA plan enrollment as of July 2008). CMS\u2019s PBP data  contain each MA plan\u2019s premiums, cost-sharing requirements, and  additional benefits. We analyzed cost sharing for eight services for which  CMS considers high cost sharing to be potentially discriminatory because  these services typically are used by Medicare beneficiaries in poor health  and are usually associated with acute and chronic conditions, high  utilization, and high cost. For several services, we simulated beneficiary  OOP costs using average beneficiary utilization profiles developed by CMS  and accounted for plans that charged service-specific deductibles or had  service-specific OOP maximums\u2014dollar limits on the amount a  beneficiary must pay in cost sharing in a period of coverage (typically   1 year). We also determined whether MA plans provided additional  coverage for dental, vision, or hearing services; and fitness benefits. We  did not determine whether MAOs structured their plan benefit packages in  response to enrolled beneficiaries\u2019 health status or whether beneficiaries  of a given health status chose certain MA plans specifically because of  their benefit package designs.", "To examine the distribution and characteristics of MA plans by beneficiary  health status, we analyzed 2008 MA plan-level risk score data, the most  recent data available, and calculated the number of MA plans and the  percentage of plan beneficiaries in each health group. We further  examined the differences across the health groups (1) among the five  largest MAOs, (2) by plan type, (3) by plan size, (4) and by the percentage  difference between the MA payment benchmarks and estimated FFS  spending across a plan\u2019s service area.", "To describe CMS\u2019s process for ensuring that MA plan benefit packages are  not discriminatory with respect to health status, we interviewed CMS  officials, including staff responsible for reviewing and approving plan  benefit packages; and reviewed relevant laws and regulations, CMS  standard operating procedures, and other agency documentation on the  review process. We determined the outcome of CMS\u2019s review process by  analyzing data for contract years 2008 and 2009 on MA plans that CMS  initially identified as having potentially discriminatory cost sharing and  data on MA plans\u2019 final cost-sharing requirements for contract years 2008  through 2010.", "We interviewed CMS officials about reliability of the CMS data used in our  analysis. We also reviewed data documentation and performed certain  data checks to ensure the data were reasonable and consistent. For  example, we compared the results of our cost sharing analysis using PBP  data with information from the Medicare Options Compare Web site. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  conducted our work from April 2009 through April 2010 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

If a plan had cost sharing for one or  more selected services that exceeded the CMS thresholds and did not have  an OOP maximum or if the OOP maximum was above the amount  specified in the Call Letter, CMS considered the plan likely to be  discriminatory. In contract years 2008 and 2009, CMS generally set  thresholds based on cost sharing under Medicare FFS, not at amounts that  were relative to all MA plans\u2019 cost-sharing amounts. For example, for  contract year 2008 CMS set the MA cost-sharing threshold for Part B drugs  at 20 percent coinsurance, equivalent to that under Medicare FFS.", "The methodology CMS used in contract year 2010 resulted in thresholds  that allowed higher cost-sharing amounts for some services than those  applicable in contract year 2009. For example, among plans without an  OOP maximum or one above the amount specified in the 2010 Call Letter,  the copayment allowed for a typical inpatient mental health stay doubled  from $61 to $130 per day and the copayment allowed for a typical SNF stay  increased from $53 to $70 per day. For other services that CMS reviewed  for discriminatory cost sharing, new thresholds allowed cost-sharing  amounts in contract year 2010 that were comparable or lower than those  in contract year 2009. For example, the copayment allowed for a typical  inpatient hospital stay was reduced from $213 to $175 per day and the cost  sharing allowed for home health visits was reduced to zero."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Revised How It Selects Plans to Contact for Benefit Package Modifications; All Plans Met New Cost-Sharing Thresholds", "paragraphs": ["Under the revised process, for contract year 2010 CMS contacted all MA  plans identified as having benefit packages likely to be discriminatory\u2014 those that exceeded agency thresholds. In addition, all plans contacted  subsequently reduced cost-sharing amounts to at or below agency  thresholds. In contrast, in previous years, CMS did not contact all plans  exceeding the thresholds and not all plans contacted reduced their cost- sharing amounts to equal to or below agency thresholds. In previous years,  CMS\u2019s policy did not require disapproval of a plan benefit package if cost  sharing was above CMS\u2019s cost-sharing thresholds.", "CMS\u2019s new selection process is intended to ensure that all MA plans  identified as likely to be discriminatory are contacted regarding lowering  their cost sharing to meet the new thresholds. According to agency  officials, of the 2,930 MA plan benefit packages submitted for contract  year 2010, about 40 percent were identified as likely to be discriminatory.  CMS staff contacted all of those plans about complying with cost-sharing  thresholds, and all plans subsequently reduced cost-sharing amounts to at  or below the new thresholds. However, if CMS had applied the contract  year 2009 review methodology\u2014with its lower thresholds for certain  services\u2014to the plans submitted for contract year 2010, approximately   38 percent of the plans in our analysis would have exceeded cost-sharing  thresholds.", "In previous years, CMS approved some MA plans that did not meet its cost- sharing thresholds. For contract years 2008 and 2009, over one in four and  nearly one in three plans, respectively, had cost sharing that exceeded one  or more CMS thresholds. (See table 1.) Our analysis indicated that the  percentage of plans initially exceeding and remaining above one or more  cost-sharing thresholds in those 2 years varied by plans\u2019 average  beneficiary health status, as follows:    Among the good health group of plans reviewed for contract year 2008,   39 percent were initially identified as having cost sharing that exceeded  CMS\u2019s cost-sharing thresholds and 33 percent were approved with cost  sharing that exceeded CMS\u2019s cost-sharing thresholds, a decrease of   6 percentage points. The percentage of plans in the poor health group that  exceeded CMS\u2019s thresholds prior to and after plans were approved also  decreased by 6 percentage points, from 20 percent to 14 percent.", "Among the good health group of plans reviewed for contract year 2009,   35 percent were initially identified as having cost sharing that exceeded  CMS\u2019s cost-sharing thresholds and 29 percent were approved with cost  sharing that exceeded CMS\u2019s cost-sharing thresholds, a decrease of   6 percentage points. The percentage of plans in the poor health group that  exceeded CMS\u2019s thresholds prior to and after plans were approved  decreased by 1 percentage point, from 38 percent to 37 percent.", "In contract years 2008 and 2009, CMS did not contact all plans initially  found to have cost sharing that exceeded one or more thresholds. CMS  primarily selected plans to contact for cost-sharing reductions from among  those identified as likely to be discriminatory by considering (1) the  number of services for which cost sharing exceeded the CMS threshold   (2) how much the plan exceeded the cost-sharing threshold, and (3) how  the plan\u2019s cost sharing compared with that of other MA plans within the  same service area. In addition, CMS officials told us the process used to  select plans for cost-sharing discussions in these years had the potential to  be subjective; decisions were based on individual reviewers\u2019 evaluations of  cost sharing and judgments about how much the cost sharing exceeded  CMS\u2019s thresholds. Among the plans contacted for cost-sharing reductions  in these years, CMS reported that some reduced their cost-sharing  amounts, but they remained above the thresholds. For example, for  contract year 2008, CMS reported that nearly half of the MA plans initially  identified as likely to be discriminatory reduced cost sharing as a result of  being contacted by CMS.", "Figures 10 and 11 show the review process for contract year 2010 and for  contract years 2008 and 2009, respectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other External Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on a draft of this report from CMS and America\u2019s  Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a national organization that represents  private health insurance companies, including those that participate in the  MA program.

We  believe that the third finding of the report adequately conveys that  information. Figure 11 shows that plans with an OOP maximum at or  below the amount specified in the Call Letter were not considered likely to  be discriminatory regardless of their cost-sharing amounts for particular  services. Further, CMS pointed out that its policy until 2009 did not require  disapproval of a plan benefit package if cost sharing was above CMS\u2019s  cost-sharing thresholds. We added this information to the report. In  addition to these points, CMS described other aspects of its previous and  current benefit review process for context.", "CMS suggested a number of presentation modifications to the report.
