However, GAO found that two DOD components, the Navy and Defense Logistics Agency, have instituted definitions, policies, and procedures to manage and track their use. The components took these steps due to concerns that bridge contracts were being used too frequently and reducing competition. Federal internal control standards stipulate that management should identify, analyze, and monitor risks associated with achieving objectives, such as maximizing competition. Staff from the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), which provides direction for government-wide procurement policies so as to promote efficiency and effectiveness in government acquisitions, acknowledge that the use of bridge contracts may introduce risks related to a lack of competition. Without a definition of bridge contracts and guidance for tracking and managing their use, agencies are not able to fully identify and monitor these risks and increase opportunities for competition.", "The 73 bridge contracts GAO analyzed varied widely in characteristics such as the type of service and length of contract. Almost half of the contracts were used to procure either professional management services or information technology services. Although bridge contracts are typically envisioned as short-term, GAO found that some bridge contracts spanned multiple years, potentially undetected by approving officials. For example, of the 29 contracts GAO reviewed in-depth, 6 were longer than 3 years. As the figure below illustrates, an Army bridge contract for computer support services was initially planned as a 12-month bridge, but because of subsequent bridges, ultimately spanned 42 months.", "Even after lengthy bridge contract scenarios, most follow-on contracts were awarded competitively. Of the 26 cases in GAO's review where follow-on contracts were awarded, 23 were awarded competitively, in some instances leading to savings. The fact that competition occurred in almost all cases, which can save the government money, highlights the importance of better management controls over use of bridge contracts.", "Acquisition planning delays, such as revisions to statements of work and delays in source selection, as well as an inexperienced and overwhelmed acquisition workforce, bid protests, and budget uncertainties contributed to the use of bridge contracts in the cases GAO studied. Often, more than one of these factors led to the use of a bridge contract."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OFPP take steps to amend the FAR to incorporate a definition of bridge contracts, and, in the interim, provide guidance for agencies to track and manage their use.

We also developed a customized search  methodology using data from FPDS-NG to identify potential bridge  contracts. Our methodology included searching for (1) contract  extensions between fiscal years 2010 to 2013 that extended a contract\u2019s  period of performance and (2) sole-source contracts awarded in fiscal  year 2013 that had been awarded to the same contractor by the same  contracting organization and for the same services as a preceding  contract\u2014and with periods of performance of no more than 12 months.  We selected these timeframes so as to increase the likelihood that we  could include follow-on contracts in our review. Using the result of this  search, we selected three agencies (the Department of Defense (DOD),  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the  Department of Justice (DOJ)) and several components within each  agency for review, based on those with the highest number of potential  bridge contracts. We selected the following eight components for review:", "DOD: Air Force, Army, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)", "HHS: National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Indian Health Service  (IHS)", "DOJ: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of  Prisons (BOP)", "To gain insights into the selected agencies\u2019 use of bridge contracts, we  collected and analyzed any policies and procedures on bridge contracts  and interviewed officials about their knowledge of the use of bridge  contracts and any management controls that may be in place.

We focused  on service contracts since agency officials and our prior work indicated  that bridge contracts were predominantly used for services. We used two  processes for identifying the 73 contracts included in our review: (1) 52  contracts identified based on our customized search of FPDS-NG, and (2)  21 contracts initially identified by selected components and verified by us  as bridge contracts. To arrive at the selection of the 52 contracts, we  provided a list of potential bridge contracts identified through the search  methodology described above to each component included in our review.  The components then provided contract documentation that we analyzed  to determine whether the selected contracts matched our definition of  bridge contracts. Based on this analysis, we identified 52 bridge contracts  across the components to be included in our review. We then added in 21  contracts identified on lists of bridge contracts provided to us by  components included in our review. We conducted a high level review of  the 73 contracts\u2014collecting and reviewing contract award and extension  documentation, such as justification and approval (J&A) documents, price  negotiation memorandums, relevant contract modifications, and file  memoranda. We then selected a subset of 29 contracts from 6 of the 8  components for a more in-depth review, based on several factors,  specifically the contract value, obtaining a mix of contract extensions and  stand-alone bridge contracts, and the location of the contract files. For  this in-depth review, we reviewed the bridge contract, the contract  preceding it, and, if awarded at the time of our review, the follow-on  contract. The results from the sample of contracts included in our review  are not generalizable, but are designed to provide illustrative examples of  the characteristics and rationale for the use of bridge contracts at the  selected agencies and components and supplement the information  obtained from our interviews and review of agency policies and  procedures. We also interviewed contracting and program officials to  discuss the facts and circumstances related to the award of the bridge  contracts for the subset of 29 contracts in our sample, and the  challenges, if any, related to their use.

However, in certain situations, it may become evident that a base contract  and any option years will expire before a subsequent contract to meet the  same need can be awarded. In these cases, because of time constraints,  contracting officers generally use one of two options: (1) extend the  existing contract for up to 6 months or (2) award a short-term stand-alone  contract to the incumbent contractor on a sole-source basis to avoid a  lapse in services. While these contracting options have been informally  referred to as bridge contracts by some in the acquisition community, no  formal definition of bridge contracts exists nor is there a requirement to  track them in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). For the purposes  of this report, we established the following definitions:", "Bridge contract. An extension to an existing contract beyond the  period of performance (including option years), or a new, short-term  contract awarded on a sole-source basis to an incumbent contractor  to avoid a lapse in service caused by a delay in awarding a follow-on  contract.", "Predecessor contract. The contract in place prior to the award of a  bridge contract.", "Follow-on contract. A longer-term contract that follows a bridge  contract for the same or similar services. This contract can be  competitively awarded or awarded on a sole-source basis.", "Contract extensions and the award of stand-alone bridge contracts are  established in different ways. If a contracting officer needs a bridge  contract and opts to extend an existing, predecessor contract, the  contracting officer may use a number of different authorities to do this. If  the predecessor contract included the \u201coption to extend services clause,\u201d  the contracting officer could use this clause to extend the contract for up  to six months, based on the FAR. If the contracting officer determines  that a new short-term sole-source contract should be awarded to avoid a  gap in services, the FAR generally requires that the contract award be  supported by a written justification known as a justification and approval  document (J&A). The J&A must include sufficient facts and rationale to  justify the use of a sole-source contract and include, among other things,  the following information:", "The nature or description of the action being approved;", "A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency\u2019s  need, including the estimated value of the contract;", "The statutory authority being cited to justify a noncompetitive  contract\u2014for example urgency, only one-source available, etc;", "A demonstration that the proposed contractor\u2019s unique qualifications  or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited; and", "A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to  the government will be fair and reasonable.", "While OMB has stated that noncompetitive contracts can play an  important role in helping agencies address the needs that arise during  emergencies, we and others have noted that competition is the  cornerstone of a sound acquisition process and OMB has issued  guidelines for federal agencies to increase competition and reduce their  spending on sole-source contracts. Further, the FAR prescribes policies  and procedures to promote full and open competition.", "There are few, if any, federal contracting reviews or reports focused  solely on bridge contracts. However, we and others have identified such  contracts in prior reviews and, in some cases, reported on challenges  related to their use. For instance, in an August 2011 report on acquisition  planning, we reported that a prior GAO bid protest decision found that the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection  had not properly justified an $11.5 million bridge contract and had failed  to engage in reasonable advanced acquisition planning. In a March 2012  report on competition, we found that 18 out of the 111 J&As we reviewed  were for bridge contracts with a total value of over $9 billion. We found  that these bridge contracts were caused by delays in the acquisition  planning process, unexpected expansion of requirements, and bid  protests. In March 2014, we issued a report on noncompetitive contracts  awarded on the basis of urgency. We found that 12 of the 34 contracts  we reviewed were bridge contracts. The average period of performance  for these 12 contracts was 11 months with a total contract value over  $466 million. Additionally, in a March 2010 report on competition for  services contracts, the Institute for Defense Analyses reported that nearly  one in four sole-source contracts reviewed were bridge contracts. That  report noted that bridge contracts represented a potentially large cost to  DOD due to process inefficiencies such as the cost of administering the  bridge contracts, the strain on the limited DOD contracting workforce  because bridge contracts must be justified and awarded while the follow- on contract was being planned, and the loss of benefits associated with  competition during the period that the bridge contracts are in place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Little to No Insight into Their Use of Bridge Contracts but Two Components Have Instituted Policies", "paragraphs": ["The agencies we reviewed had limited or no insights into their use of  bridge contracts. None of the agencies have agency-level policies to  manage and track their use of bridge contracts, nor do their acquisition  regulations define bridge contracts. HHS officials told us that their agency  has no overarching policy because the agency does not have a standard  definition for bridge contracts. Officials at DOD said that, at the  department-level, the agency did not have any policies because bridge  contracts had not previously been raised as a specific concern at the  department. DOJ officials indicated they see defining bridge contracts as  a government-wide issue, and officials from one of their components told  us that the concept of defining bridge contracts was a new one to them.", "HHS officials also stated that the agency has some visibility into high- dollar bridge contracts through the FAR-required reviews of J&As.", "Two of the eight components\u2014the Navy and DLA\u2014established policies in  2012 and 2013, respectively, regarding the use of bridge contracts. Both  components\u2019 policies were established to reduce reliance on bridge  contracts and note that bridge contracts can be an impediment to  competition. DLA\u2019s policy further states that bridge contracts may be  indicative of a lack of adequate preparation for follow-on acquisitions.  DLA officials we spoke with told us that there was concern at DLA  regarding the impact bridge contracts could have on competition, since  they effectively delay competition by extending existing contracts or  awarding sole-source contracts to incumbent contractors. Officials said  that they hope the policy will increase competition at DLA by focusing  management attention on the use of bridge contracts and tracking their  use. In both cases, these components\u2019 policies go beyond the standard  J&A requirements for sole-source contracts to specifically address bridge  contracts. Features of these components\u2019 policies on bridge contracts are  included in table 1.", "As the table shows, DLA\u2019s definition of bridge contracts explicitly includes  contract extensions whereas the Navy\u2019s has additional guidance as to  when contract extensions are considered bridges. A DLA official told us  that they included contract extensions in their definition because  extensions still enable officials to bridge a gap in service without  competition. The Navy report to the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Navy, Acquisition and Procurement includes contract  numbers, periods of performance for the predecessor and bridge  contracts, dollar values, and the rationale supporting the use of a bridge  contract, among other information. The DLA report to the Acquisition  Operations Division includes contract numbers, periods of performance  for the bridge contract, dollar values, number of the bridge contracts  awarded for the requirement, and other information.", "According to Navy officials, the department is monitoring the contract  values of bridge contracts awarded. For example, officials told us that in  fiscal year 2014 the Navy made bridge contract awards in excess of $1.6  billion. Navy officials told us that while it is too early to quantify, the  implementation of the policy brought about a cultural shift away from  more frequent use of bridge contracts and helped significantly curb  prolonged use of bridge contracts. According to a DLA official responsible  for compiling bridge contract information, DLA awarded $1.3 billion in  bridge contract awards in fiscal year 2014. DLA officials also told us that  they were seeing reductions in the use of bridge contracts based on an  internal review process. Increased attention to bridge contracts, according  to a DLA official, sends a message to program-level activities that DLA  wants to reduce its use of bridge contracts, and requiring approval  appears to be an effective deterrent to awarding bridge contracts if the  program or contracting office does not have a good reason to do so, such  as poor acquisition planning.", "In addition, one activity within the Army\u2014the Health Care Acquisition  Activity (HCAA), which was not included as part of our review\u2014issued a  policy memorandum in November 2008 that established a definition and  an approval and tracking mechanism for bridge contracts. Similar to the  policies at the Navy and DLA, HCAA\u2019s policy was established due to  concern over the increasing reliance on bridge contracts at the activity. In  particular, the policy stated that there was concern that bridge contracts,  which prevent competition, were being awarded to expand the scope of  the original requirement, which was increasing costs. The policy and  compliance branch at HCAA developed a tracking system to account for  the number of bridge contracts awarded. According to HCAA officials,  issuing the policy memorandum and requiring officials to report their use  of bridge contracts has enhanced the activity\u2019s ability to track bridge  contract use and prevented the award of bridge contracts that increase  the scope of work established by the predecessor contract.", "Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify,  analyze, and monitor risks associated with achieving objectives, and that  information needs to be recorded and communicated to management so  as to achieve agency objectives. One common procurement objective at  federal agencies is to maximize competition. However, without a definition  for bridge contracts, and strategies for tracking and managing their use,  agencies are not able to fully identify and monitor the risks related to  these contracts, and therefore may be missing opportunities to increase  competition. As we noted earlier, the FAR does not define bridge  contracts. Staff from OMB\u2019s OFPP, one of the entities responsible for  initiating revisions to the FAR, acknowledged that the use of bridge  contracts may introduce risks related to a lack of competition, such as the  risk of higher contract prices. Similarly, contracting, program, and policy  officials we spoke with also stated that while bridge contracts are an  important \u201ctool in their toolbox\u201d for ensuring continuity of services, some  officials indicated that their prolonged use poses a risk to competition,  and that use of bridge contracts should be avoided when possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bridge Contracts Cover a Variety of Services and Can Span Multiple Years, and Follow-on Contracts Were Generally Competed", "paragraphs": ["DOD, DOJ, and HHS awarded bridge contracts to procure a diverse array  of services, ranging from professional and administrative support to  housekeeping.

For  example, during our initial review of J&A documentation for an NIH bridge  contract for utility services at a research facility, we found no record of an  additional four-month bridge contract. Through our interviews with  contracting officials, however, we learned that another bridge contract  had been awarded prior to the bridge contract we had identified. In  another example, our initial review of a J&A for a residential reentry  services contract at BOP indicated that contracting officials granted  approval for a seven-month bridge contract, but upon further review, we  found that there were five separate bridge contracts awarded over a 27- month period between the predecessor and follow-on contracts.

Approving  officials, signing off on individual J&As, would not have insight into the  total number of bridge contracts that may be put in place by looking at  individual J&As alone. Without a definition and a policy for bridge  contracts, J&A documentation generally provides information on the  individual contract covered by the J&A, and on the anticipated period of  performance and estimated contract value at the time of award, rather  than a full picture of the cumulative time and cost associated with bridging  a gap in services for a requirement.", "Overall the average period of performance for the 73 contracts we  reviewed at a high-level was 8 months, and the average period of  performance for the 29 contracts we reviewed in-depth was 21 months.

For instance, in the example displayed in Figure  3, Army contracting officials extended a bridge contract on two occasions,  with each extension lasting six months in duration. This means an  additional year was added to the initial period of performance of one year.  For both extensions, contracting officials cited the option to extend  services clause. Additionally, we learned from contract file review  documentation that contracting officials had attempted to extend this  bridge contract a third time, but the local office of small business  programs denied this request because the incumbent contractor no  longer qualified as a small business.

While the  rate increased from the predecessor contract to the first bridge, it  decreased from the first to second bridge, and decreased again from  the second bridge to the competitive follow-on contract. Most  significant is the rate reduction for the Database Management  Specialist; the award of the follow-on contract resulted in a decreased  hourly rate of nearly $21.00, or 28 percent. The contracting official  responsible for this contract told us that by awarding the follow-on  contract competitively, the incumbent contractor had to re-evaluate  what price the market demands for these services.", "Competition has generally been considered to be associated with  achieving more favorable prices, and we and others have cited potential  savings from competition in prior work.

The majority of agency officials that we interviewed identified  bid protests as a common reason for the use of bridge contracts, and we  found that bid protests had caused delays in eight of the 29 contracts  included in our in-depth review\u2013roughly a quarter\u2014and that bid protests  created substantial delays in awarding follow-on contracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Late Completion of Acquisition Planning Documentation Most Frequently Identified Reason for Bridge Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Based on our reviews of contract documentation and information provided  by agency officials, we found that the most commonly cited reasons for  the use of a bridge contract across the 73 contracts were related to  acquisition planning issues\u2014in particular the late completion of key  acquisition planning documentation, such as statements of work, that are  needed to begin a solicitation. Acquisition planning activities generally  begin when the program office identifies a need, involves research and  preparation of acquisition documents by both the program office and the  contracting office, and concludes when the contracting office issues a  solicitation. Our prior work has identified challenges that agencies faced  in relation to acquisition planning on contracts for services, such as  defining their needs and providing guidance to program offices on  timeframes for pre-solicitation activities, such as defining requirements in  a statement of work document.", "Other frequently identified reasons for delays included delays in source  selection, acquisition workforce challenges, and bid protests, among  others. Figure 7 illustrates the number of instances each reason was cited  for the contracts included in our sample. For most of the contracts, there  were multiple reasons driving the use of bridge contracts.", "Our findings regarding the reasons behind the use of bridge contracts  echo the findings of the Institute for Defense Analyses\u2019 March 2010 report  on competitiveness in contracts for services. That report noted that  bridge contracts occur when a delay in the acquisition process prevents  the award of a competitive follow-on contract until after the contract in  place is due to expire. The report further explained that these delays arise  from various sources, including the requiring agency or program office,  the contracting office, and other sources such as bid protests.", "Our in-depth review of 29 contracts further underscored that acquisition  planning issues frequently led to the use of bridge contracts and provided  additional insights into the nature of these issues. For example, the  majority of the contracting officials that we interviewed cited the late  submission of key acquisition planning documentation from program  officials as one of the most common reasons why bridge contracts are  needed. For 18 of the contracts, contracting officials told us that the  statement of work, in particular, was either submitted late by the program  office, required multiple rounds of revisions before it was ready to be  published, or a combination of those two factors contributed to the need  for a bridge contract. Acquisition planning challenges stemming from the  coordination of program and contracting offices have been highlighted in  some of our past work. For example, in a July 2010 report on competition,  we found that several contracting officials from different agencies  expressed concern that program offices sometimes do not allow them  enough time to execute a sufficiently robust acquisition planning process  that could increase opportunities for competition. They told us that  program offices are insufficiently aware of the amount of time needed to  properly define requirements or conduct adequate market research.", "A contract awarded by DEA highlights some of the acquisition planning  problems that we found across the 29 contracts. In this example, DEA  contracting officials told us that the program office was late in submitting  the statement of work. According to those officials, a contract extension  was awarded for 6 months to accommodate this delay. During this time,  the contracting office issued a solicitation for this requirement and  received multiple proposals for the follow-on contract, but the source  selection board realized during the proposal evaluation phase that the  statement of work did not accurately reflect the agency\u2019s needs. Upon  realizing that a completely new statement of work was required, DEA  decided to cancel the solicitation and awarded a six month bridge  contract, which was later extended by three months to accommodate the  additional time it needed to award a follow-on contract.", "Acquisition planning shortfalls caused substantial delays for some  contracts we reviewed at other components as well. For example, at  BOP, we found a series of 17 stand-alone bridge contracts, most of which  were about three months in length, to provide natural gas service at a  penitentiary that were put in place after the predecessor contract expired  in January 2011\u2014following a four month contract extension. Contracting  officials told us that the program office was extremely late in submitting  the necessary paperwork to award a follow-on contract, and did not  submit the required acquisition planning documents until February 2014,  over three years after the predecessor contract expired. As of the date of  this review, contracting officials have yet to award a follow-on contract  and attribute these delays to personnel shortages within the contracting  office. Specifically, contracting officials told us that they are short-staffed;  explaining that 119 different requirements are handled by only two  contracting officers, therefore, this requirement often gets placed on the  backburner, resulting in the need for bridge contracts to prevent a gap in  critical services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acquisition Workforce Challenges Also Led to Bridge Contracts", "paragraphs": ["As the previous example highlights, challenges related to the acquisition  workforce can exacerbate delays, and thus contribute to the award of  bridge contracts.

Contracting officials at the Air Force told us that in  one instance, inexperienced contracting personnel failed to exercise the  second annual option for a logistics management contract and the  contract expired. However, the contractor continued to provide services  during that time without a contract in place for over five weeks before the  mistake was realized. As a result of this and other problems, the last two  years of the contract could not be used, and a series of noncompetitive  bridge contracts totaling 41 months were used until a competitive follow- on contract was awarded. The same Air Force officials also told us that  the majority of their contracting workforce had less than five years of  experience, which contributed to significant delays in awarding follow-on  contracts. Similarly, three Army contracting officials told us that their  divisions did not have enough experienced contracting officers or  available attorneys to run source-selection boards in order to select  vendors for follow-on contracts. One of those officials also told us that  their overwhelmed contracting office also struggled to award new  contracts in a timely manner. For example, that official told us that a  bridge contract that had been in place for 37 months would likely be  extended yet again even though it was possible to award a follow-on  contract, because it was unclear if anyone in her division would have  enough time to dedicate to that requirement before the current bridge  contract expired. Contracting and program officials from this Army  component concurred that workforce challenges in both the program and  contracting offices were the primary reason why they awarded multiple  bridge contracts that lasted more than three years.

This official also stated that  there may have been a larger staffing issue in the contracting office  during this time that contributed to the solicitation being issued later than  expected after the statement of work had been finalized.", "Through our analysis of contract documentation and information provided  by agency officials, we also found that a lack of institutional knowledge  within the contracting office was apparent for seven of the 73 contracts in  our sample. This acquisition workforce problem was generally the result  of staff turnover coupled with a lack of contract documentation. For  example, after reviewing a contract file for software within DEA  laboratories and interviewing contracting and program officials, we were  unable to determine the specific reason why a bridge contract was  needed. After reviewing the contract documentation following our visit, the  DEA was also unable to identify the specific reason for delay that led to a  bridge contract. Similarly, DLA could not provide specific reasons beyond  the need for continued services for six contracts in our sample. As a point  of comparison, the Navy had greater institutional knowledge regardless of  staff turnover due to the high level of detail provided in their J&As and  contract documentation. Navy officials we spoke with as part of our in- depth review were generally more aware of the facts and circumstances  for the bridge contracts they awarded when compared to their  counterparts at other components. The contracting officials we spoke with  stated that the Navy\u2019s policy on bridge contracts has curtailed their use,  especially since contracting officials have faced pressure from their  superiors to avoid bridge contracts.

For example, NIH received  nine protests from the incumbent contractor and other unsuccessful  bidders on a requirement for utility maintenance services. In this instance,  contracting officers awarded a series of short-term bridge contracts for  roughly six years to continue to meet the requirement. Similarly, a BOP  contract for residential reentry services received multiple protests that  resulted in three stand-alone bridge contracts.

In this  decision, the Court discussed BOP\u2019s procurement of residential reentry  services. In June 2012, BOP issued a Request for Proposals for  residential reentry services. During the acquisition process for the follow- on contract, the incumbent\u2019s contract for the residential reentry services  expired.

During the period of performance of the last bridge, BOP  awarded a follow-on contract to a different vendor. The incumbent  contractor filed a protest with GAO in April 2015. Rather than enter into a  fourth bridge contract with the incumbent contractor, BOP decided to  transfer the inmates of the facility being serviced by the incumbent  contractor to other facilities. Based on BOP\u2019s decision to transfer the  inmates, the incumbent filed another protest, this time with the U.S. Court  of Federal Claims.

Because we found that almost all of  the bridge contracts in our review were ultimately followed by competitive  contracts\u2014which can lead to savings for the taxpayer\u2014the importance of  awarding these contracts in a timely manner is heightened. By defining  bridge contracts and implementing a policy related to their use, the Navy  and DLA have taken important steps to enhance these components\u2019  management of bridge contracts. However, bridge contracts have been  identified not only across the three agencies and eight components  included in our review, but at other agencies as well, as evidenced by our  past work and that of others. Therefore, the importance of defining and  tracking bridge contracts is not limited to those agencies included in our  review. A uniform, government-wide definition and strategies for tracking  and managing the use of bridge contracts would help ensure all agencies  have better insights into their use of these contracts and provide agencies  with the information necessary to manage their use. Otherwise, agencies  are left without a complete picture or understanding of how long a bridge  contract has been in place.

We  analyzed this information to identify key characteristics of the bridge  contracts, such as the period of performance and the authority used to  extend the existing contract or award the stand-alone contract. In  addition, we reviewed information in FPDS-NG on these 73 contracts to  identify the types of services procured and the contract value. To identify  the reasons for the award of the bridge contract and the methods used to  determine price reasonableness across the 73 contracts, we analyzed the  contract file documentation and, in situations where the contract file  documentation did not include information on the reason for award or the  methods used to determine price reasonableness, we followed up with  agency officials. To gain additional knowledge about the facts and  circumstances surrounding the award of bridge contracts, we conducted  an in-depth review of the subset of 29 contracts. For the in-depth review,  we conducted site visits to six locations selected based on the location of  contract files, collected and analyzed contract documentation from the  predecessor contract, bridge contract(s), and, if awarded at the time of  our review, the follow-on contract, and conducted interviews with  contracting and program officials for each contract. We analyzed the  contract documentation and the interviews to develop a more in-depth  understanding of certain characteristics of bridge contracts, such as the  length of time between the end of the predecessor contract and the award  of the follow-on contract, the extent to which follow-on contracts were  competed, and the change in prices between the predecessor, bridge,  and follow-on contracts.
