Effective internal controls over grants and grantee oversight are critical to LSC as its very mission and operations rely extensively on grantees to provide legal services to people who otherwise could not afford to pay for adequate legal counsel. GAO also found poor fiscal practices and improper and potentially improper expenditures at grantees it visited. Weaknesses in LSC's control environment include the lack of clear definition in the responsibilities of two of the three organizational units that oversee the work of grantees. GAO also found that communication between oversight units and coordination of grantee site visits is not sufficient to prevent gaps or duplication of effort, or both. The timing and scope of site visits is not based on a systematic analysis of the risk of noncompliance or financial control weakness across LSC's 138 grantees, so LSC cannot determine whether its resources are being used effectively and efficiently to mitigate risk among its grantees. LSC control activities performed in the monitoring of grantee internal control were not sufficient in scope to achieve effective oversight, and GAO noted implementation weaknesses. For example, in the site visits GAO observed, staff did not follow up on questionable transactions and relied heavily on information obtained through interviews. Feedback to grantees was often delayed, preventing grantees from correcting deficiencies in a timely manner. As of September 2007, LSC had not yet issued reports to grantee management for about 19 percent (10 out of 53) of the 2006 site visits. LSC grantee reviews missed potential control deficiencies at grantees that could have been detected with more effective oversight as evidenced by weaknesses GAO found at 9 of the 14 grantee sites it visited. While control deficiencies at the grantees were the immediate cause of the problems GAO found, weaknesses in LSC's controls over its oversight of grantees did not assure effective monitoring of grantee controls and compliance. Among the questionable expenditures GAO found were grantee use of funds for expenditures with insufficient supporting documentation, unusual contractor arrangements, alcohol purchases, employee interest-free loans, lobbying fees, late fees, and earnest money."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Legal Services Corporation\u2019s (LSC) mission is to make federal funding  available to support the provision of legal assistance in civil matters to  low-income people throughout the United States on everyday legal  problems.

Established by a federal charter in 1974 as a federally  funded, private nonprofit corporation, LSC is highly dependent on federal  appropriations for its operations. LSC received $348.6 million in  appropriations for fiscal year 2007 and $326.6 million in fiscal year 2006.  For fiscal year 2006, LSC received 99 percent of its funding from federal  appropriations and approximately 1 percent from grants through the  Department of Veterans Affairs.

To identify and assess LSC\u2019s internal controls, we obtained an  understanding of LSC\u2019s grants management processes and the roles and  responsibilities of the three organizational components of LSC that  participate directly in grantee oversight. We also observed LSC site visits  at two grantees. In our reviews of controls and compliance at 14 LSC  grantee offices, we interviewed grantee officials; reviewed grantee policies  and procedures; and performed walkthroughs of transactions. We also  reviewed supporting documentation for selected grantee expenditures and  performed follow-up activities with grantee officials regarding selected  transactions and grantee activities. While we identified some improper or  potentially improper expenditures, our work was not designed to identify  all improper or potentially improper expenditures or to estimate their  extent.

LSC  reported that most cases are resolved out of court. In 2007, LSC reported  that three out of four clients were women, most of them mothers.", "To be eligible, clients must meet certain requirements. First, individual  applicants for legal assistance supported by LSC funds must meet financial  eligibility requirements. LSC has statutory authority to assist only \u201celigible  clients,\u201d which are defined as \u201cany person financially unable to afford legal  assistance.\u201d LSC\u2019s regulations include additional criteria to help determine  whether a potential client is eligible for assistance from LSC.

Second, there are  also legal restrictions on access to LSC-supported legal assistance by  aliens.", "The LSC Act prohibits LSC personnel and grant recipients or their  employees from engaging in certain prohibited activities, such as  providing legal assistance with respect to any fee-generating case,  providing legal assistance related to a criminal proceeding, supporting or  conducting training programs for the purpose of advocating particular  public policies or encouraging political activities, providing legal  assistance in civil actions to persons who have been convicted of a  criminal charge, or participating in litigation related to an abortion. In  addition, LSC cannot provide funds for legal services for a proceeding  related to a violation of the Military Selective Service Act.", "The LSC Board of Directors, which is charged with managing the affairs of  the corporation, is responsible for ensuring compliance with these  restrictions. The LSC Act established the LSC Board and specified that the  board members shall annually select a Chairman and appoint an LSC  President. The D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act, which generally applies to  LSC as a D.C. nonprofit corporation, provides that the affairs of the  corporation shall be managed by the board of directors and permits the  board of directors to delegate some of the authority to perform  management duties to corporate officers. Our recently issued report,  Legal Services Corporation: Governance and Accountability Practices  Need to Be Modernized and Strengthened, discusses LSC, its unique  status, and the rigorous controls necessary to protect the heavily federally  funded entity.", "As an independent office within LSC, the LSC OIG is authorized to carry  out audits and investigations of LSC programs and operations, recommend  policies to improve program administration and operations, and keep the  LSC board and Congress fully and currently informed about problems in  program administration and operations and the need for and progress of  corrective action.

In the  appropriation for LSC, Congress regularly designates a specific amount for  the OIG.

According to LSC  management, one purpose of the competitive grants process is to  encourage the economical and effective delivery of assistance to eligible  clients. This represented a major change in the legal-services delivery  system, eliminating the automatic renewal of funding as permitted by the  LSC Act and practiced by LSC.

LSC\u2019s control environment  contains several weaknesses, including the lack of clearly defined roles  and responsibility among the three different organizational units providing  for oversight of grantees\u2014OPP, OCE, and the OIG. In addition, OIG and  OCE\u2019s shared authority to oversee grantee financial internal controls and  fiscal compliance has resulted in confusion about responsibility for  grantee financial oversight. Poor communication and coordination  between the oversight offices further impedes LSC\u2019s ability to effectively  oversee grantees.

We also found that  communication and coordination of grantee site visits between OCE and  OPP need improvement in order to achieve effective oversight and avoid  gaps and duplication in oversight. Management and employees should  establish and maintain an environment throughout the organization that  sets a positive and supportive attitude toward internal control and  conscientious management.", "Another factor affecting an entity\u2019s control environment is the entity\u2019s  organizational structure. It provides management\u2019s framework for  planning, directing, and controlling operations to achieve agency  objectives. A good internal control environment requires that the agency\u2019s  organizational structure clearly define key areas of authority and  responsibility and establish appropriate lines of reporting.", "In 1988 Congress subjected LSC to the Inspector General Act of 1978, as  amended (IG Act).The IG Act provides that each designated federal  entity, in this case LSC, shall transfer to the OIG \u201cthe offices, units, or  other components, and the functions, powers, or duties thereof, that such  head determines are properly related to the functions of the Office of  Inspector General.\u201d For example, the IG Act transferred to the Inspector  General responsibility for providing policy direction for, and conducting,  supervising, and coordinating audits of entity programs, such as LSC\u2019s  legal assistance grants program. Further, in April 1996, Congress enacted  the appropriations act funding LSC for fiscal year 1996 (1996 Act) and  included a number of administrative provisions supplementing the LSC  Act requirements, including those related to grantee audits (\u00a7 509). The  1996 Act clarified that the grantees are responsible for contracting for  audits with independent public accountants (IPA), the OIG is responsible  for overseeing the quality and integrity of the audit process, and LSC is  responsible for resolving deficiencies and noncompliance identified in the  audits and sanctioning grantees for unacceptable audits. Under the 1996  Act, IPAs follow OIG guidance and generally accepted government  auditing standards in conducting their audits. These audits include an  independent auditor\u2019s opinion about whether the financial statements are  fairly presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, along with auditors\u2019 reports on internal control and  compliance. The 1996 Act also authorizes the OIG to conduct additional  on-site monitoring, audits, and inspections. If the OIG reports to LSC  management that a grantee IPA found significant reportable conditions,  findings, or recommendations, then the 1996 Act provides that LSC is  responsible for ensuring that these are timely resolved, including  performing appropriate follow-up. In the event that the OIG were to  determine that a grantee\u2019s IPA audit were unacceptable, then the 1996 Act  authorizes LSC, consistent with OIG recommendations, to sanction the  grantee by withholding some or all its funding until the grantee completes  an acceptable audit. Thus, the OIG plays an important role in LSC grantee  oversight.", "OPP is specifically responsible for designing and administering the  competitive grants process. In addition, OPP is responsible for   (1) program evaluation and supportive follow-up; (2) developing strategies  to improve program quality, including identifying areas of grantee  weaknesses and following up with individual recipients; (3) promoting  enhanced technology to improve client community access to services; and  (4) encouraging \u201cbest practices\u201d through the legal resource Web site,  specialized help with intake and rural area delivery, and pilot projects  such as loan repayment and mentoring. OPP also performs grantee  program site visits.

In particular,  OCE reviews grantee compliance with various regulatory provisions,  including the following related to fiscal accountability: fee generating  cases; use of non-LSC funds and transfers of LSC funds; private attorney  involvement; subgrants; membership fees; dues; timekeeping  requirements; and attorney\u2019s fees. A summary of these provisions in the  fiscal component of OCE reviews is included in appendix III.", "In 2006, OCE conducted fiscal compliance site visits at 24 of these  grantees, OPP conducted program review site visits at 32, and 3 were  performed jointly. LSC presents the grantees with any findings arising  from the site visits in its exit meetings and a later written report and  subsequently monitors grantee actions to resolve them. OCE\u2019s staff totals  15 members, comprised of a Director, 10 attorneys, two fiscal program  analysts and two administrative assistants.", "According to OCE officials, prior to 1994, LSC staff in the OCE  predecessor organization conducted internal control reviews and detailed  financial statement-related audits. After the transfer of many oversight  functions concerning grantees\u2019 financial statement audit responsibilities to  the IPAs and the OIG, OCE stopped its financial statement audits as well  as its internal control reviews of grantees, even though oversight of  grantee financial controls is a basic management responsibility. OCE  instead implemented a limited fiscal review of grantee compliance with  selected fiscal provisions of LSC regulations. The number of staff  performing this function was reduced from 12 to 2. OCE management told  us that the reason for this was that fiscal oversight of grantees had become  the responsibility of the OIG, which oversees IPA audits that include  testing of grantee internal controls. However, LSC management has the  responsibility for overseeing grantee financial controls and compliance  even if it relies on the IPA audits as the sole basis for its assurance about  grantee controls. Further, even LSC management\u2019s reduced oversight role  has been further questioned by the OIG. Despite LSC\u2019s shift to a limited  compliance oversight role, the OIG recently reported that OCE\u2019s reviews  of grantee compliance were duplicative of IPA testing and concluded that  most of the LSC regulations tested by OCE are already covered by the  OIG\u2019s own guidance and the reviews conducted by IPAs as part of the  financial statement audits of grantees.", "With compliance oversight and monitoring responsibilities divided  between OCE and the OIG and program oversight activities being  performed by OPP, strong coordination and communication between the  three offices and clarity in the roles and responsibilities is critical for  achieving effective grantee and program oversight. Under GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, \u201cFor an  entity to run and control its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and  timely communications relating to internal as well as external events.\u201d Our  discussions with both OIG and LSC management indicated that working  relationships and communications between them were strained. OCE staff  have expressed confusion about their own roles and responsibility for the  more limited fiscal compliance reviews they perform, and there is  contention between OCE and OIG over unclear areas of responsibility that  dates back to 1995. OCE and OIG officials indicated that to the best of  their knowledge no memorandum of understanding or any other  documentation implementing the board resolution to clarify the roles and  responsibilities of each unit was ever drafted or implemented.", "We also found communication and coordination weaknesses between OPP  and OCE based on interviews with LSC oversight staff, correspondence  with the grantee and other documentation related to the joint OCE/OPP  oversight visit that we observed, and our own observations of that joint  oversight visit. As an example, during our visit to a Las Vegas grantee, we  noted a lack of coordination and information sharing between OCE and  OPP staff. Specifically, we found conflicting conclusions resulting from  the OPP and OCE site visits to that grantee, and a lack of awareness  between OPP and OCE about their respective site visits to that grantee. In  reporting on an earlier April 2006 site visit in Las Vegas, OPP reported,  \u201cOverall, this program is in very good shape. Its delivery structure is  sound, its management is excellent, and its case handling staff are  performing at a high level.\u201d During our February 2007 observation visit to  the same grantee, OCE found it necessary to open an investigation after  discovering several significant deficiencies with respect to the grantee\u2019s  compliance with LSC regulations. In addition, the OCE team leader on the  visit stated that he was unaware of OPP\u2019s programmatic visit. LSC\u2019s Vice  President of Program and Compliance stated that both OPP and OCE are  required to share summary memorandums of their visits to grantees so  that staff are aware of all visits made by both OPP and OCE and properly  consider the results of the prior site visit in their own visits when  conducting their own reviews. However, as discussed in a later section of  this report, LSC\u2019s grantee site visit reports were not being completed in a  timely manner, and, therefore, were not available to the respective teams  or to LSC management for use in communications and coordination of  grantee oversight activities. In response to our finding, LSC officials  acknowledged the need to further enhance internal communications and  coordination between OPP and OCE to improve the overall efficiency and  effectiveness of their oversight visits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timing and Scope of Grantee Site Visits Is Not Based on a Risk Assessment", "paragraphs": ["LSC does not utilize a structured or systematic approach for assessing risk  associated with its 138 grantees as a basis for determining the timing and  scope of its grantee oversight visits. According to GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control, risk assessment requires identifying and analyzing  relevant risks associated with achieving the organization\u2019s objectives and  determining how risks should be managed. In determining which grantees  to visit, both OPP and OCE use an approach based primarily on time  between site visits and the respective office director\u2019s judgments. The  director of OCE stated that additional factors OCE considered include:  complaints of noncompliance, referrals from the OIG, and discrepancies in  reporting case closures. In response to a draft of this report, LSC\u2019s  President stated that other risk factors considered by OCE include the  results of grantee self-inspections and potential compliance issues  identified in OPP program visits and other discussions. The director of  OCE also said OCE attempts to visit every grantee on a 5\u00bd-year cycle.  However, this time-based cycle is not consistently followed. For example,  the second largest grant recipient, receiving over $13 million in 2006, has  not been visited by OCE since at least 1996. In addition, we noted there  was a 7-year lapse between OCE visits to a grantee in Las Vegas, for which  OCE, as previously discussed, recently opened an investigation after  discovering several significant compliance-related findings. Management  has indicated it believes additional grantee reviews are needed but stated  that LSC does not have sufficient personnel to do this. OCE occasionally  supplements its staff of two analysts that conduct fiscal reviews with an  additional contract staff, and officials told us they plan to hire additional  staff to conduct site visits on a 3- to 3\u00bd-year cycle by 2009.", "In 2006, LSC had 138 different grantees with more than 900 offices serving  all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and current and former U.S.  territories and had conducted fiscal compliance reviews at 24 of these  grantees (17 percent). With this scope of grantee operations and a limited  LSC oversight staff, an approach based on elapsed time and informal  judgments is not adequate because it lacks analytical rigor and does not  provide adequate assurance that risks are being properly addressed.  Specifically, risk analysis should make a reasonable effort to identify risk,  including inherent risk, based on all information sources available, assess  the significance and likelihood of occurrence of the risk, and factor this in  to the decision about scope and timing of oversight visits. However, LSC\u2019s  processes are not designed to identify risk in a comprehensive manner by  not considering relevant risk factors including, for example, inherent risks  due to program size or changes in grantee management or systems.  Without a more structured process for selecting grantees to review, LSC  does not have an analytical basis to know whether it is has the proper  level of staff resources assigned to the grantee review function or whether  it is gaining an adequate level of assurance for the number of staff  assigned to grantee review activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "LSC\u2019s Control Activities for Monitoring Grantees Do Not Provide Reasonable Assurance That Grant Funds Are Being Used Properly and in Compliance with Laws and Regulations", "paragraphs": ["LSC\u2019s control activities for monitoring grantee internal control systems do  not reasonably assure that grant funds are being used properly and that  grantees are in compliance with laws and regulations.

At both of our observation visits, we noted that staff did not  follow-up on questionable transactions and relied too heavily on  information obtained through interviews without corroborating the  information. We also noted that LSC did not perform timely follow-up on  an investigation into an alleged instance of noncompliance referred to it by  the OIG. In addition, LSC has not consistently provided grantees the  opportunity to take corrective actions based on findings arising out of the  OCE/OPP site visits in a timely manner. As of September 17, 2007, LSC had  not yet issued to grantee management almost 19 percent (10 out of 53) of  the 2006 LSC reports for which grantee site visits had been completed. In  one case we noted that, for unexplained reasons, the review team  presented negative findings in a positive light to a grantee and omitted  some negative findings from its feedback.

In addition to IPA audits, LSC management  relies on its site visits and grantee reviews as a key control activity to  monitor grantee fiscal compliance. The fiscal component of an OCE  review is limited, and the reviews we observed left out important follow- up to issues that surfaced during interviews and did not address  outstanding IPA findings.", "OCE staff use an OCE guide called Policies and Procedures for On-Site  Fiscal Reviews for the fiscal component of OCE reviews. However, the  guide is very limited in its scope. During our observation of an OCE site  visit, we were told that no previsit preparation is needed and no  formalized work program exists for the fiscal component of OCE reviews.  The guide\u2019s focus is assessing compliance with selected regulatory  provisions and is not a review of grantee internal controls, so it would not,  for example, require a review of whether expenditures were properly  authorized. In addition, although the fiscal component of an OCE review  involves a compliance review of seven LSC regulations, the guide provides  a framework for conducting fiscal reviews related to only three of the  seven required regulations. Furthermore, the guide does not provide an  overall objective of the fiscal compliance review nor does it provide a  clear scope or detailed steps for performing the oversight visitation. The  approach to OCE site visits relies almost entirely on grantee oral  responses to questions and did not include follow-up lines of questioning  or requests for supporting evidence. For example, the OCE analyst did not  question Greensburg, Pennsylvania, grantee officials about a $30,000  payment to a subgrantee that lacked supporting documentation. When  GAO asked the grantee Executive Director about the payment, she stated  that the previous Executive Director entered into the subgrant agreement  and she did not know anything about the agreement other than the fact  that she continued to pay the bill every year. The Executive Director was  not able to support the payment, nor did she know the reasons for the  payment. The OCE visit did not include review of important documents  such as policy and procedure manuals, or verification of crucial financial  information. In addition, OCE did not review invoices, perform internal  control reviews, or scrutinize questionable items.", "Our review of information that OCE had also reviewed found that staff did  not always follow up on questionable transactions. In reviewing  documents already reviewed by the OCE fiscal program analyst during a  site visit to Las Vegas, we discovered an improper transaction involving  the sale of the grantee\u2019s building that was partially purchased using LSC  funds. The analyst did not question the sale or the reason the LSC share of  the proceeds from the sale was not returned to the LSC restricted funds  account. The grantee had entered into an agreement to sell the building to  a developer for $3.6 million. The developer gave the grantee $310,000 as  earnest money, and the grantee withdrew $30,000 to use as earnest money  towards the expected purchase of a new property. The remaining $280,000  was deposited in an escrow account. However, when the sale of the  building fell through, the grantee transferred the funds from the escrow  account into its unrestricted general funds account. According to an  official at the grantee, this transfer was made to avoid the funds being  subjected to LSC regulations. Furthermore, the grantee official stated that  he considered it an \u201cenhancement of money.\u201d However, the OCE site visit  did not question this unusual transaction, nor was it disclosed in the  independent public accountant\u2019s (IPA) annual financial audit.

As of September 2007, LSC had not yet  issued to grantee management almost 19 percent (10 out of 53) of the 2006  LSC reports for which site visits had been completed. One such visit dates  back to January 2006. LSC management stated that this occurs because  there is not enough staff to conduct oversight visits and complete reports  in a timely manner. Absent timely communications about findings from its  site visits, grantee management does not have information about  deficiencies and corrective actions needed to address identified  deficiencies in their use of funds and improve controls. Furthermore, LSC  cannot monitor the status of grantee corrective actions.", "During OCE compliance visits and in follow-up reviews, OCE attorneys  and fiscal program analysts gather and analyze data on grantee compliance  with both nonfinancial and financial LSC regulations and conduct an exit  meeting with grantee management to present the findings. LSC then  develops a report with recommendations that is to be provided to the  grantee. OCE officials stated that although LSC policy requires reports to  be issued within 90 days of site visits, they generally take much longer.  One official also told us that OCE staff do not have the opportunity to  complete one report before having to go on another site visit. The official  told us that staff do summarize their findings in a memorandum, which is  used internally at LSC. One fiscal program analyst told us that not only  was he still working on a report which was due last year, but that he also  had three other visits he was still working on, and he was planning on  visiting three additional sites as well. It will be important to clear up the  backlog of unissued reports, especially since LSC\u2019s Vice President for  Programs and Compliance stated that LSC plans to increase OCE and OPP  staff levels to increase the number of site visits per year.", "We also found an instance where timely follow-up action was not taken  when alleged instances of noncompliance and misuse of funds existed. On  November 30, 2004, OCE received a referral from a state comptroller\u2019s  office, which reported that an LSC grantee\u2019s Executive Director had  misused LSC grant funds. OCE referred the case to the OIG. The OIG  found that the Executive Director used LSC grant funds for time and travel  unrelated to grantee operations and contributions of LSC funds to other  charitable organizations. On November 3, 2005, the OIG referred the  results of its investigation back to OCE for follow-up action. LSC  management told us that this case has yet to be resolved and attributes the  delay to other priorities, including staff shortages.", "In one case, we noted that, for unexplained reasons, the LSC review team  presented mostly positive findings to a grantee during the exit conference  when in fact other significant findings were negative. Without a complete  report of the instance of noncompliance and potential weaknesses found  by the reviewers, grantee management was not afforded the opportunity to  respond to those findings, nor did they have the information needed to  correct the deficiencies in a timely manner. An exit conference is the  standard forum for presenting site visit results prior to issuing the final  report. It gives LSC the opportunity to inform grantee management, once  the team has finished its planned interviews, tests, and other data- collection activities, about the findings and observations discovered  during the visit. It also gives grantee management an opportunity to timely  begin addressing problems. However, in an exit conference held to close  out a joint OCE-OPP oversight visit in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, we found  that the attorneys and fiscal program analyst that performed the review  focused on the few positive points that had been observed during the  week-long visit. A number of findings that the review team had  characterized as significant and in need of immediate attention during the  previous day\u2019s meeting to prepare for the exit conference were not  communicated as such at the exit conference. In contrast to the discussion  regarding the need for improvements at the exit conference, the  memorandum prepared for the LSC files to summarize the visit  characterizes the grantee as a weak program that faces many challenges.  In effect, the exit conference focused on a few positive points rather than  the substantial number of significant findings.", "LSC oversight staff cited staff shortages as the cause for some of the  weaknesses in the quality of site visits. Currently, there are only two fiscal  program analysts in OCE, and in order to ensure that there is a program  analyst available to participate in every OCE grantee visit, it is sometimes  necessary to contract with an outside analyst for coverage.", "Effective grantee monitoring is especially important for LSC because it has  limited options for sanctioning or replacing poor-performing grantees.", "Although LSC has the authority to temporarily suspend funding or  terminate all or part of a recipient\u2019s grant, LSC rarely uses this authority.  According to LSC, termination is seldom used because it is difficult to find  a replacement organization to provide the service. Although the LSC Act  provides general enforcement authority to the corporation, LSC must  take all practical steps to ensure the continued provision of legal  assistance. After a final decision has been issued by LSC terminating  financial assistance to a grantee, LSC must implement a new competitive  bidding process for the affected service area. In fiscal year 2006, only 5 out  of 71 potential grants received multiple bids during the grant renewal  process. Because there are few competitors for LSC grants in a given  service area, LSC\u2019s competition process does not provide a practical  solution for competitive selection when quality issues arise in some cases.  Therefore, it is particularly important that LSC effectively and efficiently  oversee its grantees to ensure that grant funds are used for intended  purposes in accordance with laws and regulations so that grantee  weaknesses do not develop into serious weaknesses that would normally  call for termination of funding for the grantee."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "LSC Oversight Did Not Identify Control Weaknesses at Nine Grantees", "paragraphs": ["Based on our limited reviews, we identified internal control weaknesses at  9 of the 14 grantees we visited that LSC could have identified with a more  effective oversight review regimen.

In addition, the shared  responsibilities for grantee oversight between LSC management and OIG  presents risks that can be mitigated with clear lines of authority and  responsibility and effective communications and coordination across  oversight offices to avoid unnecessary duplication where possible. Finally,  given the number of grantees, a sound risk-based approach for  determining timing and scope of site visits is key to prioritizing resource  allocations to reflect the varying risks presented by grantees.", "To maximize the effectiveness of each site visit, LSC needs to conduct its  oversight visits with sufficient scope to target areas of greatest risk, follow  up on information and results of prior reviews and audits, and employ a  review scope and approach that is tailored to specific risks.

First, LSC  management stated that \u201cthe draft report does not sufficiently address the  fact that in 1996 Congress mandated that the LSC OIG have oversight  responsibility for all audit work performed by independent public  accountants (IPA) and the report should include a fuller discussion of the  role of the IPAs in the financial oversight of grantees.\u201d We added language  to our report to augment our discussion of how the 1996 Act clarified that  grantee financial statement and compliance audits are performed by IPAs  and overseen by OIG. While these audits serve as an accountability  mechanism, they are performed after the fact, and do not include all the  grantee oversight objectives and procedures that would be expected of  LSC management as part of its responsibilities to manage the affairs of the  corporation, such as its grants program and to monitor its grantees to  ensure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and grant terms.", "Second, LSC\u2019s President states that \u201cthe draft report supports its  conclusion about limited coordination of the work of OCE and OPP with  an isolated example from one grantee visit and fails to note the range of  communication and coordination that actually exists between these  offices.\u201d We provide the example in the report to illustrate the effect on  grantee oversight. Our conclusion about the need for improved  communication and coordination were also based on interviews with LSC  staff and our assessment of LSC\u2019s control environment during the course  of our work.

In addition, we accompanied LSC staff on oversight visits to Las  Vegas, Nevada, and Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Appendix B of  OMB Circular No. A-122, Selected Items of Cost, provides guidance on the  allowability of the direct or indirect cost of the selected items. Appendix  B\u2019s item no. 3, Alcoholic Beverages, states that the costs of alcoholic  beverages are unallowable and provides for no exceptions.
