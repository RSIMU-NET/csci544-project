Nevertheless, 9 of 40 projects that have received full funding grant agreements since 1997, and had complete data available, had milestone dates that ranged from about 4 to 14 years to complete the project development phases. However, the data from these 9 projects are not generalizeable to the 40 New Starts projects. FTA has not historically retained all milestone data for every project, such as the dates that project sponsors apply to enter preliminary engineering and FTA's subsequent approval. Although not required by its records retention policy, FTA has retained milestone data from some projects longer than 2 years. However, GAO was unable to obtain complete and reliable project milestone data from FTA. FTA officials acknowledged that, while not historically perfect, the agency has retained sufficient milestone data to help manage the New Starts program. Nevertheless, recognizing the importance of having complete milestone data, FTA has taken several steps in recent years to more consistently collect and retain such data. In addition, GAO found that project sponsors do not consistently retain milestone data for projects that have completed the New Starts process. Congress and FTA have taken action to expedite projects through the New Starts process. For example, legislative action created the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P) to study the benefits of using public-private partnerships for certain new fixed-guideway capital projects, such as accelerating project delivery. In addition, FTA has implemented administrative changes to expedite the New Starts process. For example, FTA has developed and offered training workshops for project sponsors and has introduced project delivery tools. These tools include checklists for project sponsors to improve their understanding of the requirements of each phase of the New Starts process. Project sponsors and industry stakeholders GAO interviewed identified options to help expedite project development within the New Starts program. These options include tailoring the New Starts evaluation process to risks posed by the projects, using letters of intent more frequently, and applying policy and guidance changes only to future projects. Each option has advantages and disadvantages to consider. In addition, FTA must also strike the appropriate balance between expediting project delivery and maintaining the accountability of the program. For example, by signaling early federal support of projects, letters of intent could help project sponsors use potentially less costly and time-consuming alternative project delivery methods, such as design-build. However, such early support poses some risk. It is possible that with more frequent use of letters of intent, FTA's commitment authority could be depleted earlier than expected, which could affect the anticipated funding stream for future projects. Furthermore, some options, like combining one or more statutorily required project development phases, would require legislative action."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1970s, much of the federal government\u2019s share of new  capital investment in mass transportation has come through the Federal  Transit Administration\u2019s (FTA) New Starts program.

Using these  statutorily identified criteria, FTA evaluates potential projects annually  and as a condition for advancement into each phase of the New Starts  process, including preliminary engineering, final design, and construction.  FTA refers to projects in the preliminary engineering or final design  phases as being in the \u201cpipeline\u201d through which successful projects  advance to receive funding.", "We have previously identified FTA\u2019s use of a rigorous and systematic  evaluation process to distinguish among proposed New Starts investments  as a model for other transportation programs. However, we and other  stakeholders and policymakers have also identified challenges facing the  New Starts program. For example, our past reviews found that many  program stakeholders thought that FTA\u2019s process for evaluating New  Starts projects was too time consuming, costly, and complex. These issues  and the upcoming reauthorization of all surface transportation programs,  including the New Starts program, have led stakeholders and  policymakers to examine the existing evaluation and rating process and  consider potential modifications and other options to reduce the  complexity, cost, and time it takes for a New Starts project to go through  the pipeline.", "We are required by SAFETEA-LU to report each year on FTA\u2019s processes  and procedures for evaluating, rating, and recommending New Starts  projects for federal funding and on FTA\u2019s implementation of these  processes and procedures. This report discusses the (1) time it has  generally taken for proposed projects to move through the New Starts  process, and what Congress and FTA have done to expedite the process,  and (2) options that exist to expedite the process. In addition, appendix I  contains an overview of FTA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 New Starts Annual Report  and budget request. To address these objectives, we reviewed SAFETEA- LU and other New Starts statutory requirements, FTA guidance and  regulations governing the New Starts program and other FTA documents,  including the annual New Starts report, and interviewed transportation  experts, transit consultants, transit industry associations, and Department  of Transportation (DOT) officials about the time it takes for a New Starts  project to move through the New Starts process, as well as the options  that exist to expedite the process. We also interviewed 9 project sponsors  about 10 projects. We selected these projects based on a range of  characteristics, including: (1) timing (i.e., when projects received a FFGA);  (2) mode (i.e., heavy rail, light rail, or bus); (3) scope (i.e., the total cost of  the project); and (4) geographic area. In addition, we gathered, and took  steps to verify, FTA data on project milestone approval dates to determine  how long the 40 projects that received a FFGA after June 1997 took to  complete the New Starts process. We also attempted to gather data  directly from project sponsors on project milestone approval and  application dates for these 40 projects to determine how long it took  projects to complete the New Starts process.

For projects to obtain FFGAs, they must emerge from a regional,  multimodal transportation planning process.", "The early stages of the New Starts project development process\u2014 alternatives analysis and much of preliminary engineering\u2014are carried out  in concert with the metropolitan planning process specified by SAFETEA- LU and the environmental review processes required by the National  Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Alternatives analysis studies  are a corridor-level analysis of a range of alternatives designed to address  locally-identified mobility and other problems in a specific transportation  corridor. The alternatives analysis phase culminates in the selection of a  locally preferred alternative (LPA), which is the New Starts project that  FTA evaluates for funding.", "After a locally preferred alternative is selected, the project sponsor  submits an application to FTA for the project to enter the preliminary  engineering phase. During the preliminary engineering phase, project  sponsors refine the design of the locally preferred alternative, taking into  consideration all reasonable design alternatives and estimating each  alternative\u2019s costs, benefits, and impacts (e.g., financial or environmental).  Further, project sponsors are required to complete the NEPA  environmental review process in order to receive federal funding.  Specifically, FTA interprets NEPA to require, as part of the NEPA process  for evaluation of the alternatives, an environmental review document  with information on each alternative\u2019s benefits and costs relating to the  New Starts evaluation. When the preliminary engineering phase is  completed and federal environmental requirements are satisfied, FTA may  approve the project\u2019s advancement into final design, after which FTA may  recommend the project for a FFGA and proceed to construction. FTA  oversees grantees\u2019 management of projects from the preliminary  engineering phase through the construction phase (see fig. 1). This project  management oversight is conducted by FTA staff, working closely with its  project management oversight contractors (PMOC), to provide continual  monitoring and assessment of projects\u2019 scope, schedule, and budget, and  of its sponsor\u2019s technical capacity.", "To help inform administration and congressional decisions about which  projects should receive federal funds, FTA currently distinguishes among  proposed projects by evaluating and assigning ratings to various statutory  evaluation criteria\u2014including both project justification and local financial  commitment criteria\u2014and then assigning an overall project rating. (See  fig. 2.) These evaluation criteria reflect a broad range of benefits and  effects of the proposed project, such as cost-effectiveness, as well as the  ability of the project sponsor to fund the project and finance the continued  operation of its transit system. FTA has developed specific measures for  each of the criteria outlined in statute. However, FTA currently assigns a  50 percent weight to both the cost-effectiveness and the land use criteria  when developing the project justification summary rating. The other  project justification criteria are not weighted, although the mobility  improvements criterion is used as a \u201ctiebreaker.\u201d On the basis of their  evaluation measures, FTA assigns proposed projects a rating for each  criterion and then assigns a summary rating for local financial  commitment and project justification. These two ratings are averaged  together, and FTA assigns each project a \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium-high,\u201d  \u201cmedium,\u201d \u201cmedium-low,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d overall rating, which is used to rank  projects and determine which projects to recommend for funding.", "Projects are rated at several points during the New Starts process,  including as part of the evaluation for entry into the preliminary  engineering and final design phases, and they are rated yearly for inclusion  in the New Starts Annual Report. The administration uses the FTA  evaluation and rating process, along with the phase of development of  New Starts projects, to decide which projects to recommend to Congress  for funding. Although many projects receive a summary rating that would  make them eligible for a FFGA, generally only a few are proposed for a  FFGA in a given fiscal year. FTA proposes FFGAs for those projects that are projected to meet the fol lowing conditions during the fiscal year for  which funding is proposed:  deral project funding must be committed and available for the  roject.", "The project must be in or near the final design phase and have progre far enough for uncertainties about costs, bene financial or environmental) to be minimized. fits, and impacts (e.g.,    The project must meet FTA\u2019s tests for readiness and technical capacity, o remaining cost, project scope, or local  which confirm that there are n financial commitment issues.", "SAFETEA-LU introduced a number of changes to the New Starts pr including some that affect the evaluation and rating process. For  example, given past concerns that the evaluation process did not ac for a project\u2019s impact on economic development and FTA\u2019s lack of  communication to sponsors about upcoming changes, the statute added  economic development to the list of project justification criteria that FT must use to evaluate and rate New Starts projects, and requires FTA to  issue notice and guidance each time significant changes are made to th process and criteria. SAFETEA-LU also established the Small Starts  program, a new capital investment grant program, simplifying the  requirements imposed for those seeking funding for lower cost projects  e  such as bus rapid transit, streetcar, and commuter rail projects. This  program is intended to advance smaller-scale projects through an  expedited and streamlined evaluation and rating process. FTA also  subsequently introduced a separate eligibility category within the Small  Starts program called Very Small Starts, which is for projects with a  capital cost of less than $50 million. Very Small Starts projects qualify for  an even simpler and more expedited evaluation and rating process than  other Small Starts projects.", "FTA, like most federal agencies, must document its activities, including  work related to the New Starts program, in accordance with the Federal  Records Act of 1950, as amended.

FTA has historically retained milestone data from some  projects using a variety of techniques, such as maintaining hard copies of  milestone approval letters or internal memos in binders and saving  electronic copies of some documents in a computer filing system. Using  these sources, FTA provided us with milestone approval dates\u2014 preliminary engineering, final design, and FFGA\u2014for the 40 projects that  received a FFGA since 1997. However, when we attempted to verify the  milestone approval dates from a random sample of 10 projects, we found  that the data were unreliable and, in some cases, inaccurate. For example,  the approval dates for some projects did not match the dates contained in  the source documents (e.g., letters from FTA approving a project\u2019s  advancement into preliminary engineering); in other cases the source  documents for some projects were missing from the project files. In  addition to milestone approval dates, we asked FTA to provide the dates  that these 40 projects began alternatives analysis and submitted  applications for preliminary engineering, final design, and FFGA. Because  FTA is not required by its record schedule to retain these dates, FTA was  unable to provide these dates. In addition, FTA officials cited several  challenges to collecting this information. First, FTA told us that it does not  have records on when a project begins alternatives analysis because this  phase is conducted at the local level, generally without FTA involvement.  Second, FTA told us that it does not record when a project sponsor  submits an application for preliminary engineering, final design, and FFGA  because project sponsors almost never submit complete applications.  According to FTA officials, they begin to review applications while  simultaneously working with project sponsors to submit additional  documentation to complete the application.

Also, according to FTA, the agency has begun to  document the date when it considers project sponsors\u2019 preliminary  engineering applications complete. In addition, in 2008, FTA officials said  that they began requiring project sponsors to submit a copy of their  alternatives analysis initiations packages for FTA review and comment.

Because of the  limitations of FTA\u2019s data, we attempted to collect data from project  sponsors that have received a FFGA since 1997, on the time it takes for a  project to move through the New Starts evaluation and rating process. We  queried the project sponsors for several New Starts milestone dates.  However, we found that some of the project sponsors do not consistently  maintain records on completed projects. In addition, some projects had  multiple project sponsors during the New Starts evaluation and rating  process, which complicated record keeping. Nonetheless, we were able to  gather some milestone dates for 30 of the 40 projects, but these data were  not complete due to missing milestone dates and therefore we were not  able to calculate valid timelines for all projects. (See app. III for more  information on these data.)", "However, of the 30 project sponsors that provided information to us, only  9 had complete sets of New Starts milestone dates. Figure 3 shows the  time it took for each of these projects with complete data to move from  the beginning of alternatives analysis to the approval for a FFGA, ranging  from about 4.5 years for 3 projects to over 14 years for 2 projects. Due to  the number of projects with complete data, the data from these 9 projects  are not generalizeable to the 40 New Starts projects. The small sample size  also makes it difficult to determine whether mode (i.e., heavy rail, light  rail, or bus), cost, or the year that the completed projects entered the New  Starts evaluation and rating process impacts the time each project spends  in each phase. Furthermore, FTA officials told us that each New Start  project\u2019s experience in the evaluation and rating process is unique, making  it difficult to identify trends or patterns.", "Some project sponsors, transit consultants, and a transportation industry  association official told us that, over the years, the New Starts process has  become too time consuming. Specifically, several project sponsors told us  that the amount of time it takes for FTA to determine whether a project  can advance into the next phase can be significant and causes additional  costs. In addition, a 2007 Deloitte study on the New Starts program found  that the New Starts process is perceived by project sponsors as intensive,  lengthy, and burdensome. For example, one project sponsor believes that  FTA reviews prolonged its project development by approximately 1 year,  which they estimate cost an additional $24 million.", "FTA officials have acknowledged that the requirements of the New Starts  process could add time to project development and have acted to  streamline the process. For example, FTA has allowed projects to conduct  additional engineering while FTA reviews applications for final design.  FTA has also maintained that thorough reviews of project information can  identify issues and challenges with proposed investments that may later  prolong project development. However, FTA officials also noted that not  all project delays can be attributed to FTA or the New Starts process. FTA  officials cited a number of reasons that a project could be delayed during  preliminary engineering or final design that are outside FTA\u2019s control such  as changes to a project\u2019s scope, changes in local political leadership, or the  loss of local financial commitment. For example, according to FTA  officials, the Northern Virginia (Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project\u2014 Extension to Wiehle Avenue) project was about to receive FTA approval  to enter the final design phase when the Governor of Virginia requested a  period of 6 months to evaluate a potential change in the project\u2019s scope\u2014 digging a large-bore 4-mile tunnel for a portion of the project\u2014that the  project sponsor eventually discarded in favor of the original design.", "The lack of reliable comprehensive data makes it difficult to develop a  complete understanding of the time it takes projects to move through the  New Starts process. The limited information available and anecdotal  examples suggest that the process can be lengthy. But, without complete  and accurate data, it is difficult to know whether and to what extent the  process has become more time consuming over the years or the addition  of new requirements add to the length of the process. Without such  information, Congress and FTA cannot reliably identify the location,  causes, or extent of the pain points and which options would be an  appropriate response to expedite this process.

Penta-P projects may be eligible for a simplified and  accelerated New Starts review process that is intended to reduce the time  and cost to project sponsors. For example, under Penta-P, the projects are  eligible for consideration, on a case-by-case basis, for accelerated design  approvals. Specifically, FTA could issue concurrent approvals for  preliminary engineering and final design to commence, thus allowing the  project to proceed with final design immediately upon completion of  preliminary engineering without requiring additional approval. To date,  FTA has not issued such concurrent approvals. In 2007, FTA executed  memorandums of understanding for three pilot Penta-P projects that are  candidates for New Starts funding: Houston, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and  Oakland, California. According to FTA officials, as of July 2009, FTA has  not issued concurrent approvals of the type described above as the   Penta-P projects have not yet demonstrated the distribution of risk among  the private and public sectors that would enable FTA to relax its normal  due diligence for approvals into preliminary engineering or final design.", "FTA has also implemented administrative changes designed to expedite  the New Starts process. Examples of these changes include the following:    Regular training workshops: FTA has developed and offered regular  training workshops for project sponsors and offered information to  project sponsors to end misconceptions about the New Starts process.

Project  sponsors can advance the project at their own risk, meaning they could  have to redo the work if FTA does not subsequently approve an aspect of  the project. The amount of time it takes for FTA to determine whether a  project can advance can be significant. For example, one project sponsor  told us that FTA\u2019s review of its application to advance from alternatives  analysis to preliminary engineering took 8 months, about the same amount  of time it took the project sponsor to complete alternatives analysis.

In this regard, the Deloitte study reflected the sentiments of  project sponsors and consultants we interviewed, who said that combining  phases and/or creating a programmatic approval would allow FTA to  signal its intent to recommend a project for funding at an earlier point than  the current project development process allows. This would give sponsors  more opportunity to pursue private financing arrangements and  alternative project delivery methods, such as those being carried out under  Penta-P, as this federal funding provides the certainty needed to  encourage private sector participation.

The Deloitte study also noted that New Starts project sponsors miss the  opportunity to use alternative project delivery methods because of the  lack of early commitment of federal funding for the projects. To encourage  the private sector involvement needed, project sponsors, consultants, and  experts we interviewed suggested that FTA use letters of intent, which are  nonbinding agreements, or early system work agreements, which are  binding agreements. Through a letter of intent, FTA announces its  intention to obligate an amount from future available budget authority to a  project. According to private sector entities we interviewed, such an  intended obligation sends a signal of federal support for a project and,  therefore, attaches more certainty to the project. A challenge of using  letters of intent is that they can be misinterpreted as an obligation of  federal funds, when in fact they only signal FTA\u2019s intention to obligate  future funds should the project meet all New Starts criteria and  requirements, and budget authority is available. In addition, because FTA  reserves, or sets aside, commitment authority, or contract authority,  when it issues letters of intent, issuing more such letters would reduce the  availability of this authority at a faster pace than issuing more early  systems work agreements. Letters of intent cover the project\u2019s full federal  share and, while early systems work agreements actually obligate federal  funds, they obligate only a portion of a project\u2019s federal share. As such, it  is possible that, with more frequent use of letters of intent, FTA\u2019s  commitment authority could be depleted earlier than expected, which  could affect the anticipated funding stream for future projects. Finally,  another challenge of using an early systems work agreement is that the  law specifies that FTA can only enter into this type of agreement with a  project if a Record of Decision under NEPA has been issued, and the  Secretary finds that a FFGA for the project will be made and the terms of  the agreement will promote ultimate completion of the project more  rapidly and at less cost, thus limiting FTA\u2019s ability to use these  agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tailor the New Starts Evaluation Process to Risks Posed by the Projects", "paragraphs": ["Project sponsors, consultants, and experts we interviewed suggested that  FTA adopt a more risk-based evaluation process for New Starts projects  based on a project\u2019s cost or complexity, the federal share of the project\u2019s  cost, or the project sponsor\u2019s New Starts experience. For example, FTA  could align the level of oversight with the proposed federal share of the  project\u2014that is, the greater the financial exposure for the federal  government, the greater the level of oversight. This was employed with the  creation of the Small Starts program, which is intended to provide a more  streamlined process for smaller and less costly projects. Similarly, FTA  could reduce or eliminate certain reviews for project sponsors who have  successfully developed New Starts projects in the past, while applying  greater oversight to project sponsors who have no experience with the  New Starts project development process. We have noted the value in using  risk-based approaches to oversight. For example, we have previously  reported that assessing risks can help agencies allocate finite resources  and help policymakers make informed decisions. By adopting a more  risk-based approach, based on, for example, project sponsor experience,  project scope, total project cost, or federal share of the cost, FTA could  allow select projects to move more quickly through the New Starts project  development process and more efficiently use its scarce resources.  However, a trade-off of not applying all evaluation measures to every  project is that FTA could miss the opportunity to detect problems early in  the project\u2019s development. Further, this practice may move FTA away  from their stated management objective of treating \u201call projects equitably  across the U.S.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consistently Use Project Development Tools", "paragraphs": ["Project sponsors said that FTA should more consistently use road maps or  similar tools to define the project sponsor\u2019s and FTA\u2019s expectations and  responsibilities for moving the project forward. Without establishing these  expectations, project sponsors have historically had little information  about how long it will take FTA to review, for example, their request to  move from alternatives analysis to preliminary engineering. This lack of  information makes it difficult for the project sponsor to effectively manage  the project. Additionally, FTA previously identified an \u201cadequate schedule\u201d  as a key factor of successful project implementation. Given the benefits of  clearly setting these expectations, Deloitte recommended that FTA use  road maps for all projects. The Deloitte study also observed that project  sponsors would like to see FTA use more project development  agreements, or similar vehicles, early in the development process because  they help clarify expectations on both sides.", "The following project development tools could increase the transparency  of and help project sponsors navigate the New Starts project development  process:    Road maps or similar project schedules: FTA has used road maps for  select projects, but the agency does not consistently use them for all  projects. According to FTA, the agency is currently working with project  sponsors to establish road maps for all projects. However, according to  some project sponsors, a limitation of using road maps is that expected  time frames are subject to change\u2014that is, project schedules often change  as a project evolves throughout the development process. Furthermore,  every project is unique, making it difficult to set a realistic time frame for  each phase of development. Consequently, the road maps can provide only  rough estimates of expected time frames.", "Project development agreements (PDA): FTA has used project  development agreements, on a limited basis, to help streamline the New  Starts project development process. PDAs require project sponsors and  FTA to agree on three components: a delivery schedule, a review of key  project development deliverables, and clear expectations from both sides  for demonstrating project development progress, so that each would be  held accountable for the advancement of a project. However, an FTA  official stated that there are differences of opinion inside FTA as to the  relative efficacy of road maps versus project development agreements. In  addition, FTA told us that, as legal documents, PDAs take so long to  negotiate with project sponsors that they may not offer a streamlining  advantage. Because of that, some FTA staff members have stated a  preference for road maps over PDAs and, as an alternative to PDAs, are  currently using the informal road maps described above to establish  milestones and timelines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Apply Policy and Guidance Changes Only to Future Projects", "paragraphs": ["Project sponsors told us that the frequent policy and guidance changes to  the New Starts program can result in additional costs and delays as project  sponsors are required to redo analyses to reflect the changes. In May 2006,  FTA modified its policy so that a project that has been approved for entry  into final design would no longer be subject to changes in New Starts  policy and guidance. However, this policy change does not apply to  projects approved for entry into preliminary engineering, which is the New  Starts project development phase that has the most requirements for  project sponsors and the phase where project sponsors told us that  frequent changes result in additional costs and delays. For example,  sponsor officials for one project told us that shortly after they submitted  their preliminary engineering approval materials to FTA, FTA established  a new, internal rule that required a risk assessment to take place prior to  FTA\u2019s approval to enter preliminary engineering, instead of during  preliminary engineering. To protect the development schedule, the  officials asked for, but were denied, approval for the project to proceed  under the existing guidance that placed risk assessment activities during  preliminary engineering, or at least to perform the risk assessment  concurrently with preliminary engineering approval to maintain the  schedule. The sponsor said the overall effect of the change was a delay of  the preliminary engineering approval by about 4 months. According to  FTA officials, FTA typically allows \u201cgrace periods\u201d when implementing  major policy changes to provide sponsors stability and time to adapt to  those changes. Furthermore, another project sponsor noted that new  requirements can prolong project development because each element of a  proposed project is interrelated, so changing one requirement can stop  momentum on a project. To avoid this rework, some project sponsors,  consultants, and experts we interviewed suggested that FTA apply  changes only to future projects, not projects currently in preliminary  engineering. However, by not applying changes to projects in preliminary  engineering, FTA could miss the opportunity to enhance its oversight of  these projects.

Consultants  and sponsors told us that FTA\u2019s \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d approach to the review  process, while not agency policy, sometimes can result in FTA reviewing  only one project at a time, in the order they arrive. FTA told us this  happens occasionally because of overlapping demands placed on  oversight contractors, who are not able to perform simultaneous reviews.  As a result, the development of low-risk projects is often prolonged if they  happen to sit in the queue behind more complex projects that were  submitted earlier. The Deloitte study recommended, and consultants and a  sponsor we interviewed agreed, that FTA could adjust its process or  staffing, as needed, to enable multiple reviews to be conducted in parallel.  In addition, sponsors and consultants we interviewed told us some of  FTA\u2019s PMOCs have little experience with New Starts or Small Starts  projects, leaving them uncertain about FTA requirements. As a  consequence, inexperienced PMOCs sometimes provide inconsistent  guidance, resulting in sponsors having to re-do work, adding time to the  development process. To reduce the PMOC\u2019s uncertainties about FTA\u2019s  requirements, FTA could provide them with additional training, especially  when regulatory and administrative requirements change. FTA could also  streamline the process by using staff, instead of contractors, to oversee  project sponsors.

Moreover, this  lack of adequate data makes it difficult for Congress and FTA to assess the  extent to which federal efforts designed to expedite the New Starts  process are succeeding. Although each project is unique, providing this  information could also help set general expectations about the length of  the process for potential project sponsors. While FTA has taken some  steps to improve its data collection and retention, additional work is  needed.
