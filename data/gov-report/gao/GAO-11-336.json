In addition, IRS has conducted an outreach campaign consistent with key practices to inform paid preparers of the new requirements. For example, IRS developed a standardized message that it distributed in different formats. IRS is developing strategies for how to ensure that paid preparers comply with the new requirements, according to the director of IRS's Return Preparer Office. IRS is funding the paid preparer requirements through user fees, which it is setting consistent with established criteria for cost estimating. For example, in setting the PTIN user fee to ensure it covered program costs, IRS identified key costs associated with registration, estimated fixed costs, and based some variable costs on similar registration efforts. IRS has discussed but not documented a framework for how it plans to use the requirements to improve taxpayer compliance. For example, IRS plans to develop a comprehensive database containing information on paid preparers and related tax returns. Also, IRS has yet to document how it will assess the requirements' effect, for example, by identifying what baseline data IRS needs. Without a documented framework, IRS may have difficulty (1) assessing whether it has adequately planned for what data it needs to collect and (2) deciding how to allocate resources given competing priorities.

While paid preparers could be  subject to penalties with respect to the preparation of tax returns, until  recently IRS had not regulated the conduct and competency of all paid  preparers.

Paid  preparers prepared almost 60 percent of all federal tax returns filed in  2008 and 2009. IRS does not know how many paid preparers there are but  estimates there are between 900,000 and 1.2 million. Prior to the new  requirements for paid preparers there were no national standards that a  paid preparer was required to satisfy before being compensated for  preparing a federal tax return. Currently, attorneys, certified public   accountants (CPA), enrolled agents (EA), enrolled actuaries, enrolled  retirement plan agents, and other individuals authorized to practice  before IRS are subject to standards of practice under Department of the  Treasury Circular No. 230. Most EAs are required to pass an examination  and complete annual continuing education, while attorneys and CPAs are  licensed by states but are still subject to Circular 230 standards of  practice if they practice before IRS. Previously, other paid preparers were  not regulated, required to pass a competency examination, complete  continuing education, or adhere to the standards of practice in Circular  230. The states of Oregon, California, New York, and Maryland all regulate  paid preparers, but oversight in each state varies. IRS has noted that the  lack of uniform federal regulation of all paid preparers has resulted in  greatly varying oversight of paid preparers depending on the paid  preparer\u2019s professional affiliations, or lack thereof, and the geographical  area in which they practice.", "In previous work, we and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration (TIGTA) found that some paid preparers made significant  errors preparing tax returns and we recommended that IRS conduct  research to determine the extent to which paid preparers file accurate and  complete tax returns. We also recommended that IRS develop a plan to  require stricter regulation of paid preparers and suggested Congress adopt  a nationwide paid preparer regulatory regime similar to Oregon\u2019s paid  preparer regulatory regime if it judged that Oregon\u2019s regulatory regime  accounted for at least a modest portion of the higher federal tax return  accuracy in the state.", "In June 2009, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue initiated a review of  paid preparers to help IRS strengthen its partnerships with paid preparers  and ensure that paid preparers adhere to applicable professional standards  and follow tax laws. IRS recommended changes to the oversight of paid  preparers in its December 2009 Return Preparer Review report. These  recommended changes included mandatory registration for paid preparers  who are required to sign a federal tax return; competency testing and  continuing education for paid preparers who are required to register with  IRS and who are not attorneys, CPAs, or EAs; and holding all paid  preparers to Circular 230 standards of practice, regardless of whether or  not the preparers are required to sign a federal tax return.

In addition to the requirements shown in figure 1, IRS  will require all paid preparers to adhere to Circular 230 standards of  practice. Revisions to the Circular 230 regulations are currently being  reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), according to an  official involved in the implementation of the new requirements. When the  revisions to the Circular 230 regulations have been finalized, paid  preparers will be required to adhere to its standards of practice.", "The dates for implementing the competency testing and continuing  education requirements are tentative because OMB is currently reviewing  the proposed revisions to the Circular 230 regulations. Because these  proposed regulations are not final, IRS has not decided how it will  implement some details of the competency testing and continuing  education requirements. Nevertheless, the RPO Director discussed with us  his thoughts on approaches IRS might take.", "Paid preparers may register for a PTIN online or on paper via Form W-12,  IRS Paid Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) Application.  Paid preparers who currently have a PTIN must register in the new P registration system but in most cases can retain their old PTIN as long as  IRS can verify identifying information for the existing PTIN. Online  registrants are supposed to receive a provisional PTIN immediately while  paper registrants are supposed to receive a provisional PTIN in                   4-6 weeks.  As of March 20, 2011, according to an IRS official involved in  implementing the new requirements, IRS had issued 692,297 PTINs,  approximately 60 percent of which were issued to paid preparers with  existing PTINs and approximately 40 percent of which were issued to paid  preparers without existing PTINs.", "Most, but not all, paid preparers were able to obtain a PTIN online.  According to an official involved in the implementation of the new  requirements, approximately 92 percent of paid preparers who attempted  to obtain PTINs by the start of the filing season got them online. The rest  either attempted to obtain a PTIN by paper or were directed to obtain a  PTIN by paper, likely as a result of an online authentication issue. Officials  and members of multiple paid preparer organizations stated that some  preparers have encountered technical problems when using the PTIN  registration system but also noted that IRS\u2019s administration of the PTIN  registration system has improved. The RPO Director said that IRS has  worked to address problems with the registration system since it was  initiated. For example, married paid preparers with different last names  from their spouses who filed tax returns under the married filing jointly  status were experiencing difficulty obtaining a new PTIN. The RPO  director said that IRS solved this problem. For the 2011 tax filing season,  IRS will allow paid preparers who are able to demonstrate a good faith  effort to obtain a PTIN, but were unsuccessful, to use their old PTINs or  Social Security numbers on tax returns.", "When applying for a PTIN, paid preparers are asked to self-disclose if they  are compliant with their personal and business taxes, under penalty of  perjury. The RPO Director said that IRS plans to initiate automated tax  compliance checks on all paid preparers. IRS plans to limit the checks to  whether the preparers have filed all federal tax returns and paid or entered  into an agreement to pay federal tax debts. Paid preparers are also asked if  they have been convicted of a felony in the past 10 years, under penalty of  perjury. The PTIN application includes space to write an explanation for  both tax compliance and felony information. The RPO Director said that  IRS plans to check the accuracy of registrants\u2019 tax compliance and  background information by late 2011 and that registrants who provide  false information on their PTIN applications will have severely limited  appeal rights if IRS proposes to deny them PTINs. Paid preparers who are  attorneys, CPAs, or EAs are asked to self-identify their professional  credentials. The RPO Director said that IRS does not have a single-source  database through which it can verify these professional credentials (it only  has information on EAs). IRS plans to sample randomly attorneys and  CPAs for verification of their self identification, and the RPO Director said  that IRS is working toward developing a database that contains  information about attorneys and CPAs that will allow for automated  verification.", "IRS plans to hold paid preparers to Circular 230 standards of practice and  will establish a new category of practitioner\u2014registered tax return  preparer. These paid preparers will be limited in their practice before IRS  to preparing tax returns, claims for refund, and other documents for  submission to IRS but will be required to adhere to professional ethical  standards when doing so or face a penalty. Additionally, paid preparers  who are supervised by an attorney, CPA, EA, enrolled actuary, or enrolled  retirement plan agent at a law firm, CPA firm, or other recognized firm and  do not sign tax returns but obtain a PTIN, while not being granted rights to  practice before IRS, will be required to meet the same standards. The RPO  Director said that if paid preparers are denied a PTIN or have their PTIN  revoked, paid preparers will have the right to appeal this denial or  revocation in the same manner as other Circular 230 sanctions.", "Applicability of the new paid preparer requirements will vary by type of  paid preparer, as shown in table 1:  According to the RPO Director, some types of paid preparers will be  exempt from the new competency testing and continuing education  requirements because they are subject to competency testing and  continuing education requirements set by their professional licensing  bodies.", "IRS proposed regulations amending Circular 230 will require individuals  (see table 1 above) to pass a competency test to become an officially  registered tax return preparer. Paid preparers who have a valid PTIN  before competency testing is available will have until 2013 to pass a  competency test. Paid preparers who register for a PTIN after testing is  available must pass a competency test before obtaining a PTIN. The RPO  Director said that IRS is allowing this delay in testing for preparers who  register for a PTIN before testing is available to encourage paid preparers  to register for a PTIN as soon as possible while giving them time to  prepare for the competency test. The RPO Director also said that IRS  plans to develop and implement one competency test for individuals who  prepare returns from the individual tax return (Form 1040) series and will  assess whether IRS needs to add additional tests in the future. The RPO  Director also said that IRS plans to have the test available at national and  international locations, which will allow individuals to consult forms and  instructions during the test, and that individuals will pay a fee each time  they take the test. After completing the competency test, registered tax  return preparers will be subject to suitability checks, which IRS plans to  conduct to determine whether the individual has engaged in disreputable  conduct. According to the RPO Director, IRS plans to link suitability  checks for registered tax return preparers to the competency test so that  when paid preparers take the competency test they will be fingerprinted,  thereby submitting to a suitability check.", "IRS plans to implement a continuing education requirement, whereby  registered tax return preparers (see table 1 above) will be required to take  15 hours of training annually\u20143 hours of federal tax law updates, 2 hours  of ethics, and 10 hours of additional federal tax topics.

According to the RPO Director, IRS plans to implement initiatives  intended to ensure paid preparers\u2019 compliance with the new requirements  but has yet to make many decisions because it is waiting for information  from the PTIN registration system that will allow it to implement effective  initiatives.", "During the first year after the PTIN requirement has been implemented,  IRS plans to focus on bringing paid preparers into compliance and  improving its communications and outreach, and not on penalizing paid  preparers for noncompliance, according to the RPO Director. For  example, the RPO Director said that IRS plans to contact paid preparers  who file returns signed with an old PTIN, a SSN, or other identification  number after the filing season is over. The RPO Director said that IRS will  direct them to obtain a PTIN that will retroactively cover their practice  during the recently completed filing season. The RPO Director also said  that in cases of egregious noncompliance, such as paid preparers ignoring  an IRS contact directing them to use a PTIN, IRS plans to contact paid  preparers directly. IRS has the authority to penalize paid preparers who  are required to but fail to include a PTIN on a tax return.", "IRS has undertaken one initiative for ensuring paid preparer compliance  with the new requirements and is evaluating other future compliance  initiatives. IRS sent letters in November 2010 to 10,000 paid preparers to  remind them of their responsibility to comply with requirements for paid  preparers, including registering for a PTIN.

IRS contracted with a vendor  to establish and maintain the PTIN registration system, and the vendor will  charge a $14.25 fee, bringing the total fee for PTIN registration to $64.25.  In determining the level of the PTIN registration user fee, IRS has taken  actions or made plans consistent with established criteria for setting user  fees and using the resulting revenue. These criteria, which we identified in  prior reports, include a set of key questions that should be considered  when designing and implementing user fees and best practices for  developing cost estimates. Key questions to consider when designing and  implementing a user fee are contained within four primary components:  setting, collecting, using, and reviewing.

To calculate the cost  of foreign paid preparer registration processing, IRS estimated the number  of PTIN registrants who will be foreign paid preparers and the cost to  process each registration. To calculate the cost of screening paid  preparers for tax compliance and a criminal background, IRS extrapolated  to the paid preparer requirements the costs of screening individuals  applying to become IRS e-File providers for tax compliance and a  criminal background. The RPO Director acknowledged that these  estimates are uncertain and therefore the actual costs could be higher or  lower.", "Approximately 25 percent of the costs IRS is planning to cover with the  PTIN registration user fee are fixed and are contained within the  remaining three categories: communications and customer support, IT,  and operations support. For these three categories, IRS estimated various  component costs, including staff salary and benefits. IRS developed these  cost figures assuming that as many as 1.2 million individuals will register  for a PTIN, an estimate based on the number of individuals who signed tax  returns as paid preparers in 2006 with a PTIN, SSN, or other identification  number. IRS has acknowledged that this estimate is uncertain. Because  these costs are fixed, their average will depend on the number of paid  preparers who register for a PTIN.", "In addition to setting the user fee, there are key questions that should be  addressed when implementing a new user fee that cover collecting, using,  and reviewing the fee.

Likewise it has  not developed a framework for evaluating the effect of any planned  service and enforcement efforts or the effect of the requirements  themselves on improving taxpayer compliance. One of IRS\u2019s goals for the  paid preparer requirements is to better leverage the tax preparer  community to improve taxpayer compliance. The RPO Director shared  with us ideas on how to achieve that goal. For example, according to the  RPO Director, IRS plans to develop a comprehensive database containing  information on paid preparers and the tax returns they prepare. IRS plans  to use information from this database to test which strategies are most  effective for improving the quality of tax returns prepared by different  types of paid preparers. Likewise, IRS has discussed how to measure the  effect of the requirements, for example, the effects that requiring  continuing education and testing have on tax return accuracy. In planning,  the RPO has included other IRS divisions, such as the Small Business/Self- Employed division, which is responsible for examining tax returns, and  the Research, Analysis, and Statistics unit, which will help monitor and  evaluate whether the new requirements improve taxpayer compliance.  Although IRS discussed with us its planned approaches for using the  requirements to improve taxpayer compliance, it has not yet produced a  document that lays out this approach. Likewise, as discussed previously,  IRS has yet to decide how it will enforce paid preparers\u2019 compliance with  the requirements.", "Documenting a framework for using the requirements and measuring their  effect is consistent with three steps we found leading public sector  organizations take to increase the accountability of their initiatives:          (1) define clear missions and desired outcomes; (2) measure performance  to gauge progress; and (3) use performance information as a basis for  decision-making. IRS has defined an overarching desired outcome of  increasing taxpayer compliance and could increase its accountability by  including the next two steps in a documented framework. Likewise, we  have reported that it is important to develop assessment plans prior to full  project implementation in order to ensure that the data necessary for  evaluation are collected. We also previously reported that we were  unable to assess whether California\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s paid preparer  requirements led to improved return accuracy because data were not  available on return accuracy prior to the enactment of the requirements.  Both IRS and we have acknowledged the importance of measuring  performance, including using baseline data and having intermediate and  end outcomes. Since the PTIN registration requirement has been  implemented and IRS plans to implement the other requirements  gradually, it is important for IRS to identify and collect baseline data to  have a basis by which to measure the effect of the requirements, IRS\u2019s  strategies to leverage the requirements to increase taxpayer compliance,  and the strategies\u2019 relative costs. In addition, we have also reported that  establishing a timeline that includes critical phases and essential activities  that need to be completed by particular dates to achieve results is  important for accountability. The timeline can help pinpoint performance  shortfalls and gaps, suggest midcourse corrections, and demonstrate  progress toward goals.", "The RPO Director stated that IRS decided to begin implementing the  requirements before determining how to use them to improve taxpayer  compliance and measure their impact because it would take less time than  waiting to implement all of the requirements until it documented its plans.", "As noted above, IRS\u2019s approach to implementing the requirements is  sequential, so the details of its compliance strategy will not be known for  some time. However, not documenting the basic framework being  followed may create problems.", "The lack of a documented framework may have negative repercussions for  several reasons. First, without a documented framework, the various IRS  divisions and offices involved in implementing the new requirements may  have difficulty assessing whether there is a sound analysis plan and  whether adequate plans are in place to collect the data needed to carry out  the analysis. Without such assessments IRS is at risk of incurring  additional evaluation costs by, for example, conducting unplanned data  analyses, collecting irrelevant data, or failing to collect needed data in a  timely manner. Second, the RPO Director stated that IRS does not know  when the comprehensive database on paid preparers will be completed  because there are many competing priorities for IRS resources. A  documented framework with proposed steps and a timeline could help IRS  make more informed resource allocation decisions. Third, members and  officials from paid preparer associations whom we interviewed stressed  that it is essential for IRS to evaluate whether the requirements are  improving taxpayer compliance, and some stated that the requirements  will be worthwhile only if they result in an improvement. The impact of  these requirements depends on the compliance of paid preparers and paid  preparers bear the burden of complying with the requirements.  Demonstrating to paid preparers that IRS will evaluate whether the  requirements provide the benefit of improved taxpayer compliance could  improve preparers\u2019 voluntary compliance with the requirements.", "The framework will likely evolve over time and become more detailed.  Initially, the framework may be a high level road map for achieving  taxpayer compliance results sooner and perhaps at a lower cost and could  include information on IRS\u2019s strategies and tactics for improving taxpayer  compliance and what data need to be collected now.

We analyzed  this information against key communications internal control standards  we identified in GAO\u2019s Internal Control Management and Evaluation  Tool and key practices for communicating with the public about a new  initiative that we identified in GAO\u2019s Digital Television Transition:  Increased Federal Planning and Risk Management Could Further  Facilitate the DTV Transition.", "To assess IRS\u2019s resource estimates to develop and implement the new  requirements, we reviewed IRS documents on the preparer tax  identification number (PTIN) user fee that IRS is charging paid preparers  for obtaining a PTIN and interviewed officials from the Return Preparer  Implementation Project Office, RPO, and IRS\u2019s Chief Financial Officer\u2019s  office. We examined this information using key questions that agencies  should consider when developing and implementing user fees that we  identified in GAO\u2019s Federal User Fees: A Design Guide and best practices  that agencies should follow when developing cost estimates that we  identified in GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. In table 2, we  examined key questions to consider when setting a user fee and key  criteria for establishing a credible estimate of a program\u2019s cost, and IRS\u2019s  actions in setting the PTIN registration user fee. In table 3, we examined  key questions to consider when collecting, using, and reviewing a user fee,  and IRS\u2019s actions and planned actions in collecting, using, and reviewing  the PTIN registration user fee. We determined whether IRS had considered  the key questions and criteria and did not examine the appropriateness of  the specific program costs that IRS plans to fund with the PTIN user fee.", "To assess IRS\u2019s plans to use the requirements to improve taxpayer  compliance and evaluate the effect of the paid preparer requirements, we  reviewed IRS documents and interviewed Return Preparer Implementation  Project Office and RPO officials. We examined this information using IRS\u2019s  plans in the December 2009 Return Preparer Review and its guidance on  measuring performance in the Internal Revenue Manual Exhibit 1.5.1-5,  Process to Create a Performance Model for New (or Revised) Programs.  We also examined this information using our past work on evaluating a  program in Agency Performance Plans: Examples of Practices That Can  Improve Usefulness to Decisionmakers; Executive Guide: Effectively  Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act; Tax  Administration: Planning for IRS\u2019s Enforcement Process Changes  Included Many Key Steps but Can Be Improved; Designing Evaluations;  Results-Oriented Cultures: Implementation Steps to Assist Mergers and  Organizational Transformations; and Tax Preparers: Oregon\u2019s  Regulatory Regime May Lead to Improved Federal Tax Return Accuracy  and Provides a Possible Model for National Regulation.", "In addition, for all three objectives we interviewed members and officials  of paid preparer associations that IRS had convened as industry  stakeholders, which included the major types of paid preparers that IRS  intended the requirements to cover. These associations were the American  Bar Association, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,  National Association of Enrolled Agents, National Society of Accountants,  and National Association of Tax Professionals. We also interviewed a  representative from H&R Block, a retail tax return preparation chain that  IRS consulted as part of an independent preparer panel and  representatives of two additional return preparer associations, the  American Payroll Association and American Society of Pension  Professionals and Actuaries, that included types of paid preparers that  IRS, at the time, intended the requirements to cover. IRS has since decided  that individuals who prepare only employee benefit plan returns are not  covered by the requirements. We summarized the members\u2019 and officials\u2019  responses to a variety of questions about the paid preparer requirements.", "We shared the criteria on which we based our descriptions and  assessments in our three objectives with IRS during the course of our  audit work.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact person named above, Jeff Arkin, Assistant  Director; Amy Bowser; Maya Chakko; Ellen Grady; Donna Miller; Cindy  Saunders; and Dan Webb made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
