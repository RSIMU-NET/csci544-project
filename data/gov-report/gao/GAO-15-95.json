One required the suspension of AUO for certain employees. The other required components to submit plans to address deficiencies, which most DHS components have done. DHS also plans to issue a department-wide AUO directive and to monitor component implementation of corrective actions through its ongoing human resource office assessments every 3 to 4 years, among other things. However, this monitoring is too general and infrequent to effectively monitor or evaluate DHS components' progress. Given the department's long-standing and widespread AUO administration and oversight deficiencies, developing and executing a department-wide oversight mechanism to ensure components implement AUO appropriately on a sustained basis, and in accordance with law and regulation, could better position DHS to monitor components' progress remediating AUO deficiencies.

The employees and supervisors\u2014although authorized to  receive AUO pay in their regular positions\u2014were not eligible to  receive AUO pay during the time frame under investigation because  the office they were temporarily detailed to involved work that was  controllable and administrative in nature.", "DHS component officials stated that they did not regularly conduct  authorization reviews because they thought that reviewing AUO rates to  determine amount of pay provided sufficient oversight. For example, the  results of a rates review could find that an employee\u2019s AUO rate should  be decreased to 0 percent, based on the hours of AUO the employee  worked in the prior review period. However, rates reviews do not provide  components with sufficient information to determine whether those  employees who worked enough hours of AUO to qualify for AUO should  continue to receive AUO pay. Authorization reviews are to examine  whether each employee who has received AUO pay in the past should  continue to receive AUO. For example, authorization reviews should  consider past and future expected work duties to ensure that they are  administratively uncontrollable, among other things. Because DHS  components have not regularly conducted AUO authorization reviews,  components are limited in their ability to ensure that employees are in  positions\u2014and performing work\u2014eligible for AUO.

As a result, ICE did not have reasonable assurance that it was  paying the appropriate AUO rate to applicable employees. In response to  the findings of its June 2014 review, in July 2014, the ICE Office of  Human Capital began disseminating biweekly reports to ICE  headquarters and field office management detailing required AUO rates  changes and deauthorizations to provide greater oversight and to track  these adjustments.

For  example, a May 2008 investigation conducted by CBP\u2019s Office of Internal  Affairs on referral from OSC found that employees at two CBP locations  did not document AUO activities in accordance with CBP policies, in part,  because employees did not understand or were not aware of the  documentation requirement. Investigations and reviews conducted by  ICE, CBP, and USCIS also found that employees have not consistently  provided sufficient information in AUO documentation forms.

For example, a January  2014 ICE investigation found that some supervisors conducted  inconsistent reviews of AUO documentation because of minimal AUO  guidance from ERO headquarters and the field office investigated. The  investigation report noted that one supervisor may ask for additional  clarification for AUO documentation that stated \u201ccleaned up paperwork,\u201d  while another supervisor may consider it a sufficient justification of AUO  duties.", "Because many supervisors do not consistently review AUO hours, AUO  rates generally remained steady, often at the maximum level, for much of  the department\u2019s workforce authorized for AUO, according to the DHS  May 2014 AUO administration memorandum.

The DHS memorandum further stated that a particular  challenge is that supervisors may routinely approve 2 hours of AUO for  the same employees performing the same tasks at the same time on the  same days of the week, and that work that is steady and consistent is not  uncontrollable. According to testimony from OSC\u2019s Special Counsel at a  January 2014 congressional hearing, using AUO routinely, and every day,  is an entrenched part of the culture at DHS components. In addition,  officials from the department\u2019s Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer  (OCHCO) stated that certain employees were accustomed to using AUO  without much oversight, and that this use of AUO has become part of the  department\u2019s culture. For example, a February 2013 investigation  conducted by CBP\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs, on referral by OSC, found  that Border Patrol agents assigned to the Commissioner\u2019s Situation Room  regularly remained at the duty station 2 hours beyond the end of regularly  scheduled shifts to transition between scheduled shifts.", "According to DHS\u2019s May 2014 memorandum on AUO administration,  without sufficient documentation, managers cannot adequately evaluate  hours claimed or differentiate between uncontrollable and scheduled  overtime. In addition, clear and complete AUO activity documentation and  review of that documentation permit components to actively manage  overtime expenditures, such as by varying schedules or staggering shifts  to minimize overtime costs. The memorandum further states that when  supervisors approve claimed AUO hours without appropriately reviewing  activity documentation, employees receive inflated rates of AUO pay  based on the approval of work that should have been scheduled in  advance or completed the next working day. DHS has begun to take  action to ensure that components consistently document and review AUO  activities and hours, which we discuss later in the report.", "Components have not routinely conducted AUO administration  reviews: Most DHS components have not routinely conducted  independent reviews of AUO administration. Federal guidance suggests  that these independent reviews are to include reviews of authorization  and rates reviews and AUO activity documentation, among other things.  As previously discussed, OCSO\u2019s and USSS\u2019s AUO policies do not  include a mechanism to independently review AUO administration, and  accordingly, these reviews have not been conducted. ICE\u2019s AUO policies  did not previously include such a mechanism until ICE updated its policy  to include independent AUO administration reviews in July 2014. USCIS  policy calls for annual AUO administration reviews; however, USCIS  conducted them twice from 2008 to 2013. According to USCIS officials,  USCIS did not conduct annual reviews because its response to the 2008  review recommended enhanced AUO administration controls, and the  agency was implementing these controls before assessing AUO again in  2013.", "CBP and NPPD have conducted AUO administration reviews at least  once every 5 years in accordance with component policies and consistent  with OPM guidance. In particular, CBP\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs inspects  30 to 50 offices\u2019 management practices annually, which includes a review  of AUO administration focused on time and attendance. Since fiscal year  2011, the Office of Internal Affairs has identified 31 instances of  noncompliance with component AUO policies, and CBP offices have  implemented more than 80 percent of related recommendations.  According to NPPD officials, NPPD conducted a compliance review of  2013 AUO administration, in accordance with its 2012 AUO policy. NPPD  found that, among other things, most of the duties NPPD employees  claimed for AUO did not meet the criteria for AUO.

CBP deauthorized  AUO for more than 1,900 employees in 139 positions on September  7, 2014. The authorization review found that 48 positions were still  eligible for AUO based on the nature of work duties, and proposed  next steps such as revising current position descriptions, issuing new  position descriptions detailing AUO-qualifying duties performed by  employees in those positions, and pursuing the recovery of instances  of improper AUO payments. In addition, CBP officials responsible for  human resources reported that they were in the process of updating  AUO employee documentation forms from requiring one supervisory  signature to requiring supervisors to sign each line describing AUO  activities.

The flexibility of AUO, however, requires  the department and components to provide rigorous oversight of the use  of AUO\u2014including careful and consistent review of hours claimed and  employee eligibility, among other things, so that AUO is appropriately  used. Reviews as far back as 1997 show that current DHS entities\u2014such  as U.S. Border Patrol\u2014have not properly managed AUO, partly because  of a culture throughout DHS that employees in certain positions may use  AUO without much oversight and regardless of whether AUO is the  appropriate compensation for the work being performed. Furthermore,  extensive AUO oversight deficiencies have continued since the formation  of DHS in 2003 because DHS components have not implemented AUO in  a manner consistent with federal law, regulation, and guidance, and  component policies.", "DHS is taking actions to improve the management of AUO as detailed in  the Deputy Secretary\u2019s May 23, 2014, memorandum that requires  components to develop and implement corrective action plans and  requires DHS to develop a department-wide directive on AUO. Until the  directive is finalized, it is unclear what provisions will be included, and  whether oversight mechanisms will be robust enough and sufficient to  address the myriad of deficiencies identified with AUO administration and  oversight. Given the department\u2019s total spending on AUO payments of  over $500 million in fiscal year 2013 and DHS\u2019s long-standing and  widespread AUO administration and oversight deficiencies, ensuring  accountability and safeguarding the expenditure of public funds is  paramount. By developing and executing a department-wide oversight  mechanism to ensure components implement AUO appropriately on a  sustained basis, and in accordance with law and regulation, DHS could  be better positioned to monitor components\u2019 progress remediating AUO  deficiencies. In addition, by DHS reporting annually to Congress on the  extent to which DHS components have made progress in remediating  AUO implementation deficiencies, including information from annual third- party AUO audits or other department AUO oversight efforts, Congress  could have reasonable assurance that DHS components have sustained  effective and appropriate use of AUO in accordance with law and  regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that DHS components have sustained effective and  appropriate use of AUO in accordance with law and regulation, Congress  should consider requiring DHS to report annually to Congress on the use  of AUO within the department, including the extent to which DHS  components have made progress remediating AUO implementation  deficiencies and information from annual third-party AUO audits or other  department AUO oversight efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better position DHS to monitor components\u2019 progress remediating  AUO deficiencies, we recommend that the Secretary of DHS develop and  execute a department-wide oversight mechanism to ensure components  implement AUO appropriately on a sustained basis, and in accordance  with law and regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.

How much has the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spent on  administratively uncontrollable overtime (AUO) pay from fiscal year  2008 through March 2014?  2.  To what extent have DHS components implemented AUO  appropriately?  3.  How have recent AUO suspensions and deauthorizations at selected  DHS components affected their use of overtime?", "For this report, we assessed DHS\u2019s use of AUO for those components  that compensated employees with AUO from fiscal year 2008 (October  2007) to March 22, 2014\u2014the most currently available data for fiscal year  2014 at the time of our data request. However, when calculating annual  averages, we used the last full year of available data\u2014fiscal year 2013.  Specifically, these components included U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),  National Protection and Program Directorate (NPPD), U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Secret Service (USSS), and the  Office of the Chief Security Officer (OCSO). We include OCSO in our  scope when we refer to DHS components throughout this report. We  selected this time frame because the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)  first raised allegations of AUO abuse within DHS in 2007. We omitted the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) and DHS\u2019s Office of  the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) because they previously used AUO  on a limited basis to fewer than 10 employees, for about 1 year.  Specifically, FLETC compensated 1 employee with AUO from July 2010  to October 2011, and OCIO compensated 4 employees with AUO from  April 2012 to May 2013.", "To determine how much each DHS component spent on AUO from fiscal  year 2008 through March 2014, we collected AUO payments data for all  DHS components that paid AUO since October 2007. These data  included AUO payments to individual employees within each component  per pay period as well as occupational characteristics such as grade,  series, position title, salary, location, and program office. These data  allowed us to calculate, for each component and in aggregate for DHS,  the total amount of AUO paid per fiscal year; the average amount of AUO  pay per employee; the number of recipients of AUO; and the counts of  AUO recipients by location, grade, and position title. We assessed the  reliability of the AUO payments data by (1) interviewing agency officials  about the data sources, the systems\u2019 controls, and any quality assurance  steps performed by officials before data were provided from the systems  and (2) testing the data for missing data, duplicates, negative dollar  amounts or payments, entries with values beyond expected ranges, or  other entries that appeared to be unusual. We identified limitations to the  data including incomplete duty location information for CBP, incomplete  date ranges for NPPD, as well as missing AUO payments and other  variables for several components. The missing locations data for CBP  affected about 9 percent of all records that we received, and we included  caveats in the report where relevant. In addition, NPPD was unable to  provide AUO payments from fiscal years 2008 through 2009 because its  system does not allow access to older years\u2019 information at the level of  detail requested. NPPD accounted for about 1 percent of all AUO  payments during the years of data available to us, so we believe the  absence of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 of NPPD AUO payments data  likely resulted in a minimal impact on our reported overall expenditures for  those years. We included caveats in the report where relevant related to  NPPD\u2019s AUO payments data. Additionally, USSS was able to provide  calendar year payments data only for 2008 through 2010, resulting in a 3  month overlap with the last 3 months of calendar year 2010 with the first 3  months of fiscal year 2011. Since USSS constitutes a relatively small  amount of total AUO payments any impacts on the aggregate data are  likely minimal. We found the components\u2019 data sufficiently reliable and  complete for providing descriptive information on the amount of AUO that  DHS components paid and on the occupational characteristics of  employees earning AUO payments.", "To determine the extent to which DHS components implemented AUO  appropriately, we reviewed AUO policies and procedures for those DHS  components that compensated employees with AUO from fiscal year  2008 through March 2014\u2014CBP, ICE, NPPD, USSS, OCSO, and  USCIS. We analyzed these policies and procedures to determine the extent to which they comply with relevant federal regulations and  incorporate Office of Management and Personnel (OPM) guidance. We  also interviewed OPM officials about these regulations and guidance to  better inform our understanding of components\u2019 AUO policies and  procedures. To describe the extent to which AUO policies and procedures  may have contributed to inappropriate implementation of AUO, we  reviewed relevant Office of Inspector General (OIG) and OSC-referred  component investigation and review reports that were based on referrals  or otherwise begun between May 2007 and January 2014. We reviewed  the Department of Justice\u2019s OIG\u2019s sampling methodology for its 1997  review of Border Patrol employees\u2019 use of AUO, and found it sufficiently  sound to report the results. In addition, to assess the extent to which ICE  consistently adjusted AUO rates, we compared AUO rates changes for  employees identified by ICE with personnel actions to decrease AUO  rates, and thereby AUO payments, for identified employees. We selected  ICE because officials indicated that AUO rates adjustments were not  carried out in a timely fashion by field office officials. Further, we reviewed  AUO activity documentation submitted by NPPD employees from  December 1 through 14, 2013, because NPPD stores this documentation  electronically and it was the most recently available documentation at the  start of our review.", "We also met with agency officials from component program offices that  compensated employees with AUO to obtain their perspectives on AUO  policies and procedures, as well as implementation of these policies and  procedures, including (1) DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer  (OCHCO); (2) CBP\u2019s U.S. Border Patrol, Office of Internal Affairs, Office  of Field Operations, Office of Training and Development, and Office of Air  and Marine; (3) ICE\u2019s Office of Human Capital, Enforcement and  Removal Operations, Homeland Security Investigations, and Office of  Professional Responsibility; (4) NPPD\u2019s Infrastructure Security  Compliance Division, Protective Security Coordination Division, and  Federal Protective Service; (5) USCIS\u2019s Office of Security and Integrity;  (6) USSS\u2019s Management and Organization Division, Office of  Investigations, Office of Protective Operations, and Office of Technical  Development and Mission Support; and (7) OCSO. We also met with  representatives from two unions with bargaining unit members receiving  AUO to obtain their perspectives on components\u2019 use of AUO: the  National Border Patrol Council and the National ICE Council. To  determine actions DHS and its components have taken to strengthen  AUO policies and procedures and to improve implementation of these  policies and procedures, we reviewed DHS\u2019s January 23, 2014, and May  23, 2014, memorandums on AUO administration.", "To determine how recent DHS suspensions of AUO have affected use of  overtime, we analyzed employee overtime information for those  employees who received AUO compensation from USCIS and OCSO,  both of which suspended AUO in November 2013. Components use  different terms to describe the cessation of AUO within their respective  components. For the purposes of this report, we use \u201csuspension\u201d of AUO  when addressing components\u2019 actions to completely stop use of AUO for  all employees without a formal, written determination as to a particular  employee\u2019s or position\u2019s AUO eligibility. Specifically, we compared  overtime hours worked and overtime paid for these employees prior to  and after the AUO suspension. Our analysis included 13 pay periods of  AUO payments and hours worked prior to the suspension of AUO and 13  pay periods of Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA), or scheduled  overtime, payments, and hours worked following the suspension of AUO.  To determine how recent deauthorizations have affected components, we  analyzed AUO paid to employees who DHS components subsequently  deemed to be incorrectly receiving AUO following DHS Secretary  Johnson\u2019s January 27, 2014, memorandum, which instructed components  to suspend AUO for certain categories of employees. For the purposes  of this report, we use \u201cdeauthorization\u201d of AUO when referring to  components\u2019 actions to identify specific employees or positions as no  longer eligible for AUO. We analyzed a list of all individuals from CBP,  ICE, and NPPD who had been deauthorized from receiving AUO, and  requested that each record also include the reason for the person\u2019s  deauthorization. USSS responded that it did not have any employees  meeting the criteria of the memorandum and therefore did not suspend or  deauthorize any employees and did not provide any such data to us. We  combined the CBP, ICE, and NPPD lists with the AUO payments data  previously discussed, and calculated the amount of AUO that DHS  components paid individuals just prior to the time of deauthorization in  January 2014. Subsequently, we estimated the annual amount paid to  these individuals by multiplying the total they were paid at the time of  suspension by 26, the total number of pay periods in a year. Since these  pre- and postsuspension data and deauthorization data are from the  same sources as we assessed above, we interviewed agency officials  about any specific limitations to these different data sets. We did not  identify any additional limitations, and noted any caveats to our analysis.  We found the data sufficiently reliable for providing descriptive information  on how DHS and components\u2019 November 2013 suspensions of AUO  have affected use of overtime and the amount of AUO paid to employees  deauthorized from receiving AUO following the January 2014  memorandum. In addition, we interviewed officials from USCIS and  OCSO, as well as CBP, ICE, and NPPD, to collect their perspectives on  the effect that the AUO suspensions and deauthorizations had on their  ability to fulfill mission-critical tasks, such as any related attrition or morale  issues.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2014 to December  2014, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
