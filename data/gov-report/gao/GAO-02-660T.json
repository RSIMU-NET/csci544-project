In January 2002, the District of Columbia Family Court Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-114) was enacted to, among other things, (1) redesignate the Family Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia as the Family Court of the Superior Court, (2) recruit trained and experienced judges to serve in the Family Court, and (3) promote consistency and efficiency in the assignment of judges to the Family Court and in the consideration of actions and proceedings in the Family Court. The passage of this act represented the first major overhaul of the Superior Court\u2019s Family Division in 3 decades. The Congress, in considering such an overhaul, found that poor communication between participants in the child welfare system, a weak organizational structure, and a lack of case management were serious problems plaguing the Family Division.", "As a first step in initiating changes to the Family Division, the Family Court Act required the chief judge of the Superior Court to submit to the president and the Congress a transition plan outlining the proposed operation of the Family Court. The Congress also required that the chief judge submit the transition plan to the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and that, within 30 calendar days after submission of the plan by the Superior Court, we submit to the president and the Congress an analysis of the contents and effectiveness of the plan in meeting the requirements of the Family Court Act. My testimony is based on our analysis of the transition plan, including discussions with court and child welfare experts, juvenile and family court judges across the country, and officials from the District of Columbia Superior Court and the Family Court. To supplement our analysis of the transition plan, we also asked several court experts to examine the plan and highlight its strengths and areas that may need more attention. Our final report will be submitted to the president and the Congress by May 5, 2002.", "In summary, the District of Columbia Superior Court has made progress in planning the transition of its Family Division to a Family Court, but some challenges remain. The Superior Court\u2019s transition plan addresses most, but not all, of the required elements outlined in the act. Significantly, the completion of the transition hinges on timely completion of a complex series of interdependent plans intended to obtain and renovate physical space to house the court and its functions. For example, the plan explains how the abuse and neglect cases currently being heard by judges in other divisions of the Superior Court will be closed or transferred to the Family Court; however, the plan states that the complete transfer of these cases can only occur if additional judges and magistrates are hired, trained, and housed in appropriate space. All required space may not be available, as currently planned, to support the additional judges the Family Court needs to perform its work in accordance with the act, making it uncertain as to when the court can fully complete its transition. Finally, the development and application of the District of Columbia Courts\u2019 Integrated Justice Information System (IJIS) will be critical for the Family Court to be able to operate effectively, evaluate its performance, and meet its judicial goals in the context of the changes mandated by the Family Court Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia Family Court Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-114) was enacted on January 8, 2002.

These judges must meet certain qualifications, such as having training or expertise in family law, certifying to the chief judge of the Superior Court that he or she intends to serve the full term of service and that he or she will participate in the ongoing training programs conducted for judges of the Family Court. The act also allows the court to hire and use magistrates to hear family court cases. Magistrates must also meet certain qualifications, such as holding U.S. citizenship, being an active member of the D.C. Bar, and having not fewer than 3 years of training or experience in the practice of family law as a lawyer or judicial officer. The act further states that the chief judge shall appoint individuals to serve as magistrates not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of the act. The magistrates hired under this expedited appointment process are to assist in implementing the transition plan, and in particular, assist with the transition or disposal of child abuse and neglect proceedings not currently assigned to judges in the Family Court.", "The Superior Court submitted its transition plan on April 5, 2002.

Volume II contains information on the development of IJIS and its planned applications. Volume III addresses the physical space the court needs to house and operate the Family Court.", "Courts interact with various organizations and operate in the context of many different programmatic requirements. In the District of Columbia, the Family Court frequently interacts with the child welfare agency\u2014the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA)\u2014a key organization responsible for helping children obtain permanent homes. CFSA must comply with federal laws and other requirements, including the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), which placed new responsibilities on child welfare agencies nationwide. ASFA introduced new time periods for moving children who have been removed from their homes to permanent home arrangements and penalties for noncompliance. For example, the act requires states to hold a permanency planning hearing not later than 12 months after the child is considered to have entered foster care.

According to the plan, the court has asked each Superior Court judge to review his or her caseload to identify those cases that meet the criteria established by the court for transferring or not transferring cases. Cases identified for transfer include those in which (1) the child is 18 years of age and older, the case is being monitored primarily for the delivery of services, and no recent allegations of abuse or neglect exist; and (2) the child is committed to the child welfare agency and is placed with a relative in a kinship care program. Cases that the court believes may not be candidates for transfer by June 2002 include those with respect to which the judge believes transferring the case would delay permanency. The court expects that older cases will first be reviewed for possible closure and expects to transfer the entire abuse and neglect caseloads of several judges serving in other divisions of the Superior Court to the Family Court. Using the established criteria to review cases, the court estimates that 1,500 cases could be candidates for immediate transfer.", "The act also requires the court to estimate the number of cases that cannot be transferred into the Family Court in the timeframes specified. The plan provides no estimate because the court\u2019s proposed transfer process assumes all cases will be closed or transferred, based on the outlined criteria. However, the plan states that the full transfer of all cases is partially contingent on hiring three new judges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Transition Plan Describes The Family Court\u2019s Approach to Managing Its Cases, But The Court Could Consider Additional Approaches to Assessing Implementation", "paragraphs": ["The transition plan identifies the way in which the Family Court will implement the one family/one judge approach and improve its case management practices; however, the evaluation measures developed to assess the court\u2019s progress in reforming its operations could include additional measures that reflect outcomes for children. The plan indicates that the Family Court will implement the one family/one judge approach by assigning all cases involving the same family to one judicial team\u2014 comprised of a Family Court judge and a magistrate. This assignment will begin with the initial hearing by the magistrate on the team and continue throughout the life of the case. Juvenile and family court experts indicated that this team approach is realistic and a good model of judicial collaboration. One expert said that such an approach provides for continuity if either team member is absent. Another expert said that, given the volume of cases that must be heard, the team approach can ease the burden on judicial resources by permitting the magistrate to make recommendations and decisions, thereby allowing the Family Court judge time to schedule and hear trials and other proceedings more quickly. Court experts also praised the proposed staggered terms for judicial officials\u2014newly-hired judges, magistrates, and judges who are already serving on the Superior Court will be appointed to the Family Court for varying numbers of years\u2014which can provide continuity while recognizing the need to rotate among divisions in the Superior Court.", "In addition, the plan identifies actions the court plans to take to improve case management. First, the Family Court plans to centralize intake. According to the plan, a central office will encompass all the functions that various clerks\u2019 offices\u2014such as juvenile, domestic relations, paternity and support, and mental health\u2014in the Family Court currently carry out. As part of centralized intake, case coordinators will identify any related cases that may exist in the Family Court. To do this, the coordinator will ensure that a new \u201cIntake/Cross Reference Form\u201d will be completed by various parties to a case and also check the 18 current computer systems serving the Family Court. Second, the court plans to use alternative dispute resolution to resolve cases more quickly and expand initial hearings to address many of the issues that the court previously handled later in the life of the case. Last, the plan states that the Family Court will provide all affected parties speedy notice of court proceedings and implement strict policies for the handling of cases\u2014such as those for granting continuances\u2014although it does not indicate who is responsible for developing the policies or the status of their development.", "The plan states that the court will conduct evaluations to assess whether components of the Family Court were implemented as planned and whether modifications are necessary; the court could consider using additional measures to focus on outcomes for children. For example, evaluation measures listed in the plan are oriented more toward the court\u2019s processes, such as whether hearings are held on time, than on outcomes. According to a court expert, measures must also account for outcomes the court achieves for children. Measures could include the number of finalized adoptions that did not disrupt, reunifications that do not fail, children who remain safe and are not abused again while under court jurisdiction or in foster care, and the proportion of children who successfully achieve permanency. In addition, the court will need to determine how it will gather the data necessary to measure each team\u2019s progress in ensuring such outcomes or in meeting the requirements of ASFA, and the court has not yet established a baseline from which to judge its performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Transition Plan Addresses the Number and Roles of Judicial Officers, But Other Human Capital Issues Remain Unclear", "paragraphs": ["The transition plan states that the court has determined that 15 judges are needed to carry out the duties of the court and that 12 judges have volunteered to serve on the court, but does not address recruitment and the nomination of the three additional judges.

The plan, however, does not include a request that the Judicial Nomination Commission recruit and the president nominate the additional three individuals to serve on the Superior Court, as required by the Family Court Act.", "The Superior Court does not provide in the plan its determination of the number of nonjudicial staff needed. The court acknowledges that while it budgeted for a certain number of nonjudicial personnel based on current operating practices, determining the number of different types of personnel needed to operate the Family Court effectively is pending completion of a staffing study.", "Furthermore, the plan does not address the qualifications of the 12 judges who volunteered for the court. Although the plan states that these judges have agreed to serve full terms of service, according to the act, the chief judge of the Superior Court may not assign an individual to serve on the Family Court unless the individual also has training or expertise in family law and certifies that he or she will participate in the ongoing training programs conducted for judges of the Family Court.", "The transition plan describes the duties of judges assigned to the Family Court, as required by the act. Specifically, the plan describes the roles of the designated presiding judge, the deputy presiding judge, and the magistrates. The plan states that the presiding and deputy presiding judges will handle the administrative functions of the Family Court, ensure the implementation of the alternative dispute resolution projects, oversee grant-funded projects, and serve as back-up judges to all Family Court judges. These judges will also have a post-disposition abuse and neglect caseload of more than 80 cases and will continue to consult and coordinate with other organizations (such as the child welfare agency), primarily by serving on 19 committees. One court expert has observed that the list of committees to which the judges are assigned seems overwhelming and added that strong leadership by the judges could result in the consolidation of some of the committees\u2019 efforts.", "The plan also describes the duties of the magistrates, but does not provide all the information required by the act. Magistrates will be responsible for initial hearings in new child abuse and neglect cases, and the resolution of cases assigned to them by the Family Court judge to whose team they are assigned. They will also be assigned initial hearings in juvenile cases, noncomplex abuse and neglect trials, and the subsequent review and permanency hearings, as well as a variety of other matters related to domestic violence, paternity and support, mental competency, and other domestic relations cases. As noted previously, one court expert said that the proposed use of the magistrates would ease the burden on judicial resources by permitting these magistrates to make recommendations and decisions. However, although specifically required by the act, the transition plan does not state how the court determined the number of magistrates to be hired under the expedited process. In addition, while the act outlines the required qualifications of magistrates, it does not specifically require a discussion of qualifications of the newly hired magistrates in the transition plan. As a result, none was provided and whether these magistrates meet the qualifications outlined in the act is unknown.", "A discussion of how the court will provide initial and ongoing training for its judicial and nonjudicial staff is also not required by the act, although the court does include relevant information about training. For example, the plan states that the Family Court will develop and implement a quarterly training program for Family Court judges, magistrates, and staff covering a variety of topics and that it will promote and encourage participation in cross-training. In addition, the plan states new judges and magistrates will participate in a 2 to 3 week intensive training program, although it does not provide details on the content of such training for the five magistrates hired under the expedited process, even though they were scheduled to begin working at the court on April 8, 2002. One court expert said that a standard curriculum for all court-related staff and judicial officers should be developed and that judges should have manuals available outlining procedures for all categories of cases. In a September 2000 report on human capital, we said that an explicit link between the organization\u2019s training offerings and curricula and the competencies identified by the organization for mission accomplishment is essential.Likewise, organizations should make fact-based determinations of the impact of its training and development programs to provide feedback for continuous improvement and ensure that these programs improve performance and help achieve organizational results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Obtaining The Necessary Physical Space and in Developing a New Information System Could Impede Family Court Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Two factors are critical to fully transitioning to the Family Court in a timely and effective manner: obtaining and renovating appropriate space for all new Family Court personnel and the development and installation of a new automated information system, currently planned as part of the D.C.

These include a very aggressive implementation schedule and a design that makes each part of the plan interdependent with other parts of the plan. The transition plan further states that the desired results cannot be reached if each plan increment does not take place in a timely fashion. For example, obtaining and renovating the almost 30,000 occupiable square feet of new court space needed requires a complex series of interrelated steps\u2014from moving current tenants in some buildings to temporary space, to renovating the John Marshall level of the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse by July 2003.", "The Family Court of the Superior Court is currently housed in the H.

The court estimates that accommodating these judges, magistrates, and staff requires an additional 29,700 occupiable square feet, plus an undetermined amount for security and other amenities. Obtaining this space will require nonrelated D.C. Courts entities to vacate space to allow renovations, as well as require tenants in other buildings to move to house the staff who have been displaced.", "The plan calls for renovations under tight deadlines and all required space may not be available, as currently planned, to support the additional judges the Family Court needs to perform its work in accordance with the act, making it uncertain as to when the court can fully complete its transition.

A disciplined software development and acquisition effort maximizes the likelihood of achieving the intended results (performance) on schedule using available resources (costs).", "The requirements contained in a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) lacked the necessary specificity to ensure that any defects in these requirements had been reduced to acceptable levels and that the system would meet its users\u2019 needs. Studies have shown that problems associated with requirements definition are key factors in software projects that do not meet their cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "The requirements contained in the D.C. Courts\u2019 draft RFP did not directly relate to industry standards. As a result, inadequate information was available for prospective vendors and others to readily map systems built upon these standards to the needs of the D.C.

Courts officials, who generally concurred with our findings and stated their commitment to only go forward with the project when the necessary actions had been taken to reduce the risks to acceptable levels. In that report, we made several recommendations designed to reduce the risks associated with this effort to acceptable levels. In April 2002, we met with D.C. Courts officials to discuss the actions taken on our recommendations and found that significant actions have been initiated that, if properly implemented, will help reduce the risks associated with this effort. For example, D.C. Courts is   beginning the work to provide the needed specificity for its system requirements. This includes soliciting requirements from the users and ensuring that the requirements are properly sourced (e.g., traced back to their origin). According to D.C. Courts officials, this work has identified significant deficiencies in the original requirements that we discussed in our February 2002 report. issuing a Request for Information to obtain additional information on commercial products that should be considered by the D.C. Courts during its acquisition efforts. This helps the requirements management process by identifying requirements that are not supported by commercial products so that the courts can reevaluate whether it needs to (1) keep the requirement or revise it to be in greater conformance with industry practices or (2) undertake a development effort to achieve the needed capability.   developing a systems engineering life-cycle process for managing the D.C.

We will review the plan once it is made available to us. Although they recognize that maintaining two systems concurrently is expensive and causes additional resource needs, such as additional staff and training for them, these officials believe that they are needed to mitigate the risk associated with any delays in system implementation.", "Although these are positive steps forward, D.C. Courts still faces many challenges in its efforts to develop an IJIS system that will meet its needs and fulfill the goals established by the act. Examples of these include: Ensuring that the systems interfacing with IJIS do not become the weak link: The act calls for effectively interfacing information technology systems operated by the District government with IJIS. According to D.C. Courts officials, at least 14 District systems will need to interface with IJIS. However, several of our reviews have noted problems in the District\u2019s ability to develop, acquire, and implement new systems. The District\u2019s difficulties in effectively managing its information technology investments could lead to adverse impacts on the IJIS system. For example, the interface systems may not be able to provide the quality of data necessary to fully utilize IJIS\u2019s capabilities or provide the necessary data to support IJIS\u2019s needs. The D.C. Courts will need to ensure that adequate controls and processes have been implemented to mitigate the potential impacts associated with these risks.", "Effectively implementing the disciplined processes necessary to reduce the risks associated with IJIS to acceptable levels: The key to having a disciplined effort is to have disciplined processes in multiple areas. This is a complex task and will require the D.C. Courts to maintain its management commitment to implementing the necessary processes. In our February 2002 report, we highlighted several processes, such as requirements management, risk management, and testing that appeared critical to the IJIS effort.", "Ensuring that the requirements used to acquire IJIS contain the necessary specificity to reduce requirement related defects to acceptable levels: Although D.C. Courts officials have said that they are adopting a requirements management process that will address the concerns expressed in our February 2002 report, maintaining such a process will require management commitment and discipline.", "Court experts report that effective technological support is critical to effective family court case management. One expert said that minimal system functionality should include the identification of parties and their relationships; the tracking of case processing events through on-line inquiry; the generation of orders, forms, summons, and notices; and statistical reports. The State Justice Institute\u2019s report on how courts are coordinating family cases states that automated information systems, programmed to inform a court system of a family\u2019s prior cases, are a vital ingredient of case coordination efforts. The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges echoes these findings by stating that effective management systems (1) have standard procedures for collecting data; (2) collect data about individual cases, aggregate caseload by judge, and the systemwide caseload; (3) assign an individual the responsibility of monitoring case processing; and (4) are user-friendly. While anticipating technological enhancements through IJIS, Superior Court officials stated that the current information systems do not have the functionality required to implement the Family Court\u2019s one family/one judge case management principle.", "Ensuring that users receive adequate training: As with any new system, adequately training the users is critical to its success. As we reported in April 2001, one problem that hindered the implementation of the District\u2019s financial management system was its difficulty in adequately training the users.", "Avoiding a schedule-driven effort: According to D.C. Courts officials, the act establishes ambitious timeframes to convert to a family court. Although schedules are important, it is critical that the D.C. Courts follows an event-driven acquisition and development program rather than adopting a schedule-driven approach. Organizations that are schedule- driven tend to cut out or inadequately complete activities such as business process reengineering and requirements analysis. These tasks are frequently not considered \u201cimportant\u201d since many people view \u201cgetting the application in the hands of the user\u201d as one of the more productive activities. However, the results of this approach are very predictable. Projects that do not perform planning and requirements functions well typically have to redo that work later.
