Of the 25 areas on GAO's governmentwide \"high risk\" list, 6 are DOD program areas, and the department shares responsibility for 3 other high-risk areas that are governmentwide in scope. Key financial management weaknesses include the lack of effective and efficient asset management and accountability; unreliable estimates of environmental and disposal liabilities; lack of accurate budget and cost information; nonintegrated and proliferating financial management systems; and fundamental flaws in DOD's overall control environment. GAO has identified four underlying causes for DOD's inability to resolve its long-standing financial management problems: (1) a lack of sustained top-level leadership and management accountability for correcting problems; (2) deeply embedded cultural resistance to change, including military service parochialism and stovepiped operations; (3) a lack of results-oriented goals and performance measures and monitoring; and (4) inadequate incentives for seeking change. The following are elements that GAO has identified as key to a successful approach to financial management and business process reform: (1) addressing financial management challenges as part of a comprehensive, integrated, DOD-wide business reform; (2) providing for sustained leadership by the Secretary of Defense and resource control to implement needed financial management reforms; (3) establishing clear lines of responsibility, authority, and accountability for such reform tied to the Secretary; (4) incorporating results-oriented performance measures and monitoring tied to financial management reforms; (5) providing appropriate incentives or consequences for action or inaction; (6) establishing and implementing an enterprise architecture to guide and direct financial management modernization investments; and (7) ensuring effective executive and congressional oversight and monitoring. DOD has taken positive steps in many of these key areas. For example, the Secretary of Defense has included improving DOD's financial management as one of his top 10 priorities, and DOD has already taken a number of actions under its Business Transformation Program, including its efforts to develop an enterprise architecture to guide operational and technological changes. However, these are beginning steps and formidable challenges remain in each of the key reform areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the status of financial management  and business process reform efforts at the Department of Defense (DOD).    DOD faces financial and related management problems that are pervasive,  complex, long standing, and deeply rooted in virtually all business  operations throughout the department.  These problems have impeded the  department\u2019s ability to provide complete, reliable, and timely business  operations information to the Congress, DOD managers, and other decision  makers.  In addition, DOD\u2019s financial management weaknesses have  resulted in the failure of the department, its military services, and its major  components from passing the test of an independent financial audit and are  a significant obstacle to achieving an unqualified opinion on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  Overhauling DOD\u2019s  financial management represents a major challenge that goes far beyond  financial accounting to the very fiber of the department\u2019s range of business  operations and management culture.  Of the 25 areas on GAO\u2019s  governmentwide \u201chigh risk\u201d list, 6 are DOD program areas, and the  department shares responsibility for 3 other high-risk areas that are  government wide in scope.  Central to effectively addressing DOD\u2019s  financial management problems will be understanding that these 9 areas  are interrelated and cannot be addressed in an isolated, stovepiped, or  piecemeal fashion. While Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld has initiated a  program to transform DOD\u2019s business processes, including establishing a  new management structure to oversee reform efforts, DOD has not yet  developed an overarching plan tying key reform efforts together in an  integrated program.", "DOD\u2019s size, structure, and diversity of activities increase the difficulty and  complexity of reform efforts.  For example, DOD is the nation\u2019s largest  employer, with   1.4 million men and women currently on active duty,  1.2 million serving in the Reserve and Guard components, and   675,000 civilians.", "DOD operates more than 600,000 individual buildings and structures  located at more than 6,000 different locations and using more than 30  million acres.  For fiscal year 2002, DOD expended approximately $371  billion to operate and maintain about 250,000 vehicles, over 15,000 aircraft,  more than 1,000 oceangoing vessels, and some 550 public utility systems.", "DOD\u2019s financial management problems are the result of long-standing  deficiencies related to its systems, processes, and people.  Therefore, to be  successful, reform efforts will need to address all three factors.  In  recognition of the far-reaching nature of DOD\u2019s financial management  problems, on September 10, 2001, Secretary Rumsfeld announced a broad,  top-priority initiative intended to \u201ctransform the way the department works  and what it works on.\u201d  This new broad-based business transformation  initiative, led by DOD\u2019s Senior Executive Council and the Business  Initiative Council, incorporates a number of defense reform initiatives  begun under previous administrations but also encompasses additional  fundamental business reform proposals.  In announcing his initiative,  Secretary Rumsfeld recognized that transformation would be difficult and  expected that needed changes would take 8 or more years to complete.", "As we have seen again in Iraq, the excellence of our military forces is  unparalleled.  This same level of excellence is not yet evident in the  department\u2019s financial management and other business areas.  This is  particularly problematic because effective financial and related  management operations are critical to achieving the department\u2019s mission  in a reasonably economical, efficient, and effective manner and to  providing reliable, timely financial information on a routine basis to  support management decision making at all levels throughout DOD.   Transforming DOD\u2019s business operations would free up resources that  could be used to enhance readiness, improve the quality of life for our  troops and their families, and reduce the gap between \u201cwants\u201d and  available funding in connection with major weapon systems.   In fact,  Secretary Rumsfeld has estimated that successful business process reform  could save DOD 5 percent of its budget or $20 billion a year.", "Today, I will focus mainly on the key actions necessary to correct DOD\u2019s  financial management problems and the progress DOD is making toward  business process reform.  But first, I want to provide you with an overview  of the long-standing financial management weaknesses facing DOD\u2014as  highlighted by the results of audit work performed over the past few  years\u2014and a summary of the underlying causes of DOD\u2019s financial  management challenges.

As discussed in the  results of our audit of the fiscal year 2002 Financial Statements of the U.S.  Government, DOD\u2019s financial management deficiencies, taken together,  continue to represent one of the largest obstacles to achieving an  unqualified opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial  statements.  To date, none of the military services or major DOD  components has passed the test of an independent financial audit because  of pervasive weaknesses in financial management systems, processes, and  controls.  These weaknesses not only hamper the department\u2019s ability to  produce timely and accurate financial management information but also  impact mission performance and make mission costs unnecessarily high.   Ineffective asset accountability and the lack of effective controls continue  to adversely affect visibility over its estimated $1 trillion investment in  inventories and property, plant, and equipment (including weapon systems  and other property).  Such information is key to meeting military objectives  and readiness goals. Further, unreliable cost and budget information  related to a reported $700 billion of liabilities, particularly $59 billion of  reported environmental liabilities, and about $380 billion of reported costs  negatively affects DOD\u2019s ability to effectively project funding needs,  maintain adequate funds control, reduce costs, and measure performance.   DOD has invested, and continues to invest, significant resources\u2014in terms  of dollars, time, and people\u2014in its systems without demonstrated  improvement in its business operations and adequate management and  oversight, thereby continuing to perpetuate a proliferation of systems that  do not adequately address the department\u2019s needs.  Finally, DOD\u2019s weak  overall control environment has left the department vulnerable to fraud,  waste, and abuse.  As the results of the department\u2019s fiscal year 2002  financial audit and other audit work demonstrate, DOD continues to  confront serious weaknesses in these areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Asset Management and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Of the $776 billion of inventory and related property and general property,  plant, and equipment (PP&E) assets reported by federal entities for fiscal  year 2002, DOD is responsible for about half\u2014approximately $146 billion in  inventory and related property and $226 billion of general PP&E,  comprised of $162 billion in real property (land, buildings, facilities, capital  leases, and improvements to those assets); $37 billion in personal property  (such as vehicles, equipment, telecommunications systems, computers,  and software); and $27 billion in construction-in-progress, the largest  amount of which belongs to the Corps of Engineers. While DOD is not  presently required to report dollar values for its weapons systems and  support PP&E used in the performance of military missions, such reporting  will be required beginning October 1, 2002.  The amount subject to  reporting will likely be significant considering that DOD has estimated an  acquisition cost of over $64 billion for only three of its major weapons  systems acquisition programs.", "Effective and efficient asset management and accountability is crucial to  DOD\u2019s defense of our national interests.  While the department has  undertaken several initiatives over the years to improve its asset  management and accountability systems, processes, and controls, material  weaknesses persist.  As a result, DOD lacks reliable information about the  quantity, location, condition, and value of inventory and property\u2014 including military equipment\u2014critical to the department\u2019s ability to  effectively meet military objectives and readiness goals. Ineffective and  inefficient asset management and accountability leave the department  vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Over the past 2 years, the DOD  Inspector General (IG) and we have issued numerous reports detailing  problems with asset management and accountability, including the  following examples.", "DOD and its military services and units did not know how many Joint  Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST)\u2014commonly  referred to as \u201cchem-bio suits\u201d\u2014 they had, their condition, and where  they were located.  This lack of visibility was due to several factors,  including the use of nonstandard, nonintegrated, stovepiped systems.   Nonintegrated systems are unable to share data across business  applications and therefore, multiple manual data entries must be made  into numerous stand-alone systems, which result in errors, add  significantly to administrative costs, and generally exacerbate asset  visibility problems.  The methods used to control and maintain visibility  over JSLIST ranged from stand-alone automated systems, to  spreadsheet applications, to pen and paper, to nothing at all.  For  JSLIST, the result was that DOD was excessing and selling these suits on  the Internet for pennies on the dollar, while at the same time procuring  hundreds of thousands of new garments annually.  Similarly, a few years  ago, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) had problems identifying and  removing from its inventory defective Battle Dress Overgarments  (BDO)\u2014the JSLIST predecessor.  As a result, some of the defective suits  were shipped to U.S. forces in high-threat areas.  In a June 2000  testimony, the DOD IG pointed out that a physical count of BDOs could  not locate 420,000 protective suits that were recorded in DLA\u2019s  accountability database.", "DOD lacked effective processes and controls to ensure that easily  pilferable and sensitive items were properly recorded and safeguarded.    For example, we found that the military services failed to record all of  the pilferable and sensitive items acquired through purchase card  transactions, including the Navy\u2019s failure to record a $757,000 purchase  comprised of 430 computers, 213 flat panel monitors, and other  computer hardware and software.  The Navy was unable to provide us  with evidence confirming the location of 187 of those computers and 87  of the flat panel monitors.  Similarly, in our recent review of property  controls at three military treatment facilities, we found that items such  as a laptop computer, a Sony monitor, and a sterilizer were not recorded  in the property records.  We also found that numerous recorded items  could not be located.  Most of these were lower priced (under $5,000) or  pilferable items such as a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone,  computer monitors, color printers, a handheld radio, and various pieces  of medical equipment such as a stretcher, electric beds, and intravenous  pumps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental and Disposal Liabilities", "paragraphs": ["Under federal, state, and international law, DOD faces a major funding  requirement associated with environmental cleanup and disposal resulting  from prior and current operations and from the production of weapons  systems.  In its fiscal year 2002 financial statements, DOD reported an  estimated liability of $59 billion to manage and clean up or contain a  diverse population of environmental contamination comprised of   $22 billion for closed and open sites where past and current waste  disposal practices, leaks, spills, and other activities have created a risk  to public health or the environment;  $14 billion for closed, transferring, and active military ranges where  contamination and unexploded ordnance create environmental hazards;  and   $23 billion for cleanup, demilitarization, and disposal of nuclear and  non-nuclear weapons systems, chemical weapons, and munitions.", "DOD\u2019s reported cost represents the current value of estimated future cash  outlays that will need to be paid from appropriations; therefore, the  Congress needs reliable information in order to plan how much and when  to provide funding for cleanup activities.  In past years, we and the DOD IG  have repeatedly reported that the environmental liability amounts  presented in DOD\u2019s financial statements were not reliable because the  department did not have (1) sufficient guidance for identifying and  categorizing cleanup activities whose costs must be included in the liability  calculation, (2) complete inventories of the sites and weapons systems that  will require cleanup or containment, and (3) valid cost estimating models  that produce consistent and supportable liability estimates. These  deficiencies were not systems related but rather resulted from inadequate  policies and processes and a lack of leadership.", "We have also issued individual reports on several environmental cleanup  categories, including training ranges and on-going operations.   In those  reports, we specifically cite weaknesses related to DOD\u2019s lack of complete  site inventories, which means that the department\u2019s reported liability  amount is likely understated.  In line with our findings, the Air Force has  recently confirmed that it is investigating possible radioactive waste buried  at more than 80 former and current air bases around the country.   According to the Air Force, it lost track of the waste burial sites because of  poor record keeping and is now trying to identify and inspect the lands for  safety concerns.  Costs for cleaning up these sites are not currently  included in the Air Force\u2019s reported liability amounts.  In addition,  incomplete identification of cleanup sites on installations that are currently  being used by the military could have negative consequences for future  base reutilization, alignment, and closure decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget and Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s appropriation for fiscal year 2002 represented 18 percent of the total  U.S. budget and 48 percent of discretionary funds.

The magnitude of the dollars and number of transactions  involved makes it imperative that DOD maintain accurate fund balances  and properly account for costs; however, DOD financial management  systems and processes continue to be significant impediments to reporting  complete and accurate information with respect to budgetary and  disbursement activities.", "Weaknesses in DOD\u2019s accounting for its funds include (1) the inability to  reconcile its balances to Treasury\u2019s, a process similar in concept to  individuals reconciling their checkbooks with their bank statements,   (2) payment recording errors, including disbursements that are not  properly matched to specific obligations recorded in the department\u2019s  records, and (3) limited ability to track the use of funds appropriated for  contingency purposes. For example,  For fiscal year 2002, we found that DOD had at least $7.5 billion in  unexplained differences between Treasury and DOD fund activity  records.  Many of these differences represent disbursements made and  reported to Treasury that had not yet been properly matched to  obligations and recorded in DOD accounting records.  In addition to  these unreconciled amounts, DOD identified and reported an additional  $3.6 billion in payment recording errors.  These include disbursements  that DOD has specifically identified as containing erroneous or missing  information and that cannot be properly recorded and charged against  the correct, valid fund account.  DOD records many of these payment  problems in suspense accounts and made $1.6 billion in unsupported  adjustments to its fund balances at the end of fiscal year 2002 to account  for a portion of these payment recording errors.  These adjustments did  not resolve the related errors.", "In June 2001, we reported that DOD\u2019s financial systems could not  adequately track and report on whether the $1.1 billion in earmarked  funds that the Congress provided to DOD for spare parts and associated  logistical support were actually used for their intended purpose.  The  vast majority of the funds\u201492 percent\u2014were transferred to the military  services operation and maintenance accounts.  Once transferred, the  department could not separately track the use of the funds.  As a result,  DOD lost its ability to assure the Congress that the funds it received for  spare parts purchases were used for, and only for, the designated  purpose.", "In April 2003, we reported that DOD was not able to separately track  Emergency Response Funds provided under appropriations in fiscal  years 2002 and 2003 ($20.5 billion).  These funds were commingled in  DOD\u2019s regular appropriations accounts with funds appropriated for  other purposes.  Because DOD\u2019s accounting system only captures data  on total obligations and does not distinguish among original sources of  funds, DOD is not able to identify those obligations that are funded from  emergency response funds.", "In December 2000, we reported that our review of DOD functions that  were studied over the past 5 years for potential outsourcing under OMB  Circular A-76 showed that while DOD reported that savings had  occurred as a result of these studies, we could not determine the precise  amount of any such savings because the department lacked actual cost  data.  Further, in March 2002, we testified that while significant savings  were being achieved, it has been difficult to determine the magnitude of  those savings.", "DOD\u2019s continuing inability to capture and report the full cost of its  programs represents one of the most significant impediments facing the  department.  DOD does not have the systems and processes in place to  capture the required cost information from the hundreds of millions of  transactions it processes each year.  Lacking complete and accurate overall  life-cycle cost information for weapon systems impairs DOD\u2019s and  congressional decision makers\u2019 ability to make fully informed judgments  about which weapons, or how many, to buy.  DOD has acknowledged that  the lack of a cost accounting system is its largest impediment to controlling  and managing weapon systems costs.", "An April 2001 report on the results of an independent study of DOD\u2019s  financial operations commissioned by the Secretary of Defense concluded  that DOD lacked the ability to routinely generate cost-based metrics to link  financial management to DOD\u2019s goals.  For example, DOD\u2019s reporting  under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA)  often did not address the cost-based efficiency aspect of performance,  making it difficult for DOD to fully assess the efficiency of its performance.   DOD\u2019s most recent performance plan (fiscal year 2001) included 45  unclassified metrics but only a few of those contained efficiency measures  based on costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Management Systems", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2003, DOD estimated that it would spend approximately $18  billion to operate, maintain, and develop business systems.  Of that  amount, $5.2 billion relates directly to business systems and the remaining  $12.8 billion relates to the infrastructure that supports the systems.  While  funding system development and modernization activities is crucial, it is  only part of the solution needed to improve DOD\u2019s current business  systems and operating environment.  Key ingredients to successful systems  development and modernization include effective management and  oversight of ongoing and planned investments.", "However, in February 2003, we reported that DOD had yet to establish the  necessary departmental investment governance structure and process  controls needed to adequately align ongoing investments with its  architectural goals and direction.  An effective governance structure should  include  a hierarchy of investment review boards composed of representatives  from across the department who are assigned investment selection and  control responsibilities based on project threshold criteria;  a standard set of investment review and decision-making criteria for use  by all boards, including criteria to ensure compliance and consistency  with its newly developed enterprise architecture or \u201cblueprint for  reform\u201d; and  a specified, near term date by which ongoing investments have to be  subject to this standard investment review process, and by which  decisions should be made as to whether to proceed with each  investment.", "DOD\u2019s lack of effective oversight and process controls over IT investments  perpetuates the existence of an incompatible, duplicative, and overly costly  systems environment, which undermines its ability to optimally support  mission performance.  For example,   In March 2003, we reported that DOD did not effectively manage and  oversee its planned investment of over $1 billion in four Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) systems modernization efforts.  DOD invested approximately $316 million in these projects without first  demonstrating that they would markedly improve the information  needed for decision-making and financial reporting purposes. The DOD  Comptroller terminated one of the four projects we reviewed after an  investment of over $126 million, citing poor program performance and  increasing costs.  Investments in the other three projects continue  despite the absence of the requisite analyses of costs, benefits, and risks  to demonstrate that the projects will produce value commensurate with  the cost being incurred.", "In March 2002, the DOD IG reported that DOD\u2019s Joint Total Asset  Visibility Program (JTAV) system provided incomplete asset visibility to  military commanders in chief (CINCs) and joint task force  commanders.  Required capabilities were not developed before the  program was placed into service, including asset and personnel visibility  for the warfighter, accurate and timely source data, and data links to  critical data in other DOD systems. As a result, CINCs and joint task  force commanders did not have access, through the program, to all  required data on the location, movement, status, and identity of military  units, personnel, equipment, and supplies as intended.", "In June 2002, DOD reported that shortcomings in existing  nonintegrated personnel and pay systems caused delays in military  payroll payments (some as much as 6 or more months after the event  occurred) and resulted in errors (both under- and overpayments).

For example, in 1989,  DOD began the Corporate Information Management (CIM) initiative, which  was expected to save billions of dollars by streamlining operations and  implementing standard information systems across the department to  support common business operations.  DOD intended CIM to reform all of  its functional areas\u2014including finance, procurement, material  management, and human resources\u2014through the consolidation,  standardization, and integration of its numerous, duplicative information  systems.  DOD spent billions of dollars on this initiative with little sound  analytical justification.  Rather than relying on a rigorous decision-making  process for information technology investments, as used in leading private  and public organizations we studied, DOD made systems decisions without  (1) appropriately analyzing cost, benefits, and technical risks,   (2) establishing realistic project schedules, or (3) considering how business  process improvements could affect information technology investments.   For one effort alone, DOD spent about $700 million trying to develop and  implement a single system for the material management business area\u2014 but this effort proved unsuccessful.  After 8 years and about $20 billion in  expenditures, DOD abandoned the CIM initiative.

We have continued to  highlight in various testimonies what we believe are the underlying reasons  for the department\u2019s inability to fundamentally reform its business  operations.  There are four underlying causes:  a lack of sustained top-level leadership and management accountability   deeply embedded cultural resistance to change, including military  service parochialism and stovepiped operations;  a lack of results-oriented goals and performance measures and   inadequate incentives for seeking change."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Leadership and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Historically, DOD has not routinely assigned accountability for  performance to specific organizations or individuals who have sufficient  authority to accomplish desired goals.  For example, under the Chief  Financial Officers Act (CFO) of 1990, it is the responsibility of the agency  CFO to establish the mission and vision for the agency\u2019s future financial  management and to direct, manage, and provide oversight of financial  management operations.  However, at DOD, the Comptroller\u2014who is by  statute the department\u2019s CFO\u2014has direct responsibility for only an  estimated 20 percent of the data relied on to carry out the department\u2019s  financial management operations.  The other 80 percent comes from DOD\u2019s  other business operations.  In addition, DOD\u2019s past experience has  suggested that top management has not had a proactive, consistent, and  continuing role in building capacity, integrating daily operations for  achieving performance goals, and creating incentives.  Major improvement  initiatives must have the direct, active support and involvement of the  Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense to ensure that daily activities  throughout the department remain focused on achieving shared,  agencywide outcomes and success.  Furthermore, sustaining top  management commitment to performance goals is a particular challenge  for DOD because the average 1.7-year tenure of the department\u2019s top  political appointees has served to hinder long-term planning and follow- through.  Based on our survey of best practices of world-class financial  management organizations, strong executive leadership is essential to   (1) making financial management an entitywide priority, (2) redefining the  role of finance, (3) providing meaningful information to decision makers,  and (4) building a team of people that delivers results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cultural Resistance and Parochialism", "paragraphs": ["Cultural resistance to change, military service parochialism, and  stovepiped operations have also played a significant role in impeding  previous attempts to implement broad-based management reforms at DOD.

DOD\u2019s stovepiped approach is  most evident in its current financial management systems environment,  which DOD recently estimated to include approximately 2,300 systems and  system development projects\u2014many of which were developed in  piecemeal fashion and evolved to accommodate different organizations,  each with its own policies and procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unclear Goals and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["Lack of clear, linked goals and performance measures has handicapped  DOD\u2019s past reform efforts.

Traditionally, DOD has focused on  justifying its need for more funding rather than on the outcomes its  programs have produced.
