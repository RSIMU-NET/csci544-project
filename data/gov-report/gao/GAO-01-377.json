You expressed concerns about the extent to which women and minorities achieve SES status. SES members are critical to providing the strategic leadership needed to effectively execute agency missions and ensure accountability to the American people in the administration and operation of federal programs. Having a diverse SES corps can be an organizational strength that contributes to achieving results. Diversity can bring a wider variety of perspectives and approaches to bear on policy development and implementation, strategic planning, problem solving, and decisionmaking. Now that the labor market has become increasingly competitive and the demographics of the public served by the federal government are changing, diversity has evolved from public policy to a business need. A common practice in assessing an organization\u2019s diversity is to analyze the composition of its labor force in comparison with other labor forces. If disparities exist, further examination may be warranted to identify and eliminate any barriers to greater diversity.", "In response to your request, we agreed to provide a descriptive analysis of gender and racial/ethnic diversity in the career SES governmentwide as well as in selected agencies.

We also compared the composition of the career SES to multiple labor forces, because various benchmarks could be used to assess the representation of women and minorities in the career SES.", "As agreed with your offices, we compared the career SES to six labor forces. The labor force in our comparisons that covers the widest range of occupations and work settings is the national civilian labor force (CLF), which includes persons ages 16 and over who are employed or seeking employment but excludes those in the Armed Forces. We selected two other comparative labor forces\u2014a proxy relevant CLF (RCLF), which is that portion of the CLF that corresponds to the SES labor force as closely as possible in terms of occupations and salary levels and general schedule (GS) grade 15 career federal employees. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Justice have advised agencies to compare their labor forces to those in the CLF with the requisite skills and experience to perform the duties of the positions in their agencies. EEOC said it has suggested that agencies look at their relevant feeder groups when assessing the level of representation of women and minorities in the SES or at any particular grade level; and in the case of the SES, it has suggested that agencies look at their GS-14 and GS-15 workforces. When an agency\u2019s positions cannot be precisely matched to those in the CLF, Justice has advised agencies to compare their labor forces to those in other labor forces that have the qualifications to perform the duties of the positions in their agencies\u2014such as comparing their SES with employees in their GS-15 workforce. We recognize that the proxy RCLF we developed is not a perfect benchmark, and EEOC does not endorse our RCLF. However, it was the closest match to the SES that we could identify because data were not available to construct a direct comparison group.", "Of the remaining three labor forces in our comparisons, two of them\u2014all federal executive branch employees and federal executive branch employees in professional and administrative occupations\u2014represent a broader set of skills and experience among career federal employees; one, the U.S. Postal Service career executive corps, is a federal executive labor force that is outside the SES. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is presented on page 5 of this report and in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The SES was established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. As of September 30, 1999, the SES had 6,871 members. The majority (6,205) of the SES members were in the career SES as of that date; the remaining 666 were in the noncareer SES. Career SES members are individuals with civil service status who are appointed competitively to SES positions that are below the top political appointees in the federal executive branch. The noncareer SES members are individuals who receive noncompetitive appointments to SES positions that usually involve advocating, formulating, and directing the programs and policies of the administration.", "The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 also states that the policy of the federal government is to ensure equal employment opportunity in the workforce. To carry out this policy, the act calls for implementation of agency action through a continuing minority recruitment program designed to \u201celiminate underrepresentation of minorities in the various categories of civil service employment.\u201d It further requires that EEOC establish guidelines for use by executive agencies in complying with this statutory requirement. According to EEOC\u2019s October 6, 1987, directive, issued under this provision to aid agencies in their affirmative employment activities, women and minorities are fully represented when their percentage representation in the workforce at an agency equals or exceeds their percentage representation in an RCLF. An RCLF consists of the pool of individuals in the CLF that have the necessary skills and qualifications to perform the duties of the particular job or occupation.", "According to EEOC, it advises agencies to first compare their workforces with established broad occupational categories, such as administrative, technical and clerical, within the CLF. Then, agencies are to compare specific significant occupations within their overall workforce with the same broad CLF occupational categories to identify areas of possible underrepresentation for further analysis. For professional occupations that require advanced degrees and/or licenses, such as engineers, doctors, or attorneys, EEOC advises agencies to compare each of the professional occupations in their agencies with the corresponding occupations in the CLF.", "EEOC also said it advises agencies, in determining whether underrepresentation of minorities exists in the various levels of the workforce, to follow the guidance contained in the Department of Justice\u2019s February 29, 1996, memorandum on affirmative action in federal employment. Among other things, that memorandum gives examples of comparative labor forces that agencies can use to determine whether minority groups are underrepresented in particular jobs. For example, the memorandum states that an agency would determine whether minorities were underrepresented in its workforce by comparing minority representation in the job at issue to the relevant or qualified labor pool in the CLF, rather than to the national CLF. The memorandum also indicates that where the job at issue cannot be precisely matched to a job in the CLF, an agency should use the qualified labor force that most closely matches its qualifications for the job at issue. For example, the memorandum states that an agency would determine whether minorities were underrepresented in its SES workforce by comparing the number of minority GS-15 employees it employs, and others with similar qualifications, to the number of minority SES members it employs.", "Comparisons with other labor forces are an important part of determining what further actions agencies need to take. However, even if women and minorities are not as well represented in the career SES when compared with other selected labor forces, this information alone would not be sufficient evidence to conclude that discrimination had occurred. In addition, it should not be concluded that affirmative employment efforts are no longer needed to further improve the representation of women and minorities in the career SES if the comparisons show they are as well or better represented in the SES as in other selected labor forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assess change in the career SES composition during the 1990s, we analyzed data obtained from OPM\u2019s CPDF on the female and minority makeup of the career SES from fiscal year-end 1990 through 1999. We analyzed the data, by race/ethnicity and gender, to identify trends in the percentages of women and minorities employed in the career SES governmentwide and in each of 24 CFO agencies over the 10-year period. We did not independently verify the CPDF data on the SES for the years we reviewed. However, we reported in 1998 that governmentwide data from the CPDF for the key variables in this study (gender, race/ethnicity, GS-grade, pay plan, occupation, career status, agency, and personnel action) were 97 percent or more accurate.", "For the first part of our second objective, to determine the proportion of women and minorities appointed to the career SES annually over this 10- year period, we obtained and analyzed data from the CPDF for each fiscal year from 1990 through 1999. We excluded career SES appointments that were reinstatements into the career SES and transfers of career SES individuals from one agency to another (about 1 percent combined). For the second part of our second objective, to determine whether career SES appointments reflected the SES pipeline from which most new SES members were generally appointed, we obtained and analyzed data from the CPDF for each of 3 years (1990, 1995, and 1999). The 3 years represented the beginning, middle, and end of our overall review period. We compared the diversity of the career SES appointees with the diversity of the pipeline. Because data were not readily available on who actually applied for SES vacancies and because we could not clearly determine the workforces from which all career SES appointees came, we limited the pipeline analysis to career SES appointments of career GS-15 and equivalent employees from within the appointing agency. Over 90 percent of those appointed to the career SES from within an agency were career GS-15 and equivalent employees the year prior to their appointment and about 83 percent of all career SES appointments were from within an agency. Although we recognized that all GS-15 employees were not in managerial or supervisory positions, we selected the GS-15 workforce and its equivalent as the SES pipeline because we found that 25 percent of the GS-15 workforce appointed to the SES in fiscal year 1999 were not managers or supervisors in fiscal year 1998.", "To look at representation in the career SES compared with other labor forces, we calculated the proportions of women and minorities in the career SES, as of September 30, 1999, and compared the result with similarly calculated proportions of women and minorities in the six labor forces.

An RCLF is the pool of people in the CLF with the requisite skills and experience to perform the duties of the positions in their agencies. Comparing the SES workforce with the entire federal workforce and with the federal workforce in professional and administrative job categories parallels the CLF and RCLF comparisons but uses the federal labor force rather than the civilian workforce outside the federal government.

OPM and EEOC provided us written comments, which we reprinted in appendixes VIII and IX, respectively.", "OPM\u2019s Acting Director said our assessment shows that diversity in the SES is moving in the right direction. He further commented that while our assessment shows improvement in SES diversity and indicates that OPM and agency initiatives in this area have been fruitful, OPM is convinced that continued improvement will require a commitment to reviewing and revising employment practices that foster diversity. OPM cited several initiatives that it believes have made a difference in fostering diversity in the SES. Details of these initiatives can be found in appendix VIII.", "EEOC\u2019s Chairwoman expressed a variety of concerns about certain aspects of our methodology and possible interpretations of the report\u2019s message. She said the SES analysis contained in this report ignores and rejects much of the traditional analysis that EEOC has used to assist agencies in their equal employment opportunity efforts. For example, she said we did not examine the potential barriers that may prevent qualified individuals in the pipeline from moving into the SES. Our objective was not to examine potential barriers that might limit equal access of women and minorities to the SES. As we pointed out in this report, our objective, among others, was to describe how the representation of women and minority employees in the career SES compared with other labor forces. EEOC said it advises agencies to use both the GS-14 and GS-15 labor forces when evaluating the representation of women and any particular minority groups in their SES workforces, because it believes the use of both grades is more appropriate since they are the feeder groups that eventually lead to the SES. However, we believe that our use of the GS-15 labor force only was appropriate because, as we pointed out in this report, we found it to be the primary feeder group into the SES in 1999 as well as in preceding years.", "The Chairwoman also said that of the six labor forces included in this report, EEOC finds our construction and use of an RCLF to be particularly problematic because of the manner in which we constructed it and the lack of recognition in this report of possible artificial barriers and discriminatory factors that may limit the presence of women and minorities in our RCLF. EEOC said it appears that we restricted our RCLF to occupations in the private sector that require particular expertise when the nature of the SES requires more broad-based leadership skills. As we explain in this report, our RCLF consists of the portion of nonfederal civilian workers in 1999 who were in occupations and earning salaries that corresponded as closely as possible to that of career SES employees. Our RCLF occupations include both management and professional/technical occupations because, as we stated in this report, 87 percent of the career SES workforce were in these types of occupations as of September 30, 1999. Furthermore, we are aware that discrimination and lack of opportunity would limit the number of women and minorities in top management positions in any benchmark labor force. We recognized in this report that our RCLF is not a perfect benchmark and that other benchmarks can be used to assess the representation of women and minorities in the SES. We also state that our RCLF was the closest match to the SES we could identify because data were not available to construct a direct comparison group.", "EEOC also opposes the use of representation indexes, which are the ratios that we calculated to present our comparison of the percentage of an employee group in the SES workforce to that same group\u2019s percentage in the benchmark workforce (see table 1 and appendix V of this report). EEOC believes these indexes magnify the impact of imperfections and flaws in the benchmark used and imply conclusions that are misleading and inappropriate. As we explain in this report, we did statistical tests to determine whether the percentage comparisons were dissimilar enough to be unlikely due to imperfections and flaws in the benchmark data. We also noted in this report where differences in the compared percentages are not large enough to provide the confidence that they might not be due to imperfections and flaws in the benchmark data. We provide six different comparisons in this report, and because the results vary for each of them, we have drawn no conclusions. Furthermore, we have cautioned the reader about drawing conclusions from these results.", "The Chairwoman said EEOC is concerned that our use of aggregate data from 24 federal agencies may be statistically inappropriate and therefore result in misleading conclusions. She also said that appendix III of this report indicates that many of the 24 agencies have had problems in achieving diversity. We do not agree that aggregation of the data for the 24 agencies results in misleading conclusions, because we have clearly delineated our governmentwide and agency-specific findings. We provide full disclosure of governmentwide and agencywide numbers throughout this report. We also do not agree with EEOC\u2019s statement that the data in appendix III of this report indicate many agencies have had problems achieving diversity if EEOC\u2019s basis for saying this is the fact that some agencies had a smaller number of women and minorities than other agencies. The data in appendix III simply represent a statistical profile of the agencies\u2019 SES workforces, and one should not conclude from these data alone that agencies with smaller numbers of women and minorities had problems achieving diversity in their SES workforces.", "In conclusion, EEOC stated that a reader of this report might get the impression that whites and men are underrepresented in the career SES and that women and minorities are overrepresented. We do not believe that a reader would get such an impression, as EEOC suggested, given that the results of the comparisons we present in table 1 of this report vary across the six different workforces. For example, the GS-15 workforce comparison, which is the primary feeder group into the SES, shows that whites and men are overrepresented and that women and minorities are underrepresented. Moreover, we caution the reader that none of the comparison labor forces, including our RCLF, can be seen as definitive or conclusive as to whether the level of diversity in the SES is sufficient.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the date of the report.

We did so by obtaining data, by race/ethnicity and gender, on the number of career SES members employed governmentwide and at the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act as of September 30 of each year from 1990 through 1999. These data were obtained from the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF), the database of federal employees maintained by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). We excluded from our study SES members who were either in limited-term or limited emergency appointments; 169 individuals were in such appointments as of September 30, 1999. We analyzed these data to identify the composition of the career SES as of the end of each fiscal year from 1990 through 1999. We also analyzed these data to identify trends in how much change occurred governmentwide and in the selected agencies in the percentages of women and minorities employed in the career SES over the 1990 through 1999 period. We did not independently verify the CPDF data on the SES for the years we reviewed. However, in a 1998 report, we found that governmentwide data from the CPDF for the key variables in this study\u2014 gender, race/ethnicity, general schedule (GS) grade, pay plan, occupation, career status, agency, and personnel action\u2014were 97 percent or more accurate.", "For the first part of our second objective, to determine the proportion of women and minorities appointed to the career SES annually over this 10- year period, we obtained and analyzed data from the CPDF for each fiscal year from 1990 through 1999. We excluded career SES appointments that were reinstatements into the career SES and transfers of career SES individuals from one agency to another (about 11 percent combined). SES appointments in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), an agency within the Department of Justice, are not included because the FBI does not submit personnel action data to the CPDF.", "For the second part of our second objective, to determine whether career SES appointments reflected the SES pipeline from which most new SES members were generally appointed, we obtained and analyzed data from the CPDF for each of 3 years (1990, 1995, and 1999). The 3 years represented the beginning, middle and end of our overall review period. We compared the diversity of the career SES appointees with the diversity of the pipeline. Because data were not readily available on who actually applied for SES vacancies and because we could not clearly determine the workforces from which all career SES appointees came, we limited the pipeline analysis to career SES appointments of career GS-15 and equivalent employees from within the appointing agency. Over 90 percent of those appointed to the career SES from within an agency were career GS-15 employees the year prior to their appointment and about 83 percent of all career SES appointments were from within an agency. Because we could not clearly determine the labor force (pipeline) for career SES appointments of individuals from outside an agency, we excluded nonfederal employees (about 10 percent of appointees) and federal employees from other agencies (about 7 percent of appointees). Similarly, because we could not clearly determine the labor force for career SES appointments of nonGS-15 federal employees and noncareer GS-15 employees within an agency, we excluded these two groups (about 8 percent) of appointees.", "In our analysis of appointment and pipeline data, we did not distinguish between GS-15 employees who had supervisory or managerial experience and those who did not have such experience. We did not make this distinction because we found that 25 percent of the GS-15 employees appointed to the SES in fiscal year 1999 were not managers or supervisors in fiscal year 1998.", "Our third objective entailed identifying how the representation of women and minority employees in the career SES governmentwide and in the 24 CFO agencies as of September 30, 1999, compared with other labor forces. On the basis of agreements reached with your staff, we compared the career SES to six labor forces to provide some context for the extent of diversity in the career SES. The six labor forces varied in the extent to which they were similar to the SES in terms of occupation, salary, and size. Table II.1 shows the size of the six labor forces used in our governmentwide comparisons.", "Number of employees 123.8 million 1.2 million 1.6 million 888,000 51,000 812 We included only employees receiving wages or salaries and excluded federal employees from the CLF and the RCLF that we constructed. The CLF was derived from the March 1999 Current Population Survey (CPS). Our RCLF was constructed based on the CLF to correspond to the career SES workforce as closely as possible in terms of salary and occupation. Because salary data collected for the CPS are only in ranges of dollars, we used the salary range of $100,000 and over as that most comparable to SES salaries.", "In addition to governmentwide comparisons of the career SES to each of the labor forces, we also assessed the diversity of each of the CFO agency career SES workforces separately. Because the mission of each of the CFO agencies is different with a different occupational mix, we compared the diversity of each agency\u2019s career SES workforce to the diversity of its own agency total career workforce, its own career professional and administrative workforce, and its own career GS-15 workforce. We also compared the diversity of each agency\u2019s career SES occupations to the diversity of corresponding occupations in a RCLF that we developed. However, in comparing the diversity of each agency\u2019s career SES to the CLF and Postal Service, we did not tailor these labor forces to correspond to the SES occupational mix of each of the 24 agencies.", "We used a proxy RCLF and the GS-15 workforce as comparative groups. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Justice have provided agencies advice on assessing the extent of diversity in their SES workforces. EEOC said it has suggested that agencies look at their relevant feeder groups when assessing the level of representation of women and minorities in the SES or at any particular grade level, and in the case of the SES, it has suggested that agencies look at their GS-14 and GS-15 workforces. When an agency\u2019s positions cannot be precisely matched to those in the CLF, Justice has advised agencies to compare their labor forces to those in other labor forces that have the qualifications to perform the duties of the positions in their agencies\u2014 such as comparing their SES with employees in their GS-15 workforce. We constructed an RCLF that consists of civilian workers employed in occupations and earning salaries similar to those in the SES. We recognize that our RCLF is not a perfect benchmark, and EEOC does not endorse it.However, our RCLF was the closest match to the SES we could identify in terms of occupations and salary level, because data were not available on level of responsibilities for those in the CLF. We also used the CLF as a comparative group, recognizing that it does not provide as comparable a workforce to the SES as one that includes workers with education, skills, experience, and age similar to the SES, because it includes workers with limited education, skills, and experience as well as workers as young as age 16.", "The Bureau of the Census conducts the CPS for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because of the age of the CLF data from the 1990 decennial census, we used CLF data from the March 1999 CPS, the most recent data available at the time of our analyses, when it was statistically feasible to do so. We found that the CLF data from the 1999 CPS were statistically feasible for all racial/ethnic groups except Asian Americans and Native Americans. CLF data were not statistically reliable for Asian Americans and Native Americans because the CPS does not cover enough households to provide statistically sound projections for these two groups. Although the 1999 data were not reliable for these two groups, we used the data because the results of the 1999 CPS RCLF comparisons for Asian Americans and Native Americans indicated the same findings as the 1990 CLF comparisons for Asian Americans and Native Americans. Based on these similar findings, we believe the 1999 CPS RCLF comparisons are not misleading.", "To construct our governmentwide and agency-specific RCLF, we identified the occupations that accounted for a large proportion of the entire career SES as of September 30, 1999, as well as occupations that were small relative to the entire career SES workforce but relatively large within an agency\u2019s career SES workforce (such as Correctional Administrators in the Department of Justice). This resulted in a total of 34 SES occupations that accounted for 87 percent of the career SES workforce as of the end of fiscal year 1999. We then identified, using a crosswalk used by EEOC, occupations in the CLF that corresponded as closely as possible to these SES occupations. Because the CPDF and the CPS do not use the same occupational categories, some CPS occupations included more than one CPDF SES occupation. This resulted in a total of 28 occupations in the CPS that were comparable to the 34 SES occupations identified in the CPDF. We extracted data from the CLF only for those salaried civilian workers in the 28 occupations with salaries of $100,000 and over, which were comparable to the base salaries of career SES members in 1999. These data were weighted to reflect the occupational composition of each agency. For example, if 50 percent of an agency\u2019s SES were attorneys, then our RCLF that they were compared to also included 50 percent attorneys.", "We then calculated a representation index to measure the extent of parity between an employee group\u2019s proportion in the SES and its proportion in the comparison labor force by dividing the career SES percentage for each employee group by the percentage for the same employee group in each of the selected labor forces and multiplying by 100. The extent of parity for a particular group can vary widely from one comparative labor force to another. However, none of the comparisons of the SES to the other labor forces, governmentwide or by agency, can be seen as definitive as to whether the SES corps is sufficiently diverse. We used shading to describe the extent of parity between employee group representation in the SES and comparative labor forces.", "Using appropriate statistical tests, we tested whether the proportions of women and minorities in the SES were significantly over or under (two- tailed test) their proportions in the six labor forces to determine whether the proportional differences were statistically significant. We used the two-standard deviation difference between compared proportions, as recommended by the Justice Department, as our test of significance. A difference of two-standard deviations indicates that the difference in proportions is very unlikely to be due to sampling error or chance. Such a sizable difference provides a strong basis for concluding that the differences are noteworthy. The results of our comparisons are statistically significant unless otherwise noted.", "To provide data on the noncareer SES, we obtained data from the CPDF. Specifically, we obtained data for each fiscal year from 1990 through 1999, on the composition of and appointments to the noncareer SES governmentwide and for the 24 CFO agencies.
