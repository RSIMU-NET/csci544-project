It is important to recognize  that this transition to a more effective homeland security approach is part  of a larger transformation that our government must make to address  emerging fiscal, economic, demographic, scientific, technological and  other challenges of the 21st century and to meet the expectations of the  American people for timely, quality and cost-effective public services.", "In the nine months since the horrible events of September 11th, the  President and the Congress have responded with important and aggressive  actions to protect the nation \u2013 creating an Office of Homeland Security  (OHS), passing new laws such as the USA Patriot Act and an emergency  supplemental spending bill, establishing a new agency to improve  transportation security, and working with unprecedented collaboration  with federal, state and local governments, private sector entities, non- governmental organizations and other countries to prevent future terrorist  acts and to bring to justice those individuals responsible for such terrible  acts.", "More recently, the Congress and the President have sought to remedy long- standing issues and concerns in the government\u2019s homeland security  functions by proposing greater consolidation and coordination of various  agencies and activities.  Recent proposals include restructuring the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and splitting the enforcement and service  sections of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).   Additionally,  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and Representative William M. \u201cMac\u201d  Thornberry have authored legislation designed to consolidate many  homeland security functions.  On June 6th, the President announced a  proposal to establish a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and on  June 18th transmitted draft legislation to the Congress for its consideration.", "In my testimony today, I will focus on two major issues that Congress  should review in its deliberations on creating a new cabinet department  principally dedicated to homeland security:  (1) the need for reorganization  and the principles and criteria to help evaluate what agencies and missions  should be included in or left out of the new DHS; and (2) issues related to  the transition, cost and implementation challenges of the new department."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Need, Principles And Criteria For Reorganization", "paragraphs": ["In response to global challenges the government faces in the coming years,  we have a unique opportunity to create an extremely effective and  performance-based organization that can strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to  protect its borders and citizens against terrorism.  There is likely to be  considerable benefit over time from restructuring some of the homeland  security functions, including reducing risk and improving the economy,  efficiency and effectiveness of these consolidated agencies and programs.   Realistically, however, in the short term, the magnitude of the challenges  that the new department faces will clearly require substantial time and  effort, and will take additional resources to make it fully effective.   Numerous complicated issues will need to be resolved in the short term,  including a harmonization of information technology systems, human  capital systems, the physical location of people and other assets, and many  other factors.  Implementation of the new department will be an extremely  complex task and will ultimately take years to achieve.  Given the  magnitude of the endeavor, not everything can be achieved at the same  time.  As a result, it will be important for the new department to focus on a  handful of important things, such as: articulating a clear overarching  mission and core values, developing a national strategy, utilizing strategic  planning to establish desired outcomes and key priorities, and assuring  effective communications systems.  Further, effective performance and  risk management systems must be established, and work must be  completed on threat and vulnerability assessments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Need for Reorganization", "paragraphs": ["GAO and other observers of the federal government\u2019s organization,  performance and accountability for terrorism and homeland security  functions have long recognized the prevalence of gaps, duplication and  overlaps driven in large part by the absence of a central policy focal point,  fragmented missions, ineffective information sharing, and institutional  rivalries.    In recent years, GAO has made numerous recommendations  related to changes necessary for improving the government\u2019s response to  combating terrorism.  Prior to the establishment of the OHS, GAO found  that the federal government lacked overall homeland security leadership  and management accountable to both the President and Congress. GAO  has also stated that fragmentation exits in both coordination of domestic  preparedness programs and in efforts to develop a national strategy.   Based on evaluations prior to September 11th , GAO identified the following  five actions to improve programs to combat terrorism: Create a single high-level federal focal point for policy and coordination,  Develop a comprehensive threat and risk assessment,  Develop a national strategy with a defined end state to measure   Analyze and prioritize governmentwide programs and budgets to  identify gaps and reduce duplication of effort, and  Coordinate implementation among the different federal agencies.", "Moreover, in a recent report to Congress on initial concerns about  organizing for homeland security since September 11th, GAO indicated that  a definition of homeland security should be developed, preferably in the  context of the Administration\u2019s issuance of a national strategy for  homeland security, in order to improve the effectiveness and coordination  of relevant programs.", "The recent and on-going actions of the Administration to strengthen  homeland security functions, including the proposal for establishing DHS,  should not be considered a substitute for, nor should they supplant, the  timely issuance of a national homeland security strategy.  Based on our  prior work, GAO believes that the consolidation of some homeland security  functions makes sense and will, if properly organized and implemented,  over time lead to more efficient, effective and coordinated programs, better  intelligence sharing, and a more robust protection of our people, borders  and critical infrastructure.  At the same time, the proposed cabinet  department, even with its multiple missions, will still be just one of many  players with important roles and responsibilities for ensuring homeland  security.  At the federal level, homeland security missions will be require  the involvement of the CIA, FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Department  of Defense (DOD), and a myriad of other agencies.   State and local  governments, including law enforcement and first responder personnel,  and the private sector all have critical roles to play.  If anything, the  multiplicity of players only reinforces the recommendations that GAO has  made in the past regarding the urgent need for a comprehensive threat, risk  and vulnerability assessment and a national homeland security strategy  that can provide direction and utility at all levels of government and across  all sectors of the country.", "The development and implementation of a national strategy for homeland  security is vital to effectively leveraging and coordinating the country\u2019s  assets, at a national rather than federal level, to prevent and defend against  future terrorist acts.  A national homeland security strategy can help define  and establish a clear role and need for homeland security and its  operational components, to create specific expectations for performance  and accountability, and to build a framework for partnerships that will  support the critical role of coordination, communication and collaboration  among all relevant parties and stakeholders with homeland security  missions.  DHS will clearly have a central role in the success of efforts to  strengthen homeland security, but it is a role that will be made stronger  within the context of a larger, more comprehensive and integrated national  homeland security strategy.", "A reorganization of the government\u2019s homeland security functions along  the lines being proposed is a major undertaking and represents one of the  largest potential reorganizations and consolidations of government  agencies, personnel, programs and operations in recent history.  Those  involved in this transition should not underestimate the time or effort  required to successfully achieve the results the nation seeks.  Numerous  comparisons have been made between the proposed DHS and other large- scale government reorganizations, including the creation of DOD, the  Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council as part of the  National Security Act of 1947.   Other analogies include the 1953 creation of  the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the 1966 establishment  of the Department of Transportation (DOT) or the 1977 creation of the  Department of Energy (DOE).   Each of these cabinet level restructurings  involved the transfer and consolidation of disparate functions and the  creation of a new cabinet level structure in the Executive Branch.", "Often it has taken years for the consolidated functions in new departments  to effectively build on their combined strengths, and it is not uncommon  for these structures to remain as management challenges for decades.  It is  instructive to note that the creation of DOD, which arguably already had  the most similar and aligned missions and functions among the  reorganizations mentioned, still required Congress to make further  amendments to its organization in 1949, 1953, 1958 and 1986 in order to  improve its structural effectiveness.  Despite these and other changes made  by DOD, GAO has consistently reported over the years that the department   \u2013 more than 50 years after the reorganization -- continues to have a number  of serious management challenges.  In fact, DOD has 6 of 22 government  wide high risk areas based on GAO\u2019s latest list.  This note of caution is not  intended to dissuade the Congress from seeking logical and important  consolidations in government agencies and programs in order to improve  homeland security missions.  Rather, it is meant to suggest that  reorganizations of government agencies frequently encounter start up  problems and unanticipated consequences that result from the  consolidations, are unlikely to fully overcome obstacles and challenges,  and may require additional modifications in the future to effectively  achieve our collective goals for defending the country against terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizational Principles and Criteria", "paragraphs": ["The Congress faces a challenging and complex job in its consideration of  DHS.  On the one hand, there exists a certain urgency to move rapidly in  order to remedy known problems relating to intelligence and information  sharing and leveraging like activities that have in the past and even today  prevent the United States from exercising as strong a homeland defense as  emerging and potential threats warrant.  Simultaneously, that same urgency  of purpose would suggest that the Congress be extremely careful and  deliberate in how it creates a new department for defending the country  against terrorism.  The urge to \u201cdo it quickly\u201d must be balanced by an equal  need to \u201cdo it right\u201d in order to ensure a consensus on identified problems  and needs, and to be sure that the solutions our government legislates and  implements can effectively remedy the problems we face in a reasonably  timely manner.  It is clear that fixing the wrong problems, or even worse,  fixing the right problems poorly, could cause more harm than good in our  efforts to defend our country against terrorism.", "The federal government has engaged in numerous reorganizations of  agencies in our nation\u2019s history.  Reorganizations have occurred at various  times and for various reasons, and have been achieved through executive  order, through recommendations by landmark commissions subsequently  approved by the Congress, such as the Hoover Commission chaired by  former President Herbert Hoover in the late 1940s, and by the Congress  through its committee structure.  The prevailing consensus on  organizational management principles changed considerably during the  course of the 20th century and through the various approaches to  reorganization, but Hoover\u2019s Commission clearly articulated that agencies  and functions of the executive branch should be grouped together based on  their major purposes or missions.  The government has not always  followed Hoover\u2019s lead uniformly, but in recent years most departments  except those serving a specific clientele, such as veterans, generally have  been organized according to this principle.", "GAO\u2019s own work on government restructuring and organization over the  years has tended to support the overall tendency to emphasize  consolidations of agencies as ways to improve the economy, efficiency and  effectiveness of government operations.  GAO has previously  recommended that reorganizations should emphasize an integrated  approach, that reorganization plans should be designed to achieve specific,  identifiable goals, and that careful attention to fundamental public sector  management practices and principles, such as strong financial, technology  and human capital management are critical to the successful  implementation of government reorganizations.  Similarly, GAO has also  suggested that reorganizations may be warranted based on the significance  of the problems requiring resolution, as well as the extent and level of  coordination and interaction necessary with other entities in order to  resolve problems or achieve overall objectives.", "Of course, there are many lessons to be learned from the private sector,  which over the past 20 years has experienced an extraordinary degree of  consolidation through the merger and acquisition of companies or business  units.  Among the most important lessons, besides ensuring that synergistic  entities can broaden organizational strengths more than limit them, is the  need to pay critical attention to the employees impacted by the  reorganization, and to align the human capital strategies and core  competency components of the organization in order to meet expectations  and achieve results.  GAO has made similar conclusions and  recommendations for the federal government.  These observations are  particularly apt to the proposed structure of DHS, which would combine an  estimated 170,000 employees into a single department, making it the third  largest government department in terms of personnel behind DOD and the  Department of Veterans Affairs.", "GAO, based on its own work as well as a review of other applicable studies  of approaches to the organization and structure of entities, has concluded  that Congress should consider utilizing specific criteria as a guide to  creating and implementing the new department.   Specifically, GAO has  developed a framework that will help Congress and the Administration  create and implement a strong and effective new cabinet department by  establishing criteria to be considered for constructing the department  itself, determining which agencies should be included and excluded, and  leveraging numerous key management and policy elements that, after  completion of the revised organizational structure, will be critical to the  department\u2019s success.   The following chart depicts the proposed  framework: With respect to criteria that Congress should consider for constructing the  department itself, the following questions about the overall purpose and  structure of the organization should be evaluated:  Definition:  Is there a clear and consistently applied definition of  homeland security that will be used as a basis for organizing and  managing the new department?", "Statutory Basis:  Are the authorities of the new department clear and  complete in how they articulate roles and responsibilities and do they  sufficiently describe the department\u2019s relationship with other parties?", "Clear Mission:  What will the primary missions of the new DHS be and  how will it define success?", "Performance-based Organization:  Does the new department have  the structure (e.g., COO, etc.) and statutory authorities (e.g., human  capital, sourcing) necessary to meet performance expectations, be held  accountable for results, and leverage effective management approaches  for achieving its mission on a national basis?", "Congress should also consider several very specific criteria in its  evaluation of whether individual agencies or programs should be included  or excluded from the proposed department.  Those criteria include the  following:  Mission Relevancy: Is homeland security a major part of the agency or  program mission?  Is it the primary mission of the agency or program?", "Similar Goals and Objectives:  Does the agency or program being  considered for the new department share primary goals and objectives  with the other agencies or programs being consolidated?", "Leverage Effectiveness:  Does the agency or program being  considered for the new department create synergy and help to leverage  the effectiveness of other agencies and programs or the new department  as a whole?  In other words, is the whole greater than the sum of the  parts?", "Gains Through Consolidation:  Does the agency or program being  considered for the new department improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of homeland security missions through eliminating  duplications and overlaps, closing gaps and aligning or merging  common roles and responsibilities?", "Integrated Information Sharing/Coordination:  Does the agency  or program being considered for the new department contribute to or  leverage the ability of the new department to enhance the sharing of  critical information or otherwise improve the coordination of missions  and activities related to homeland security?", "Compatible Cultures:  Can the organizational culture of the agency or  program being considered for the new department effectively meld with  the other entities that will be consolidated?  Field structures and  approaches to achieving missions vary considerably between agencies.", "Impact on Excluded Agencies: What is the impact on departments  losing components to DHS?  What is the impact on agencies with  homeland security missions left out of DHS?", "In addition to the criteria that Congress should consider when evaluating  what to include and exclude from the proposed DHS, there are certain  critical success factors the new department should emphasis in its initial  implementation phase.  GAO over the years has made observations and  recommendations about many of these success factors, based on effective  management of people, technology, financial and other issues, especially in  its biannual Performance and Accountability Series on major government  departments.   These factors include the following:  Strategic Planning:  Leading results-oriented organizations focus on  the process of strategic planning that includes involvement of  stakeholders, assessment of internal and external environments, and an  alignment of activities, cores processes and resources to support  mission-related outcomes.", "Organizational Alignment: The organization of the new department  should be aligned to be consistent with the goals and objectives  established in the strategic plan.", "Communication:  Effective communication strategies are key to any  major consolidation or transformation effort.", "Building Partnerships:  One of the key challenges of this new  department will be the development and maintenance of homeland  security partners at all levels of the government and the private sector,  both in the United States and overseas.", "Performance Management:  An effective performance management  system fosters institutional, unit and individual accountability.", "Human Capital Strategy:  The new department must ensure that that  its homeland security missions are not adversely impacted by the  government\u2019s pending human capital crisis, and that it can recruit, retain  and reward a talented and motivated workforce, which has required  core competencies, to achieve its mission and objectives.  The people  factor is a critical element in any major consolidation or transformation.", "Information Management and Technology:  The new department  should leverage state-of-the art enabling technology to enhance its  ability to transform capabilities and capacities to share and act upon  timely, quality information about terrorist threats.", "Knowledge Management:  The new department must ensure it makes  maximum use of the collective body of knowledge that will be brought  together in the consolidation.", "Financial Management:  The new department has a stewardship  obligation to prevent fraud, waste and abuse, to use tax dollars  appropriately, and to ensure financial accountability to the President,  Congress and the American people.", "Acquisition Management:  Anticipated as one of the largest of new  federal departments, the proposed DHS will potentially have one of the  most extensive acquisition requirements in government.  Early attention  to strong systems and controls for acquisition and related business  processes will be critical both to ensuring success and maintaining  integrity and accountability.", "Risk Management:  The new department must be able to maintain and  enhance current states of homeland security readiness while  transitioning and transforming itself into a more effective and efficient  structural unit.  The proposed DHS will also need to immediately  improve the government\u2019s overall ability to perform risk management  activities that can help to prevent, defend against and respond to  terrorist acts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Homeland Security Reorganization", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the United States in recent  years had made what must be characterized as limited progress in  strengthening its efforts to protect the nation from terrorist attacks.  Mainly  through the mechanisms of executive orders and presidential decision  directives (PDD), the President has sought to provide greater clarity and  leadership in homeland security areas.  For instance, PDD 39 in June 1995  assigned the Department of Justice, through the FBI, responsibility as the  lead federal agency for crisis management, and FEMA as the lead federal  agency for consequence management for domestic terrorist attacks.  In  May 1998, PDD 62 established the position of national coordinator for  terrorism within the National Security Council.  PDD 63 emphasized new  efforts to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from attack.  Through  legislation, the federal government increased the availability of grants for  first responder training and instituted more regular tabletop training  exercises involving state and local governments.", "A number of blue ribbon panels or commissions were also convened prior  to September 11th and, after studying the government\u2019s structure and  methods for protecting against terrorism, made many important and timely  recommendations for improving our approach.  Panels led by former  Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, as well as former Virginia  Governor James Gilmore, made sweeping recommendations about  remedying the gaps, overlaps and coordination problems in the  government\u2019s ability to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks in a  comprehensive manner across both the public and private sectors.  Indeed,  the Hart-Rudman Commission recommended the creation of a new  department to consolidate many of the government\u2019s homeland security  functions.", "In recent years, GAO has also issued numerous reports and made many  recommendations designed to improve the nation\u2019s approach to homeland  security.  We summarized our work in a report completed just prior to the  September 11th attacks, in which we found that: (1) overall leadership and  coordination needed to be addressed; (2) limited progress had been made  in developing a national strategy and related guidance and plans; (3)  federal response capabilities had improved but further action was still  necessary; (4) federal assistance to state and local governments could be  consolidated; and (5) limited progress had been made in implementing a  strategy to counter computer-based threats.   We have continued to re- iterate that a central focal point such as OHS be established statutorily in  order to coordinate and oversee homeland security policy within a national  framework.  Today, we re-emphasize the need for OHS to be established  statutorily in order to effectively coordinate activities beyond the scope of  the proposed DHS and to assure reasonable congressional oversight.", "As mentioned previously, after the September 11th terrorist attacks,  Congress and the Administration took a number of actions designed to  improve our ability to combat terrorism and protect the nation.  The  President created OHS via executive order.  Congress passed legislation  creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to better secure  transportation and the USA Patriot Act to improve our capabilities to  detect and prevent terrorist acts.  Congress also introduced legislation to  restructure a variety of homeland security related functions, and Senator  Lieberman and Representative Thornberry proposed legislation to create a  new cabinet department to consolidate many homeland security functions.", "On June 6th, President Bush announced a new proposal to create a  Department of Homeland Security and submitted draft legislation to  Congress on June 18th.  Like the congressional approaches to creation of a  new department, the President\u2019s plan also reflected many of the recent  commissions\u2019 suggestions and GAO\u2019s recommendations for improved  coordination and consolidation of homeland security functions.  As  indicated by Governor Ridge is his recent testimony before Congress, the  creation of DHS would empower a single cabinet official whose primary  mission is to protect the American homeland from terrorism, including: (1)  preventing terrorist attacks within the United States; (2) reducing  America\u2019s vulnerability to terrorism; and (3) minimizing the damage and  recovering from attacks that do occur.", "In our initial review of the proposed DHS, we have used the President\u2019s  draft bill of June 18th as the basis of our comments.  Nevertheless, we  recognize that the proposal has already \u2013 and will continue -- to evolve in  the coming days and weeks ahead.  The President\u2019s proposal creates a  cabinet department with four divisions, including:  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection  Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures Additionally, the proposed DHS would be responsible for homeland  security coordination with other executive branch agencies, state and local  governments, the private sector and other entities.  The legislation  transfers to the new department intact the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.  Coast Guard.  For the organizations transferred to the new department, the  proposed DHS would be responsible for managing all of their functions,  including non-homeland security functions.  In some instances, these other  responsibilities are substantial.  Finally, the proposal would exempt the  new department from certain authorities, including some civil service  protections, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and procurement laws,  while providing authority to authorize new rules by regulation and to  reprogram portions of departmental appropriations.  The new department\u2019s  Inspector General would be modeled on that office in the Central  Intelligence Agency.", "Homeland Security Missions One of the most critical functions that the new department will have is the  analysis of information and intelligence to better foresee terrorist threats to  the United States.  As part of its function, the Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection division of the department would assess the  vulnerability of America\u2019s key assets and critical infrastructure, including  food and water systems, agriculture, health systems, emergency services,  banking and finance, communications and information systems, energy  (including electric, nuclear, gas and oil and hydropower), transportation  systems, and national monuments.", "The President\u2019s proposal seeks to transfer to the new department the FBI\u2019s  National Infrastructure Protection Center (other than the computer  investigations and operations center), the National Communications  System of DOD, the Commerce Department\u2019s Critical Infrastructure  Assurance Office, the Computer Security Division of the National Institute  of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Infrastructure  Simulation and Analysis Center of DOE, and the General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Computer Incident Response Center.", "The Administration has indicated that this new division would for the first  time merge under one roof the capability to identify and assess threats to  the homeland, map those threats against our vulnerabilities, issue timely  warnings, and organize preventive or protective action to secure the  homeland.  Considerable debate has ensued in recent weeks with respect  to the quality and timeliness of intelligence data shared between and  among relevant intelligence, law enforcement and other agencies.  The  proposal would provide for the new department to receive all reports and  analysis related to threats of terrorism and vulnerabilities to our  infrastructure and, if the President directs, information in the \u201craw\u201d state  that has not been analyzed.", "The agencies and programs included in the Administration\u2019s proposal to  consolidate information analysis functions are clear contributors to the  homeland security mission and, if well coordinated or consolidated, could  provide greater benefits in incident reporting, analysis and warning, and  the identification of critical assets.   Such a critical endeavor, however, will  still require detailed planning and coordination, including a national critical  infrastructure protection strategy, both inside and outside the new  department, to ensure that relevant information reaches the right offices  and officials who can act upon it.  Furthermore, in considering this portion  of the legislation, Congress ought to evaluate whether the new division as  proposed, despite the provision stipulating access, will have sufficient  ability to obtain all necessary information, assistance and guidance to  make decisions in a timely, effective manner.", "Within this framework, the Congress will likely need to make trade-off  decisions between concerns over access and utility of information and the  concerns that some Americans may have about civil rights issues  associated with any larger consolidation of domestically-oriented  intelligence operations.  It is also important to note that while certain  cyber/critical infrastructure protection functions are proposed for transfer  into DHS, a significant number of federal organizations involved in this  effort will remain in their existing locations, including the Critical  Infrastructure Protection Board, the Joint Task Force for Computer  Network Operations, and the Computer Investigations and Operations  Section of the FBI.  The homeland security proposal is silent on the  relationship between those entities that will be consolidated and their role  in coordinating with the entities left out of the new department, and  Congress should consider addressing this important issue.  Ultimately, a  greater emphasis on strategic planning and information sharing clearly will  be necessary to resolve the significant shortfalls that the government has  faced in sharing critical intelligence and infrastructure information in order  to better achieve homeland security expectations.  The consolidation of  some intelligence functions into DHS may help solve these problems.", "The division of the new department responsible for chemical, biological,  radiological and nuclear countermeasures will consolidate several  important scientific, research and development programs, including the  select agent registration enforcement programs and activities of the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), programs at DOE  dealing with chemical and biological national security and non- proliferation supporting programs, the nuclear smuggling programs, the  nuclear assessment program, energy security and assurance activities, and  life science activities of DOE\u2019s biological and environmental research  program related to microbial pathogens.  Also proposed for transfer are the  Environmental Measurements Laboratory, portions of the Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory, the Plum Island Animal Diseases Center of  the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and DOD\u2019s National Bio-Weapons  Defense Analysis Center, which is not yet operational.", "The proposal seeks to remedy the current fragmented efforts of the  government and its private sector partners to counter and protect against  the threat of weapons of mass destruction.  To the extent that this division  would develop or coordinate the development of national policy to  strengthen research and development in the areas of countermeasures to  chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, such a goal  conforms to previous recommendations we have made.  As with the  information analysis division discussed previously, this division would also  have extensive needs to coordinate with other similar programs throughout  the government \u2013 programs which are not included in the new department.   For example, there are civilian applications of defense related research and  development underway at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)  and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has some on-going  responsibility for bioterrorism research.  Whether such programs ought to  be considered for inclusion in the new department, or whether these issues  can be coordinated simply through improved interaction, are also  questions that should be considered in the larger context of the legislation.   The proposal also calls for transferring elements of the Lawrence  Livermore Lab to the new department.  At this point, without sufficient  additional information, it is not clear what the impact that such a shift  would have on the lab\u2019s overall research program or the significant contract  workforce that is engaged in much of the activities.  Congress may also  need to further explore whether the relationships the proposal would  establish between the new department\u2019s secretary and the Secretary of  HHS will efficiently and effectively result in the desired outcomes for  civilian research, as the nature of the agreements and delegations to  implement such functions are not clear.  Nevertheless, despite some  unresolved ambiguity, it will be important for the Congress to capture the  synergy that potentially can be created by combining compatible research  and development activities.", "One of the larger divisions of the new department would handle Border and  Transportation Security, and would include the transfer of the U.S.  Customs Service, INS, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) of USDA, the Coast Guard and TSA, both from DOT, and GSA\u2019s  Federal Protective Service.  The proposal seeks to bring together under one  department all of the border control functions, including authority over the  issuance of visas, in order to consolidate operations for border controls,  territorial waters and transportation systems.  This effort is designed to  balance prevention of terrorist activities against people, food and other  goods, and transportation systems with the legitimate, rapid movement of  people and commerce across borders and around the country.  Under the  proposed transfer, APHIS and Plum Island (as part of the Infrastructure  division) would be moved from USDA, but other units would remain.  In  addition, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety functions  were identified for transfer.  Thus, the focus appears to be on enhancing  protection of livestock and crops from terrorist acts, rather than on  protecting the food supply as a whole.  In previous reports, GAO has  described our current fragmented federal food supply safety structure and,  in the absence of a single food safety agency, Congress may wish to  consider whether the new department would be able to prevent, detect,  and quickly respond to acts of terrorism in the food supply.  Another issue  that Congress may need to consider is the organizational separation of  facilities management functions and building security responsibilities  contained in the Federal Protective Service\u2019s mission.  Since the provision  of security is a key facilities management function, security needs to be  integrated into decisions about the location, design and operation of  federal facilities.  Moreover, many federal agencies provide their own  building security.  The proposal does not address the coordination or  further consolidation of such functions, and it is also silent on GSA\u2019s role in  leading the Interagency Security Committee, which develops the federal  government\u2019s security policies and oversees the implementation of such  policies in federal facilities.", "Finally, the last division, Emergency Preparedness and Response, would  combine the government\u2019s various agencies and programs that provide  assistance, grants, training and related help to state and local governments,  to first responder personnel and support other federal agencies that may  confront terrorist attacks, major disasters and other emergencies.  The  proposal would transfer to the new department the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), the Office of Domestic Preparedness and the  Domestic Emergency Support Teams of the Justice Department and  National Domestic Preparedness Office of the FBI, as well as the Strategic  National Stockpile and certain public health preparedness responsibilities  of HHS.

In fact, quite a number of the agencies proposed to be transferred to DHS  have multiple functions \u2013 they have missions directly associated with  homeland security and missions that are not at all related to homeland  security.  In our initial review of the impacted agencies, we have not found  any missions that would appear to be in fundamental conflict with the  department\u2019s primary mission of homeland security.  However, the  Congress will need to consider whether many of the non-homeland security  missions of those agencies transferred to DHS will receive adequate  funding, attention, visibility and support when subsumed into a department  that will be under tremendous pressure to succeed in its primary mission.   As important and vital as the homeland security mission is to our nation\u2019s  future, the other non-homeland security missions transferred to DHS for  the most part are not small or trivial responsibilities.  Rather, they  represent extremely important functions executed by the federal  government that, absent sufficient attention, could have serious  implications for their effective delivery and consequences for sectors of  our economy, health and safety, research programs and other significant  government functions.  Some of these responsibilities include:  maritime safety and drug interdiction by the Coast Guard,   collection of commercial tariffs by the Customs Service,   regulation of genetically engineered plants by APHIS,   advanced energy and environmental research by the Lawrence  Livermore and Environmental Measurements labs,  responding to floods and other natural disasters by FEMA, and  authority over processing visas by the State Department\u2019s consular  officers.", "These examples reveal that many non-homeland security missions are  likely to be integrated into a cabinet department overwhelmingly dedicated  to protecting the nation from terrorism.  Congress may wish to consider  whether the new department, as proposed, will dedicate sufficient  management capacity and accountability to ensure the execution of non- homeland security missions, as well as consider potential alternatives to  the current framework for handling these important functions.", "Likewise, Congress may wish to consider the impact that the proposed  transfer of certain agencies and programs may have on their \u201chome\u201d  departments.  Both the Department of the Treasury and the DOT will see  significant reductions in size and changes to their overall departmental  missions, organization, and environments if the legislation is enacted.  As a  result, these changes provide an opportunity for Congress and the  Administration to consider what is the proper role for these and other  federal government entities.  As the impact of reductions of missions and  personnel are contemplated at several cabinet departments, it is  appropriate for Congress to reconsider the relevance or fit of federal  programs and activities.  This process requires that we ask important, yet  sometimes tough questions, such as:  What is the national need?", "How important is it relative to other competing needs and available  resources?", "What is the proper federal role, if any?", "Who are the other key players (e.g., state and local government, non- government organizations, private sector)?", "How should we define success (e.g., desired outcomes)?", "What tools of government create the best incentives for strong results \u2013  (direct funding, tax incentives, guarantees, regulation, enforcement)?", "What does experience tell us about the effectiveness of any current  related government programs?", "Based on the above, what programs should be reduced, terminated,  started or expanded?", "In fact, given the key trends identified in GAO\u2019s recent strategic plan for  supporting the Congress and our long range fiscal challenges, now is the  time to ask three key questions:  (1) what should the federal government do  in the 21st century? (2) how should the federal government do business in  the 21st century? and (3) who should do the federal government\u2019s business  the 21st century?  These questions are relevant for DHS and every other  federal agency and activity.", "As the proposal to create DHS indicates, the terrorist events of last fall  have provided an impetus for the government to look at the larger picture  of how it provides homeland security and how it can best accomplish  associated missions.  Yet, even for those agencies that are not being  integrated into DHS, there remains a very real need and possibly a unique  opportunity to rethink approaches and priorities to enable them to better  target their resources to address our most urgent needs.  In some cases, the  new emphasis on homeland security has prompted attention to long- standing problems that have suddenly become more pressing.  For  example, we\u2019ve mentioned the overlapping and duplicative food safety  programs in the federal government.  While such overlap has been  responsible for poor coordination and inefficient allocation of resources,  these issues assume a new, and potentially more foreboding, meaning after  September 11th given the threat from bio-terrorism.    A consolidated  approach can facilitate a concerted and effective response to new threats.", "The federal role in law enforcement, especially in connection with securing  our borders, is another area that is ripe for re-examination following the  events of September 11th.   In the past 20 years, the federal government has  taken on a larger role in financing criminal justice activities that have  traditionally been viewed as the province of the state and local sector.   Given the daunting new law enforcement responsibilities, and limited  budgetary resources at all levels, it is important to consider whether these  additional responsibilities should encourage us to reassess criminal justice  roles and responsibilities at the federal, state and local level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Concerns", "paragraphs": ["As Congress considers legislation for a new homeland security department,  it is important to note that simply moving agencies into a new government  organizational structure will, by itself, be insufficient to create the dynamic  environment that will be required to meet performance expectations for  protecting and defending the nation against terrorism.  It is critical to  recognize the important management and implementation challenges the  new department will face.  These challenges are already being faced at  TSA, which is under considerable pressure to build a strong workforce and  meet numerous deadlines for integrating technology and security issues.   Moreover, Congress should be aware that some fundamental problems  currently exist with certain of the agencies that are slated to become part  of the new department.  DHS will need to pay special attention to these  agencies to ensure that they can maintain readiness and confront  significant management problems simultaneously.", "For example, several of the agencies currently face challenges in  administering their programs, managing their human capital, and  implementing and securing information technology systems.  Absent  immediate and sustained attention to long-standing issues, these problems  are likely to remain once the transfer is complete.  Our past work has  demonstrated that these management challenges exist within INS, APHIS,  and FEMA.  Program management and implementation has been a  particular challenge for INS, which has a dual mission of enforcing laws  regarding illegal immigration and providing immigration and naturalization  services for aliens who enter and reside legally in the U.S.  This \u201cmission  overload\u201d has impeded INS from succeeding at either of its primary  functions.  In 1997, the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform  stated that INS\u2019 service and enforcement functions were incompatible and  that tasking one agency with carrying out both functions caused problems,  such as competition for resources, lack of coordination and cooperation,  and personnel practices that created confusion regarding mission and  responsibilities.  For example, INS does not have procedures in place to  coordinate its resources for initiating and managing its programs to combat  alien smuggling.  In several border areas, multiple antismuggling units exist  that operate autonomously, overlap in jurisdiction, and report to different  INS officials.  In addition, INS field officials lack clear criteria on which  antismuggling cases to investigate, resulting in inconsistent decision- making across locations.", "Managing human capital also remains a challenge for INS, APHIS, and  FEMA.  For INS, issues in managing its human capital management have  impacted various functions.  Because of cut backs or delays in training, a  large portion of INS\u2019 staff will be relatively inexperienced and inadequately  trained for processing visas for specialty occupations.  Furthermore, while  INS officials believe they need more staff to keep up with the workload,  they could not specify the types of staff needed or where they should be  located because of the lack of a staff allocation model and procedures.   APHIS, one of the three primary agencies responsible for monitoring the  entry of cargo and passengers into the U.S., has struggled to keep pace with  its heavy workload at ports of entry.  These conditions have led APHIS  inspectors to shortcut cargo inspection procedures, thereby jeopardizing  the quality of the inspections conducted.  In addition, APHIS has little  assurance that it is effectively deploying its limited inspection resources  because of weaknesses in its staffing models.  Likewise, FEMA still  struggles with using its disaster relief staff in an effective manner although  it has reported progress in improving its Disaster Field Office operations  through convening a review council to study its operations and the  implementation of corrective actions.", "Agencies\u2019 management efforts to implement information technology  systems, as well as utilize and secure the information within these systems,  have also proved challenging.  For example, INS lacks an agencywide  automated case tracking and management system to help it monitor and  coordinate its investigations.  Further, INS\u2019 antismuggling intelligence  efforts have been hampered by an inefficient and cumbersome process for  retrieving and analyzing intelligence information and by the lack of clear  guidance to INS staff about how to gather, analyze, and disseminate  intelligence information.  Within APHIS, no central automated system has  been implemented to allow for agency-wide access to information on the  status of shipments on hold at ports, forcing inspection staff to use a  manual record keeping system that does not reliably track this information.

DHS will need to balance national interests  with the unique needs and interests of nonfederal partners.  One size will  not, nor should it, fit all.  It is important to recognize both the opportunities  and risks associated with partnerships.  While gaining the opportunity to  leverage the legal, financial and human capital assets of partners for  national preparedness, each of these nonfederal entities has goals and  priorities that are independent of the federal government.  In designing  tools to engage these actors, the department needs to be aware of the  potential for goal slippage and resource diversion.  For instance, in  providing grants to state or local governments for training and equipment,  federal officials should be alert to the potential for these governments to  use grants to substitute for their own resources in these programs,  essentially converting a targeted federal grant into a general revenue  sharing initiative.
