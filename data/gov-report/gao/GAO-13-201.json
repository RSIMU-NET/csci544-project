GAO has previously reported that it is important for organizations to have complete, accurate, and consistent data to inform policy, document performance, and support decision making. Managers striving to reach organizational goals must have information systems in place to provide them with needed information. Based on data from defense components--the Joint Staff, U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Central Command, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the military services--that GAO reviewed, 34 in-transit visibility efforts are being conducted by the components. The department has obligated about $701 million for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 for these efforts and projected about $455.3 million in costs to be incurred for fiscal years 2012 through 2015--a total of approximately $1.2 billion. Currently, DOD conducts some informal coordination and information sharing regarding its in-transit visibility efforts, but information is not consistently shared through a formal mechanism.", "In 2012, DOD began developing a draft strategy for asset visibility and in-transit visibility; however, this strategy includes some but not all key elements of a comprehensive strategic plan. According to DOD officials, the draft strategy, developed in collaboration with all pertinent components, is expected to be completed by June 2013. Officials anticipate that it will be used to guide and integrate related department-wide efforts to improve end-to-end supply chain management and support to the services. According to DOD officials, each component will be expected to develop an execution plan that contains information about its in-transit visibility efforts. The draft strategy indicates that such information is to include descriptions of gaps or challenges within the supply chain, as well as the component's actions or proposed actions to address them. According to GAO's prior work, a comprehensive strategic plan should include a mission statement; a problem definition, scope, and methodology; goals and objectives; activities, milestones, and performance measures; resources and investments; information about organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination; and a description of key external factors that could affect the achievement of goals. GAO's review of DOD's draft strategy found that it includes one of the seven key elements of a comprehensive strategic plan, partially includes four others, and does not include the remaining two. For example, it includes overarching goals and objectives, but it does not include information on DOD's planned resources and investments to achieve those goals or key external factors that could affect the achievement of the goals. Until DOD has finalized a department-wide strategy with all accompanying execution plans, it will not have the information it needs to make well-informed decisions about asset visibility and in-transit visibility, including setting budget priorities for its in-transit visibility efforts across the supply chain in an increasingly constrained fiscal environment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that as DOD finalizes its in-transit visibility strategy it should ensure that it receives complete information from the components that addresses all key elements of a strategic plan.

We have previously reported that one of the most complex and vital tasks  facing DOD is managing its supply chain to effectively and efficiently  provide spare parts, food, fuel, and other critical supplies in support of  U.S. military forces. Maintaining visibility of these assets throughout the  materiel distribution system is critical to ensuring that DOD meets its  stated goal and provides support to the warfighter. DOD\u2019s materiel  distribution system covers four segments\u2014from the movement of  supplies in the continental United States (intracontinental movement),  through strategic and theater movements, to tactical movement on the  battlefield\u2014and must be capable of reaching its military customers  whether they are located on large, well-established bases or at small,  remote outposts.", "The performance of DOD\u2019s materiel distribution system relies on many  stakeholders, each with different responsibilities, systems, and  processes.

Joint logistics doctrine has established that delivery  from major logistics bases to the point of employment is not a joint  responsibility but rather a service-specific responsibility, as designated by  the geographic combatant commander. DOD components have efforts under way that attempt to address visibility issues in all segments of the  materiel distribution system; however, maintaining in-transit visibility all  the way through to the tactical movement segment remains challenging.  DOD defines in-transit visibility as the ability to track the identity, status,  and location of DOD units and non-unit cargo (excluding bulk petroleum,  oils, and lubricants); passengers; patients; and personal property from  origin to consignee or destination across the range of military operations.  For the purposes of this report we are referring to the Joint Staff,  TRANSCOM, U.S. Central Command, the Defense Logistics Agency, and  the military services as the components.

We stated that these challenges have hindered the  distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter and will likely  continue to affect operations in Afghanistan and limit DOD\u2019s visibility and  oversight of the supply chain. We made a number of recommendations to  address these concerns. DOD concurred with five of our  recommendations and partially concurred with another six. Although DOD  acknowledged that several challenges remain, it did not concur with our  four remaining recommendations. DOD did not concur with three of our  recommendations because its view is that TRANSCOM as Distribution  Process Owner does not and should not have any oversight between the  logistics hubs in Afghanistan and the warfighter. DOD also did not concur  with one recommendation because the department believes that  adequate policy and procedures already exist to ensure that content-level  detail is entered onto RFID tags.

The Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics serves as the principal  staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense for all matters  relating to defense logistics, among other duties, and is the department\u2019s  Defense Logistics Executive, with overall responsibility for improving and  maintaining the defense logistics and supply chain system. The Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness, under the  authority, direction, and control of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, is the principal logistics official  within the senior management of DOD. Within the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness, the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration improves the  integration of DOD\u2019s supply chain by developing policy and facilitating the  components\u2019 implementation of supply chain management practices,  among other duties.

Managers striving to reach organizational  goals must have information systems in place to provide them with  needed information. We conducted our own research, in collaboration  with the components, to identify the in-transit visibility efforts across DOD,  because DOD has not identified and does not yet have a ready means for  identifying these efforts. No single defense component could identify all of  the efforts across the department or provide cost figures for them. Based  on our analysis, 27 of the 34 efforts are each led and funded by a single  defense component. For example, the Army leads and funds the Next  Generation Wireless Communications effort, a wireless network that  provides location, condition, and intrusion-detection information on DOD  assets. Of the remaining seven efforts, each is co-led by two or more  components. For example, TRANSCOM and the Defense Logistics  Agency co-led an effort to merge data from several sources into one  system. The 34 efforts are listed in appendix II.

However, participants have included officials from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, the combatant commands, the four military  services, the Defense Logistics Agency, and other government agencies  that support distribution process improvements. DOD officials explained  that these conferences, workshops, and meetings provide opportunities to  discuss challenges that the components are experiencing with in-transit  visibility and the efforts they are taking to address these challenges. For  example, the Marine Corps hosted a logistics summit in November 2011.  The participants included officials from logistics offices in the Army, the  Defense Logistics Agency, TRANSCOM, and the Marine Corps. During  the summit, officials from the various components discussed challenges  and issues related to in-transit visibility\u2014such as methods to mandate  and implement the use of RFID tags on cargo containers, pallets, and  reusable shipping containers and the enforcement of RFID requirements  on cargo shipments transported outside the United States.
