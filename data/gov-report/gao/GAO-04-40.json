Such architectures are essential tools whose effective development and use are recognized hallmarks of successful organizations. Because of the importance of these architectures, GAO was asked to determine (1) what progress federal agencies have made in effectively developing, implementing, and maintaining their EAs and (2) the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) actions to advance the state of EA development and use across the federal government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies' progress toward effective EA management is limited. GAO surveyed federal agencies on their EA programs and compared the results with those of a similar survey that GAO conducted in 2001 (GAO-02-6). To assign a maturity level to agencies, GAO used its EA management maturity framework, which is a five-stage model that defines criteria that govern where an EA program stands in its progression toward being effectively managed (with Stage 1 being ineffective and Stage 5 being highly effective). Comparing the 2001 and 2003 survey results revealed a very similar overall picture, in which slight increases in agencies achieving Stage 3 status were offset by slight increases in agencies being at Stage 1. In addition, when GAO assessed the 2003 survey results against a recent update of the framework (GAO-03-584G), agencies' average maturity was slightly lower. An exception to this is the Executive Office of the President, which is a Stage 5 agency under the latest version of the framework. Part of the reason for this limited progress across the federal government is that agencies continue to face long-standing EA challenges, such as limited executive understanding of EA and a scarcity of skilled architecture staff. Since 2001, more agencies now report these as significant challenges. OMB has undertaken a variety of actions to advance the state of EA use across the federal government, such as collecting and analyzing architectures for major departments and agencies and requiring that major information technology (IT) investments comply with them. Additionally, OMB has developed parts of a governmentwide EA, and by requiring a mapping of agency architectures to this federal EA as part of the budget review process, it has called attention to the need for agencies to further their own architecture efforts. However, despite OMB's actions, the agencies' responses indicate that only about one-half are satisfied with OMB's leadership in addressing long-standing EA challenges. Until these challenges are effectively addressed, agencies' maturity levels as a whole are likely to remain stagnant, limiting their ability to effectively invest in IT."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A well-defined enterprise architecture provides a clear and comprehensive  picture of the structure of any enterprise, whether it is an organization or a  functional or mission area.

Such an architecture is an essential tool  for leveraging information technology (IT) in the transformation of  business and mission operations.", "As our experience with federal agencies has shown, attempting to  modernize and evolve IT environments without an enterprise architecture  to guide and constrain investments often results in operations and systems  that are duplicative, not well integrated, unnecessarily costly to maintain  and interface, and ineffective in supporting mission goals. A properly  managed enterprise architecture helps to clarify and optimize the  interdependencies and relationships among enterprise operations and their  supporting IT assets, so that agencies can base IT investment decisions on  an explicit and common understanding of both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s  environments. The development, implementation, and maintenance of  architectures are widely recognized as hallmarks of successful public and  private organizations, and their use is required by the Clinger-Cohen Act  and the implementing guidance, issued by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB).

Zachman also proposed six abstractions or models associated  with each of these perspectives.

Since that time, other federal entities have issued enterprise  architecture frameworks, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and  the Department of the Treasury. In September 1999, the federal CIO  Council published the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework  (FEAF), which was intended to provide federal agencies with a common  construct for their architectures, thereby facilitating the coordination of  common business processes, technology insertion, information flows, and  system investments among federal agencies. The FEAF describes an  approach, including models and definitions, for developing and  documenting architecture descriptions for multiorganizational functional  segments of the federal government.", "More recently, OMB established the Federal Enterprise Architecture  Program Management Office to develop a Federal Enterprise Architecture  (FEA) according to a collection of five \u201creference models,\u201d which are  intended to facilitate governmentwide improvement through cross-agency  analysis and the identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and  opportunities for collaboration, interoperability, and integration within and  across government agencies. The FEA reference models are summarized in  table 1.", "Although these post-Zachman frameworks differ in their nomenclatures  and modeling approaches, each consistently provides for defining an  enterprise\u2019s operations in both logical terms and technical terms, provides  for defining these perspectives for the enterprise\u2019s current and target  environments, and calls for a transition plan between the two.", "Several laws and regulations have established requirements and guidance,  respectively, for agencies\u2019 management of architectures, beginning with the  Clinger-Cohen Act in 1996, which directs the CIOs of major departments  and agencies to develop, maintain, and facilitate the implementation of IT  architectures as a means of integrating agency goals and business  processes with IT. OMB Circular A-130, which implements the Clinger- Cohen Act, requires that agencies document and submit their initial  enterprise architectures to OMB and that agencies submit updates to OMB  when significant changes to their enterprise architectures occur.

The focus at  Stage 2 is on assignment of roles and responsibilities and establishment  of plans for developing enterprise architecture products. Specifically, a  Stage 2 agency has designated a chief architect and established and  staffed a program office that is responsible for enterprise architecture  development. Further, a steering committee or group that has  responsibility for directing and overseeing the development has been  established, and the membership of the steering committee includes  business and IT representatives. At Stage 2, the agency either has plans  for developing or has begun development of at least some of the  necessary enterprise architecture products.

At Stage 3, an agency  focuses on actual development of enterprise architecture products. The  agency has defined the scope of its enterprise architecture as  encompassing the entire enterprise, whether an organization or a  functional area, and it has a written and approved policy demonstrating  institutional commitment. Although the products may not yet be  complete, they are intended to describe the agency in terms of business,  data, applications, and technology. Further, the products are to describe  the current and future states and the sequencing plan for transitioning  from current to future state.

An agency at Stage 4 has  complete and approved enterprise architecture products that it can use  to help select and control its portfolio of IT investments.

Because the enterprise  architecture is a corporate asset for systematically managing institutional  change, the support and sponsorship of the head of the enterprise are  essential to the success of the architecture effort. An approved enterprise  policy statement provides such support and sponsorship, promoting  institutional \u201cbuy in\u201d and encouraging resource commitment from  participating components. Equally important in demonstrating  commitment is vesting ownership of the architecture with an executive  body that collectively owns the enterprise.", "Attribute 2: Provides capability to meet commitment. The success of  the enterprise architecture effort depends largely on the organization\u2019s  capacity to develop, maintain, and implement the enterprise architecture.

Satisfaction  of the organization\u2019s commitment to develop, maintain, and implement an  enterprise architecture is demonstrated by the production of artifacts (e.g.,  the plans and products). Such artifacts demonstrate \u201cfollow through\u201d\u2014 actual enterprise architecture production. Satisfaction of commitment is  further demonstrated by senior leadership approval of enterprise  architecture documents and artifacts; such approval communicates  institutional endorsement and ownership of the architecture and the  change that it is intended to drive.", "Attribute 4: Verifies satisfaction of commitment. This attribute  focuses on measuring and disclosing the extent to which efforts to develop,  maintain, and implement the enterprise architecture have fulfilled stated  goals or commitments. Measuring such performance allows for tracking  progress that has been made toward stated goals, allows the appropriate  actions to be taken when performance deviates significantly from goals,  and creates incentives to influence both institutional and individual  behaviors.", "Collectively, these attributes form the basis by which an organization can  institutionalize management of any given function or program, such as  enterprise architecture management. Within each stage, each critical  success attribute includes between one and four core elements, which are  descriptions of a practice or condition that is needed for effective  enterprise architecture management. On the basis of the implicit  dependencies among the core elements, the EAMMF associates each  element with one of five hierarchical management stages, referred to as  maturity stages.

An organization  at Stage 2 recognizes that the enterprise architecture is a corporate asset by  vesting accountability for it in an executive body that represents the entire  enterprise. At this stage, an organization assigns enterprise architecture  management roles and responsibilities and establishes plans for developing  enterprise architecture products and for measuring program progress and  product quality. An organization at this stage also commits the necessary  resources for developing an architecture\u2014people, processes, and tools.

This committee or group membership has  enterprisewide representation. At Stage 2, the organization either has plans  for developing or has started developing at least some enterprise  architecture products, and it has fostered an enterprisewide awareness of  the value of enterprise architecture and its intended use in managing its IT  investments.

At  this stage, the scope of the architecture has been defined to encompass the  entire enterprise, whether an organization or a functional area. Although  the products may not be complete, they are intended to describe the  organization in terms of business, performance, information/data,  service/application, and technology (including security explicitly in each),  as provided for in the framework, methodology, tool, and management  plans. Further, the products are to describe the current (\u201cas-is\u201d) and future  (\u201cto-be\u201d) states and the plan for transitioning from the current to the future  state (the sequencing plan). As the products are developed and evolve, they  are subject to configuration management.

An organization at Stage 4 has completed  its enterprise architecture products, meaning that the products have been  approved by the enterprise architecture steering committee (established in  Stage 2) or an investment review board, and by the CIO. The completed  products collectively describe the enterprise in terms of business,  performance, information/data, service/application, and technology for  both its current and future operating states, and the products include a  sequencing plan for transitioning from the current to the future state.  Further, an independent agent has assessed the quality (i.e., completeness  and accuracy) of the enterprise architecture products. Additionally,  evolution of the approved products is governed by a written enterprise  architecture maintenance policy that is approved by the head of the  organization.", "Stage 5: Leveraging the EA to manage change. An organization at  Stage 5 has secured senior leadership approval of the enterprise  architecture products and a written institutional policy stating that IT  investments must comply with the architecture, unless granted an explicit  compliance waiver. Further, decision makers are using the architecture to  identify and address ongoing and proposed IT investments that are  conflicting, overlapping, not strategically linked, or redundant. As a result,  Stage 5 entities avoid unwarranted overlap across investments and ensure  maximum systems interoperability, which in turn ensures the selection and  funding of IT investments with manageable risks and returns.
