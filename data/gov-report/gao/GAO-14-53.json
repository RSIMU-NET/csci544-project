If they forgo medical care beforehand, these individuals may be in worse health and need costlier medical services after enrolling in Medicare compared to those with prior insurance.", "GAO was asked to review the effects of having prior health insurance coverage on Medicare beneficiaries. This report examines the health status, program spending, and use of services of Medicare beneficiaries with and without continuous health insurance coverage before Medicare enrollment. To examine the effects of beneficiaries' prior insurance coverage, GAO used data from the Health and Retirement Study and Medicare claims to conduct two types of multivariate analysis. GAO predicted probabilities of beneficiaries' reporting being in good health or better and values for program spending and beneficiaries' use of services.", "In comments on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services highlighted a key finding in GAO's report that beneficiaries with prior insurance used fewer or less costly medical services in Medicare compared with those without prior insurance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Beneficiaries with continuous health insurance coverage for approximately 6 years before enrolling in Medicare were more likely than those without prior continuous insurance to report being in good health or better during the first 6 years in Medicare. In particular, having prior continuous insurance raised the predicted probability that a beneficiary reported being in good health or better by nearly 6 percentage points during the first 6 years in Medicare.", "Beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had lower total program spending during the first year in Medicare compared with those without prior continuous insurance. Specifically, during the first year in Medicare, beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had approximately $2,300, or 35 percent, less in average predicted total spending than those without prior continuous insurance. Similarly, beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had lower institutional outpatient spending--for example, spending for services provided in a hospital outpatient setting--during the first and second years in Medicare compared with those without prior continuous insurance. In contrast, physician and other noninstitutional spending--spending for services provided by physicians, clinical laboratories, free-standing ambulatory surgical centers, and other noninstitutional providers--were similar during the early years in Medicare for beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance. However, during the fourth and fifth years in Medicare, beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had physician and other noninstitutional spending that was about 30 percent higher than beneficiaries without prior continuous insurance.", "Beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance had more physician office visits during the first 5 years in Medicare compared with those without prior continuous insurance. Specifically, during the first 5 years in Medicare, the difference in the average predicted number of physician office visits between beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance ranged from 1.3 to 2.5, or 23 to 46 percent. This utilization pattern may indicate that, even after Medicare enrollment, beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance continued to access medical services differently from those without prior continuous insurance. The number of institutional outpatient visits was similar for beneficiaries with and without prior continuous insurance for the first 5 years after Medicare enrollment.", "Taken together, GAO's results show that, consistent with those of some other researchers, beneficiaries with prior continuous insurance used fewer or less costly medical services compared with beneficiaries without such insurance during the early years in Medicare, because they either were in better health or were accustomed to accessing medical services differently. This suggests that the extent to which individuals enroll in private insurance before age 65 has implications for beneficiaries' health status and Medicare spending."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 7 million individuals aged 55 to 64, the pre-Medicare population,  lacked health insurance coverage in the first half of 2012, accounting for  more than 18 percent of this population.

Health insurance protects individuals against the risk of financial  hardship when they need medical care, and uninsured pre-Medicare  individuals may refrain from seeking necessary care because of the cost.  As a result, these individuals may be in worse health and may require  more costly medical services after Medicare enrollment compared with  those who were insured. They also may, out of habit, continue to seek  care differently.

HRS is a longitudinal panel study that surveys a  representative sample of more than 26,000 Americans aged 50 and older  every 2 years. From HRS, we obtained information from 1996 through  2010 on beneficiaries\u2019 self-reported health insurance coverage before  Medicare, self-reported health status in Medicare, and demographic and  health-related characteristics. From the Medicare data, we obtained  information from 2001 through 2010 on multiple categories of  beneficiaries\u2019 Medicare spending (total, institutional outpatient, and  physician and other noninstitutional spending) and services (institutional  outpatient and physician office visits).", "Unlike other studies, we performed our analysis for multiple groups of  Medicare beneficiaries categorized by their length of Medicare  enrollment. This approach enabled us to maximize the number of  beneficiaries in our study groups and to measure the effects of prior  continuous insurance on health status, spending, and use of services at  several points in time after Medicare enrollment. About 4,500 HRS  respondents met our initial criteria that they were in their first, second,  third, fourth, fifth, or sixth year of Medicare enrollment between 2001 and  2010 and provided information about their insurance coverage in each of  the three consecutive HRS surveys preceding Medicare enrollment.  Unlike some other studies on this topic that have categorized prior  insurance based on a single point in time, we categorized beneficiaries as  having prior continuous insurance only if they reported receiving private  insurance in the three consecutive HRS surveys before Medicare  enrollment at age 65\u2014a period spanning approximately 6 years. We  excluded additional respondents who were enrolled in Medicare or  Medicaid prior to Medicare enrollment at age 65 because their enrollment  in these programs may have been due, at least in part, to poor health,  which could bias our results. We also excluded respondents who had  missing or incomplete data for important variables. Our final study sample  size ranged from 3,201 to 1,152, depending on the analysis.", "Our analyses of health status relied on HRS data that were provided  every other year. Therefore, for these analyses, we defined three distinct  groups of beneficiaries who were in (1) their first and second years of  Medicare, (2) their third and fourth years of Medicare, and (3) their fifth  and sixth years of Medicare from 2001 through 2010 (see fig. 1 in app. I).  We classified beneficiaries as being in good health or better if they  reported in HRS that they were in excellent, very good, or good health.We used logistic regression analysis to estimate these beneficiaries\u2019 self- reported health status and predict probabilities of their reporting being in  good health or better assuming both that they did and that they did not  have prior continuous insurance.", "Our analyses of spending and use of services used Medicare data that  were available each year. Therefore, for these analyses, we defined five  distinct groups of beneficiaries who were in their first, second, third,  fourth, and fifth years of enrollment between 2001 through 2010 (see   fig. 2 in app. I). We used generalized linear models to estimate  beneficiaries\u2019 spending and use of services and predict values for these  variables assuming both that they did and that they did not have prior  continuous insurance.", "We included the following independent variables in all of our analyses:  prior continuous insurance, demographic characteristics (census division,  education level, income, marital status, race, and sex), potential health  risk factors (body mass index and smoking status), and ever having had a  diagnosis of any of eight health conditions (arthritis, cancer, diabetes,  heart problems, high blood pressure, lung problems, psychological  problems, and stroke). For our analyses of spending and use of services,  we also included a variable for the number of months a beneficiary was  alive during the year to control for partial-year spending and use of  services. In addition, for our spending analyses, we adjusted spending to  calendar year 2011 constant dollars. Differences in health status,  spending, and use of services that are discussed in the text of this report  are based on results that were statistically significant at a 95 percent  confidence level. The tables display all of our analytical results\u2014whether  or not the results were statistically significant at conventional confidence  levels\u2014and indicate the level of statistical significance.", "Our methodology had some important limitations. Because we used  multiple exclusion criteria to define our study populations, our results  might not be representative of the entire Medicare population. However,  we compared certain characteristics of our study populations with those  of the entire Medicare population and noted only small differences. In  addition, like other researchers, we were limited in our ability to control for  instances where individuals\u2019 poor health led to the loss of insurance  rather than the loss of insurance leading to poor health. To address this  issue, we controlled for potential health risk factors and diagnoses of  eight health conditions in all of our analyses, and we excluded  beneficiaries who were enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid before age 65  because their enrollment in these programs may be due, at least in part,  to poor health. Furthermore, because HRS does not collect health  insurance plan information, we were unable to control for variations in  health plan benefits and coverage options in our analyses. Moreover,  although we structured our analyses to capture as many beneficiaries as  possible, the number of beneficiaries in our study populations may not be  large enough to find significant differences for some variables. We  ensured the reliability of the HRS and Medicare data used in this report  by reviewing related documentation, performing appropriate electronic  data checks, and discussing the data with officials from Acumen, LLC.

However, research regarding the extent to which having prior  health insurance coverage affects spending and use of medical services  after enrolling in Medicare has produced inconsistent results.

The  group that found that having prior insurance was linked to lower spending  used a more rigorous definition of prior insurance based on a longitudinal  assessment of insurance coverage before age 65 rather than a point-in- time assessment. This group included beneficiaries who were enrolled in  Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health programs before age  65 in its analysis and used a statistical weighting methodology to control  for the possibility of reverse causality between health status and  insurance coverage. More specifically, some individuals may have  experienced declining health before age 65 that led to loss of  employment, loss of private insurance coverage, and subsequent  enrollment in government health programs. The group that did not find  that having prior insurance was linked to lower spending criticized the  inclusion of these beneficiaries, noting that many individuals transition to  government health programs before age 65 because of poor health,  thereby resulting in an overestimate of the effect of having prior insurance  on their Medicare spending after age 65.
