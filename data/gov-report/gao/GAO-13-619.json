Leadership from the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD Policy) and U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) have not been able to resolve disagreements among accounting community members, thereby impacting DOD's ability to meet the mandated goal of increasing its capability and capacity to account for 200 missing persons a year by 2015. DOD averaged 72 identifications annually in the decade ending in 2012. GAO found the following areas of progress and continuing areas of weakness:", "In response to a 2009 direction from the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the accounting community has begun drafting a community-wide plan to meet the accounting-for goal, but as of July 2013 this plan had not been completed due to a fragmented approach to planning and disputes among community members. Without a community-wide plan, members have had varied success in obtaining resources to meet the goal.", "DOD is working to clarify its guidance, but roles and responsibilities for community members are not well defined, and this lack of clarity has led to overlap in key aspects of the mission such as investigations.", "DOD does not have agreements with all combatant commands to conduct operations to find missing persons outside of PACOM's area of responsibility. JPAC negotiated an updated agreement with European Command, signed in April 2013, but it has not negotiated similar agreements with any of the other four geographic combatant commands.", "While DOD has established criteria to prioritize recovery efforts for missing persons from the Vietnam War, it has not established criteria to prioritize potentially recoverable missing persons from other conflicts.", "DOD has not established mechanisms to sustain recent improvements in communication among community members.", "Statute and DOD guidance assign responsibility for the accounting mission to many organizations and each reports through a different line of authority. Thus, no single entity is responsible for communitywide personnel and resources. This fragmented organizational structure has exacerbated weaknesses in leadership, and most community organizations GAO spoke to believe alternative structures would be more effective. A majority of community members GAO surveyed conveyed a lack of confidence about the organizational structure. For example, 12 out of 13 survey respondents ranked an option with a more centralized chain of command as the most effective in enabling the accounting community to achieve its mission. Until top-level leaders at USD Policy and PACOM can ensure that all mission activities are carried out with unity of effort, inefficient and potentially avoidable overlap, unexpected operational concerns, and disagreements among members could continue to hinder the mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making nine recommendations to DOD, including for example: examining options to reorganize; clarifying responsibilities for the accounting community; improving planning, guidance, and criteria to prioritize cases; and sustaining communication.

Several DOD components and organizations, collectively known as the  missing persons accounting community, have a role in accounting for  missing persons. Specifically, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Affairs who by law also serves as  the Director of the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office  (DPMO), under the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD Policy),  is responsible for policy, control, and oversight of the missing persons  accounting program.

We also interviewed officials from all of the missing  persons accounting community organizations as well officials from top- level leadership offices and other stakeholder organizations, to obtain  their perspectives on DOD\u2019s missing persons accounting efforts and the  organization of the accounting community. Further, we reviewed  proposed and funded plans developed by members of the accounting  community to address the accounting-for goal, and determined the  various community members\u2019 processes for requesting resources and  additional resources the community members had requested or planned  to request to meet the goal. In addition, we assessed roles and  responsibilities of various community members by examining related  statutes and guidance and discussing areas of potential overlap with  community members and key stakeholders, such as family and veterans  groups. We also discussed guidance available to accounting community  members for potential operations outside of PACOM\u2019s area of  responsibility, and examined the extent to which the community had  established criteria for prioritizing potentially recoverable missing persons.  We discussed and reviewed communication efforts, and determined the  status of a statutory requirement to establish personnel files for all  unaccounted for persons. Although we found some discrepancies in  DPMO\u2019s data, we found these data to be sufficiently reliable to enumerate  unaccounted for missing persons for background and illustrative  purposes. The numbers also relate to our discussion on criteria for  prioritizing potentially recoverable missing persons. Finally, we reviewed  the existing organizational structure of the accounting community, as well  as prior organizational assessments, and we administered a  questionnaire to the accounting community member organizations and  several DOD stakeholder organizations regarding their views on  alternative options for organizing the accounting community. This  questionnaire is presented in appendix I, along with a summary of the  responses. We compared the results of these analyses with consideration  of several practices GAO has identified in prior work that can benefit  collaborating agencies, including (1) having overarching plans to align  activities and resources; (2) clearly defining roles and responsibilities; (3)  articulating agreements in formal documents; (4) communicating  frequently; and (5) having a single designated leader.

While JPAC initially began hiring additional personnel and conducting  additional operations as called for by its plan, JPAC officials told us that  the planned rates for increasing investigation and recovery missions were  not feasible, in part because JPAC was unable to include the planned  number of investigation and recovery missions for fiscal year 2013 and  beyond when developing its operational plans. In addition, JPAC\u2019s plan  called for 114 sites to be added to the master excavation list in fiscal year  2012, but only 56 sites were added in that year. Further, the JPAC plan  presumed there would be five recovery missions each year for the Korean  War, but a planned recovery mission in North Korea was cancelled in  2012 due to political developments and it is unknown when the political  environment will again enable access to that country.", "According to JPAC and DPMO officials, some of the shortfalls associated  with the JPAC plan\u2019s increases could be made up by including  identifications from disinterments.

DPMO officials said it was their intent that no  more than 50 percent of identifications would come from disinterred  persons. JPAC has established a dedicated disinterment cell to  investigate and identify cases that would be likely candidates for  disinterment, according to comments from JPAC on a draft of this report.

Oklahoma was denied by the Navy.", "JPAC officials explained that they have identified some new methods  having the potential to improve their efforts, such as placing more  investigative capabilities in JPAC\u2019s forward detachments and using  contractors in some locations to help locate potential recovery sites.  However, changes to JPAC\u2019s operating environment\u2014such as the  decreased number of investigation and recovery missions, the inability to  access North Korea, disinterments, and JPAC\u2019s new methods\u2014have not  yet coalesced into a revised plan. As of May 2013, the JPAC plan had not  been updated to reflect any of these changed circumstances, and JPAC  officials told us they did not expect the JPAC plan to be updated until after  a community-wide plan had been finalized.

We have  previously reported that interagency collaboration can be hindered when  agencies have different planning processes and funding sources to plan  for and conduct their national security activities, which can result in a  patchwork of activities that waste scarce funds and limit the overall  effectiveness of federal efforts. An increased number of identifications  will require the support of as well as participation from other members of  the accounting community. For example, the Armed Forces DNA  Identification Laboratory will have to increase the number of DNA  analyses it performs in order for JPAC to support an increased number of  identifications, and the service casualty offices will have to communicate  with increased numbers of families and arrange and budget for more  funerals every year. According to JPAC officials, when their competing  plans were being developed, there was never a community gathering to  discuss how to increase DOD\u2019s capability and capacity to account for  missing persons.", "In 2012 the new DASD/DPMO Director, who was a former JPAC  Commander, made an effort to mend relations between DPMO and JPAC  and develop a community-wide plan to address the accounting-for goal.  DPMO officials told us in June 2012 that they were trying to develop such  a plan, incorporating the already funded JPAC plan, and that they  intended to complete the plan within 6 months. Since that time, DPMO  has instituted several positive steps. For example, it established a task  team, known as the purple team, with representation from all community  members to work on developing the community-wide plan and resolving  areas of disagreement in the community. DPMO also initiated a \u201clean six  sigma\u201d review,community. The report resulting from this review made several  recommendations related to areas such as organizational alignment,  strategic planning, accounting strategy, and process and technology.  DPMO officials said that the report was not received by DPMO until May  2013, and that DPMO plans to take actions to address some of these  recommendations. However, DPMO officials told us in January 2013 that  disagreements between JPAC and DPMO had hindered progress in  developing the community-wide plan. According to both DPMO and JPAC  officials, the areas of disagreement included topics such as (1) the   which evolved to encompass the entire accounting  division of research and analysis responsibilities between DPMO and  JPAC, (2) determination of the appropriate levels of effort for each of the  various conflicts, and (3) agreement on a policy to address lower priority  cases that have been on JPAC\u2019s list of potential recovery sites for a long  time. As of June 2013, DPMO and JPAC officials said that the areas of  disagreement had been informally resolved and needed to be  documented. DPMO has developed a draft of the community-wide plan,  but DPMO officials explained that the draft would not be sufficiently  comprehensive to share for review among the community members until  it included the resolved areas of disagreement. The officials stated that  the revised timeframe for finalizing the community-wide plan is by the end  of calendar year 2013.", "Without a community-wide plan, the accounting community organizations  have had varied success in identifying and obtaining funds and resources  to meet the accounting-for goal. Moreover, there is no community-wide  process to provide resources for the missing persons accounting mission.  While DOD guidance designates the DASD as being responsible for  advocating for program funding requirements and resources for  implementation of the missing persons accounting mission, each  member organization of the accounting community has its own processes  for requesting resources, because they belong to diverse parent  organizations, and these processes are not integrated or coordinated.  Based on funding data provided by each organization, DOD\u2019s obligations  for the accounting mission have risen each year since fiscal year 2008, as  shown in table 1 below, with obligations from JPAC and the Army  casualty office showing most of the increases over this period. JPAC  received the most funding each year, followed by DPMO, and then the  Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory.", "Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in  Action Accounting Command  Armed Forces DNA Identification  Laboratory Marine Corps service casualty  office  Air Force service casualty office Totals may not add due to rounding.", "In response to the accounting-for goal, the accounting community  members obtained varying levels of additional resources. JPAC along  with the Marine Corps and Army casualty offices successfully obtained  additional resources to support the increased goal. The JPAC plan that  was integrated into DOD\u2019s budget request proposed to provide JPAC with  253 additional personnel and $312 million in additional funding over fiscal  years 2012 through 2016. According to JPAC officials, although JPAC  was on track to implement the programmed personnel and budget growth  to increase its capability and capacity, the DOD civilian workforce cap  and the budget reductions and expected furloughs associated with  sequestration placed those increases at risk. For example, JPAC had  planned to hire 91 civilians in fiscal year 2013; however, JPAC officials  explained that JPAC was granted an exception to the workforce cap to  hire 6 personnel in fiscal year 2013. Without the ability to hire additional  personnel, the officials said JPAC will be very challenged to meet the  growth in planned operations, which could jeopardize its ability to meet  the accounting-for goal. For example, in fiscal year 2013 JPAC had  planned to conduct 36 joint field activities (which include multiple recovery  missions and investigation missions in a specific country), and that  number has been reduced to 30 joint field activities. The Marine Corps  added one additional civilian position in its casualty office starting in fiscal  year 2013. With the drawdown in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,  Marine Corps officials said that they expected the demand for current loss  cases to decrease as the workload from past cases potentially increases,  thus enabling workload to be assigned to other staff personnel as  needed. To address the accounting-for goal, the Army requested and  received authorization to hire 10 additional civilian personnel to support  the increased requirements associated with the addition of World War II  to the accounting mission.", "DPMO, the Navy, and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory  each intend to request additional resources through the DOD budget  process to support the increased accounting-for goal. Officials from all of  these organizations told us that if they did not receive additional funding,  their ability to meet the accounting-for goal would be negatively affected.  After DPMO\u2019s proposed plan to address the accounting-for goal was  disapproved in 2010, DPMO officials said they had made no progress in  identifying or developing any additional capability and capacity  requirements that would be needed at DPMO. However, in conjunction  with the community-wide planning efforts, in late 2012 DPMO began  assessing its funding and resource needs to meet the accounting-for  goal, and DPMO officials told us they would request funding for any  identified needs as part of the budget process for fiscal years 2015  through 2019. The Navy POW/MIA Branch has requested additional  funding and personnel each year since the accounting-for goal was  established, as part of the Navy\u2019s internal budget development process,  but it has not received any additional resources. The Navy POW/MIA  Branch has submitted a budget estimate for fiscal year 2015 to its  leadership, requesting three additional personnel to begin a World War II  branch, but as of May 2013 Navy officials said that no decision had been  made on this proposal. The officials told us that, because 2015 is the year  when the increased accounting-for goal takes effect, they expect this  issue to become a higher priority in the future for the Navy to include in its  budget submission to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory officials told us that unless  additional resources are approved, the laboratory will be unable to meet  increased demand, creating a bottleneck in JPAC\u2019s ability to meet the  increased number of identifications. Officials projected that their  laboratory would need to increase the number of DNA analyses it  performs from about 1,300 to approximately 2,600 specimens each year.  With their current personnel and funding levels, officials explained that the  laboratory cannot provide the necessary support for the increased  requirements. The laboratory requested additional funding and personnel  as part of the Army\u2019s budget formulation process for 2 consecutive years,  but the Army did not approve its requests for additional resources. Armed  Forces DNA Identification Laboratory officials said that in November 2012  they again requested additional funding and personnel for fiscal years  2013 and 2014 through the Army\u2019s internal budget process, and this  request was under consideration as of May 2013. In addition, the officials  said that the laboratory submitted a request as part of the Army\u2019s budget  formulation process for additional personnel and funding for fiscal years  2015 through 2019, and as of May 2013 this request was still under  consideration by the Army.", "The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory also identified some  other funding and personnel challenges. First, some of the equipment it  uses to perform DNA analyses has been discontinued and will not be  serviced by the manufacturer and must be replaced prior to fiscal year  2016, but equipment replacement costs have not been programmed into  its budget. The laboratory included the funds needed to replace this  equipment in its request for additional resources. Second, laboratory  officials explained that funding concerns prevent management from easily  rebalancing staff workload as needed to adjust to changes in demand for  different types of DNA analysis. For example, according to officials, the  laboratory lacks the flexibility to easily redirect contractors who typically  perform nuclear DNA analysis for current conflicts to perform that same  type of DNA analysis on specimens from past conflicts, because of the  different way in which these efforts are funded. Third, these officials  expressed concern with the laboratory\u2019s heavy reliance on contractor  personnel, who provide all of its scientific and technical support. They  stated that if the current personnel provider loses the contract, the  laboratory\u2019s entire scientific staff might have to be replaced and all DNA  analyses would cease until new individuals are hired and trained  according to accredited forensic standards.", "The Air Force\u2019s efforts in meeting the missing persons mission are  performed by both its mortuary affairs and its casualty offices, and the  casualty office has expressed a need for additional resources. The Air  Force mortuary affairs office does not intend to request additional  resources as officials there said they believe they have sufficient  resources for the mission. Because the Air Force was not established  until 1947, subsequent to World War II, all missing persons from World  War II era air losses are handled by the Army casualty office. However,  Air Force casualty office officials stated that they need three additional  positions to support the mission, because three positions were eliminated  in 2012 as the result of an Office of the Secretary of Defense budget  decision and in anticipation of a merger of the Air Force casualty and  mortuary affairs offices. However, the casualty office officials said the  merger of the two offices is now on indefinite hold, and they still have a  requirement for these three positions. They further stated that they may  request funding for additional personnel some time in the future, and that  the Air Force casualty office\u2019s ability to support the mission may be  degraded without additional resources.", "The Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory does not intend to request  additional resources to increase its capability and capacity at the present  time. Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory officials said that neither they  nor the Air Force could justify seeking additional resources to increase  their capability and capacity without receiving a more definite demand for  an increase in their services from DPMO or JPAC, which they have not  received. These officials stated that they expected additional funding  would be needed for the equipment laboratory to keep pace with  increased demand for their analyses; however, JPAC told the equipment  laboratory that they did not forecast any increased requirements for the  Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory. Until DOD finalizes a community- wide plan, that addresses the resource needs of community members, as  well as changes in planned operations and the extent to which  disinterments will be performed, the accounting community will be  challenged to justify the resources it needs to increase DOD\u2019s capability  and capacity to account for at least 200 missing persons a year by 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Guidance Does Not Clearly Articulate Roles and Responsibilities for All Accounting Community Organizations", "paragraphs": ["While DOD is working to revise its existing guidance and develop new  guidance, the roles and responsibilities of the various members of the  missing persons accounting community are not all clearly articulated in  existing DOD directives or instructions. We have previously reported on  the need for collaborating agencies to work together to define and agree  on their roles and responsibilities. Such guidance can help agencies  overcome differences in missions, cultures, and ways of doing business  by providing strategic direction for activities and articulating a common  outcome toward which they can collaboratively work. DOD has  established several directives and instructions related to the missing  persons accounting program. However, none of this guidance clearly  delineates the specific roles and responsibilities of all the organizations  comprising the missing persons accounting community in the key areas  that we examined. Disagreements over roles and responsibilities where  the guidance is broad or vague enough to support different interpretations  have led to discord, lack of collaboration, and friction among the  community\u2019s members, and particularly between DPMO and JPAC. For  example, DPMO views itself as having primary responsibility for research  and analysis, and its officials expressed concerns to us over the  increased research and analysis role performed by JPAC. Similarly,  JPAC views itself as having the lead on operational activities, such as  conducting investigation and recovery missions, and JPAC officials  expressed concerns with DPMO\u2019s plans to conduct some operational  activities. Conflicting views such as these have contributed to the ongoing  disputes between the two organizations. Moreover, the lack of clarity in  the guidance has given rise to overlapping and fragmented efforts among  accounting community members. We have previously reported that  overlap in efforts may be appropriate in some instances, especially if  agencies can leverage each others\u2019 efforts. In other instances, overlap  may be unintended, may be unnecessary, or may represent an inefficient  use of U.S. government resources. As described in table 2, in  implementing the accounting mission, overlapping and duplicativeefforts have led to inconsistent practices and inefficiencies in four key  areas: (1) equipment and artifact identification and analysis, (2) research  and analysis, (3) investigations, and (4) family outreach and external  communications.", "JPAC and the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory disagree about the  laboratory\u2019s roles and responsibilities for equipment and artifact  identification and analysis, and DOD guidance is vague regarding those  responsibilities. DOD Directive 2310.07E directs JPAC to work in  \u201cconsonance\u201d with, among others, the Life Sciences Equipment  Laboratory to search for, recover, and identify remains, as appropriate.", "The PACOM transition planshall establish or continue its working relationship with the Life Sciences  Equipment Laboratory. However, neither document specifies or  differentiates the roles and responsibilities of the Life Sciences Equipment  Laboratory and the JPAC Central Identification Laboratory for equipment  and artifact identification and analysis. A memorandum of agreement  governing work between JPAC and the Life Sciences Equipment  Laboratory was negotiated in 2004, but this agreement does not establish  clear roles and responsibilities in several areas. As a result, the  interactions between JPAC\u2019s Central Identification Laboratory and the Life  Sciences Equipment Laboratory have been inefficient and ineffective and  have led to underutilizing government resources, as the following  examples demonstrate.   that established JPAC states that JPAC  First, JPAC and Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory officials disagree  about the value provided by the equipment laboratory\u2019s analyses. JPAC\u2019s  life support equipment analysis capability overlaps with the analysis that  the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory provides. A JPAC official stated  that the equipment laboratory\u2019s current operational support serves as  unnecessary overlap. JPAC stated that its life support investigators are  able to produce reports that are adequate to support an identification and  are produced under faster timeframes than the reports prepared by the  Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory. In contrast, Life Sciences  Equipment Laboratory officials stated that their capabilities are  complementary to JPAC\u2019s. These officials recognized JPAC\u2019s need for  artifact expertise in the field, but noted that JPAC\u2019s field analysis reports  do not have the same fidelity as the laboratory analysis they provide. In  addition, JPAC officials said that they had discussed concerns about the  length and utility of the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory\u2019s reports, but  that the equipment lab had made no changes to address JPAC\u2019s  concerns. DPMO officials stated that DPMO has been working with the  Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory to make their reports better conform  with what JPAC would like to receive, and better enable the equipment  laboratory to contribute to the accounting mission.", "Second, JPAC officials criticized the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory  for not providing timely analyses when JPAC\u2019s Central Identification  Laboratory sent materials to the equipment laboratory, noting that cases  can go from being unresolved to resolved while the equipment lab is  preparing its report. However, we found that about half of the cases that  JPAC\u2019s Central Identification Laboratory sent to the Life Sciences  Equipment Laboratory for analysis in 2011 and 2012 had already been  resolved, and Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory officials told us they  did not intend to conduct any analysis of those cases\u2019 items. Records of  the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory show that of the 27 cases JPAC  sent during this 2-year period, 13 had been accounted for prior to JPAC\u2019s  sending the artifacts and a fourteenth was accounted for 2 weeks after  JPAC sent the artifacts. The memorandum of agreement governing work  between JPAC and the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory does not  indicate whether it is appropriate for JPAC to request the Life Sciences  Equipment Laboratory to analyze resolved cases, but it would appear that  no utility is provided by a Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory report that  is requested and prepared after the missing person has already been  accounted for, as it would be duplicative of any report that had been  prepared by JPAC to support the identification. Life Sciences Equipment  Laboratory officials stated that their analysis was unnecessary for those  cases, and that expending scarce resources and staffing to work on a  resolved case was not a sound business practice and would constitute a  waste of government resources. JPAC officials explained that in the past,  they retained all materials until a recovery site had been closed\u2014which  can take years\u2014and that older case work associated with resolved cases  or cases with little prospect of identification were not routinely submitted  to the equipment lab. However, in response to criticism from the Life  Sciences Equipment Laboratory, JPAC officials said that they changed  procedures and now send all Vietnam-era life support materials to the Life  Sciences Equipment Laboratory at least quarterly, regardless of whether  a case has been resolved.", "Third, JPAC and Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory officials disagree  about roles and responsibilities in terms of which conflicts and types of  equipment the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory can analyze. JPAC  officials told us it is unlikely that they would forward case work to the Life  Sciences Equipment Laboratory for conflicts other than Vietnam, and that  they do not send ground equipment remnants to the equipment  laboratory, regardless of conflict. These officials stated that the Life  Sciences Equipment Laboratory\u2019s core expertise was the Vietnam War  era and life sciences aircraft equipment, and that the lab\u2019s competency  with regard to World War II sites was no greater than JPAC\u2019s capabilities.  Conversely, Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory officials stated that their  capabilities can support analysis of cases for conflict periods ranging from  World War I through current military operations for all military services,  and that their mission includes analyzing artifacts recovered at aircraft  crash or ground action loss sites. The 2004 memorandum of agreement  between JPAC and the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory states that  the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory has the capability to provide  analysis for equipment from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War,  and current day conflicts. The agreement focuses on aircraft equipment  but is otherwise very general as to the types of artifacts to be provided to  the equipment laboratory. According to Life Sciences Equipment  Laboratory officials, its facilities house military aircraft, other equipment,  and artifacts from conflicts dating back to World War I, with a significant  amount from World War II, and they have the capability to analyze aircraft  and other equipment artifacts from multiple conflicts. Life Sciences  Equipment Laboratory officials expressed concern that JPAC and its  Central Identification Laboratory are trying to exclude the Life Sciences  Equipment Laboratory from the accounting process by downplaying its  potential contributions. Until DOD guidance or the memorandum of  agreement between JPAC and the Life Sciences Equipment Laboratory is  revised to more clearly define their roles and responsibilities, including the  appropriate scope of the equipment laboratory\u2019s case work, the inefficient  and ineffective interactions between the two organizations are likely to  continue.", "DOD guidance is unclear regarding the research and analysis  responsibilities of DPMO and JPAC. DOD Directive 2310.07E states  that the responsibilities of the Director of DPMO include overseeing  archival research; standardizing procedures for methodology and  prioritization; conducting national and international archival research; and  coordinating with JPAC, which also conducts archival research, to  improve efficiency and prevent duplication of effort. However, the  directive does not provide details regarding DPMO\u2019s specific research  and analysis responsibilities, and does not provide a detailed description  of JPAC\u2019s responsibilities. The October 2003 PACOM transition plan that  established JPAC does not provide clarification and states that JPAC will  conduct archival research and other analysis. While JPAC\u2019s standard  operating procedures document delineates its research and analysis  responsibilities, it states that the authority to perform these responsibilities  come from the DOD directive and PACOM. However, neither the directive  nor the transition plan clearly delineates JPAC\u2019s responsibilities with  regard to research. DPMO and JPAC officials both told us that the  absence of defined responsibilities in the areas of research and analysis  has been a source of disagreements between the two organizations.  DPMO officials told us that their organization has the lead responsibility to  perform research and analysis, while JPAC officials contended that they  have a role particularly as it relates to supporting investigations and  recovery missions. Until DOD clarifies and differentiates DPMO\u2019s and  JPAC\u2019s respective research and analysis responsibilities, the two  organizations will continue to have overlapping functions, and  disagreements are likely to continue.", "DOD guidance is also unclear with respect to defining investigation  responsibilities for DPMO and JPAC, and this lack of clarity has enabled  each organization to develop its own operational roles, which overlap one  another. For example, both DPMO and JPAC conduct investigations for  missing persons from World War II in Europe. DOD Directive 2310.07E  states that the DASD shall exercise policy, control, and oversight within  DOD for the entire process of accounting for missing persons, but it does  not mention what role, if any, DPMO should play in performing  investigations. Further, the directive does not describe JPAC\u2019s  investigation responsibilities. JPAC\u2019s 2013 operational plan states that  JPAC conducts worldwide investigation, recovery, and laboratory  operations to identify missing personnel from past conflicts in order to  support DOD\u2019s personnel accounting mission, and that JPAC\u2019s functions  include field investigations. JPAC officials contend that they are DOD\u2019s  primary operational organization for accounting for missing persons, and  that JPAC\u2019s operational responsibilities include having the primary role in  conducting investigations. In contrast, DPMO officials told us that their  organization also has an operational role, particularly as it relates to  performing investigations of World War II missing persons in many  European countries. DPMO officials told us that JPAC does not have the  capability and capacity to perform the investigative work for all World War  II cases by itself, and that DPMO has the personnel and expertise to  perform some investigations. Although the purple team has  recommended that JPAC perform all operational functions, in May 2013  DPMO officials told us that the disagreement between DPMO and JPAC  regarding investigation responsibilities had been resolved and that DPMO  will be conducting investigations for World War II cases outside of  PACOM\u2019s area of responsibility. However, this resolution has not yet  been documented. Until DOD clarifies and differentiates DPMO\u2019s and  JPAC\u2019s investigation responsibilities, the two organizations will continue  to have overlapping functions, and disagreements are likely to continue.", "While there is limited DOD guidance regarding family outreach and  external communications roles and responsibilities for DPMO and the  service casualty offices, there is no guidance on JPAC\u2019s roles and  responsibilities in this area. DOD Directive 5110.10 states that DPMO  shall establish and lead a communications and outreach program in  coordination with, among others, the service casualty offices to share  information with a variety of external stakeholders, including families of  unaccounted-for personnel, and shall serve as an advocate for families  throughout the accounting process. Further, this directive states that  DPMO will conduct communications and outreach with families of  unaccounted-for personnel through the appropriate service casualty  offices. DOD Instruction 1300.18 states that the military departments shall  maintain a service casualty office as a focal point on all casualty matters  and the concerned component will notify, advise, and assist the primary  next of kin in cases where the individual is deceased or missing. Neither  the directive nor the instruction mentions JPAC\u2019s role in this area, and the  JPAC transition plan does not mention JPAC\u2019s role either. In addition, the  guidance does not specify how DPMO, JPAC, and the service casualty  offices are to coordinate family outreach responsibilities with one another.  To carry out its family outreach and external communication  responsibilities, DPMO organizes periodic updates and annual  government briefings to keep family members informed and discuss their  specific cases. Although guidance does not assign a specific family  outreach goal to JPAC, JPAC\u2019s 2010 annual report notes that JPAC  conducts some family outreach activities by hosting numerous private  tours for family members and providing operational briefings and  individual family meetings at nine family update events. Service casualty  office officials told us they serve as the primary liaison for families. They  coordinate the briefings for the families concerning case status and  developments through the regularly scheduled updates and annual  government briefings organized by DPMO, as well as notify family  members of an identification and assist them with funeral arrangements.  None of the family organizations with which we spoke raised concerns  about DOD\u2019s having several organizations involved with family outreach  and external communications. However, without clear guidance regarding  the roles and responsibilities for each organization, there is potential for  inconsistent communication of information to family members and  external parties.", "Since 2010, DPMO has attempted to address the above-described issues  surrounding the accounting community organizations\u2019 roles and  responsibilities by developing new guidance or revising existing guidance,  but these efforts have not been completed. DPMO has drafted a revision  to DOD Directive 2310.07E and has also drafted a new DOD instruction  to provide more clarity with regard to roles and responsibilities. As of May  2013, however, neither the draft instruction nor the revised directive had  been finalized, because the drafts had been stymied by disagreements  among community members regarding their respective roles and  responsibilities as stated in the drafts. DPMO and JPAC\u2013\u2013the two primary  community organizations\u2013\u2013disagreed with regard to several areas of their  respective roles and responsibilities. For example, JPAC\u2019s initial  comments on the draft instruction expressed disagreements about issues  such as the role of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, the  responsibilities of JPAC and PACOM versus the other combatant  commands, and JPAC\u2019s specific roles and responsibilities in areas such  as research and analysis and investigations. Subsequent disagreements  on a later draft included similar issues, and DPMO officials held a meeting  with JPAC officials to resolve some of these issues. Both DPMO and  JPAC officials said they have made progress in addressing these areas of  disagreement, and DPMO officials stated that they hoped to have the  draft directive finalized by September 2013 and the draft instruction  published by March 2014. Because the drafts of these documents are still  under revision, it is unclear whether the final guidance will clarify the roles  and responsibilities sufficiently to address the four areas of overlap and  disagreements discussed above. Until DOD issues its revised directive  and new instruction that more clearly define the roles and responsibilities  of all the accounting community organizations, these areas of inefficient  overlap may continue, and the disputing factions within the accounting  community may continue to hinder future progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have Agreements in Place to Conduct Missing Persons Operations Outside of PACOM\u2019s Area of Responsibility", "paragraphs": ["While JPAC has negotiated an agreement with European Command  governing JPAC\u2019s operations in Europe, JPAC has not established  agreements or other appropriate mechanisms with the other combatant  commands to conduct operations outside of PACOM\u2019s area of  responsibility. DOD Directive 2310.07 applies to personnel  unaccounted for as a result of hostile acts in Operations Desert Shield  and Desert Storm, the Indochina War era, the Korean Conflict, the Cold  War, and World War II, as well as those who may be unaccounted for  after the cessation of future conflicts. This directive states that the  commanders of the combatant commands are responsible for supporting  personnel accounting operations within their areas of responsibility. It also  states that PACOM has designated JPAC as the command office of  primary responsibility for personnel accounting matters pertaining to  losses due to hostile acts, and that PACOM shall exercise combatant  command authority over JPAC.", "Investigations and recoveries associated with World War II may require  operations in combatant command areas other than PACOM, and  combatant commands have expressed differing opinions as to whether  PACOM should conduct worldwide operations to support the missing  persons accounting mission. DOD estimates that more than 73,000  persons are missing from World War II and are located in the areas of  responsibility of all geographic combatant commands (see figure 2  above). For example, an estimated 1,444 are missing in Northern  Command\u2019s area of responsibility, and 997 are missing in Africa  Command\u2019s area of responsibility. JPAC and its predecessor organization  were originally placed within PACOM because DOD\u2019s accounting efforts  were focused on persons unaccounted-for from the Vietnam and Korean  conflicts. While the establishment of JPAC to conduct operations in  support of the missing persons accounting mission was approved by the  Deputy Secretary of Defense and coordinated with the joint staff when  JPAC was formed in 2003, the scope of the accounting mission has  expanded since then, and the statutory addition of all World II losses in  2009 has increased the likelihood that JPAC will need to operate in all  of the combatant commands\u2019 areas of responsibility. According to DPMO  officials, some combatant commanders did not agree that PACOM should  conduct worldwide operations because these operations are beyond the  span of a single geographic combatant command and contrary to the  intent of the Unified Command Plan. JPAC, however, maintains that its  placement within PACOM continues to be appropriate in part because  about 70 percent of missing persons are believed to be located in  countries and seas within that command\u2019s area of responsibility.", "In anticipation of the increased activity in European Command\u2019s area of  responsibility related to World War II cases, JPAC and European  Command updated their 2007 memorandum of agreement governing  JPAC\u2019s operations. The updated agreement, signed in April 2013,  specifies European Command\u2019s and JPAC\u2019s responsibilities and  procedures for conducting investigations and recoveries in European  Command\u2019s area of responsibility. The stated purpose of the updated  agreement is to enable JPAC to accomplish its assigned mission  objectives while respecting European Command\u2019s enduring relationships  with nations within its area of responsibility. The agreement does not  confer JPAC with tasking authority over European Command personnel  and activities.", "JPAC officials told us that the statutory requirement to increase DOD\u2019s  capability and capacity, along with JPAC\u2019s recognition of the need to  expand operational activity in European Command\u2019s area of  responsibility, contributed to their decision to update the agreement with  European Command to establish more robust processes. The officials  explained that JPAC will have to conduct significantly more investigations  and recoveries than previously, including in countries where JPAC has  not routinely conducted operations. However, DPMO officials told us that  another reason for the updated agreement with European Command was  to address concerns from that command, as well as criticisms from  embassies and the joint staff, regarding some accounting efforts that had  been conducted in Europe. DPMO officials said that complexities  sometimes arise when interacting with foreign countries, explaining that  the archaeological laws and cultural considerations governing the  excavation, handling, and transport of human remains can be very  different in each European country, and can vary from JPAC\u2019s customary  mode of operations in the Asia-Pacific region. DPMO officials said that  foreign governments have their own protocols, cultural norms, and ways  of doing business, so to accomplish tasks and address  misunderstandings or obstacles, individuals who perform recovery  operations should coordinate closely with the combatant command that  possesses the knowledge, experience, and insight about these foreign  countries. While the updated agreement with European Command  represents a positive step toward addressing these issues, JPAC has not  negotiated similar agreements or other appropriate mechanisms with any  of the other combatant commands. We have previously reported that  articulating agreements in formal documents can strengthen agencies\u2019   JPAC officials explained that  commitment to working collaboratively.JPAC will seek agreements with other combatant commands as needed  as the accounting community expands its routine operational activities to  include the areas of responsibility of other combatant commands.  Moreover, the commander of JPAC stated that regardless of the  existence of memoranda of agreement, JPAC considers coordination with  other combatant commands as an imperative in its operations.  Nonetheless, until these imperatives are formalized in memoranda of  agreement or other documents specifying roles and responsibilities and  negotiated with all of the combatant commands in which DOD may need  to operate in its efforts to account for missing persons, future missing  persons operations may be adversely affected due to unexpected  operational or diplomatic concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Accounting Community Has Not Established Criteria to Prioritize Potentially Recoverable Missing Persons from Conflicts Other Than the Vietnam War", "paragraphs": ["While DPMO has established criteria to prioritize recovery efforts for  missing persons from the Vietnam War, the DOD accounting community  is hampered in its ability to estimate how many recoveries can reasonably  be expected from other conflicts, because DPMO has not established  criteria that can be used to prioritize missing persons cases by reflecting  feasibility of recovery. DOD Directive 2310.07E calls for DPMO to define,  maintain, and enumerate government lists to account for missing  persons. It further requires DPMO to render final analytic judgments as to  what constitutes the fullest possible accounting on each case by  identifying possibilities for future action and determining when further  investigation must be deferred, pending new information or determination  that no further pursuit is possible that may recover remains. One of the  goals of DPMO\u2019s research and analysis efforts is to develop a  comprehensive list of missing persons information for all past conflicts  starting with World War II, and to prioritize the missing persons cases  according to probability of recovery, according to DPMO officials.", "DPMO has made some progress toward establishing criteria to prioritize  missing persons cases from more recent conflicts, but it has not grouped  the cases from World War II into categories to help the accounting  community prioritize further investigations or recoveries of those cases.  DPMO officials told us they rely on conflict-specific information in  ascertaining why each individual is unaccounted for. According to these  officials, their most precise information pertains to missing persons from  the Vietnam War, for which a total of 1,647 persons are currently  unaccounted-for. The Vietnam War missing persons cases are  categorized as either \u201cfurther pursuit,\u201d \u201cno further pursuit,\u201d or  \u201cdeferred.\u201d In contrast, DPMO officials said they have the least  information about World War II missing persons, in part because of the  sheer magnitude of the number (more than 73,000). Although DPMO has  developed what officials consider to be a comprehensive list of World War  II missing persons, they have not yet developed categories or other  criteria comparable to the \u201cpursuit\u201d and \u201cno further pursuit\u201d categories  used for Vietnam War missing persons to help them prioritize their efforts  for World War II. In recent years, DPMO has undertaken an effort to  develop more detailed and complete information on the specific loss  circumstances for World War II cases, and has completed this work on  14,000 cases. As of May 2013, DPMO has not established a date by  when it expects to complete this effort for all World War II cases.  According to DPMO officials, the information they have for Korean War  missing persons is not as refined or detailed as that for Vietnam War  missing persons, but it is more detailed than the information for World  War II missing persons.", "Of the more than 83,000 missing persons who have yet to be accounted  for, DOD officials told us that recovery of only an estimated 25,000 to  35,000 persons can be reasonably expected, due to the circumstances of  some of the losses. According to DPMO officials, between 48,000 and  58,000 of the missing were in airplanes or ships lost over inaccessibly  mountainous regions throughout the world or in deep water, and these  persons cannot feasibly be recovered using technology available today.  DPMO estimates that almost 40,000 of World War II missing persons  were lost over deep water and are not recoverable. These officials  emphasized that this number is an estimate, and that until they do further  analysis they will not be able to determine whether missing persons in an  aircraft fell on land, shallow water, or deep water; and ultimately, which of  the missing persons have the potential to be recovered.", "DPMO officials told us that while they have enough information to support  the conclusion that large numbers of unaccounted-for persons are not  recoverable by means of current technology, they are concerned about  the reactions this conclusion might elicit from relatives of the missing  persons and from veterans and family organizations. Expressing their  empathy with such family members, these DPMO officials told us that  some family members hold out hope that the remains of their loved ones  can still be recovered, and that family members sometimes challenge  information presented to them, even when the information positively  identifies the remains. Officials from some family and veterans  organizations, however, told us that they would find it preferable for DOD  to use a smaller and more realistic number for estimating those missing  persons who are potentially recoverable, rather than the 83,000 figure the  department currently cites. JPAC officials told us that DPMO is  responsible for developing criteria that prioritizes cases, and that such  criteria would help JPAC to determine those cases having the best  potential for recovery and improve their ability to evaluate their  performance. Until DOD establishes criteria that can be used to prioritize  and determine the number of recoveries the department can reasonably  expect, the accounting community will remain unable to accomplish its  efforts to account for missing persons in the most efficient and effective  way possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Communication Efforts Are Ad Hoc, and Required Personnel Files Have Not Been Fully Developed", "paragraphs": ["While efforts have been made to improve communication among the  accounting community members, some communication efforts are still ad  hoc, and the accounting community has not fully developed personnel  files, as required by statute, to share information within the community.  We have previously reported that frequent communication among  collaborating agencies is a means to facilitate working across agency  boundaries and to prevent misunderstandings.", "Members of the accounting community have credited the current  DASD/DPMO Director with taking some recent steps to build trust and  cooperation through increased and improved communication among  accounting community members, but some of the new communication  efforts have not been formalized. For example, community-wide monthly  meetings and two week-long conferences have been broadly supported  by the accounting community as positive steps toward building unity and  have resulted in greater collaboration among community members.  Similarly, JPAC has involved DPMO in the development of JPAC\u2019s fiscal  year 2014 operational plan, and various officials within the community  said that JPAC has also begun sharing its completed operational plans  with other community members. Several community members stated that  having access to JPAC\u2019s operational plan has helped them in planning  and managing their work. Further, JPAC\u2019s Central Identification  Laboratory began giving service casualty offices earlier notification of  pending identifications. Service casualty officials explained that this has  allowed them to start researching and updating next-of-kin contact  information in advance, thereby expediting notifications to the next of kin  after JPAC\u2019s Central Identification Laboratory completes the identification.", "These improvements among the accounting community over the past  year represent an important step toward better collaboration among a  group of organizations that have been hampered by longstanding  conflicts among key leaders and organizations. However, it is unknown  whether these ad-hoc communication improvements within the  accounting community would be sustained after a change in leadership,  because DOD has not established a mechanism to sustain them, such as  the community-wide plan or other accounting community documents.  Until the accounting community institutionalizes mechanisms for  communication among the different community members, the community  is at risk of losing recent gains made in communication, and the  community could revert to an atmosphere of dissension and lack of  collaboration.", "Furthermore, the Army service casualty office worked with the Armed  Forces DNA Identification Laboratory to link their computer systems to  better communicate about the status of family reference samples.  Generally, to obtain family reference DNA samples, the service casualty  offices will first request a genealogy report to identify potential DNA  donors; then contact family members to request that they submit a DNA  sample, and follow up with family members to help ensure the sample is  provided; and finally communicate with the laboratory to determine  whether it has processed the sample. Some service casualty officials  explained that they did not have visibility over the status of family  reference sample requests unless they looked up each case in the  laboratory\u2019s system. According to Army officials, for services with a large  number of missing persons this level of individual case management was  difficult and hindered their ability to set priorities and manage their  workload. However, Army officials stated that they have been working to  link the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory\u2019s system with that  used by all four of the service casualty offices, so that the Army and the  other service casualty offices will receive an automated download of  family reference sample information. An Army official said that the  agreement to transfer the data was approved by all parties in February  2013, but that the laboratory is currently working on a means to correct  some data discrepancies. They expect the data file transfers to become  routine by June 2013 or soon thereafter. This ability to easily  communicate about the status of family reference samples will help all of  the service casualty offices ensure that the samples are obtained in a  timely manner, explained DNA laboratory officials, so that a potential  identification is not delayed due to the absence of a family reference  sample.", "Notwithstanding these positive steps toward improving communication  and collaboration, the accounting community has not yet established a  personnel file for all persons unaccounted-for, as required by statute.  DOD is required to ensure that the personnel files contain all relevant  information pertaining to a missing person and are readily accessible by  all elements of the department involved in the effort to account for the person. After passage of the law that established this requirement,DPMO initiated efforts to convert a case management system under  development for personnel recovery efforts for additional use in missing  persons accounting efforts. More than $4.8 million was spent in  developing this system, but DPMO told us that the effort was ultimately  terminated due to such problems as adapting to the changed focus and  managing and funding the increased size and scope of the program.  Further, according to DPMO officials, the effort was unsuccessful  because it was developed without input from or collaboration with any  members of the accounting community. DPMO officials told us that  DPMO is currently looking for a system that can be used for this purpose,  and that DPMO intends to request funds for this effort as part of its  budget submission for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. According to  DPMO officials, digital case files already exist for all missing persons from  the Vietnam and Korean Wars. They said that DPMO, in partnership with  the Army and JPAC, has contracted to digitize all of the World War II  deceased personnel files, and this effort is expected to be completed in  September 2015, although the contract may be extended if needed.  Digitizing the World War II records is a large and time-sensitive  undertaking due to the large volume of World War II records and the fact  that some of these records are stored on media that are at risk of  decaying within the next several years, according to DPMO officials.  DPMO officials also observed that many other historical records were in  danger of loss due to age and decay, and that preservation of such  material was critical to building case files and future accounting efforts.", "The officials said that these digitized files will serve as the starting point  for the required personnel files for World War II missing persons. JPAC  officials told us that JPAC is also undertaking efforts to digitize its records  and other information. Until such personnel files for all unaccounted-for  missing persons are developed and made readily accessible, as required  by law, the community\u2019s efforts to collaborate on cases will be hindered  by lack of information visibility among community members, which could  lead to overlapping or duplicative research and analysis efforts as well as  incomplete information provided to families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting Community\u2019s Fragmented Organizational Structure Exacerbates Weaknesses in Leadership", "paragraphs": ["The accounting community\u2019s fragmented organizational structure has  exacerbated the weaknesses in its leadership, and a majority of  accounting community and DOD stakeholder organizations believe that  alternative structures would be more effective. With each accounting  community organization reporting under a different line of authority, as  shown in figure 4, no single entity has overarching responsibility for  community-wide personnel and resources\u2014important levers for providing  the capacity to reach DOD\u2019s accounting-for goal. As a result, no single  entity can implement or enforce decisions without obtaining widespread  consensus. We have previously reported that having a single designated  leader is often beneficial because it centralizes accountability for  achieving outcomes and can accelerate decision-making.", "Concerns have risen over the years, both within and outside of DOD, with  regard to whether DOD\u2019s missing persons accounting community\u2019s  current organizational structure enables it to most effectively meet its  mission. For example, we previously reported that DPMO\u2019s 2005 strategic  plan specified a goal of implementing an organizational structure that  would unify missing persons accounting efforts, and that DPMO had also  drafted an update to its charter directive consistent with this strategic plan  goal that would give DPMO control over the entire process of recovering  missing persons. We reported that reactions to early versions of the  draft were mixed, with some organizations expressing concern that  DPMO would assume more of an operational role than it had previously  played. When our 2005 report was issued, the draft charter directive had  not yet been finalized but had been revised to scale back DPMO\u2019s role\u2014a  revision that was sustained when the directive was ultimately issued.", "In addition, a 2006 Institute for Defense Analysis study conducted at the  request of DPMO analyzed organizational changes that could improve the  effectiveness and efficiency of the accounting community. This study  concluded that significant improvements could be made by increasing the  lines of coordination in the accounting community and by recommending  that the community acknowledge DPMO as the leader in the accounting  effort. The study also described some of the problems associated with the  current organization; for example, that DPMO does not have tasking  authority over the other organizations, and that while there are multiple  lines of authority, no one organization has effective authority over  execution of the entire mission. Furthermore, the December 2009 memo  from the Deputy Secretary of Defense, directing the DASD to begin  planning a response to the accounting-for goal, noted that reorganizing  the personnel accounting community to improve efficiency could be  included as part of the planning process. In May 2011 CAPE conducted a  study on the proposal to transfer the mission, function, and resources of  DPMO from USD Policy to USD Personnel and Readiness. As part of its  study, CAPE solicited the opinions of several organizations, and  concluded that the mission was being met under the current  organizational structure and that no significant efficiencies would be  gained from the transfer. During the course of our review, DPMO officials  told us that concerns are still being raised about the organization of the  accounting community, both within DOD and externally, and that the  entire accounting community continues to struggle with efforts to achieve  consensus and to establish a structure that will enable the department to  most efficiently and effectively achieve the mission.", "We found that a majority of accounting community and DOD stakeholder  organizations believe that an alternative organizational structure for the  accounting community would be more effective. We administered a  questionnaire asking representatives from each accounting community  organization whether various options could improve the ability of the  community to meet its mission. One question asked respondents to rank  five organizational options that would best enable the accounting  community to meet its mission. We found that 12 of the 13 survey  respondents who answered the question ranked an option with a more  centralized chain of command as the most effective in enabling the  accounting community to achieve its mission. Ten of these 12  respondents ranked the current organizational structure as the least  effective or second least effective option for achieving the mission of the  accounting community. For example, the Life Sciences Equipment  Laboratory stated that the current system is fragmented and inefficient  due to different reporting chains and is not conducive to community  involvement or to establishing standard community policies and  procedures, and that having a single leader would better enable the entire  accounting community to achieve its mission. Moreover, the Army service  casualty office stated that the current structure does not allow for senior  leadership involvement, and that having unity of command would allow  leaders to focus on the right issues instead of spending time resolving  disputes.", "Responses to our questionnaire also demonstrated a lack of confidence  about the current organizational structure among many community and  DOD stakeholder organizations. We asked respondents to rate the  various organizational options with regard to several characteristics that  we have previously reported would benefit collaborating organizations,  such as defining an overarching mission with clear priorities; limiting  areas of overlap or duplication; communicating and operating across  agency boundaries; collectively determining necessary resources;  defining and agreeing on roles and responsibilities; monitoring progress,  evaluating efforts, and identifying areas of improvement; and enabling  appropriate involvement of senior leadership. In their responses to each  of our seven questions on these issues, at least 10 respondents  expressed a lack of confidence in the current organizational structure. For  example, at least 12 of the survey respondents indicated that the current  organizational structure did not enable or only somewhat enabled the  community to develop the mandated capability and capacity, or to  collectively determine necessary resources. In addition, nine respondents  indicated that the current organizational structure did not at all enable the  accounting community to define and agree on their respective roles and  responsibilities. The organizations provided detailed comments to  elaborate on their responses to the survey questions. For example, the  Armed Forces Medical Examiner System stated that the status quo, in  any form, is inefficient and promotes a disjointed and disunified effort and  that the only way to potentially meet the accounting-for goal would be  through unity of effort and clear command and control channels. The  Navy POW/MIA Branch stated that a more integrated model would allow  for a single agency with increased authority within DOD to create the plan  for developing the capability and capacity to account for 200 missing  persons per year. The Air Force casualty and mortuary affairs offices  stated that an integrated structure would provide a single lead for policy  oversight and would eliminate the duplication of operations among  accounting community organizations, and that transferring operational  missions from a combatant command would eliminate the need for  memoranda of agreement between each of the commands for operations  and would eliminate the need for JPAC\u2019s budget request to compete for  resources with those of other PACOM missions.", "In contrast, not a single organization ranked the current organizational  structure as the most effective organizational option, and only three  organizations\u2014USD Policy, PACOM, and JPAC\u2014ranked the current  organizational structure as the second most effective organizational  option. Illustrating a disconnect between leadership\u2019s perspective and the  rest of the community, only two organizations\u2014USD Policy and PACOM,  the two existing top-level leadership organizations in the accounting  community\u2014responded that the current structure greatly enables  appropriate senior leadership involvement. PACOM and USD Policy  stated that all of the organizational options, including the current  organizational structure, offer access to DOD senior leadership. In  addition, senior officials from these offices questioned whether the benefit  of reorganization would result in real change and would be worth  undergoing turmoil in the organization. While we recognize that a  reorganization may pose challenges, such as creating the potential for  short-term impacts on operations due to disruption, our findings show  that the majority of accounting community members and other  stakeholders lack confidence in the status quo, and we believe that the  potential benefits of reorganizing and/or clarifying roles and  responsibilities could outweigh those challenges.", "The accounting community\u2019s current organizational structure has  contributed to the community\u2019s lack of collaboration, which in turn has  contributed to the deficiencies related to planning, roles and  responsibilities, requirements, and communication discussed above. Until  the Secretary of Defense ensures that activities associated with the  accounting mission are efficiently and effectively carried out with unity of  command and effort, the inefficient and potentially avoidable overlap and  disagreements among the community members may continue, and  recovery operations could be hindered by unexpected operational  concerns and a lack of standard procedures.

This discord has also contributed to  the department\u2019s inability to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the  members of the accounting community regarding fundamental functions  such as artifact analysis, research and analysis, investigations, and family  outreach. While there have been some indications of progress being  made by the accounting community, the department\u2019s efforts continue to  be thwarted by organizational fragmentation and discord.

The department stated that it concurs that there is a need for a formal  mechanism to ensure that DPMO and JPAC have the appropriate  authorities to operate across combatant commands. However, DOD said  that the best mechanism or overarching document may not be a  memorandum of agreement, noting that the current and future DOD  Directive 2310.07E directs the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to  operationally implement this directive. DOD stated that the best  mechanism is through procedures available to the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, rather than using memorandums of  agreement. DOD said that DPMO will support action by the Joint Staff to  carry out that direction. We recommended the development of  memoranda of agreement with all geographic combatant commands  because that was the vehicle that JPAC used with U.S. European  Command, as we discuss in our report, and the agreement with U.S.  European Command contained detailed processes governing JPAC\u2019s  operations within that command\u2019s area of responsibility that we  considered would be beneficial to develop similar agreements with all of  the geographic combatant commands.

In addition, we distributed the  questionnaire to several DOD stakeholder organizations, including the  Defense Intelligence Agency (Stony Beach), JPAC\u2019s Central Identification  Laboratory, USD Policy, USD Personnel and Readiness, the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, Armed Forces Medical Examiner, U.S. Pacific Command, U.S.  European Command, and DOD\u2019s Office of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation. We selected these organizations based on their  involvement in the missing persons accounting mission. We administered  the questionnaires via e-mail. We received a total of 14 responses out of  the 17 questionnaires distributed, and followed up with all of the non- respondents. All of the accounting community organizations submitted  survey responses. We qualitatively analyzed the open-ended responses  and quantitatively analyzed the closed-ended responses from the  questionnaires to identify trends in responses and gain insight into the  accounting community organizations\u2019 and DOD stakeholders\u2019 views on  the issues identified in the questionnaire.", "The survey used was not a sample survey in that it included the universe  of respondents. Therefore, the survey has no sampling errors. However,  the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other  types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the  sources of information available to respondents, or the types of people  who do not respond can introduce unwanted variability into the survey  results. We included steps in the development of the survey, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors  and help ensure the accuracy of the answers that were obtained. For  example, a social science survey specialist designed the questionnaire, in  collaboration with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. The survey  asked a combination of questions that allowed for both open-ended and  close-ended responses. We pretested the content and format of the  questionnaire. During the pretests, we asked questions to determine  whether (1) the survey questions were clear, (2) the terms we used were  precise, (3) the questionnaire did not place an undue burden on the  respondents, and (4) the questions were unbiased. We received input on  the survey and made changes to the content and format of the final  questionnaire based on our pretest results.", "The questionnaire was also reviewed by an independent GAO survey  specialist. Data analysis was conducted by a GAO data analyst working  directly with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. A second  independent analyst checked all of the computer programs for accuracy.  The survey was conducted using self-administered electronic  questionnaires. All data were double-keyed during the data-entry process,  and GAO staff verified a sample of the resulting data to ensure accuracy.", "We compared the results of our analyses to several practices we have  identified in prior work that can benefit collaborating agencies, including  (1) having overarching plans to align activities and resources; (2) clearly  defining roles and responsibilities; (3) articulating agreements in formal  documents; (4) communicating frequently; and (5) having a single- designated leader.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 through June 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
