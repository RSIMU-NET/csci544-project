DOD also issued an order in October 2016 requiring DOD components to ensure that equipment transfer dates are recorded in SCIP. The process for providing the equipment to Iraq's security forces generally falls into three phases: (1) acquisition and shipment, (2) staging in Kuwait and Iraq, and (3) transfer to the government of Iraq or the Kurdistan Regional Government. However, for the 566 ITEF-funded requisitions marked as complete in SCIP's management reporting system as of February 2017, GAO found that the system captured one of two key transportation dates for 256 of the requisitions in phase 1, and none of the transportation dates for these requisitions in phase 2 or phase 3 (see figure).", "DOD officials attributed the lack of key transportation dates in SCIP's management reporting system to potential interoperability and data reporting issues in all three equipping phases.", "Interoperability issues.

We reviewed ITEF-funded equipment tracking reports from  the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command (USASAC), the U.S. Army  TACOM Life Cycle Management Command, and the U.S. Army Joint  Munitions Command. We examined ITEF-funded equipment requisitions  marked as \u201csupply/services complete\u201d in SCIP to determine whether key  transportation dates of these requisitions were captured in SCIP.

It was beyond the scope of this review to  determine the extent to which the ITEF-funded equipment requisitions  had been correctly marked as complete for supply and services.  However, we did report where ITEF-funded equipment requisitions  marked as complete for supply and services were lacking key information.  In the body of this report, we detail how the lack of complete key  information means that these data cannot be used to maintain visibility  and accountability of ITEF-funded equipment.

The  department said that the 1st TSC planned to update its written  procedures to include this verbal order by May 31, 2017.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that DOD develop  written procedures for reporting ITEF-funded equipment transfer dates in  EFTS in SCIP. The department commented that the relevant  organizations have most, if not all, of the written procedures that are  necessary for reporting these dates in EFTS. However, the department  said it would coordinate with all interested parties to ensure that the  required written procedures exist and to update those documents if  needed. GAO continues to believe that additional written procedures are  needed and modified the language of our recommendation to specify that  DOD include in its written procedures the EFTS data field in which ITEF- funded equipment transfer dates should be captured. Although the 1st  TSC has written procedures on how personnel can upload some transfer  information into SCIP, the procedures do not clearly state which data field  in EFTS should be used to capture the transfer dates of ITEF-funded  equipment to the government of Iraq or the Kurdistan Regional  Government. As a result, DOD personnel and contractors have had  difficulty locating these dates, which 1st TSC officials said they have  uploaded to EFTS. Providing clear procedures on the data field to be  used to capture ITEF-funded equipment transfer dates would help ensure  that DOD personnel responsible for managing ITEF are able to locate  these dates in EFTS as needed.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State.

We interviewed DOD officials from  DOD components responsible for managing or tracking ITEF-funded  equipment through different phases of the equipping process to  understand their processes for providing visibility over ITEF-funded  equipment. These components included the Combined Joint Task Force- Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), U.S. Army Security Assistance  Command (USASAC), U.S. Army TACOM Life Cycle Management  Command, and the 1st Theater Sustainment Command (1st TSC). We  reviewed USASAC, U.S. Army TACOM Life Cycle Management  Command, and U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command\u2019s status reports on  ITEF-funded equipment. We also interviewed officials from the  Department of State\u2019s Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq to understand  their role in providing visibility of ITEF-funded equipment.", "In addition, to determine the extent to which DOD components ensured  that SCIP captured key transportation dates of ITEF-funded equipment,  we analyzed data from SCIP\u2019s Security Cooperation Management Suite  (SCMS) by running two reports from SCMS on February 10, 2017.", "First, we ran a report to determine the total universe of cases and  their corresponding requisitions for which ITEF funds had been  obligated. We determined that this universe consisted of 13,674 ITEF- funded equipment requisitions.", "Second, we ran a report to determine how many of the 13,674 ITEF- funded equipment requisitions had all items and services delivered  and performed. Specifically, we ran a report of cases and their  corresponding requisitions that DOD had marked in SCMS as  \u201csupply/services complete\u201d because DOD considered all of the items  and services delivered and performed for these requisitions. Using  this designation, we determined that 566 ITEF-funded equipment  requisitions were marked as \u201csupply/services complete.\u201d", "In using the term requisitions, we mean lines of data entries in SCMS by  case that contain a unique combination of requisition numbers and/or  transportation control numbers. In our analysis, we noted some  requisition numbers that applied to multiple lines of entries as well as  some transportation control numbers that applied to multiple lines of  entries; however, we found no exact duplicates by entry. Our analysis  focused on completeness of these records, which is where we found the  deficiencies noted in the body of this report. It was beyond the scope of  this review to assess the accuracy of the requisition numbers,  transportation control numbers, and any dates entered into SCMS. In  addition, we were not able to determine the extent to which ITEF-funded  equipment cases and their corresponding requisitions were properly  marked as \u201csupply/services complete\u201d in SCMS. One reason why DOD  only marked 566 of the 13,674 ITEF-funded equipment lines of  requisitions as \u201csupply/services complete\u201d could be that DOD had one or  more requisitions on a case that had not yet been delivered or performed,  which prevented DOD from closing the case and marking all of the  requisitions associated with the case as \u201csupply/services complete.\u201d Also,  DOD may have had some ITEF-funded equipment cases and  corresponding requisitions that should have been marked as  \u201csupply/services complete\u201d but were not. We determined that we could  proceed with assessing the extent to which the 566 ITEF-funded  equipment requisitions that had been marked as \u201csupply/services  complete\u201d in SCMS had recorded key transportation dates of equipment  in SCMS for each of the three phases of the ITEF equipping process  because DOD considered all of the items and services delivered and  performed for these requisitions. We selected data fields in SCMS for  each requisition that would capture key transportation dates of ITEF- funded equipment in each of the three phases of the ITEF equipping  process. These included:  \u201cArrive Port of Embarkation\u201d data field to determine whether SCMS  captured the arrival date of equipment at the last point of departure in  the United States in phase 1 of the ITEF equipping process,  \u201cDepart Port of Embarkation\u201d data field to determine whether SCMS  captured the departure date for equipment shipped from the United  States in phase 1 of the ITEF equipping process,  \u201cArrive Country\u201d data field to determine whether SCMS captured the  arrival date of equipment in Kuwait or Iraq, and  \u201cCustomer Receipt\u201d data field to determine whether SCMS captured  the transfer date of equipment to the government of Iraq or the  Kurdistan Regional Government.", "We verified that our selection and interpretation of these data fields were  correct by reviewing DSCA-issued guidance on SCIP and consulting with  DSCA officials. In addition, we probed the 1st TSC officials\u2019 assertion that  they had reported about 2,000 ITEF-funded equipment requisition transfer  dates in SCIP between August 2016 and January 2017 by interviewing  the contractor responsible for SCIP\u2019s EFTS, in which these dates would  have been reported. We also reviewed additional data from him. It was  beyond the scope of this review to determine the extent to which the  13,674 ITEF-funded equipment requisitions had been correctly marked as  complete for supply and services, as such an analysis would have  required a reconciliation of SCIP computerized records against source  documents and other supporting materials. However, we did determine  that the 566 requisitions marked as complete for supply and services  were lacking key information, which we reported. In the body of this  report, we detail how the lack of complete key information means that  these data cannot be used to maintain visibility and accountability of  ITEF-funded equipment.", "To determine the extent to which DOD accounts for ITEF-funded  equipment transferred to the government of Iraq or the Kurdistan  Regional Government, we reviewed 1st TSC transfer documentation. We  requested all U.S. transfer and receipt forms that the 1st TSC used to  document ITEF-funded equipment transfers to the government of Iraq or  the Kurdistan Regional Government and were provided with 284 forms  dated between March 2015 and April 2016. We reviewed these 284  forms to check whether they contained key information, such as  signatures and unique case identifiers. When determining whether the  forms contained transfer dates, we created a decision rule of only  counting those dates that were legible because the purpose of this review  was to assess DOD\u2019s accountability over the equipment transferred. We  were unable to determine whether we were provided with all the  equipment transfer and receipt forms for this period because DOD does  not maintain the information that would have allowed us to do this.  Specifically, the data problems that we have noted in SCIP, in particular  the problem of missing entries, prevented us from making that  determination. We also reviewed the 1st TSC\u2019s November 2015, April  2016, and November 2016 standard operating procedures for ensuring  the accountability of ITEF-funded equipment as well as CJTF-OIR\u2019s June  2016 standard operating procedures for the management of ITEF. In  addition, we traveled to Kuwait and Iraq to interview DOD officials from  the 1st TSC and CJTF-OIR to understand their roles, responsibilities, and  processes for ensuring the accountability of ITEF-funded equipment.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to May 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
