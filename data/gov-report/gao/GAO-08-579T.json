The library network also provides information and services to the public. In fiscal year 2006, the network included 26 libraries across headquarters, regional offices, research centers, and laboratories. These libraries were independently operated by several different EPA program offices, depending on the nature of the libraries' collections. In 2006, facing proposed budget cuts, EPA issued a plan to reorganize the network beginning in fiscal year 2007. The plan proposed a phased approach to closing libraries and dispersing, disposing of, and digitizing library materials. GAO was asked to summarize the findings in its report being released today, Environmental Protection: EPA Needs to Ensure That Best Practices and Procedures Are Followed When Making Further Changes to Its Library Network (GAO-08-304). GAO made four recommendations in this report aimed at best practices and procedures that EPA should follow when continuing to reorganize its library network. The agency agreed with the recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2006, EPA has implemented its library reorganization plan and has closed physical access to the Office of Environmental Information (OEI) headquarters library and three regional office libraries. In the same period, six other libraries in the network independently changed their operations. Some of these libraries digitized, dispersed, or disposed of their materials before EPA had drafted a common set of agencywide library procedures for doing so. Until these procedures are completed, EPA plans no further changes to the library network. EPA reorganized its library network primarily to generate cost savings through a more coordinated library network and more electronic delivery of services. However, GAO found that EPA did not effectively justify its reorganization decision. According to EPA officials, OEI decided to reorganize its libraries without fully completing the recommended analyses in order to reduce its fiscal year 2007 funding in response to the President's fiscal year 2007 budget proposal. EPA did not systematically inform the full range of stakeholders on the final configuration of the library network. In addition, EPA libraries varied considerably in the extent to which they communicated with and solicited views from staff, external stakeholders, and experts before and during the reorganization effort. EPA is currently reaching out to stakeholders, including EPA staff and library experts, by holding and attending stakeholder meetings and conferences. EPA does not yet have an effective strategy to ensure the continuity of library services following the reorganization and does not know the full effect of the reorganization on library services. EPA's library plan describes the reorganization effort as a \"phased approach,\" but it does not provide specific goals, timelines, or feedback mechanisms that allow the agency to measure performance and monitor user needs to ensure a successful reorganization while maintaining quality services. EPA did not follow key practices for a successful transformation, even though the agency made several changes to the library network that could have impaired the continued delivery of library materials and services to its staff and the public. The several different program offices responsible for the EPA libraries in the network each generally decide how much of their available funding to allocate to their libraries and how to fund their reorganization. However, when faced with a proposed budget reduction of $2 million in fiscal year 2007, rather than following its normal procedures, OEI directed the regional and headquarters offices to reduce funding for OEI libraries--a reduction of 77 percent for these libraries from the previous fiscal year. EPA did not allocate funds to help closing libraries manage their collections; instead, the responsible program or regional office used its annual funding to pay for these costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to appear here today to discuss our recent review of the  reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) library  network, which is being released today.

Before the 2007 reorganization, the network comprised 26 libraries, each  funded and managed by several different program offices at EPA: 1 library  was managed by OEI and 10 by regional offices; 8 libraries were located at  EPA laboratories within the Office of Research and Development (ORD),  and 2 were within the Office of Administration and Resources  Management (OARM). In addition, each of the following program offices  had 1 library: Office of the Administrator, Office of General Counsel,  Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS), Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and Office of Air and Radiation.  A national program manager within OEI was responsible for coordinating  the major activities of the entire EPA library network.", "Aside from visiting a physical location, the network provides access to its  collections to its staff and to the public through (1) a Web-based database  of library holdings\u2014the Online Library System (OLS); (2) interlibrary  loans from another network library or a public library; and (3) through a  separate online database\u2014the National Environmental Publications  Internet Site (NEPIS). EPA staff also have access to other information  sources\u2014such as online journals, the Federal Register, news, databases of  bibliographic information, and article citations\u2014from their desktop  computers.", "EPA began to evaluate its library network in 2003. It developed and issued  studies to determine the value of library services and inform regional  management of their options to support library services beyond fiscal year  2006. EPA also issued an internal report in November 2005, which offered  recommendations on how to maintain an effective library network if the  library support budget were reduced. After these reports were issued, EPA  established a Library Steering Committee\u2014composed of senior managers  from EPA\u2019s program offices and regions\u2014to develop a new model for  providing library services to EPA staff. In August 2006, the steering  committee issued the EPA FY 2007 Library Plan: National Framework  for the Headquarters and Regional Libraries.", "The August 2006 library plan provided the framework for the network to  begin reorganizing in the summer of 2006 in preparation for the proposed  fiscal year 2007 budget reduction beginning in October 2006. The plan  provided guidelines for EPA staff to determine how the collections would  be managed; noted that OEI libraries in Regions 5, 6, and 7 would close,  and that the headquarters library would close physical access to its  collection but would function as a repository library, along with the OARM  libraries in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  In addition, according to the plan, EPA is to develop Library Centers of  Excellence, where a library with more expertise in a specific area of  reference research would provide that service to staff in other regions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Libraries Independently Decided to Close, Reduce Their Hours, or Take Other Actions, but the Final Network Configuration Is Still Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["As a part of EPA\u2019s 2006 reorganization effort, some EPA libraries have  closed, reduced their hours of operation, or changed the way that they  provide library services.

According to EPA officials, the plan focused on the OEI  headquarters and regional office libraries, and they did not think it was  necessary to reflect all changes that were planned for other libraries.

At the  time of our review, 15,260 titles had been digitized, and EPA anticipates  that a total of about 51,000 unique EPA library materials from closed and  open libraries will be digitized.", "In terms of dispersal, EPA\u2019s library plan noted that a library choosing to  disperse its materials can send materials to one of the EPA-designated  repositories, other libraries in the library network, EPA regional record  management centers, other federal agency libraries, state libraries and  state environmental agency libraries, colleges and university libraries,  public libraries, or e-mail networks used specifically to exchange library  materials.", "Finally, in terms of disposal, the OEI headquarters library and the OPPTS  Chemical Library disposed of some of their materials as a part of the  reorganization. EPA\u2019s library plan noted that certain materials not claimed  during the dispersal process could be destroyed. In total, the OEI  headquarters library has disposed of over 800 journals and books, and the  Chemical Library has disposed of over 3,000 journals and books.", "Recognizing that libraries could function more cohesively as a network,  EPA established a new interim library policy in 2007 and established  uniform governance and management for the network. This interim policy,  among other things, (1) reestablished the National Library Program  Manager position, which was left vacant from 2005 through 2007 and (2)  resulted in 12 draft agencywide library procedures, including procedures  on digitizing and dispersing library materials, and developing a  communication strategy. EPA officials told us that they do not have a time  frame for completing these procedures but will complete them before the  moratorium on changes to the network is lifted.

In addition, EPA\u2019s  decision to reorganize its library network was not based on a thorough  analyses of the costs and benefits associated with such a reorganization.", "EPA initiated its 2004 Business Case study because of ongoing budget  uncertainties and because of technological changes in how users obtain  information and how commercial information resources are made  available. While the study concluded that EPA\u2019s libraries provide  \u201csubstantial value\u201d to the agency and the public, it raised concerns about  EPA\u2019s ability to continue services in its present form. As such, the study  recommended that EPA take several actions to foster an agencywide  discussion on the library network\u2019s future. In addition, according to Office  of Management and Budget guidance, a benefit-cost analysis should be  conducted to support decisions to initiate, renew, or expand programs or  projects, and that in conducting such an analysis, tangible and intangible  benefits and costs should be identified, assessed, and reported. One  element of this analysis is an evaluation of alternatives to consider  different methods of providing services to achieve program objectives.", "However, EPA did not fully complete these assessments before it closed  libraries and began to reorganize the network. According to EPA officials,  EPA decided to reorganize its libraries without fully completing the  recommended analyses in order to reduce its fiscal year 2007 funding for  the OEI headquarters and regional office libraries by $2 million. This  claimed savings, however, was not substantiated by any formal EPA cost  assessment. According to EPA officials, the $2 million funding reduction  was informally estimated in 2005 with the expectation that EPA would  have been further along in its library reorganization before fiscal year  2007. Furthermore, EPA did not comprehensively assess library network  spending in advance of the $2 million estimation of budget cuts.", "By not completing a full assessment of its library resources and not  conducting a benefit-cost analysis of various approaches to reorganizing  the network, EPA did not justify the reorganization actions in a way that  fully considered and ensured adequate support for the mission of the  library network, the continuity of services provided to EPA staff and the  public, the availability of EPA materials to a wider audience, and the  potential cost savings.

While EPA did not fully take  these actions during the library reorganization, it is now reaching out to  both EPA staff and external stakeholders.", "EPA\u2019s August 2006 library plan did not inform stakeholders on the final  configuration for the library network or implementation goals and a  timeline. Through the library plan, EPA generally informed internal and  external stakeholders of its vision for the reorganized library network,  noting that EPA would be moving toward a new model of providing library  services to EPA staff and the public. However, EPA did not provide  enough information on how the final library network would be configured  or the implementation goals and timeline it would take to achieve this  configuration. For example, EPA did not inform its staff or the public that  OPPTS would close its Chemical Library and that other libraries would  reduce their hours of operation or make other changes to their library  services. According to OEI officials, the plan was intended to provide a  framework for how new services would be provided and not to lay out the  network\u2019s physical configuration. Without a clear picture of what EPA  intends to achieve with the library network reorganization and the  implementation goals and timeline to achieve this intended outcome, EPA  staff may not know if progress is being made, which could limit support  for the network reorganization.", "Because EPA\u2019s library structure was decentralized, EPA did not have an  agencywide communication strategy to inform EPA staff of, and solicit  their views on, the changes occurring in the library network, leaving that  responsibility to each EPA library. As a result, EPA libraries varied  considerably in the information they provided to staff on library changes.", "For example, management in only a few of the regions solicited views  from their regional staff through discussions with their regional science  councils\u2014an employee group located in each region composed of EPA  scientists and technical specialists\u2014or unions. In addition, EPA generally  did not communicate with and solicit views from external stakeholders  before and during the reorganization because it was moving quickly to  make changes in response to proposed funding cuts. Of the libraries that  closed, only the headquarters library informed the public of the changes  occurring at its library by posting a notification in the Federal Register.  EPA also did not fully communicate with and solicit views from  professional library associations while planning and implementing its  library reorganization. EPA did meet with the American Library  Association, a professional library association, on a few occasions, but did  so later in the reorganization planning process. Without an agencywide  communication strategy, staff ownership for the changes may be limited,  and staff may be confused about the changes. Furthermore, EPA cannot  be sure that the changes are meeting the needs of EPA staff and external  stakeholders.", "Finally, EPA did not solicit views from federal and industry experts  regarding the digitization of library materials and other issues. These  experts could have provided leading practice information and guidance on  digitization processes and standards for library materials. As such, EPA  cannot be sure that it is using leading practices for library services.", "Recognizing the need to communicate with and solicit the views of staff,  external stakeholders, and industry experts, EPA recently increased its  outreach efforts. For example, EPA asked local unions to comment on a  draft of the 2008 library plan, and attended and presented information at a  stakeholder forum at which a number of professional library associations  were present.

In addition, to balance the continued delivery of services with  merger and transformation activities, it is essential that top leadership  drives the transformation. However, during the reorganization, EPA did  not have a national program manager for the library network to oversee  and guide the reorganization effort.", "Several changes that EPA made to its library network may have impaired  the continued delivery of library materials and services. For example,  because of copyright issues, only unique reports produced by or for EPA  will be digitized in NEPIS\u2014only about 10 percent of EPA\u2019s holdings of  books and reports.

For  example, the Regions 5 and 6 libraries gave materials to private  companies, and the OEI headquarters library and the Chemical Library  discarded materials without first determining that they had no monetary  value.

OEI, which is the primary source of funding for the regional libraries,  typically provides funding for them through each region\u2019s support budget,  and generally allows regional management to decide how to allocate this  funding among the library and other support services, such as information  technology.

After $500,000 of the $2 million reduction was applied to  the headquarters library, the regional administrators together decided that  the remaining $1.5 million reduction should be spread equally across all  regions, rather than by staffing ratios in each region or previous years\u2019  spending. The $2 million reduction for the libraries was included in the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal for EPA.
