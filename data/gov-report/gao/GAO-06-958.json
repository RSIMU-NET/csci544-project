VA projected about 86 percent of its costs using an actuarial model that estimated veterans' demand for health care. To project the costs of long-term care (about 10 percent of the funds for VA medical programs in each of these years) and the remaining medical care costs (about 4 percent), separate estimation approaches were used that did not rely upon an actuarial model but used other methods instead. The agency anticipated resources based on prior year appropriations, guidance from OMB, and other factors. For both fiscal years, VA officials told GAO that projected costs--calculated from the actuarial model and other approaches--exceeded anticipated resources and that they addressed the difference in budget requests for those years with cost-saving policy proposals and management efficiencies. Although VA staff closely monitored budget execution and identified problems for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, VA did not report this information to Congress in a sufficiently informative manner. VA closely monitored the fiscal year 2005 budget as early as October 2004, anticipating challenges managing within its resources. However, Congress did not learn of these challenges until April 2005. VA initially planned to manage within its budget for fiscal year 2005 by delaying some spending on equipment and nonrecurring maintenance and drawing on funds it had planned to carry over into 2006. Instead, the President requested additional funds from Congress for both fiscal years 2005 (a $975 million supplemental appropriation in June 2005) and 2006 (a budget amendment of $1.977 billion in July 2005). Congress included in the 2006 appropriations act a requirement for VA to submit quarterly reports regarding the medical programs budget status during this fiscal year. These reports have not included some of the measures that would be useful for congressional oversight, such as patient workload measures to capture costs and the time required for new patients to be scheduled for their first primary care appointment. Unrealistic assumptions, errors in estimation, and insufficient data were key factors in VA's budget formulation process that contributed to the requests for additional funding for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Unrealistic assumptions about how quickly cost savings could be realized from proposed nursing home policy changes contributed to the additional requests, as did computation errors measuring the estimated effect of one of these changes. Insufficient data in VA's initial budget projections also contributed to the additional funding requests. For example, VA underestimated the cost of serving veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, in part because estimates for fiscal year 2005 were based on data that largely predated the Iraq conflict and because according to VA, the agency had challenges for fiscal year 2006 in obtaining data from the Department of Defense."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates one of the largest health  care delivery systems in the nation. For fiscal year 2006, VA estimates it  will treat 5.4 million patients with appropriations of $31.5 billion. During  the past decade the number of patients served by VA has increased  rapidly, due in part to an expansion of the number of veterans eligible to  receive care. The Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996  simplified eligibility standards for veterans in need of hospital and  outpatient care and made available services that previously had not been  made available to veterans without service-connected disabilities or low  incomes. The act required VA to provide a uniform set of medical benefits,  including hospital and outpatient care, to veterans who are eligible and  who enroll in its health care system. In addition to the uniform set of  medical benefits, VA is required to provide certain other services\u2014such as  nursing home care\u2014to some veterans, but not to others. If sufficient  resources are not available to provide hospital and outpatient care that is  timely and acceptable in quality, VA is required to restrict enrollment  based on veterans\u2019 eligibility priorities.", "For VA, like other agencies, formulation of a budget request begins  approximately 18 months before the start of the fiscal year to which the  request relates and about 10 months before transmission of the President\u2019s  budget request, which usually occurs in early February. For this purpose,  the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), within VA, develops estimates  of its medical program budget for agency review and approval. In  preparing budget estimates, VA and its component organizations\u2014such as  VHA\u2014use policy and technical guidance from the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), while preparing a budget submission to OMB that  reflects VA priorities. OMB is the office responsible for assisting the  President in overseeing the preparation of the federal budget and  supervising its administration. OMB reviews VA\u2019s and other agencies\u2019  budget requests from their submission in September through November  and then notifies agencies at the end of November on the level of funding  and policy proposals that will be included in the President\u2019s budget  request. Agencies have very limited time to appeal these decisions to OMB  before they start preparing a congressional budget justification\u2014a more  detailed presentation of the President\u2019s budget request\u2014for their  appropriations subcommittees\u2019 consideration. Congressional budget  justifications are submitted to appropriations subcommittees following  transmission of the President\u2019s budget request.", "After the President submits his budget request, he may request further  changes in one of two ways, depending on the timing of the additional  request. If Congress has not completed action on an appropriations act,  the President can transmit a budget amendment. If an appropriations act  has already been enacted, the President can request a supplemental  appropriation; this is typically done in cases where the need for funds is  too urgent to postpone until enactment of the following year\u2019s  appropriations bill.", "Once an appropriations bill becomes law, OMB apportions the funds,  allowing an agency to obligate and expend the funds as authorized. Each  agency is responsible for obligating and expending funds efficiently and  effectively to carry out the programs and activities for which funds were  appropriated. Carrying out this responsibility is referred to as budget  execution and requires monitoring throughout the fiscal year to ensure  that funds are being used as authorized for agency program objectives\u2014in  the case of VA medical programs to provide quality care to veterans\u2014and  to ensure compliance with provisions of fiscal law. For example, the  Antideficiency Act prohibits VA and other agencies from making or  authorizing obligations or expenditures in excess of the available  appropriations.", "Congress provided additional funds beyond those initially requested by the  President for VA medical programs for both fiscal years 2005 and 2006. In  June 2005, the President requested a $975 million supplemental  appropriation for fiscal year 2005, and in July 2005, the President  submitted a $1.977 billion budget amendment for fiscal year 2006. These  additional requests raised concerns in Congress and among stakeholders  regarding the reasons for the additional requests for funding. At your  request, we examined for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 (1) how the  President\u2019s budget requests for VA medical programs were formulated,   (2) how VA monitored and reported to Congress on its budget execution,  and (3) which key factors in the budget formulation process contributed to  the requests for additional funding.", "To perform this work, we interviewed VA officials responsible for the  agency\u2019s medical programs budget issues, and for developing budget  projections. We also interviewed OMB officials. We analyzed and reviewed  budget documents including VA\u2019s budget justifications for medical  programs for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. We also reviewed VA budget  estimates and other information VA reported that it used either to  formulate its submissions to OMB for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 or to  monitor the use of appropriated funds for those fiscal years. Our review of  how VA monitored its use of funds in the fiscal year 2006 budget includes  the first 11 months of the fiscal year. This work expands upon the  preliminary findings that we reported in February 2006.

As part of a uniform set of medical benefits provided to  eligible veterans who enroll, VA provides a range of services including  preventive and primary health care, a full range of outpatient and inpatient  services, and prescription drugs. VA also provides additional services,  such as nursing home and dental care and other services, as required by  law, for some veterans and makes these services available to other  veterans on a discretionary basis as resources permit. One of the largest of  these programs is VA\u2019s nursing home care program, which provides care in  three settings. VA operates its own nursing homes in 134 locations; it pays  for care under contract in non-VA nursing homes, referred to as  community nursing homes; and it pays about one-third of the costs per day  for veterans in state veterans\u2019 nursing homes. In its three settings, nursing  home services are provided to veterans, ranging from short-stay post-acute  care for patients recovering from a condition such as a stroke to long-stay  care for patients who cannot be cared for at home because of severe,  chronic physical or mental limitations.", "To manage access to hospital and outpatient care in relation to available  resources, VA established an enrollment system with priority categories,  as required by the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996.  The act called for seven priority categories; subsequent legislation  provided for eight categories. Priority categories are generally  determined by a veteran\u2019s degree of service-connected or other disability  or on financial need. VA gives veterans in Priority category 1 (with   50 percent or more service-connected disability) the highest preference for  services and gives lowest preference to those in Priority category 8 (no  disability, with income exceeding certain thresholds, and who were  enrolled as of January 16, 2003).", "The act also required VA to restrict enrollment consistent with its priority  categories if sufficient resources are not available to provide care that is  timely and acceptable in quality. In January 2003, VA restricted  enrollment by no longer allowing Priority 8 veterans, those in the lowest  priority category, to enroll. However, Priority 8 veterans who were  already enrolled as of January 16, 2003, would continue to receive service.  This policy remained in effect as of August 2006.", "In the mid-1990s, VA began to change the way it delivered health care to  veterans to increase the efficiency of its health care system and to improve  access to medical services. Applying lessons learned from the private  sector\u2019s experiences with managed health care, VA began emphasizing  certain managed care practices, such as primary, outpatient, and  preventive care, and deemphasizing its reliance on inpatient care. Over the  10-year period from 1995 through 2004, for example, the ratio of outpatient  visits to inpatient hospital stays at VA increased from 29 to 1, to 92 to 1,  reflecting the change in how VA delivers medical care. To support its  health care reform efforts, VA decentralized the management structure of  the agency to coordinate the organization of hospitals, outpatient clinics,  and other facilities into 21 regional health care networks. These networks  have budget and management responsibilities that include allocating  resources to facilities, clinics, and programs within their networks and  ensuring access to appropriate health care services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Formulation of President\u2019s Budget Request for VA Medical Programs Informed by Comparing Cost of Projected Demand and Anticipated Resources", "paragraphs": ["The formulation of the President\u2019s budget requests for VA medical  programs for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 was informed by VA\u2019s comparison  of its estimation of the cost of projected demand and anticipated  resources.

The actuarial model used cost estimates associated with  particular health care services in conjunction with the enrollment and  utilization projections to project VA health care costs. The actuarial model  provided utilization projections for 55 health care services including  inpatient acute surgery, outpatient care, prescription drugs, and  prosthetics. The model used private sector benchmarks but made  allowances for the special characteristics of the VA enrollee population,  adjusting for age, sex, morbidity of enrollee population, and veterans\u2019 use  of other health care providers reimbursed by payers such as Medicare and  Medicaid.", "VA used a separate estimation approach, rather than an actuarial model, to  project long-term care demand and costs, which accounted for about   10 percent of the funds requested for medical programs for each of the  fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The long-term care estimation approach  projected demand by using historical expenditures to calculate the costs  of treating veterans and multiplying these estimates by projected  workload, which was calculated based on historical trends and policy  proposals. VA officials told us that they are working on incorporating the  projection of long-term care demand and costs into the actuarial model,  but could not provide a date when this would be completed. Similarly, VA  used other approaches, rather than an actuarial model, to project demand  and costs for the remaining 4 percent of the medical programs budget  request for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. These other methodologies included  adding inflation to actual expenditures and projecting trends based on  workload, expenditure, and other data provided by program officials. The  majority of these expenditure projections were for Civilian Health and  Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) and  dental care.", "The actuarial model projections and the other estimation approaches for  the fiscal year 2005 budget were developed in March 2003. To estimate  costs for VA\u2019s medical programs for fiscal year 2005, VA used fiscal year  2002 data, which were the most current fiscal year data available in the  spring of 2003.

These cost-saving policy proposals totaled   $494 million and $734 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2006, respectively,  and were proposed to reduce the total appropriation requested. (See table  1.) More specifically, a proposed long-term care policy was designed to  reduce costs by reducing patient workload, while a proposed $250  enrollment fee and an increase in pharmacy copayments for Priority 7 and  8 veterans\u2014primarily, those veterans with incomes or net worths above  applicable thresholds and no service-connected disability\u2014would have  generated additional resources. The projected savings from these policy  proposals, which were designed to enhance revenue as a means of  protecting resources, were used to adjust projected costs. VA used the  actuarial model and long-term care estimates to project savings from these  proposals.", "In addition to cost-saving policy proposals, VA developed estimates of  management efficiency savings of $340 million and $590 million in fiscal  years 2005 and 2006, respectively, which were included in the President\u2019s  budget request. According to VA, these management efficiency savings  were initiatives designed to reduce costs without reducing quality. In a  February 2006 report, we reported that VA\u2019s total projected management  efficiency savings in the President\u2019s budget request for fiscal years 2003  through 2006 were used to fill the gap between the costs associated with  VA\u2019s projected demand for health care services and anticipated resources.

However, they will continue to include other  efficiency savings, which VA calls clinical efficiencies, projected by its  actuarial model. Each year, a workgroup of VA officials and staff from the  developer of the actuarial model review VA and health care industry  trends and evaluate specific VA practices expected to affect health care  service utilization and cost and incorporate these expectations into the  actuarial model. For example, VA\u2019s Advanced Clinical Access initiative is  intended to reduce the need for veterans to visit clinics to receive care by  implementing certain health care practices such as using follow-up  telephone calls by practitioners to reduce the number of in-person office  visits. VA officials told us that to calculate the savings from such an  initiative, the assumptions of reducing patient utilization are built into the  actuarial model.

In December  2004, in internal briefings to VA\u2019s National Leadership Board, the Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, and the  Deputy Secretary, the workgroup recommended that the agency consider  a number of budget options to manage within its fiscal year 2005 budget,  including limiting the implementation of new initiatives and shifting  resources from equipment and nonrecurring maintenance into direct  patient care.", "VA officials told us that in the middle of fiscal year 2005, it became clear  that demand for health care services was increasing rapidly\u2014confirming  what they had anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year\u2014and that  spending would have to be carefully controlled to manage within its fiscal  year 2005 budget for the remainder of the year. VA staff identified these  trends by analyzing the monthly reports they generate for VA senior  management. In its March 2005 report to senior management, VA found  that through January 2005 unique patient workload was about 4.1 million,  5.2 percent above what VA had expected by that time of the fiscal year,  suggesting a potential challenge to managing care with available  resources.", "On the basis of this close monitoring which began as early as October  2004, VA took actions to shift resources it had originally allocated for  equipment and nonrecurring maintenance into direct patient care.

However, the unique patient measure does not capture  the difference between patients predominately using low-cost services,  such as primary care outpatient visits, at an average $245 each, and  patients using more high-cost services, such as acute inpatient hospital  care, which costs about $1,500 a day, on average. In contrast, VA now  provides in its monthly reports to OMB other patient workload  measures\u2014in addition to the number of unique patients\u2014that provide a  more complete picture of whether new patients are receiving low- or high- cost services.

For  example, VA underestimated the cost of serving veterans returning from  Iraq and Afghanistan, in part because estimates for fiscal year 2005 were  based on data that largely predated the Iraq conflict and because VA did  not have sufficient data for fiscal year 2006 due to challenges in obtaining  data needed to identify these veterans from DOD, according to VA  officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unrealistic Assumptions and Errors in Estimating the Effect of Nursing Home Policies Contributed to Requests for Additional Funding", "paragraphs": ["An unrealistic assumption about the expected time frame in which VA  could implement a fiscal year 2005 proposed nursing home cost-saving  policy contained in the President\u2019s budget request\u2014a reduction in nursing  home patient workload in VA-operated nursing homes\u2014contributed to  $226 million of the request for supplemental funding for that fiscal year,  VA officials said.

In retrospect, agency officials told us this  assumption was particularly unrealistic because of its accelerated time  frame. VA projected the savings from this reduction in workload would be  realized on the first day of the fiscal year, a change which would have  required transferring or discharging, in an extremely compressed time  frame, potentially thousands of veterans, many of whom had severe,  chronic, physical or mental impairments. These veterans would have had  to seek financing from other sources, such as Medicaid or private health  insurance, or paid for their care out of pocket. Moreover, achievement of  substantial savings from this policy would have also likely required  reducing the number of VA employees. However, VA included no  discussion in its budget formulation on how this cost-saving policy was to  be implemented. Furthermore, VA officials told us that because VA had  established a precedent for providing care to veterans who receive nursing  home care on a discretionary basis, changing the policy on short notice  would be difficult.", "Similarly, the fiscal year 2006 President\u2019s budget request for VA medical  programs included unrealistic assumptions and computational errors in  estimating savings of a proposed nursing home policy. The assumption  and estimation errors contributed to $600 million of the budget  amendment requesting additional funding in fiscal year 2006. The  President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request for VA medical programs  included a policy proposal to reduce patient workload and costs by  prioritizing the veterans who would receive long-stay nursing home care  in its VA-operated nursing homes, community nursing homes, and state  veterans\u2019 nursing homes. Long-stay care includes nursing home care  needed by veterans who cannot be cared for at home because of severe,  chronic physical or mental impairments such as the inability to  independently eat or the need for supervision because of dementia. Under  the proposed policy, many veterans receiving VA nursing home care would  no longer qualify for long-stay care.", "An unrealistic assumption about the expected time frame in which VA  could implement the proposed policy contributed to $152 million of the  $600 million request for additional funding for nursing home care in that  fiscal year, according to VA officials. While VA had originally assumed the  savings could be realized in April 2005, before the start of the 2006 fiscal  year, VA staff said they later recognized with OMB that this date had been  unrealistic. In addition, VA said that the policy assumed a 90 percent  reduction in patient workload in state veterans\u2019 nursing home workload  for patients requiring long-stay nursing home care but that the correct  estimate was a 20 percent reduction in workload per year. For VA- operated nursing homes, the policy assumed an 80 percent reduction in  patient workload over 1\u00bd years; however, VA later stated the correct  estimate was closer to 30 percent.", "Computation errors in estimating the effect of this proposed fiscal year  2006 policy contributed to about $445 million of the $600 million request  for additional funding for nursing home care in that fiscal year, according  to VA officials. In particular, VA underestimated patient workload\u2014 average daily census\u2014and costs in all three nursing home settings.  Specifically, VA incorrectly estimated that the average daily census in VA- operated nursing homes was 9,795, when the correct estimated patient  count was 11,151. Similarly, while VA estimated that the per diem rate for  its homes was $471.16, it was actually $567.52. VA officials said that the  errors in estimating the effect of the proposed nursing home policy  resulted from calculations being made in haste during the OMB appeal  process, and that a more standardized approach to long-term care  calculations could provide stronger quality assurance to help prevent  future mistakes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insufficient Data on Certain Activities Contributed to the Requests for Additional Funding in Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006", "paragraphs": ["Insufficient data on veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014OIF  and OEF\u2014accounted for $273 million of the request for supplemental  funding in fiscal year 2005. According to VA officials, the original cost  projections for providing care to OIF and OEF veterans were understated  for fiscal year 2005 in part because they were based on data from fiscal  year 2002 that predated the Iraq conflict, which began in March 2003.  While VA originally projected, in its fiscal year 2005 budget formulation,  that it would need to provide care to about 23,500 returnees from Iraq and  Afghanistan, revised projections indicated that it would serve about four  times that number of OIF and OEF veterans, nearly 100,000 returnees for  fiscal year 2005.", "Insufficient data on returning OIF and OEF veterans continued to be a  problem in fiscal year 2006 budget formulation, accounting for   $276 million of the budget amendment requesting additional funding for  that year, according to VA officials. VA officials told us they did not have  sufficient data for fiscal year 2006 due to challenges obtaining data needed  to identify these veterans from DOD. VA later determined in late fiscal  year 2005, after the President submitted the fiscal year 2006 budget  request, that it expected to provide care to approximately 87,000 patients  beyond what it had initially projected. According to VA officials, VA now  receives the DOD data it requires to identify OIF/OEF veterans on a  monthly basis rather than the quarterly reports it used to receive.  However, VA has a 2-month lag in projecting costs associated with treating  these veterans at VA.", "Insufficient data on whether VA achieved management efficiency savings  may have also contributed to the requests for additional funding. However,  VA\u2019s calculations of management efficiencies obtained in fiscal year 2005  were based on the same approach we found to be inadequate in our earlier  work and therefore are not reliable. Data on whether management  efficiency savings were achieved for fiscal year 2006 were not available  during our work because the fiscal year was not complete. Because we  could not determine if the efficiency savings were achieved, we could not  conclude whether the estimation of savings was incorrect and therefore  may have contributed to the request for additional funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA, like other federal agencies, faces fiscal challenges as demand for its  services increases while federal resources are constrained. Until recently,  VA had more options to meet this challenge because it could redirect  resources from more expensive inpatient care to less expensive outpatient  care to serve more veteran patients as it modernized the delivery of its  health care services. However, VA\u2019s success in transforming its system to  emphasize outpatient care means that it will have fewer such options to  meet future fiscal challenges. In this context, sound budget formulation,  anticipatory monitoring of budget execution, and the reporting of  informative and timely information to Congress for oversight will become  increasingly important in order to provide high-quality, accessible, and  cost-efficient health care to veterans. Even with these actions, the  challenge of balancing veterans\u2019 access to health care and the availability  of federal resources is likely to be more difficult in the future.", "The lessons of the last few years show what can happen when budget  formulation is affected by calculation errors, unrealistic assumptions, and  insufficient data. Whether due to errors in calculating long-term care  patient workloads and costs, unrealistic assumptions about the expected  time frame in which long-term care policies can be changed and lack of  discussion in budget formulation on how such policies would be  implemented, or insufficient data on the number of people who will need  health care, such problems can result in mismatches in projecting service  provision and available resources. Although budget formulation is, by its  nature, based on assumptions and imperfect information, these  assumptions and information can be improved based on experience, and  complemented by reasonable projections for known events that will affect  the agency. Additional measures in VA\u2019s quarterly reports, such as the time  new patients waited for their first health care appointments and measures  of patient workload in addition to unique patients, might help alert  Congress to potential problems VA may face in managing within its budget  in future years. VA\u2019s budget execution and monitoring in fiscal years 2005  and 2006 were perhaps more vigilant than in prior years because VA  expected, from the beginning of fiscal year 2005, that it might experience  difficulties in managing its medical program within available resources.  When, as a result of this monitoring, VA found potential problems in  providing medical care programs within its appropriations, its reporting of  the information to Congress was not sufficiently timely or informative.  More recently, however, VA improved the timeliness of its reporting. VA  submitted its third quarterly report for fiscal year 2006 more quickly after  the end of the quarter than it had the first two quarterly reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve VA\u2019s budget formulation of its medical programs budget  and facilitate congressional oversight, we recommend that the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs take three actions:    Explain the relationship between implementation of proposed policy  changes and the expected timing of when cost savings would be achieved.

We interviewed VA officials in Washington, D.C. from  three primary offices responsible for budget issues related to VA\u2019s medical  programs: (1) VA\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget,   (2) Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA) Office of the Chief Financial  Officer, and (3) VHA\u2019s Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for  Health for Policy and Planning. We also interviewed senior officials from  OMB responsible for VA budget issues to obtain their perspective on the  President\u2019s budget request for VA\u2019s medical programs and the subsequent  requests for additional funding for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.", "For the purposes of our analysis, the President\u2019s budget request for VA  medical programs primarily concerned four appropriation accounts:   (1) medical services, for direct patient care; (2) medical administration, for  administrative oversight and all information technology; (3) medical  facilities, for the maintenance and operation of hospitals and other  structures; and (4) medical research. VA funded nonrecurring  maintenance, for items such as roof repair, through the appropriations for  VA medical programs, and funds for these activities are included in our  analysis. However, we did not include more general construction  funding\u2014i.e., for major construction and minor construction\u2014in our  analysis, as these funds are provided in separate appropriations.", "We obtained and analyzed documents and interviewed VA officials about  how each of the three primary projection methods was used in formulating  the budget: (1) an actuarial model; (2) a long-term care approach; and   (3) other methodologies, including adding inflation to actual expenditures.  For each method, we verified information VA officials told us in interviews  by analyzing the documents VA provided. For example, we confirmed that  the actuarial model accounted for about 86 percent of the President\u2019s  budget request for VA medical programs for fiscal year 2005 through our  analysis of documents VA provided.", "To determine how VA monitored and reported to Congress on its budget  execution, we conducted interviews and reviewed copies of monthly  reports prepared internally for VA senior managers, monthly reports  prepared for OMB, and quarterly reports prepared for the House and  Senate Appropriations Committees. For monthly reports prepared for VA  senior managers, we reviewed both the March 2005 and the March 2006  monthly reports. We reviewed a monthly report VA prepared for OMB for  the month of April 2006.

Second, we interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the data used to formulate, monitor, and report on  the budget. We determined that the actuarial model appeared reasonable  for formulating the budget but we did not conduct a separate, detailed  audit of all data inputs into the actuarial model. Third, we relied on our  prior work to identify potential issues about data reliability.
