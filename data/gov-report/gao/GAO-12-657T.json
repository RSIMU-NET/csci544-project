This mandate directed that GAO report on, among other things, the potential deployment of additional units, increased use of ground-based mobile surveillance systems, use of mobile patrols by military personnel, and an increased deployment of unmanned aerial systems and manned aircraft in national airspace. In September 2011, GAO reported that DOD estimated a total cost of about $1.35 billion for two separate border operations\u0097Operation Jump Start and Operation Phalanx\u0097conducted by National Guard forces in Title 32 status from June 2006 to July 2008 and from June 2010 through September 30, 2011, respectively. Further, DOD estimated that it has cost about $10 million each year since 1989 to use active duty Title 10 forces nationwide, through its Joint Task Force-North, in support of drug law enforcement agencies with some additional operational costs borne by the military services. Agency officials stated multiple benefits from DOD\u0092s increased border role, such as assistance to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Border Patrol until newly hired Border Patrol agents are trained and deployed to the border; providing DOD personnel with training opportunities in a geographic environment similar to current combat theaters; contributing to apprehensions and seizures and deterring other illegal activity along the border; building relationships with law enforcement agencies; and strengthening military-to-military relationships with forces from Mexico.", "GAO found challenges for the National Guard and for active-duty military forces in providing support to law enforcement missions. For example, under Title 32 of the United States Code, National Guard personnel are permitted to participate in law enforcement activities; however, the Secretary of Defense has precluded National Guard forces from making arrests while performing border missions because of concerns raised about militarizing the U.S. border. As a result, all arrests and seizures at the southwest border are performed by the Border Patrol. Further, DOD officials cited restraints on the direct use of active duty forces, operating under Title 10 of the United States Code in domestic civilian law enforcement, set out in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. In addition, GAO has reported on the varied availability of DOD units to support law enforcement missions, such as some units being regularly available while other units (e.g., ground-based surveillance teams) may be deployed abroad\u0097making it more difficult to fulfill law enforcement requests.", "Federal officials stated a number of broad issues and concerns regarding any additional DOD assistance in securing the southwest border. DOD officials expressed concerns about the absence of a comprehensive strategy for southwest border security and the resulting challenges to identify and plan a DOD role. DHS officials expressed concerns that DOD\u0092s border assistance is ad hoc in that DOD has other operational requirements. DOD assists when legal authorities allow and resources are available, whereas DHS has a continuous mission to ensure border security. Further, Department of State and DOD officials expressed concerns about the perception of a militarized U.S. border with Mexico, especially when Department of State and Justice officials are helping civilian law enforcement institutions in Mexico on border issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our observations on the costs,  benefits, and challenges of a Department of Defense (DOD) role in  helping to secure the southwest land border.

In recent years, the National Guard has  played a role in helping to secure the southwest land border by providing  the Border Patrol with information on the identification of individuals  attempting to cross the southwest land border into the United States. Last  year, we reported to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees  our observations on the use of the National Guard and active duty forces  to help secure the southwest land border of the United States as directed  by the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2011.", "My statement today is based on our work conducted in 2011 and will  examine (1) the costs and benefits of a DOD role to help secure the  southwest land border, including the deployment of the National Guard,  other DOD personnel, or additional units; (2) the challenges associated  with a DOD role at the southwest land border; and (3) considerations of  an increased DOD role to help secure the southwest land border.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed our previous assessments of  southwest land border security and key documents related specifically to  DOD efforts at the southwest land border, such as the legal authorities  governing military forces operating under state, Title 32, and Title 10  status; the cost and benefits of recent efforts by DOD to assist DHS,  including Operation Jump Start (2006-2008) and Operation Phalanx  (2010-2011); DOD after-action reports and evaluations related to recent  DOD efforts to support law enforcement efforts at the southwest land  border; strategic and operational plans, and guidance related to  addressing security concerns at the southwest land border; funding and  cost data and sources of funding related to the deployment of DOD  personnel, equipment, unmanned aerial systems, and manned  surveillance aircraft; and other key documents.", "In addition, to better understand the cost, benefits, and challenges of a  DOD role in helping to secure the southwest land border, we met with and  interviewed officials from DOD, including the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, military services, National Guard Bureau, U.S. Northern  Command, U.S. Army North, and Joint Task Force-North. Further, to  distinguish the impact of an increased DOD role in helping to secure the  border, we spoke with officials from DHS, Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) (including U.S. Border Patrol, Office of Air and Marine); the  Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration; and the  Department of State, including the Bureau of International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement Affairs and Office of Mexican Affairs.", "We performed the work on which this testimony is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Over the last decade the National Guard has experienced  the largest activation of its forces since World War II. At the same time,  the Guard\u2019s domestic activities have expanded from routine duties, such  as responding to hurricanes, to include activities such as helping to  secure U.S. borders. Generally, the National Guard can operate in three  different statuses: (1) state status\u2014state funded under the command and  control of the governor; (2) Title 32 status\u2014federally funded under  command and control of the governor (Title 32 forces may participate in  law enforcement activities); and (3) Title 10 status\u2014federally funded  under command and control of the Secretary of Defense. Forces serving  in Title 10 status are generally prohibited from direct participation in law  enforcement activities, without proper statutory authorization, but may  work to support civilian law enforcement. Although National Guard forces  working in support of law enforcement at the southwest land border have  been activated under Title 32, the Secretary of Defense has limited their  activities with regard to law enforcement. Specifically, these National  Guard forces are not to make arrests. Since 2006, the National Guard  has supported DHS\u2019s border security mission in the four southwest border  states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) through two  missions:", "Operation Jump Start (June 2006-July 2008) involved volunteers from  the border states and from outside the border states; its mission  included aviation, engineering, and entry identification, among others,  according to National Guard officials.", "Operation Phalanx (July 2010-September 30, 2011) involved  volunteer units and in-state units.

This mandate directed that we report  on a number of steps that could be taken that might improve security on  the border, including the potential deployment of additional units,  increased use of ground-based mobile surveillance systems, use of  mobile patrols by military personnel, and an increased deployment of  unmanned aerial systems and manned aircraft to provide surveillance of  the southern land border of the United States. In September 2011, we  reported that DOD estimated a total cost of about $1.35 billion for two  separate border operations\u2014Operation Jump Start and Operation  Phalanx\u2014conducted by the National Guard forces in Title 32 status from  June 2006 to July 2008 and from June 2010 through September 30,  2011, respectively. Further, DOD estimated that it has cost about $10  million each year since 1989 to use active duty Title 10 forces nationwide,  through its Joint Task Force-North, in support of drug law enforcement  agencies with some additional operational costs borne by the military  services.", "As we considered the various steps we were directed to address in our  report, we found that the factors that may affect the cost of a DOD effort  are largely determined by the legal status and the mission of military  personnel being used, specifically whether personnel are responding  under Title 32 or Title 10 (federal status) of the Unites States Code. For  example, in considering the deployment of additional units, if National  Guard forces were to be used in Title 32 status, then the factors that may  impact the cost include whether in-state or out-of-state personnel are  used, the number of personnel, duration of the mission, ratio of officers to  enlisted personnel, and equipment and transportation needs. The costs of  National Guard forces working at the border in Title 32 status can also be  impacted by specific missions. For example, DOD officials told us that if  National Guardsmen were assigned a mission to conduct mobile patrols,  then they would be required to work in pairs and would only be able to  perform part of the mission (i.e., to identify persons of interest). They  would then have to contact the Border Patrol to make possible arrests or  seizures because the Secretary of Defense has precluded National  Guardsmen from making arrests or seizures during border security  missions. Border Patrol agents, however, may individually conduct the full  range of these activities, thus making the use of Border Patrol agents for  these activities more efficient.", "At the time of our review, Title 10 active duty military forces were being  used for missions on the border, and cost factors were limited primarily to  situations whereby DOD may provide military support to law enforcement  agencies for counternarcotic operations. Support can include direct  funding, military personnel, and equipment. With the estimated $10  million that DOD spends each year for Title 10 active duty forces in  support of drug law enforcement agencies nationwide, DOD is able\u2014  through its Joint Task Force-North\u2014to support approximately 80 of about  400 requests per year for law enforcement assistance. These funds have  been used for activities in support of law enforcement such as operations,  engineering support, and mobile training teams. For example, DOD was  able to provide some funding for DOD engineering units that constructed  roads at the border. While DOD provided the manpower and equipment,  CBP provided the materials. In addition, DOD was able to provide some  funding for DOD units that provided operational support (e.g., ground  based mobile surveillance unit) to law enforcement missions.", "We also reported on the cost factors related to deploying manned aircraft  and unmanned aerial systems. DOD officials did not report any use of  unmanned aerial systems for border security missions because these  systems were deployed abroad. DOD officials, however, did provide us  with cost factors for the Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial systems.  Specifically, in fiscal year 2011, the DOD Comptroller reported that a  Predator and a Reaper cost $859 and $1,456 per flight hour, respectively.  DOD uses maintenance costs, asset utilization costs, and military  personnel costs to calculate these figures. In addition, DOD officials  identified other factors that may impact operating costs of unmanned  aerial systems, including transportation for personnel and equipment,  rental or lease for hanger space, and mission requirements.", "With regard to manned aircraft, DOD provided cost factors for a  Blackhawk helicopter and a C-12 aircraft, which were comparable to the  type of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft used by DHS. For example, in fiscal  year 2011, DOD reported that a Blackhawk helicopter and a C-12 aircraft  cost $5,897 and $1,370 per flight hour, respectively. DOD uses  maintenance costs, asset utilization costs, and military personnel costs to  develop their flight hour estimates. Furthermore, according to DOD  officials, in fiscal year 2011, DOD contracted for a Cessna aircraft with a  forward-looking infrared sensor (known as the Big Miguel Program),  which costs $1.2 million per year and assisted at the southwest land  border."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Officials See Some Benefits of a DOD Role in Helping to Secure the Border", "paragraphs": ["Federal officials cited a variety of benefits from a DOD role to help secure  the southwest land border. For example, DOD assistance has (1)  provided a bridge or augmentation until newly hired Border Patrol agents  are trained and deployed to the border; (2) provided training opportunities  for military personnel in a geographic environment similar to combat  theaters abroad; (3) contributed to apprehensions and seizures made by  Border Patrol along the border; (4) deterred illegal activity at the border;  (5) built relationships with law enforcement agencies; and (6) maintained  and strengthened military-to-military relationships with forces from  Mexico. Specifically with regard to Operation Jump Start (June 2006-July  2008), CBP officials reported that the National Guard assisted in the  apprehension of 186,814 undocumented aliens, and in the seizure of  316,364 pounds of marijuana, among other categories of assistance,  including rescues of persons in distress and the seizure of illicit currency.  Based on these reported figures, the National Guard assisted in 11.7  percent of all undocumented alien apprehensions and 9.4 percent of all  marijuana seized on the southwest land border. During the National  Guard\u2019s Operation Phalanx (July 2010-June 30, 2011), CBP reported that  as of May 31, 2011, the National Guard assisted in the apprehension of  17,887 undocumented aliens and the seizure of 56,342 pounds of  marijuana. Based on these reported figures, the National Guard assisted  in 5.9 percent of all undocumented alien apprehensions and 2.6 percent  of all marijuana seized on the southwest land border. In fiscal year 2010,  active duty military forces (Title 10), through Joint Task Force-North,  conducted 79 missions with 842 DOD personnel in support of law  enforcement and assisted in the seizure of about 17,935 pounds of  marijuana, assisted in the apprehension of 3,865 undocumented aliens,  and constructed 17.26 miles of road, according to DOD officials.", "With regard to unmanned aerial systems at the time of our report, DOD  had fewer systems available, since they were deployed to missions  abroad, including operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere.", "Moreover, DOD\u2019s access to the national airspace is constrained given the  safety concerns about unmanned aerial systems raised by the Federal  Aviation Administration, specifically the ability of the unmanned aerial  system to detect, sense, and avoid an aircraft in flight. We also reported  that, conversely, pilots of manned aircraft have the ability to see and  avoid other aircraft, and thus may have more routine access to the  national airspace. Further, DOD reports that manned aircraft are effective  in the apprehension of undocumented aliens. For example, during fiscal  year 2011, DOD leased a manned Cessna aircraft (the Big Miguel  Program) that was used to assist in the apprehension of at least 6,500  undocumented aliens and the seizure of $54 million in marijuana, as  reported to DOD by DHS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges of a DOD Role in Helping to Secure the Southwest Land Border", "paragraphs": ["A number of challenges exist for both the National Guard and for active- duty military forces in providing support to law enforcement missions on  the southwest land border."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Guard", "paragraphs": ["National Guard personnel involved in activities on the border have been  under the command and control of the governors of the southwest border  states and have received federal funding in Title 32 status.

The National Guard  mission limitations are based in part on concerns raised by both DOD and  National Guard officials that civilians may not distinguish between  Guardsmen and active duty military personnel in uniform, which may lead  to the perception that the border is militarized. Therefore, all arrests and  seizures at the southwest land border are performed by the Border Patrol.", "Additionally, we found that the temporary use of the National Guard to  help secure the border may give rise to additional challenges. For  example, we reported that the use of out-of-state Guardsmen for long- term missions in an involuntary status may have an adverse effect on  future National Guard recruitment and retention, according to National  Guard officials. Finally, CBP officials noted that the temporary nature of  National Guard duty at the border could impact long-term border security  planning.

Further, DOD officials we spoke with also  raised information-sharing challenges when providing support to law  enforcement missions. For example, DOD officials commented that  because there are different types of law enforcement personnel that use  information differently (e.g., make an immediate arrest or watch, wait, and  grow an investigation leading to a later arrest), it was sometimes difficult  for DOD to understand whether information sharing was a priority among  law enforcement personnel.
