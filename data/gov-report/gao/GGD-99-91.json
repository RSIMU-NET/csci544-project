The recent rapid growth of Internet banking services has led to congressional concern about the safety and security of such banking activities and the preparedness of banking regulators to help ensure safe and sound Internet banking operations. The objectives of this report are to (1) describe the risks posed by Internet banking and the extent of any industrywide Internet banking-related problems, (2) assess the methods used by regulators to track depository institutions\u2019 plans to provide Internet banking services, (3) determine how regulators examined Internet banking activities, and (4) determine the extent to which regulators examined firms providing Internet banking support services to depository institutions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Internet banking is one form of on-line banking; PC direct dial banking is another.

According to recent data, at least 3,610 federally insured depository institutions\u2014about 17 percent of all U.S. banks, savings associations, and credit unions\u2014offered some form of Internet banking service as of February 1999. About 20 percent of these depository institutions offered fully transactional Web sites. Information available from the banking regulators and industry studies suggest that Internet banking is accelerating. According to FDIC and NCUA statistics, in the 11 months ending February 1999, the number of banks, thrifts, and credit unions with transactional sites almost tripled. According to projections reported by the Department of Commerce, the number of customers who went on-line to perform banking transactions increased by 22 percent, from 4.6 million to 5.6 million, in the 6 months ending April 1998.", "Five federal regulators\u2014FDIC, FRS, NCUA, OCC, and OTS\u2014supervise and examine all federally insured depository institutions. FDIC, a government corporation, is the primary federal regulator of state-chartered banks that are not members of FRS. FRS, another independent body, shares responsibility with state banking regulators for supervising and examining state-chartered banks that are members of FRS. In addition, FRS supervises bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. Banks under FRS\u2019 supervision are supervised by 12 regional Reserve Banks that conduct examinations under delegated authority from the Board of Governors in Washington. NCUA is an independent body responsible for examining and supervising federally insured credit unions and works with state regulators to monitor the safety and soundness of state-chartered credit unions. OCC, an agency, that is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, supervises all national banks. OTS, which is also a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, serves as the primary regulator for thrifts and thrift holding companies. The regulators oversee a mix of large, medium, and small depository institutions, as shown in table 1.", "Banking regulators also work together through FFIEC, an interagency forum Congress created in 1979 to promote consistency in the examination and supervision of depository institutions. In 1996, FFIEC updated its \u201cInformation Systems Handbook,\u201d which provides regulators with general guidance on information systems and technology examinations.", "To help ensure the safety and soundness of federally insured banks, thrifts, and credit unions, banking regulators conduct various types of monitoring activities. They include the following:", "Off-site monitoring, which generally consists of reviews and analyses of depository institution-submitted data, including call reports, and discussions with bank management, is carried out to monitor compliance with requirements or enforcement actions; formulate supervisory strategies, especially plans for on-site examinations; and identify trends, areas of concern, and accounting questions.", "On-site safety-and-soundness examinations are conducted to assess the safety and soundness of a depository institution\u2019s practices and operations. Specific objectives of these on-site examinations that are common to all the banking regulators include (1) determining the institution\u2019s condition and the risks associated with its current and planned activities; (2) evaluating the institution\u2019s overall integrity and the effectiveness of its risk management by testing the institution\u2019s practices; and (3) determining the institution\u2019s compliance with laws, regulations, and rulings.", "Information systems examinations are conducted to identify and correct information and technology-related risk exposures of significance that threaten the depository institution. These examinations focus on various components of an institution\u2019s information system, such as the capabilities of its information technology management; the adequacy of its systems development and programming; and the quality, reliability, availability, and integrity of its information technology operations.", "Finally, special technical examinations of banking services by third parties are conducted to ensure that banking operations performed by third-party firms are consistent with the safety and soundness of the depository institutions using the services. These examinations, which often include a review of the management systems, operations, and financial condition of the service providers, can provide regulators with greater assurances of the reliability of services than can be obtained during normal safety and soundness examinations of a depository institution.", "The banking regulators also conduct reviews of on-line banking systems for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.

We did not independently verify the accuracy of data that banking regulators provided. We also interviewed representatives from selected depository institutions and third-party firms to obtain their views on the scope and frequency of examinations by bank regulators and their assessment of risks posed by Internet banking systems. In addition, we developed a data collection instrument to document our review of 81 safety and soundness and information systems examinations that included on-line banking and we also used a structured questionnaire to interview 43 selected examiners who had conducted these on-line banking examinations.

Too few examinations that included a review of Internet banking had been conducted at the time of our review for the extent of Internet banking-related problems industrywide to have been identified. However, our review of 81 such examinations revealed that some depository institutions had not always adhered to risk mitigation guidance provided by the regulators. Few examinations had been conducted because, according to the regulators, Internet banking was a relatively new activity, and examination procedures were still being developed. Other reasons reported by regulators were that the number of examiners with expertise in information systems was limited and that some examiners who might otherwise have examined on-line banking during our study period were diverted by higher priority efforts to address the Year 2000 computer problem. As more examinations are completed, sharing of information among the regulators could help them better understand the extent of risks posed by Internet banking, develop risk characteristics allowing them to target institutions requiring further attention, and help make decisions on how best to allocate information technology expertise among competing priorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Internet Banking Risks", "paragraphs": ["Internet banking heightens various types of traditional banking risks that are of concern to banking regulators.

The use of an electronic channel, such as the Internet, to deliver products and services introduces unique risks for a depository institution due to the speed at which systems operate and the broad access in terms of geography, users, applications, databases, and peripheral systems.", "Transactional risk is the risk of financial losses arising from problems with service or product delivery. Transactional risk often results from deficiencies in computer system design, implementation, or ongoing maintenance.", "Strategic risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions or adverse implementation of those decisions. Depository institutions face strategic risk whenever they introduce a new product or service, such as Internet banking.", "Reputation risk is the risk of significant negative public opinion that results in a critical loss of funding or customers. This risk can also expose the depository institution to costly litigation. Failure of Internet banking products to perform as promised, such as a communication failure that prevents customers from accessing their accounts, could expose a depository institution to reputation risk.", "Lastly, compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of, or nonconformance with, laws, rules, regulations, required practices, or ethical standards. This risk may arise if a depository institution fails to comply with regulatory guidance or an enforcement action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Provided Guidance on Risk Mitigation", "paragraphs": ["Banking regulators have provided depository institutions with advisory guidance on how to mitigate risks posed by Internet banking, including risks related to services provided by third-party firms. In their guidance, regulators describe how depository institutions in general should plan for, manage, and monitor risks associated with the use of technology. Most regulators provided such guidance in advisory letters to all covered depository institutions. FRS provided its guidance in a \u201csound practices paper\u201d released at a FRS information security conference in September 1997. The guidance was not tailored to fit individual institutions. (See app. II for descriptions of guidance provided by each regulator.) As discussed in these advisory guidance, risk management systems include the following critical components.", "Active board and senior management oversight: Boards of directors have ultimate responsibility for on-line banking systems, including Internet banking systems, offered by their depository institutions. The guidance points out that the Internet facilitates broad access to confidential or proprietary information, and deficiencies in planning and deployment can significantly increase the risk posed to a depository institution and decrease its ability to respond satisfactorily to problems that arise. For this reason, directors, senior managers, and line officers are to be fully informed of the significant investments, opportunities, and risks involved in deploying such technology. Boards of directors should approve the overall business and technology strategies, and senior management should ensure that adequate risk management systems are in place.", "Effective internal controls: Internal controls are the means by which the board of directors, management, and other personnel obtain reasonable assurance that an institution\u2019s assets are safeguarded and that its systems and operations are reliable and efficient. Regulators\u2019 guidance describes a variety of internal controls to help mitigate risks involving such areas as systems security, management of third-party firms, and various operating policies and procedures that should be considered to keep pace with new technological developments.", "Adequate internal audits: Regulators\u2019 guidance points out that an objective review of on-line banking should identify and quantify risk, and detect possible weaknesses in a depository institution\u2019s risk management system as it pertains to on-line banking. When coupled with a strong risk management program, a comprehensive, ongoing audit program allows the institution to protect its interests as well as those of its customers and other participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Too Few Examinations Had Been Conducted to Identify the Extent of Any Industrywide Internet Banking-Related Problems", "paragraphs": ["While examiners found that some depository institutions were not taking all of the prescribed precautions to mitigate risks, too few examinations with documented on-line banking assessments were available at the time of our review to identify the extent of any industrywide Internet banking- related problems. According to the regulators, few examinations had been conducted because Internet banking is a relatively new activity and regulators have had to develop and implement new policies and procedures and related training programs to assess this activity. In addition, regulatory examinations required to address the higher priority Year 2000 computer problem were contemporaneous with our review, and some regulators reported that limited information systems resources prevented them from conducting both Year 2000 and on-line banking examinations.", "Between March 1998 and August 1998, we asked each regulator to provide us with information on safety and soundness and information systems examinations in which (1) examiners applied their agency\u2019s on-line banking examination procedures written for both direct-dial and Internet banking systems or (2) where the examination\u2019s scope included on-line banking. It was difficult for most regulators to provide such information because, with the exception of FDIC, information was not maintained centrally to identify examinations that included on-line banking assessments. We reviewed 81 examinations that regulators were able to provide. The 81 examinations included 58 small-, 18 medium-, and 5 large- sized depository institutions. The Internet banking activities examined by the regulators included informational sites, information-exchange sites, and transactional sites.", "In the examinations we reviewed, examiners noted that the on-line banking risk mitigation systems had various types of weaknesses. None of the examined depository institutions, including those whose risk management systems evidenced weaknesses, were reported to have experienced financial losses or security breaches due to Internet banking activities. However, in the 81 depository institutions examinations we reviewed, regulators found that 36 (44 percent) had not completely implemented the on-line banking risk mitigation steps outlined by the regulator. As summarized in table 2, in 20 of the 81 examinations (25 percent), strategic planning deficiencies were discovered. For example, the regulators found that some institutions had not prepared strategic plans or had not obtained board of directors\u2019 approval before initiating on- line banking. In 26 of the examinations (32 percent), the regulators found that the institution did not have policies and procedures in place to guide its on-line banking operations. In 29 of the examinations (36 percent), the regulators found that the institution lacked adequate audit coverage of its on-line operations. Fifteen examinations (18 percent) disclosed that the institution had not taken steps to evaluate its third-party firm or lacked a written contract with the firm. Examiners whom we interviewed expressed concerns about deficiencies similar to those revealed in the examinations we reviewed. For example, examiners were concerned that some smaller institutions were implementing Internet banking systems before they had established operating policies and procedures and that bank management had to be reminded that operating policies and procedures were not optional.", "Because the examinations we reviewed did not represent a statistically valid sample, we are unable to project the number of weaknesses beyond the institutions reviewed. However, the extent of problems identified at smaller institutions is consistent with views expressed by some banking industry officials that smaller institutions have the potential to encounter Internet banking-related problems. These officials generally believed that smaller institutions may have insufficient in-house expertise to operate an Internet banking system or lack the ability to adequately evaluate the Internet banking services offered by third-party firms to ensure that such systems operate as intended. In particular, NCUA officials observed that smaller institutions might move too quickly into Internet banking because of the relatively low costs of providing such services through third-party firms and the desire to remain competitive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Face Human Capital Challenges Because of Internet Banking Growth", "paragraphs": ["Banking regulators have told us that depository institutions\u2019 increasing use of information technology\u2014such as that employed in Internet banking\u2014 and the growth forecast for Internet banking, present them with human capital management challenges. The adequacy of regulatory efforts to ensure safe and sound operations of complex transactional Internet banking systems will depend increasingly upon the availability of examiners with appropriate expertise or training in information technology management.

This information could be instrumental in enabling regulators to provide individual depository institutions with more timely and specific risk-management guidance and advice before such institutions enter into contracts with third-party firms or independently develop their own Internet banking services. Awareness of an institution\u2019s Internet banking plans could also provide regulators with useful information to plan the scope and timing of future examinations as well as to identify the need for examiners with the appropriate information technology expertise. OTS recently established a requirement that it receive advance notice of an institution\u2019s plans to establish a transactional Web site. OTS and FDIC were the only regulators that captured Internet banking information gathered during examinations, including information about institutions\u2019 plans to offer Internet banking, in a centralized database that could be used in planning examinations and monitoring Internet banking activities.

The regulations state that the notice must describe the transactional Web site; indicate the date the site will become operational; and list a contact familiar with the deployment, operation, and security of the site. According to OTS officials, the one-time notification requirement will enable the agency to better monitor technological innovations and thus assess emerging security and compliance risks. OTS officials said they believed that this monitoring would also enable the agency to more proactively provide guidance to thrifts as they plan for or begin to conduct Internet operations.", "At the time of our review, OTS was beginning to develop procedures for providing such guidance. If, after receiving the notice OTS informs the thrift of any concerns, the thrift must follow any procedures that OTS imposes. If the thrift does not receive any comments from OTS, it is free to go on-line 30 days from the filing date of its notice with OTS.", "Before adoption of the final proposal, OTS recognized that this notice requirement would impose some burden on thrifts. However, it determined that the one-time expenditure by a thrift of an estimated 2 hours to report its plans represented a minimal burden. Before January 1999, the effective date of the reporting requirement, OTS officials told us that OTS identified thrifts\u2019 Internet banking activities primarily during examinations, although some of its regional offices used other means to identify Web sites. For example, the western region periodically had surveyed thrifts, and the Atlanta region used the Internet to identify thrifts\u2019 Web sites.", "In August 1998, OTS asked for public comment on its advance notice proposal. The agency received nine comments in response\u2014six from thrifts, two from trade associations, and one from a public interest organization. Seven commenters supported the proposal\u2019s overall flexible regulatory approach. Two commenters argued for even greater flexibility and opposed the proposed notification requirement. Four commenters also argued that the notice requirement would place thrifts at a competitive disadvantage, because other banking regulators did not impose a similar requirement. OTS\u2019 response was that it did not anticipate that the notification requirement would place thrifts at a significant competitive disadvantage because, once a thrift has addressed any follow-up questions from OTS\u2019 regional office or the 30-day period has expired, the thrift would be free to operate the transactional Web site.", "Finally, one commenter questioned whether requiring regulatory notice 30 days prior to installing a transactional site would mitigate the risks mentioned by OTS. The commenter noted that developing a system requires substantial advance planning, possibly across multiple departments, and perhaps a contract with an outside third-party firm. Thus, at the time of notice, according to the commenter, the work essentially would be completed, and the financial costs of development already would have been absorbed by the institution. The commenter pointed out that, for this reason, an advance notice after the financial risk had been assumed would not substantially protect the institution. OTS\u2019 response was that it encourages thrifts concerned with such expenditures of resources to consult their regional office in the early stages of development, even before filing a notice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDIC and OTS Maintain Centralized Databases on Internet Banking Information", "paragraphs": ["Currently FDIC and OTS are the only regulators that maintain a centralized database on Internet banking information gathered during banking examinations.

In addition to data on institutions offering or planning to offer Internet banking, this database includes information on third-party firms supplying Internet banking services. According to FDIC officials, information captured in the centralized system facilitates the creation of uniform records of all examined institutions with on-line banking and avoids capturing redundant information across FDIC\u2019s eight regions. They said that the system also provides an improved means across separate regional systems for headquarters\u2019 staff and examiners to understand how electronic banking is changing and to more effectively plan the scope, timing, and staffing of future examinations. As of April 1, 1999, the FDIC centralized system included information from 391 on-line banking examinations.", "OTS began collecting information centrally in November 1998.

FDIC was the first to implement an on-line banking examination program in 1997 and had identified more examinations for our review than any other banking regulator. In commenting on a draft of this report, FDIC said that it had also developed three technical work programs that it is field-testing and has shared with the other regulators.

NCUA first began to consider the need for Internet banking examinations in 1997, when it informally distributed a white paper on \u201ccyber credit union services.\u201d This paper was distributed to NCUA examiners who had attended a specific training course and was also provided to each regional director, who had the option of making the paper more widely available to regional staff.", "NCUA officials told us the agency now expects to develop new Internet examination procedures that will be closely aligned to FFIEC\u2019s guidance on supervisory oversight of information systems, but no time frames have been established for developing or implementing these procedures.

For example, because Internet banking is a new banking activity that can potentially introduce new risks to an institution, FDIC and OTS expect their examiners to thoroughly examine an institution\u2019s Internet banking activities during the first examination after those activities are implemented. In contrast, FRS and OCC do not require that an institution\u2019s new Internet banking activity be thoroughly examined. Instead, these regulators permit safety and soundness or information systems examiners to exercise discretion in determining the relative risk and the need for and scope of their examinations of new banking activities, including the establishment of Internet banking services. In this regard, examiners may decide not to devote further resources to examining Internet banking if they determine after an initial assessment that Internet banking is a small segment of an institution\u2019s overall business, posing little risk to the safety and soundness of the institution.", "We also found differences in the type of examiners used to perform on-line banking examinations. Two regulators, FDIC and FRS, designed their examination procedures to mainly assess the safety and soundness aspects of Internet banking, such as the appropriateness of an institution\u2019s strategic planning, internal controls, and operating policies and procedures. These regulators said that, due to the orientation of the examination procedures, safety and soundness examiners generally conducted examinations that included a review of Internet banking. If, in the judgment of the safety and soundness examiner, a more sophisticated assessment of an institution\u2019s Internet banking activities were needed, more technically proficient information system specialists were to be called in to perform a separate assessment. In contrast, OCC said that information system specialists conducted most of its Internet banking examinations, utilizing procedures that included more technical aspects of an institution\u2019s Internet banking activities, such as policies addressing passwords, firewalls, encryption, and physical security. OCC requires that most Internet banking examinations be conducted by information system specialists because it believes that the technology-related aspects of Internet banking require examiners with expertise in information systems. OTS also requires the use of information systems examiners for examinations of complex or large institutions. Small or less complex institutions are to be examined by safety and soundness examiners.", "Regulators also differed in the degree to which their examiners were trained in on-line banking systems. FDIC, FRS, and OTS initiated training programs for their safety and soundness examiners on electronic-banking issues. Topics in the training programs included electronic banking trends and developments, risks and vulnerabilities, and regulatory concerns. At the close of our review, FDIC said that it had trained nearly all of its safety and soundness examiners, and OTS said that it expected to complete their training for safety and soundness examiners by the end of 1999. FRS officials also said that they expected to complete an initial training program for safety and soundness examiners by the end of 1999. These officials added that additional training would likely be required as Internet banking activities evolve and a greater understanding of the risks is developed. FDIC also had developed a training program that provided more in-depth information systems training to a group of information systems examiners and certain safety and soundness examiners.

NCUA officials cited the lack of technical expertise as a key reason for their inactivity. Further, NCUA officials said that, on the basis of discussions at a January 1999 FFIEC planning meeting, it appeared unlikely that other regulators would participate with NCUA in joint reviews of third-party firms servicing credit unions. The NCUA officials explained that regulators typically provide staff and resources to a particular joint review when there is a regulatory overlap involving firms that provided services to both banks and thrifts.

In deliberations prior to enacting the Bank Service Company Act, Congress made it clear that banks could not avoid examinations of banking functions by outsourcing the functions to third-party firms. The legislative history shows that Congress intended that banking regulators be able to examine all bank records and that they must be able to exercise proper supervision over all banking activities, whether performed by bank employees on the bank\u2019s premises or by anyone else on or off their premises. Regulators generally believe that this authority is important because it allows them to take a broader approach to examining the services of banks or thrifts and their providers. These examinations are not intended to replace a depository institution\u2019s oversight and monitoring of its third-party firms, which remains the responsibility of the depository institution. Instead of examining particular services that a third-party firm provides to a single bank or thrift, regulators can assess the entire broad range of services a third-party firm provides to the banking industry. In addition to being a more direct approach, most regulators believe such examinations also may be more efficient and effective. Over time, the authority to examine third-party firms has become even more important, as depository institutions have contracted out an increasing proportion of their operations. FRS officials noted, however, that such examinations (1) extend bank supervision outside the banking industry, (2) may unnecessarily consume scarce government resources unless effectively risk focused, and (3) may create a moral hazard by undermining the incentive for banks and thrifts to manage their service provider relationships effectively.", "In March 1998, NCUA and OTS were given authority to examine certain third-party firms through the Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness for Financial Institutions Act (the Parity Act). Specifically, the Parity Act gave NCUA and OTS independent authority to examine services provided by service providers to credit unions and thrifts by amending the Federal Credit Union Act and the Homeowners\u2019 Loan Act, respectively. The acts primarily focus on ongoing computer services and turnkey operations in which transactions are transmitted at the end of the day to a central location.

In addition, at the time the Parity Act legislation was being considered, one credit union trade association strenuously objected to strengthening NCUA\u2019s examination authority. As a result a compromise was reached that NCUA\u2019s authority would be sunsetted. Unless Congress amends the sunset provision, NCUA will not have the third-party oversight authority already provided to all other banking regulators. This is of particular concern because NCUA officials said that most credit unions offering Internet banking services lack in- house expertise and rely in part or totally on third-party firms to provide such services.

At the time of our review, too few examinations of Internet banking had been conducted to identify the extent of potential Internet banking-related problems industrywide. Nonetheless, the examinations we reviewed revealed that some depository institutions had not taken all the necessary precautions to mitigate on-line banking risks. As banking regulators conduct more Internet banking examinations, they could usefully pool and share their findings to establish the extent of such problems industrywide. Sharing information on such findings could provide regulators with information to better understand the risks posed by Internet banking, allow regulators to better monitor industry trends, make more informed decisions on the scope and timing of examinations, and allocate limited resources among competing priorities.", "At a time when Internet banking appears to be accelerating rapidly, banking regulators either have or plan to utilize a variety of means to identify depository institutions that are already offering Internet banking services. However, OTS and FDIC were the only regulators with procedures to gather centralized information on depository institutions\u2019 plans to offer Internet banking. OTS required that it receive advance notification of a depository institution\u2019s intentions, and FDIC required its examiners to collect information on an institution\u2019s Internet banking plans for inclusion in a centralized database. Such early identification procedures could enable regulators to provide more timely and specific risk management guidance and advice to depository institutions, and the procedures could also provide the regulators useful information to assess the scope and timing of future examinations and determine the need for examiners with information technology expertise. Given concerns that some institutions, particularly smaller ones, might move too quickly into Internet banking because of a desire to remain competitive, regulatory procedures that provide advance notification could be an effective means for regulators to proactively oversee this new and evolving banking activity.", "With the exception of NCUA, the banking regulators were developing, testing, or implementing new on-line banking examination procedures and had conducted at least some examinations of institutions\u2019 Internet banking services. However, regulators\u2019 examination programs used differing methods in conducting and staffing Internet banking examinations. In addition, differences exist in the degree to which examiners received training on how to examine such activities. As each regulator gains experience in the application of its examination procedures, it could be useful for the regulators to share their findings and approaches to help determine which methods yield the most effective and efficient results. In addition, NCUA, which has reported resource constraints due to the Year 2000 computer problem, has an obligation to help ensure the safety and soundness of credit unions\u2019 Internet banking operations and needs a reasonable strategy to do so once work on the Year 2000 computer problem diminishes.", "The banking regulators\u2019 joint study of third-party firms providing Internet banking service is a good first step toward providing efficient and effective oversight, because it has the potential to lead to single coordinated examinations. However, it is too early to tell whether the study will result in a proposal to jointly examine third-party firms.", "Also, NCUA\u2019s authority to examine firms providing Internet banking services expires on December 31, 2001. If this authority is not extended, NCUA will not have the third-party oversight authority provided to other federal banking regulators.

FDIC commented that it had observed numerous examples of small banks successfully employing sophisticated technology and believed that it is up to bank management, regardless of the size of the bank, to properly manage any new technology. OTS similarly commented that it did not believe that it is inherently more difficult for smaller banks to properly manage on-line and Internet banking activities and believed that such technology should not be exclusively the province of large institutions. We did not intend to broadly characterize small banks as being technologically deficient and agree that a bank\u2019s success in managing new technology depends on the strength of its management. Our review of 81 examinations of on-line banking assessments showed that examiners found that some small- and medium-sized depository institutions were not taking all of the prescribed precautions to mitigate Internet banking risks. However, the report specifically notes that too few examinations had been conducted to identify the extent of any industrywide Internet banking-related problems.", "Finally, FRS concurred with the need for the regulators to develop supervisory plans with respect to outsourcing of Internet banking operations by depository institutions. However, it commented that it was not clear whether we were recommending a change in the current policies and practices regarding interagency examinations of service providers or some other form of regulatory oversight. Further, FRS stated that the report provided no evidence of problems at Internet vendor firms that would indicate the need to expand the regulators\u2019 responsibility to oversee directly all providers of Internet banking products and services, and it suggested that the report emphasize that banks, and not bank supervisors, bear the responsibility for monitoring and overseeing their service providers.", "We are encouraged by the banking regulatory agencies\u2019 efforts to conduct a joint research project designed to develop a greater understanding of the oversight issues associated with assessments of Internet banking products and services offered to banks and thrifts by third-party firms.

In this regard, our recommendation is intended to ensure that an interagency strategy, instead of individual agency strategies, is developed to examine those third-party firms.

Since not all regulators track examinations of on-line banking operations, we could not ascertain how many on-line banking examinations had been conducted. FDIC was the only regulator that was able to tell us the number of on-line banking examinations it completed during the period of our review. FRS did not maintain centrally on-line banking examinations conducted by the various Federal Reserve districts at the time of our review. As such, FRS officials directed us to the Reserve Banks, which maintain examination workpapers and are responsible for scheduling and conducting examinations. We discussed with the San Francisco District Bank staff their on-line banking procedures and related examiner training and obtained copies of examination work papers. We then contacted the New York District Bank, which was field testing the on-line banking procedures. To review additional examinations, we contacted the Atlanta and Kansas City District Banks.", "OCC was not able to provide the number of on-line banking examinations conducted by its district offices.

For those banks that appeared on both lists, we then requested a Profile Extract Report for each bank to determine the scope of examination activities. This method resulted in our identifying eight examinations with a scope that included Internet banking. Initially, OTS was also not able to tell us with certainty the number of on-line banking safety and soundness and information systems examinations conducted by its regional offices. To obtain this information, OTS contacted each office for the information because each office maintains its own information and determines its own examination schedule.", "We were able to identify 81 on-line banking safety and soundness and information systems examinations conducted during the period June 1997 to August 1998.
