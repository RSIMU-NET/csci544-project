The difference between the RIK gas owed--MMS's entitled percentage of gas--and the percentage it actually receives is referred to as a \"gas imbalance.\" GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which MMS can provide reasonable assurance that it is accurately identifying and collecting RIK gas imbalances in a timely fashion.

GAO found that MMS is forgoing revenues for the following reasons: (1) MMS estimates that it is owed a net of $21 million for past imbalances but it lacks the information necessary to calculate the full amount of revenues due. MMS does not have sufficient data to determine whether it has received its full percentage of RIK gas. Also, MMS's estimate does not include interest on some unpaid imbalances because MMS has not determined when interest begins to accrue on imbalances, as required by law. Further, MMS monitors imbalances on a monthly, rather than daily basis, which leaves open the possibility that some companies owing RIK gas could provide less gas to MMS when gas prices are relatively high, making up the difference by providing more gas when prices are relatively low, something that could cost MMS additional revenues because it could miss the opportunity to sell gas on the days when prices are high. (2) MMS does not audit gas companies' production and allocation data, therefore it cannot verify that it is receiving its entitled percentage of gas. MMS does not audit, in part, because it believes that its verification procedures are sufficient. However, other governments and gas companies routinely audit their imbalances and uncover inaccuracies that would result in lost revenues if left unchecked. (3) MMS lacks adequate policies and procedures for accurately and promptly identifying and collecting gas imbalances. For instance, the agency does not know how companies allocate gas among all parties having a claim on a share of gas produced; this may affect whether MMS receives its percentage of gas on a daily basis. In addition, MMS does not compel companies to document production and deliveries in a consistent format and meet deadlines. As a result, MMS analysts spend time gathering and reformatting data instead of identifying and collecting on imbalances. MMS also allows companies to negotiate imbalances indefinitely. For example, MMS has been negotiating with a company for more than 2 years regarding a $900,000 imbalance. (4) MMS's information system does not provide accurate and timely data on RIK gas imbalances. For instance, MMS's information system cannot calculate cash settlements for imbalances or compare various types of data that companies submit. Consequently, MMS processes more than half of its gas imbalance data manually. (5) MMS has been operating for many years without sufficient staff to reconcile gas imbalances, and the staff it has is not sufficiently trained. For instance, according to RIK management, MMS does not have sufficient staff to dedicate someone to fully review RIK gas analysts' work on imbalances, even though mistakes in that work often occur. MMS recently hired one new gas imbalance analyst but has not formally assessed staffing needs. In addition, RIK gas imbalance staff lack, among other things, training on industry standards on gas imbalance calculations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) Minerals  Management Service (MMS) collected more than $12 billion in royalties  for oil and natural gas developed and produced from federal lands and  waters. These royalties represent one of the country\u2019s largest nontax  sources of revenue. Companies that develop and produce oil and gas  resources from federal lands and waters do so under leases obtained from  and administered by agencies of Interior\u2013\u2013the Bureau of Land  Management for onshore leases and MMS for offshore leases. MMS also  collects, accounts for, and distributes royalties associated with oil and gas  produced from leased federal lands and waters. MMS collects royalties  either through its royalty-in-value program\u2013\u2013whereby producers pay  royalties in cash based on the cash value of the oil and gas produced and  sold\u2013\u2013or its royalty-in-kind (RIK) program\u2013\u2013whereby producers pay  royalties in oil or gas, and MMS in turn sells the oil or gas. In fiscal year  2008, MMS estimates it collected gas valued at more than $2.4 billion and  oil valued at nearly $4.2 billion through the RIK program, which is equal to  more than half the royalties collected by MMS. In September 2008, we  reported that MMS\u2019s oversight of its RIK natural gas collections was less  robust than its oversight of RIK oil collections and that the agency lacked  assurance that it was collecting the RIK gas royalties it was owed.", "Given the financial importance of royalty management, MMS has been the  subject of considerable scrutiny by GAO; Interior\u2019s Inspector General (IG);  its own internal reviews; and the Royalty Policy Committee, a group  convened in 1997 by the Secretary of the Interior and charged with  advising Interior on managing federal leases and revenues. One  vulnerability identified by these groups is the possibility that MMS may not  receive the total amount of royalties to which it is entitled\u2014a situation  known as an \u201cimbalance.\u201d Interior\u2019s IG first noted this vulnerability in the  RIK program in 2002. In June 2007, MMS likewise found weaknesses in its  handling of RIK gas imbalances in its response to the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Circular A-123, which defines management\u2019s  responsibility for internal control in federal agencies. Based on these  findings, MMS implemented an action plan to assist in the identification  and timely resolution of imbalances. Further, the Royalty Policy  Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Royalty Management issued a report to the  full committee in December 2007 that included more than 100  recommendations to strengthen Interior\u2019s royalty collections, including 31  directed at the RIK program. Among these recommendations, the  subcommittee recommended that an RIK subcommittee be formed to  address, among other things, the verification of RIK gas volumes. This  subcommittee, established in April 2008, has since noted RIK gas  imbalances as an issue and has stated that it will be reporting to the full  committee on its findings and recommendations early in the new  administration.", "In light of these questions, as well as the potential financial impacts of RIK  gas imbalances, you asked us to determine the extent to which MMS  ensures the accurate and timely identification and collection of RIK gas  imbalances.

We also met with officials from MMS, gas production companies, the North American Energy Standards Board, , as  well as industry experts.

In addition, MMS concluded  that it would not need to audit RIK sales because the agency would sell th gas rather than relying on producers to accurately report their ow prices, as is done in the royalty-in-value program. The collecting,  reporting, and auditing of cash royalty payments have been challenging for  MMS because of concerns about the accuracy and reliability of productionand pricing data submitted by royalty payors and because there are about  29,000 leases producing oil and gas, many with several companies paying  monthly royalties.

MMS  estimated that from fiscal years 2004 through 2007, the RIK program  generated about $150 million more in net value to the government than  MMS would have collected had it received royalties in cash. Of this $150  million, MMS estimated that (1) $131 million came from selling RIK oil and  2)  gas for more than MMS would have received in cash royalty payments, ( $8 million came from interest that accrued because revenues from RIK  sales were received earlier than cash payments would have been rece through the in-value program, and (3) $11 million came from savings accrued because the RIK p royalty-in-value program.  rogram costs less to administer than the  Through the RIK gas program, companies that produce gas on federal  leases owe MMS a royalty, or a percentage, of the daily gas production. To  ensure that the government obtains the fair value of RIK sales, MMS must  ensure that it receives the percentage of total production volumes to  which it is entitled. The volume of gas a company owes to MMS is  determined by the following equation:  royalty volume = total production volume x royalty percentage  The royalty percentage for leases taken in kind varies somewhat b currently in the range of 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent. Measuring  ut is  production and allocating a percentage of that production is relatively straightforward when one company measures its own output from a  federal lease and reports its own production to MMS. However, multip production companies sometimes combine the gas flowing from theirleases at a measurement point in order to share the risks, costs, and  benefits of gas production. These companies often elect from among  themselves a single company\u2014called the operator\u2014to allocate the gas  flowing from each of the companies. Due to the complex nature of the  natural gas market, operators cannot always allocate each producti on  company or royalty owner its entitled amount of gas, resulting in a  situation known as an \u201cimbalance.\u201d Imbalances\u2014both positive and  negative\u2014are a common occurrence for MMS and all companies in the industry because, among other reasons, companies must estimate the  volume of gas they will produce; in turn operators allocate gas based those estimates rather than actual production.

First, it does not verify  all gas production data to ensure it receives its entitled percentage of RIK  ciled  gas from all leases taken in kind. Prior to February 2009, MMS recon gas imbalances through data from two operator-generated reports,  imbalance statements and monthly production reports, and online third- party data from pipeline companies on the amount delivered to purchase of RIK gas. This verified whether MMS received the volumes of ga the operator reported, and whether that volume was the correct  percentage of reported production according to operator-generated d However, it did not verify through third-party data that the operator  correctly reported the total production at each lease in the first place.  Therefore, MMS could not use this method to verify that the gas alloca by operators was equal to MMS\u2019s entitled percentage of gas volum Recognizing this, in 2008, we recommended that MMS bolster its  verification process for gas volumes owed to the government by using third-party production information, such as the data collected in the  Offshore Energy and Minerals Management division\u2019s gas verification  system, in addition to the third-party delivery information it had already  been using. MMS\u2019s gas imbalance analysts began using the third-party  data contained in the gas verification system in February 2009, but  because these data only include total production at the measurement po rather than for each lease, analysts cannot use the system to verify that it  was allocated the entitled percentage from each lease taken in kind.  ata. es.", "Second, MMS lacks information on how to price gas imbalances and the  point at which the agency should begin applying interest to the imbalanc for leases that have terminated from the program or those leases whe re  production has ceased. Since the RIK program first began, MMS has  updated its guidance letter to operators. Although MMS\u2019s most recent  guidance letter states that MMS will charge monthly interest on  imbalances, past guidance letters state that interest will only be charged if  the operator pays its imbalance later than 60 days after the final month the imbalance occurred. Interior is required by law to charge interest on late  payments and underpayments of royalties. Further, while MMS\u2019s c guidance letter to operators specifies that it will price imbalances  according to its own contract price for the gas during the month the  imbalance occurred, the previous guidance letters did not contain this  language. MMS is not actively trying to collect on the imbalances of those  leases that have been terminated from the program or those leases wh ere  production has ceased because there have been discussions with the  Office of the Solicitor for more than a year about these issues. In a January 2008 memo, MMS asked the Office of the Solicitor for an opinion  on when  to charge interest and whether its current methodology to price  imbalances is consistent with law. In its memo, MMS proposed the following two pricing methods, in addition to its current method:  1.  Calculating the price of the imbalances based on the value applicable  editing  to the month before settling the imbalance in cash and after cr any over-allocations existing since the first imbalance month.   the price using the value when the last imbalance  occurred.", "Recently, the Office of the Solicitor asked RIK program officials to ch the most appropriate pricing and interest methods before issuing an  opinion on those methods. However, those methods have not yet been  presented to the Solicitor, and MMS is currently not making additional  requests for payment of imbalances for leases that have term the program or those leases where production has ceased.", "Finally, MMS could be forgoing revenue because it lacks information  daily gas imbalances. Section 115 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty  Management Act, as amended, provides that a lessee\u2019s obligation does not  become \u201cdue\u201d until the end of the month following the month in which th e  gas is produced. In its guidance letter to operators, MMS requests t deliveries be made on a daily basis equal to the royalty percentage.  Because the statute authorizes MMS to enforce operator obligations only  on a monthly basis, MMS believes it appropriate to calculate and monito r  imbalances owed solely on a monthly rather than daily basis. However, this leaves open the possibility that some companies that owe RIK gas  could provide less gas to MMS on days when gas prices are relatively high,  hat  and make up the difference by providing more gas on days when prices are relatively low. Because purchasers of RIK gas bid on two components of  the amount of gas produced daily\u2014a minimum volume set at a monthly price and an additional volume, if available, at a fluctuating daily or \u201cspot price\u2014MMS would lose revenue because it would miss the opportunity  sell gas on days when spot prices are higher. Because MMS reconciles  imbalances on a monthly\u2013\u2013rather than daily\u2013\u2013basis, such an occurrence could go undetected. MMS guarantees the purchaser of RIK gas the  full  minimum volume on a daily basis, except in the case of equipment failure or natural disaster. In contrast, industry officials we  spoke with said that they monitor imbalances daily to ensure their  companies do not lose revenue from daily imbalances.", "To investigate the extent to which MMS has been allocated its royalty  percentage of RIK gas on a daily basis, we analyzed daily volumes of to production and allocation to MMS at a sample of measurement points.  Because measurement points combine the gas from numerous leases may have differing royalty percentages, it is not possible to determine  whether MMS received its royalty percentage on a daily basis using data. We therefore restricted our analysis to a random sample of the  measurement points that had leases with a common royalty percenta These points account for about 85 percent of those in the RIK gas  program. On most days\u2013\u201374 percent of those we examined\u2013\u2013the alloca was within 25 percent of MMS\u2019s royalty percentage.

We estimated that the correlation we found would result in a loss  of about $1,400 for each measurement point during a 6-month time period.  Further, the common royalty percentage in the leases at the measurement  points we examined\u2014which accounts for about 85 percent of  measurement points in the RIK gas program\u2014makes it easier to detect  this practice. At measurement points with a mix of different royalty  percentages\u2014about 15 percent of measurement points in the RIK gas  program\u2014there are no data available to MMS to detect this, which could  encourage such behavior and result in higher revenue losses for these  measurement points. See appendix II for our complete analysis.", "Daily imbalances may also be costing MMS because it does not track transactions called \u201ckeepwhole payments.\u201d MMS must make such  payments if RIK gas purchasers do not receive their minimum daily  volume of gas. This is because purchasers typically enter into advance contracts to resell RIK gas, and if they do not receive their expected  volumes they must buy that volume elsewhere in order to fulfill these  e triggering keepwhole payments,  contracts. Daily gas imbalances may b but MMS does not know the extent to which this occurs because it does  n ot adequately track these payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MMS Does Not Audit Operators\u2019 Records to Verify RIK Gas Production", "paragraphs": ["MMS also may be forgoing revenue because it does not audit operator d to ensure it has received its entitled royalty percentage. MMS has  procedures for reconciling imbalances and uses third-party production data to verify some of the data it receives from operators. However, it has  not assessed the risk of forgoing audits at those measurement points  where it does not have complete data with which to verify that it has bee allocated its entitled percentage of gas. Although the RIK guidance lett er  to operators states MMS\u2019s right to audit operator information related to RIK gas produced and delivered, MMS has not done so because it has  considered its verification of operator-generated data to be sufficient .  MMS has also claimed that it has saved money as a result of not auditing  and that this is a benefit of the RIK program. However, other royalty owners and members of the oil and gas industry regularly audit operator reported data. According to an industry representative, this entails  traveling to an operator\u2019s place of business to scrutinize gas production  documentation. According to an official from the Texas General Land  Office\u2014the agency responsible for administering Texas\u2019s RIK program\u2014 state audits often find that the office has not received the gas volu entitled to. Furthermore, the Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies  (COPAS), a professional organization of oil and gas accountants,  recommends that any royalty or working interest owner initiate an audit an operator\u2019s response is unsatisfactory or if a discrepancy is considered  significant.

This shortcoming  is apparent in three main areas.", "First, MMS policies do not adequately ensure that operators allocate  MMS\u2019s percentage of RIK gas. MMS\u2019s guidance letter to operators requests  that operators allocate to MMS the royalty percentage of gas on a daily  basis, but MMS believes it does not have the authority to enforce this  guidance. Further, RIK officials said MMS does not know what method  operators use to allocate gas. Indeed, our analysis shows that, contrary to its guidance letter to operators, on many days MMS is not receiving its  percentage of RIK gas. This could be happening because the operator\u2019s  allocation method ranks other leaseholders before MMS when allocatin g  gas and total production is less than expected. In this instance, MMS cou ld receive less than its royalty percentage of gas or no gas at all. According to COPAS, when the output of gas from multiple leases is combined and  measured at a single measurement point, it is imperative that all parties  agree on the method the operator will use to allocate the gas. We lea from industry representatives that gas companies rely extensively on such  agreements to ensure they receive the gas volumes they are owed and to  minimize the negative impact of imbalances on company revenues.", "Second, MMS does not have adequate policies and procedures to compe operators to report imbalances promptly and in a standard format.  Although the RIK gas guidance letter to operators requests that the  operator provide an imbalance statement to MMS within 60 days of the month of production, the guidance is not enforceable and MMS cannot impose a penalty for failing to submit imbalance statements within  time period. To allow MMS to take enforcement actions, regulations are  required. These regulations must (1) go through the public notice and  comment process, and thus be transparent to the public, oversight  agencies, and Congress; and (2) carry the full force of the law and hold  agency implementing the program and program participants accou to the terms specified in the regulations. RIK officials said MMS has  operated the RIK program without regulations because of the onerous  nature of establishing regulations and because industry had been  cooperative. More recently, RIK officials told us they have recognized that it is necessary to implement regulations for the RIK gas program in order for the agency to receive imbalance statements in a timely manner, among  other reasons, and have begun drafting these regulations. In contrast, the  provincial government of Alberta, Canada, has regulations in place that  state a company can be fined a portion of its royalty payment if it  submit required production data on time. Similarly, COPAS guidelin the oil and gas industry provide that operators should submit imbalance statements to appropriate parties within 45 days of the month of  production, unless other timing requirements have been agreed to.  Following this guideline, gas companies we spoke with said they have  es for  policies in place to compel timely reporting. For example, one industry  agreement we obtained states that if an operator fails to submit imbalance  statements for four consecutive months, the operator could be subject to  auditing.", "Our review of MMS\u2019s spreadsheet for tracking imbalance statements  shows that, from January 2007 through June 2008, at least 35 percent o expected imbalance statements were received late and about 10 p remain missing. As a result, MMS analysts spend a great deal of time  repeatedly calling companies to inquire about missing imbalance  statements. RIK officials agreed that this was not an efficient use of  resources.", "MMS also does not have a policy to require operators to submit imbalanc statements in a standardized or electronic format. Operators submit  imbalance statements by e-mail, but the statements commonly arrive in  different file formats\u2014even from a single operator. Additionally, some  operators report gas volumes in MMBtu, the measurement unit used by  MMS, while others use different units of measure, such as thousand  feet. In these cases, MMS analysts must manually convert reported g volumes to a uniform measurement unit\u2014increasing the chance of  calculation errors\u2014and must spend additional time combining the  information from different reports into one format, rather than focusing on  balance  reconciling imbalances. MMS could require operators to submit im e  statements in an MMS-approved standard format. In contrast to MMS, th government of Alberta requires companies to report gas volumes electronically in a standardized format and measurement unit, and these  reports must pass data checks. Alberta officials have stated that  standardized reporting has improved the efficiency of its RIK operations.", "The third area in which MMS does not have adequate policies and  procedures is in collecting payment for an imbalance from a compan when a cash-out settlement between MMS and the company has not  reached. When there is an extraordinary imbalance, MMS sends the  y  been  operator an initial cash-out memo explaining the amount that MMS  believes the company owes. The operator can either pay for the imbalance  or dispute it by submitting evidence that the imbalance value is incorrect.  To pay for the imbalance, the operator submits to MMS a royalty pa yment  form, which indicates the company\u2019s agreement with MMS\u2019s calculation of  the imbalance and classifies the imbalance as an open receivable,  triggering the debt collection process with the Department of the Treasu (Treasury). The royalty payment form is the only means of triggering collection, but the operator would not submit this form if it disputes an  imbalance. With no other bill or invoice to begin the debt collection  process for disputed imbalances, MMS\u2019s practice has been to allow the  exchange of supporting evidence with the operator regarding the size and  value of the imbalance to continue indefinitely. In one instance, MMS se nt  an operator a cash-out memo in December 2006 for an imbalance valued  at  nearly $900,000 and, as of February 2009, was still negotiating with the  operator. In such cases, because MMS has not sent a demand letter to a   RIK  company for payment, it has not referred a company to Treasury. officials stated that the agency has avoided debt collection for imbalances  because it is an onerous process and because it is waiting for the Office ofthe Solicitor to issue an opinion on the pricing and interest associated imbalances for leases that hav such debts are not collected within 7 years, the statute of limitations  renders them uncollectible.  e reached the end of their contract term.

For example, two  employees spend a portion of their time logging information from  operator-submitted imbalance statements onto spreadsheets after which  gas imbalance analysts manually upload imbalance statement data into  MMS\u2019s information system.

In its December 2007 report on mineral revenue  collection, MMS\u2019s Royalty Policy Committee recommended the  electronic submission of all offshore production records to improve  MMS\u2019s compliance and enforcement activities. According to RIK officials,  the committee\u2019s recommendation was not specifically directed at, and  therefore did not pertain to, the RIK program. Yet RIK program managers  also told us that they recognized as early as August 2007 that the system needed improvements. According to the RIK gas imbalance manager,  when MMS alerted the software manufacturer to these problems, there  was a disagreement as to whether the manufacturer or the support  services contractor were responsible. In July 2008, MMS contracted with  the software manufacturer for support services, but this system is still n meeting MMS\u2019s needs.", "At the time of our review, MMS had planned to enhance the system but  was also exploring the possibility of acquiring a new information  management system.
