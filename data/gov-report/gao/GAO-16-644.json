Specifically, each of the military services either over- or underestimated its actual fuel consumption spending when compared to budget estimates (see figure).", "Military Services' Reported Actual Versus Estimated Fuel Consumption Spending, Fiscal Years 2012 through 2015", "The Department of Defense (DOD) takes some steps to report fuel consumption data in annual budget requests, but it does not fully reconcile differences in the military services' reported actual fuel consumption data and does not include some fuel consumption data. For each budget request, DOD validates the military services' fuel consumption data by ensuring that the budget estimates align with DOD's funding priorities, among other steps. However, GAO's analysis found differences between the military services' reported fuel consumption spending and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) data on fuel sales to them. For example, DOD reported that the Navy's actual obligations for fuel consumption spending in fiscal year 2014 were about $2.7 billion less than what DLA's fuel sales data show was sold. DOD had not established an approach to reconcile such differences. Having an approach to reconcile differences would provide DOD with a means to determine if any actions are needed to better assess the accuracy of the military services' reported fuel consumption data. Further, GAO's analysis found that DOD's budget requests for fuel did not include details in two areas that could be used by Congress to evaluate funding requests for fuel. First, the budget requests excluded fuel volume data that were collected during the budget development process. Fuel volume data would provide another measure of fuel consumption to justify DOD's funding requests. Second, the requests did not separate actual fuel consumption spending for day-to-day activities, such as training, from war-related spending, which has varied considerably from budget estimates. Without additional data in these two areas, Congress does not have full visibility over the amount of fuel volume the military services require for their activities or trends in fuel consumption spending for non-war-related purposes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) develop an approach to reconcile the military services' and DLA fuel consumption data and (2) report more complete fuel consumption data to Congress.

GAO believes the recommendation remains valid to ensure that Congress has information to assess trends in fuel consumption, as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) generally, and the military services in  particular, are the largest consumers of fuel in the United States  Government. Specifically, in fiscal year 2015, the military services  reported fuel consumption spending of about $10.1 billion. For each fiscal  year, DOD\u2019s fuel customers, such as the military services, estimate the  amount of fuel they will consume, and DOD sets a standard price per  barrel that it will charge its fuel customers. However, our previous work  has shown that DOD has faced challenges in estimating its fuel costs. In  2014, we reported that during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOD\u2019s  actual costs for fuel differed considerably from its budget estimates. For  example, in 2009, DOD overestimated its bulk fuel costs by about $3  billion and underestimated its bulk fuel costs in 2012 by about $3.2 billion.  Although fluctuations in the market price for fuel were, on average, the  primary driver of the differences between DOD\u2019s actual and estimated  fuel costs, our analysis showed that changes in actual fuel consumption  during these same years accounted for, on average, 26 percent of the  difference. In November 2015, we reported on several weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s methodology for establishing the standard price for its fiscal year  2016 budget request. We made recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s  methodology for developing the standard price for fiscal year 2017 and for  future fiscal years. We discuss actions DOD has taken to address these  recommendations later in this report.", "Senate Report No. 114-49, which accompanied a proposed Senate bill  for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, included  a provision for us to review the military services\u2019 fuel consumption  estimates in DOD\u2019s annual budget requests. This report (1) describes the  military services\u2019 reported actual spending on fuel consumption compared  to their budget estimates since 2012 and factors that the services  reported to have contributed to any differences; (2) assesses the steps  DOD takes to report accurate and complete fuel consumption data in its  annual budget requests; and (3) evaluates the extent to which DOD\u2019s  approach for determining the fiscal year 2017 standard price it will charge  to fuel customers is consistent with federal budget guidance and leading  practices for a credible and well-documented cost estimate.", "To describe the military services\u2019 reported actual spending on fuel  consumption compared to their budget estimates since 2012 and factors  that were reported to have contributed to any differences, we analyzed  DOD\u2019s operation and maintenance (O&M) budget justification materials  for fiscal years 2012 through 2015. We compared data on actual  obligations reported in the military services\u2019 O&M budget justification  materials for fuel consumption against the military services\u2019 spending  estimates for fuel consumption for these same years. We focused our  analysis on fiscal years 2012 through 2015, because this period covered  the most recent complete year of actual fuel consumption and provided  three years of consumption data to analyze any trends. To determine the  reliability of the data, we obtained information on how the data were  collected, managed, and used through interviews with and questionnaires  to relevant officials and determined that the data presented in our findings  were sufficiently reliable to present trends in this report on the military  services\u2019 actual and estimated O&M spending for fuel consumption for  fiscal years 2012 through 2015. We interviewed an official from the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Comptroller who is  responsible for managing the bulk fuel program and officials with the  military services to better understand any factors that contributed to  differences between actual and estimated fuel consumption.", "To assess the steps DOD takes to report accurate and complete fuel  consumption data in annual O&M budget requests, we analyzed DOD\u2019s  O&M budget justification materials for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 as  well as military service and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) fuel data.  We interviewed an official from the OUSD Comptroller who is responsible  for managing the bulk fuel program, officials with military service budget  and financial management offices, and DLA to determine how O&M  budget justification materials generally, and fuel consumption estimates  specifically, are prepared, evaluated, and reported to Congress. We also  interviewed officials from DLA to determine how DLA reports its fuel sales  to the military services. To understand the differences, if any, between the  military services\u2019 fuel consumption data and DLA fuel sales, we analyzed  actual obligations for fuel consumption spending reported in the military  services\u2019 O&M budget materials for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 and  compared the data with DLA data on fuel sales to the military services for  these same years. To determine the reliability of both the O&M budget  justification data and DLA fuel sales data provided to us by DOD, we  obtained information on how the data were collected, managed, and used  through interviews with and questionnaires to relevant officials. We  assessed the information against federal internal controls and  accounting standards that describe practices regarding how information  should be recorded and communicated to management and others. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to present the military  services\u2019 total O&M obligations for fuel consumption spending for fiscal  years 2012 through 2015 and DLA fuel sales data to the military services  for these same years. However, as discussed later in this report, we  identified differences in the fuel consumption data reported by the military  services and DLA. To understand the differences between the military  services\u2019 O&M base request for fuel and actual fuel consumption for O&M  base programs and activities, we calculated O&M base spending,  because DOD does not report this information separately from O&M  Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending in its budget  justification materials. To do this, we compiled and summed O&M OCO  obligations for fuel consumption spending reported in the O&M OCO  budget materials for each military service for fiscal years 2012 through  2015 and subtracted this amount from total O&M obligations for fuel  consumption spending reported in the military services\u2019 budget exhibits,  which included the total of O&M base obligations and O&M OCO  obligations. We then compared this amount to fuel consumption  estimates included in the military services\u2019 O&M base budget requests for  each fiscal year.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD\u2019s approach for determining the fiscal  year 2017 standard price charged to fuel customers is consistent with  federal budget guidance and leading practices for a credible and well- documented cost estimate, we compared the methodology DOD selected  to establish the fiscal year 2017 standard price with the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) A-11 Circular, which governs federal  agencies\u2019 budget development and with GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide, which outlines a compilation of best practices,  including characteristics of a credible and well-documented cost estimate,  that federal cost-estimating organizations and industry use to develop and  maintain reliable cost estimates. We also interviewed an official from the  OUSD Comptroller who is responsible for managing the bulk fuel program  and reviewed documentation on DOD\u2019s analysis of various methodologies  it examined to develop the fiscal year 2017 standard price. We did not  evaluate the relative costs or benefits of the methodologies that DOD  considered\u2014such as the limitations or uncertainties that may be inherent  in selecting one methodology over another. Appendix I provides further  details on our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to September 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress provides the military services with O&M funds for certain  expenses, such as pay and benefits for most of DOD\u2019s civilians;  operations at military bases; training, education, and medical care for  individual service members; and fuel and spare parts for DOD equipment,  among other expenses. When developing annual O&M funding requests,  the military services report that estimates of their fuel consumption are  based on planned activity levels, which can vary by service. For example,  the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps estimate their fuel consumption  based on planned operational and training flying hours. According to  Navy and Marine Corps officials, the Navy estimates its fuel consumption  based on a planned number of steaming days for ship operations (i.e., the  number of days a ship is not in port), and the Marine Corps estimates its  fuel consumption for its ground units based on the number of days for  planned training exercises. The Army estimates its fuel consumption  based on historical fuel usage rates for vehicle miles during training  events and operational fuel requirements as determined by Army major  commands and Army operations and plans.", "In general, the military services follow a similar process for estimating fuel  consumption requirements, with some differences in the extent to which  they use actual fuel consumption data to estimate future fuel  consumption. For example, officials from both the Air Force and Navy  reported using historical averages to calculate fuel consumption  estimates for their flying hour program and ship operations. However, the  Air Force uses five years of data while the Navy uses three years of data  to estimate fuel consumption for ship operations and data from the  previous year to calculate fuel consumption estimates for its air  operations. Officials with two military services\u2014the Army and the Marine  Corps\u2014stated that they used other data points to approximate actual fuel  consumption in order to calculate a fuel consumption estimate. For  example, according to Army officials, the Army uses three to five years of  sample test data from ground vehicles and equipment, fuel efficiency  rates in technical manuals, and manufacturer\u2019s data for equipment to  approximate fuel efficiency for each type of equipment item. Taken  together, the Army uses these data points to approximate its actual fuel  consumption. According to Marine Corps officials, the Marine Corps  bases its fuel consumption requirements on the previous year\u2019s sales  data from DLA and adjusts its fuel consumption estimate to reflect  changes in operational and training requirements for the budget request  year.", "The military services and other fuel customers use O&M funding to  reimburse DOD for the costs of purchasing bulk fuel on the world market  to support their operations. The military services calculate their total O&M  funding needs for fuel in a given fiscal year by using their planned volume  of fuel consumption expressed in millions of barrels of fuel and the  standard price per barrel that DOD will charge its fuel customers for fuel.  The OUSD Comptroller, in coordination with DLA, estimates and sets a  standard price for its fuel and other fuel-related commodities for each  budget request. For its fiscal years 2016 and 2017 budget estimates,  DOD established the standard price based on two components: the  projected cost of refined fuel and operating costs, which cover various  overhead and transportation costs. According to DOD officials, in setting  the standard price, DOD endeavors to closely approximate the actual per  barrel price that will be paid during budget execution, which occurs almost  a year later. If the actual market price of fuel is higher than the price DOD  is charging its customers, DOD will have to pay more for fuel than it is  being reimbursed from its customers. If the actual price is lower than the  standard price, DOD will be reimbursed with more cash than it  anticipated.", "DOD and military service financial management officials prepare budget  justification materials for their O&M funding requests on an annual basis.  Beginning in fiscal year 2010, the military services have prepared  separate budget justification materials for O&M base and O&M OCO  funding requests. O&M base funding is used to pay for enduring day-to- day programs and activities\u2014including fuel for training activities. O&M  OCO funding is used to support activities associated with overseas  contingency operations. DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation  governs how the military services formulate these budget requests and  communicate them to Congress. Specifically, the Regulation directs  statutory and regulatory financial management requirements, systems,  and functions for all appropriated and non-appropriated, working capital,  revolving and trust fund activities. For fuel consumption estimates, the  military services prepare two principal budget exhibits:", "Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants Consumption and Costs budget exhibit  (the \u201cOP-26\u201d): Contains information on direct consumption by type of  petroleum product. The military services prepare and submit to the  OUSD Comptroller three separate exhibits for each budget  submission: (1) OP-26A for flying hours; (2) OP-26B for unit fuel  costs; and (3) OP-26C for sources of purchases for petroleum, oil,  and lubricants consumption. According to DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation, the OP-26 is not provided to Congress with  the budget justification materials accompanying the President\u2019s  annual budget request.", "Summary of Price and Program Changes budget exhibit (the \u201cOP- 32\u201d): Contains information by specific line items detailing, among  other items, Defense-wide Working Capital Fund supplies and  materials purchases related to fuel consumption, such as fuel  purchases from the DLA\u2019s Defense Fuel Supply Center and locally- purchased fuel. According to DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation, the OP-32 is provided to Congress with the budget  justification materials accompanying the President\u2019s annual budget  request.", "DLA, as the department-wide executive agent for bulk petroleum, is  tasked with executing supply chain management for all bulk fuel owned  by DOD. DLA utilizes the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund to  purchase bulk fuel for customers. DOD prepares Defense-wide Working  Capital Fund operating and capital budget materials. These budget  materials describe DLA\u2019s budget requests, provide justifications for any  changes in the budget request from previous years, and report changes  in the standard price of fuel across fiscal years. Generally, DOD\u2019s O&M  budget justification materials for fuel consumption present data for three  years, including actual total obligations for fuel consumption spending for  the previous fiscal year, estimated obligations for fuel consumption  spending for the current fiscal year, and estimated obligations for fuel  consumption spending for the budget request fiscal year.", "The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund covers DLA\u2019s costs for  purchasing bulk fuel and is reimbursed through its sale of fuel to the  military services and other customers at a standard price. The standard  price is intended to remain unchanged until the next budget year. This  helps to shield the military services from market price volatility by allowing  the cash balance in the fund to absorb minor fuel price fluctuations. For  example, from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the military services  purchased an average of approximately 102 million barrels per year from  DOD. Therefore, a standard price increase of even $1 per barrel would  result in a $102 million difference from the military services\u2019 budget  requests. According to DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation, working  capital funds were established to satisfy recurring DOD requirements  using a businesslike buyer-and-seller approach, and the goal for the  Defense-wide Working Capital Fund is to remain revenue neutral,  allowing the fund to break even over time\u2014that is, to neither make a gain  nor incur a loss.", "During the year the budget is executed, the actual price for a barrel of fuel  on the world market may be higher or lower than DOD\u2019s standard price. If  the actual price is higher, the cash balance in the Defense-wide Working  Capital Fund will go down. If the actual price is lower, the cash balance in  the fund will go up. To correct for these fluctuations, DOD may adjust the  standard price for the following year. For example, DOD may increase the  standard price to make up for losses in the previous year and bolster the  cash balance in the fund. Alternatively, DOD may decrease the standard  price to reimburse the military services, which had paid a higher price the  previous year. DOD can also cover fund losses during the execution year  by obtaining an appropriation from Congress, transferring funds from  another DOD account into the fund, or adjusting the standard price out of  cycle.", "Figure 1 illustrates the process and the main organizations involved in  budgeting for fuel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Services\u2019 Reported Actual Spending on Fuel Consumption Has Differed from Budget Estimates since Fiscal Year 2012, Which Officials Attributed Largely to Changes in Operations and Training", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal years 2012 through 2015, the military services reported a  decrease in total obligations for fuel consumption spending but reported  actual obligations differed from budget estimates during these years,  which officials attributed to changes in operations and training that  affected the level of fuel consumption.

According to these  officials, changes in operational missions were the main driver of the  difference between its actual and estimated fuel consumption spending  for that fiscal year.", "Air Force financial management officials identified changes in fighter and  tanker support during overseas missions as factors that contributed to  differences between its actual and estimated fuel consumption spending.", "One Navy budget official told us that delays in the delivery of ships and  equipment can lead to differences between actual and estimated fuel  consumption spending. For example, Navy budget officials cited the delay  in deployment of the Littoral Combat Ship in fiscal year 2015, noting that  they included fuel consumption spending estimates for these ships in  annual budget requests for that year, but the ships were not yet ready to  deploy, and thus the fuel consumption spending estimates were over  stated.", "Marine Corps budget officials told us that it is difficult to identify an  accurate budget estimate for fuel consumption spending up to 18 months  in advance of the year of budget execution, because factors like a change  in operational tempo or a sudden need to deploy or redeploy forces can  have a significant effect on actual fuel consumption spending.", "Officials told us that other factors can result in differences between actual  and estimated spending on fuel consumption, such as inclement weather  or maintenance issues. For example, Air Force and Navy officials stated  that inclement weather can affect fuel efficiency for air and ship  operations or result in delays or the cancellation of training activities.  Army officials stated, for instance, that entire training schedules have  been canceled as a result of inclement weather. Unforeseen maintenance  issues during the year of budget execution can also have an effect on fuel  consumption spending. For example, Army officials stated that funding  budgeted for fuel can be used for spare parts and other costs related to  operation and maintenance instead of fuel, which has contributed to  differences between actual and estimated spending on fuel consumption.", "Budgetary actions that affect O&M funding levels for fuel have also  affected actual consumption spending, according to service officials. In  fiscal year 2013, for example, officials reported that actual fuel  consumption spending was lower than estimated spending as a result of  actions DOD took to address sequestration. In our prior work, we  highlighted several actions identified by DOD officials that DOD and the  military services took to address these budgetary reductions. For  instance, all four of the military services cancelled or reduced participation  in training exercises in fiscal year 2013. Additionally, the Air Force stood  down 17 of 62 operational squadrons for 3 months during fiscal year 2013  and reduced flying hours for 10 other squadrons for a period of 1 to 3  months.", "Military service officials also described changes in the standard price that  DOD charges its fuel customers that can result in differences between  actual and estimated fuel consumption spending.  The military services  use the standard price as a key component when developing their O&M  budget requests. If DOD changes the standard price actually charged to  fuel customers during the year of budget execution, the military services\u2019  O&M budgets can be affected as a result. For instance, in 2014, we  reported that from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the differences  between the price DOD paid for fuel and the standard price it charged its  fuel customers accounted for, on average, 74 percent of the difference  between DOD\u2019s actual and estimated fuel costs. DOD officials told us  that they try to avoid changes to the standard price when possible to  avoid the negative effect on the military services\u2019 O&M budgets. We  found that for fiscal years 2012 through 2015, DOD generally kept the  standard price it charged fuel customers the same throughout the year or  decreased it. For example, DOD decreased the standard price three  times in fiscal year 2012 (from $165.90 to $97.02 per barrel) and left it  unchanged for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. In fiscal year 2015, DOD  decreased the standard price from $155.40 to $136.92 per barrel.

For example, according to DOD officials, DLA fuel sales for an individual  service may include sales to DOD\u2019s combatant commands, such as U.S.  Transportation Command. Officials explained that the large differences  between the Air Force\u2019s reported obligations for fuel consumption  spending and DLA\u2019s fuel sales to the Air Force could be attributable to the  inclusion of fuel sales to U.S. Transportation Command in DLA\u2019s data  sets if Air Force aircraft flew missions for the command. However, the  obligations for fuel consumption spending would not necessarily be  accounted for in the Air Force\u2019s data.", "Additionally, according to an official from the OUSD Comptroller, the Air  Force might purchase fuel from DLA in order to support an Army mission.  The Army would then be responsible for reimbursing the Air Force for this  fuel consumption.", "Another reason for these discrepancies, officials explained, is the result of  the military services\u2019 accounting practices for fuel consumption spending.  For example, when an Air Force aircraft is used to support a U.S.  Transportation Command or other DOD component mission, the fuel  purchased from DLA for that aircraft is initially charged to an Air Force  account. Officials stated that through a monthly review of accounting  records, the Air Force\u2019s fuel charges for that particular aircraft would  eventually be charged to the appropriate DOD component organization.  Yet, DLA would not be informed of the final consumer of the fuel, and  would thus record the sale of the fuel to the Air Force. DOD and military  service officials stated these reasons would not account for all  discrepancies between DLA\u2019s data and military services\u2019 actual  obligations for fuel consumption spending. However, despite these  significant differences in military service and DLA data, DOD officials  were unable to provide an analysis or other documentation that explained  the differences between the military services\u2019 actual obligations for fuel  consumption spending reported in annual budget requests and DLA fuel  sales data.", "DOD has not established an approach to reconcile data on fuel  consumption reported by the military services and DLA fuel sales to the  military services, although DLA\u2019s Strategic Plan for 2015-2022  emphasizes DLA\u2019s commitment to collaborating with the military services  to increase transparency. The plan highlights the need to have an  ongoing, open dialogue with the military services about DLA\u2019s costs. On  an annual basis, DLA coordinates with the military services to define  estimated fuel requirements, which DLA uses to purchase fuel worldwide  for eventual sale to the military services. DOD officials told us that  during the annual budget development process, the OUSD Comptroller  uses DLA\u2019s fuel sales data to validate the military services O&M fuel  consumption estimates; however, neither OUSD Comptroller, DLA, nor  the military services act to reconcile any differences between data on  DLA\u2019s fuel sales and the military services\u2019 actual obligations for fuel  consumption spending. These officials noted that the directive  establishing DLA as the department\u2019s executive agent for bulk fuel does  not require DLA to record or report fuel sales data to the military services  or other fuel customers or reconcile any differences with the military  services\u2019 data, and there is no department-wide policy that requires  consistency between DLA fuel sales data and military service actual  obligations for fuel consumption spending.

Specifically, the department held a series of initial working group  meetings in April and May 2016 to discuss the military services\u2019 fuel  consumption O&M budget exhibits and DLA\u2019s process for reporting its  fuel sales, including how DLA fuel sales are recorded and reported and  how DLA\u2019s data relate to the information the military services report in  their O&M budget justification materials. For example, in May 2016, the  OUSD Comptroller, DLA, and the military services discussed possible  adjustments to DOD\u2019s accounting practices for fuel consumption  spending to more accurately record DLA fuel sales to fuel customers.  However, while DOD held an initial set of working groups at the time of  our review, it did not have specific plans or milestones to address the  limitations and inconsistencies between the military services\u2019 and DLA\u2019s  data, although an OUSD Comptroller official agreed that a more formal  process to reconcile differences would help validate the military services\u2019  annual O&M budget estimates for planned fuel consumption spending.  Given the significant differences between the military services\u2019 and DLA\u2019s  fuel data, having an approach to reconcile differences would provide DOD  with a means to understand any discrepancies in its fuel consumption  data and better assess the accuracy of the military services\u2019 actual fuel  consumption spending that is reported in annual budget requests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Annual Budget Requests Provided to Congress Do Not Include Certain Fuel Consumption Data", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s annual O&M budget requests and the accompanying budget  justification materials provide Congress with certain information on the  military services\u2019 actual and estimated fuel consumption spending that  can help it make appropriations decisions, conduct oversight, and provide  control over funds.

Specifically,  DOD\u2019s budget requests did not (1) provide fuel volume data and (2)  separate the military services\u2019 actual O&M base obligations for fuel  consumption spending for day-to-day activities from its actual O&M OCO  obligations for war-related fuel consumption spending. The military  services do provide the OUSD Comptroller with actual and estimated fuel  volume data in the OP-26 budget exhibits during the budget development  process. These budget exhibits describe the volume of fuel (i.e., millions  of barrels of fuel) that the military services estimate they will use for a  total of their base and OCO needs when developing annual budget  estimates. However, although DOD collects and evaluates fuel volume  data from the military services, it does not include the OP-26 budget  exhibits in the O&M budget justification materials it provides annually to  Congress. According to an OUSD Comptroller official who oversees the  bulk fuel program, DOD\u2019s historical practice has been to use the fuel  volume requirements data included on the OP-26 during the budget  development process. Although the DOD Financial Management  Regulation states that the OP-26 will not be included with the military  services\u2019 budget justification materials submitted to Congress, it does not  specifically preclude DOD from providing fuel volume information. The  official could not explain the reasoning behind the Financial Management  Regulation direction to exclude the OP-26 from DOD\u2019s budget request.  Because the military services\u2019 O&M funding estimates for fuel can be  affected by market price fluctuations from one year to the next, fuel  volume data would provide another measure of estimated or actual fuel  consumption to justify DOD\u2019s funding requests for fuel.", "Additionally, the military services\u2019 O&M budget materials submitted to  Congress do not report actual O&M base obligations for fuel consumption  spending separately from actual O&M OCO obligations for the prior fiscal  year. For example, as noted above, the OP-32 budget exhibits  accompanying the military services\u2019 O&M budget requests provide data  on (1) actual obligations for the total of O&M base and O&M OCO fuel  consumption spending combined and (2) O&M OCO-only spending.  According to the OUSD Comptroller official who oversees the bulk fuel  program, DOD and the military services collect and track O&M base  obligations and O&M OCO obligations for fuel consumption spending  separately, but DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation does not  require O&M base obligations to be reported separately from O&M OCO  obligations in its budget justification materials and does not specifically  preclude DOD from doing so. This official also stated that Congress has  not asked the department to report O&M base obligations for fuel  consumption spending separately from its O&M OCO obligations.", "Table 1 shows the extent to which DOD\u2019s various O&M budget  documents contain fuel consumption information and are reported to  Congress.", "Additional data on the military services\u2019 actual fuel consumption could  assist Congress in determining funding levels that are needed for their  activities, including full-spectrum training. In the absence of such data,  congressional decision makers may not have the data they need to  assess any trends in actual O&M base obligation for non-war-related  purposes when evaluating the military services\u2019 budget requests for fuel.  For example, although DOD does not report actual O&M base obligations  for fuel consumption spending separately from actual O&M OCO  obligations for prior fiscal years, we conducted an analysis to separate  the military services\u2019 actual O&M base and actual O&M OCO obligations  for fuel consumption spending. In conducting this analysis, we calculated  O&M base obligations, because DOD does not report this information in  its budget justification materials, as noted above. To do this, we first  compiled and summed data on actual O&M OCO obligations for fuel  consumption spending reported in the OP-32 budget exhibits  accompanying the military services\u2019 O&M OCO requests for fiscal years  2012 through 2015. We then subtracted this amount from the total O&M  obligations for fuel consumption spending for these same years that are  reported in the OP-32 budget exhibits accompanying the military services\u2019  O&M base budget requests which, as we also noted above, included  actual obligations for fuel consumption spending in the prior fiscal year for  the total of both O&M base and O&M OCO obligations combined. We  then compared this amount to the estimates for fuel consumption  spending included in the military services\u2019 O&M base budget request for  each fiscal year.", "Our analysis found that the military services generally overestimated the  amount of actual O&M base fuel consumption spending for fiscal years  2012 through 2015, with one exception, as figure 5 shows. For example,  the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps each overestimated O&M base fuel  consumption spending each year during this time period. The amount and  percent difference of the overestimate for these services, comparing our  estimate of actual O&M base obligations for fuel consumption spending  with the original estimates, varied each year from a high of about $2.5  billion for the Navy in fiscal year 2014, or about a 280 percent difference  from its original estimate, to a low of about $17 million for the Marine  Corps in fiscal year 2013, or about a 17 percent difference from its  original estimate. Our analysis also showed that the Air Force over- estimated its O&M base fuel consumption in three out of the four years  during this time frame. For example, the Air Force underestimated O&M  base fuel consumption spending by about $477 million in fiscal year 2012,  or about a 13 percent difference from its original estimate. In fiscal year  2015, however, the Air Force overestimated its O&M base fuel  consumption spending by about $895 million, or about a 24 percent  difference from its original estimate.", "Navy officials noted that congressional budget actions can affect the  amount of O&M base fuel consumption spending in a particular fiscal  year. Navy officials stated that, in fiscal year 2014, Congress realigned  funds from base funding to OCO funding, which resulted in a difference of  $800 million from the Navy\u2019s original O&M base budget request for fuel.  This realignment then affected the base activities the Navy was able to  execute for that fiscal year. A Navy official noted that this realignment was  one explanation for the differences between actual and estimated fuel  consumption spending in the Navy\u2019s O&M base spending for fuel.", "DOD also produces additional sources of information that contain data  that could be used by decision makers to measure the military services\u2019  fuel consumption, but these sources lack details in these same areas and  are not provided to Congress. For example, DLA publishes annually a  fact book in which, among other activities, it reports the total dollar  amount of fuel it recorded having sold to the military services for that  fiscal year, but the fact book does not report the fuel volume associated  with these sales. Further, according to a DLA official, DLA does not  submit the fact book to Congress with its annual budget request. As our  analysis shows, there is no single document or set of documents that  provides Congress with information on actual and estimated fuel volume  and fuel consumption spending that it could use to evaluate the military  services\u2019 budget requests for fuel. Unless DOD reports more complete  information on its actual and estimated fuel consumption, Congress will  not have full visibility over the amount of fuel volume the military services  require on an annual basis for their activities, or trends in the military  services\u2019 spending for non-war-related fuel consumption, which has  varied considerably from budget estimates."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Approach for Determining the Fiscal Year 2017 Standard Price Methodology Is Consistent with Federal Budget Guidance and Leading Practices for a Credible Cost Estimate, but DOD Has Not Fully Documented Its Rationale for Estimating the Price", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s approach for determining the fiscal year 2017 standard price of  fuel is consistent with federal budget guidance and leading practices for a  credible cost estimate, but DOD has not fully documented its rationale for  estimating the standard price.

However, we found that the new methodology did not  reflect actual market conditions or fully account for risks to the reliability of  DOD\u2019s fuel cost estimates. More specifically, we found that DOD had not  used valid and reliable data on market conditions when evaluating options  for adjusting its fuel pricing methodology because it used OMB's Gas and  Oil price index as a dollar value rather than applying it in its analyses as a  percentage to measure the change in prices from one year to the next.  Our analysis showed that applying the Gas and Oil price index as a  measure of a change in fuel prices from one year to the next produced  results that differed from what DOD found. For example, DOD applied the  Gas and Oil price index for fiscal year 2016 as a dollar price of $122.56  per barrel of refined fuel. In contrast, we calculated a refined fuel price  estimate between $58.10 and $83.58, depending on how the Gas and Oil  price index is applied to actual fuel prices.", "Furthermore, we found that DOD's analysis of the methodology based on  the use of the price index did not review and understand the limitations  and risks to the reliability of its fuel estimate which, in this case, resulted  from determining a projected fuel price that applied the price index to  actual fuel prices that would be almost 2 years old at the time of DOD\u2019s  budget request. According to its budget materials, DOD had a fiscal year  2016 estimate of planned fuel consumption totaling 81 million barrels of  fuel, which, according to our analysis, led DOD to request in its fiscal year  2016 budget request $9.9 billion for refined fuel based on the refined fuel  portion of the standard price of $122.56 per barrel of refined fuel. In  contrast, our analysis found that the difference between the estimates for  refined fuel when applying the Gas and Oil price index as a reflection of  the change in prices from fiscal year 2014 would have resulted in a  budget request based on the refined fuel portion of the standard price of  between about $8.6 billion and about $8.9 billion, depending on how the  price index was applied to fiscal year 2014 actual refined fuel prices.", "As a result, we recommended that, in addition to fully implementing our  prior recommendations, DOD use valid and reliable data on market  conditions and review and understand the risks and limitations of using  data, such as actual fuel price data from 2 years prior when it developed  its standard price for fiscal year 2017 and future fiscal years.

As we noted in our report,  the budget exhibits include actual obligations for fuel consumption  spending for the total of both O&M base and O&M OCO obligations  combined. We then compared this amount to the estimates for fuel  consumption spending included in the military services\u2019 O&M base budget  request.", "DOD also stated that it is already required to report total obligations to  Congress by appropriation. However, neither the OMB circular that  governs federal agencies\u2019 preparation, submission, and execution of their  budgets nor relevant sections of the U.S. Code preclude the department  from providing additional detail on O&M base obligations. As we discuss  in our report, the military services generally over-estimated the amount of  actual O&M base fuel consumption spending for the period we reviewed;  therefore, without additional data that distinguishes between O&M base  and O&M OCO spending, Congress does not have the information to  assess trends in the military services\u2019 spending for non-war-related fuel  consumption, which has varied considerably from budget estimates.  Moreover, as we also noted in our report, DOD produces data in various  sources that could be used by decision makers to measure the military  services\u2019 fuel consumption. DOD could report additional information on  actual O&M base obligations for fuel consumption spending as well as  actual and estimated fuel volume as we recommended as part of DOD\u2019s  annual O&M budget justification materials, or through other reporting  mechanisms that the department determined would assist Congress in its  decision making. Without more complete information, Congress does not  have full visibility over the amount of fuel volume the military services  require on an annual basis for their activities.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), the Secretaries of Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps.

We focused our analysis on fiscal  years 2012 through 2015 because this period covered the most recent  complete year of DOD fuel sales and provided three years of cost data to  analyze any trends. We identified the specific accounting lines in each  O&M budget exhibit related to fuel for both O&M base and O&M  Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fuel consumption. We then  compared the military services\u2019 reported actual obligations for fuel  consumption spending that are contained in these accounting lines  against the military services\u2019 budget estimates. To determine the reliability  of the data, we obtained information on how the data were collected,  managed, and used through interviews with and questionnaires to  relevant officials and determined that the data presented in our findings  were sufficiently reliable to present trends in this report on the military  services\u2019 actual and estimated O&M spending for fuel consumption for  fiscal years 2012 through 2015. We interviewed an official from the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) Comptroller, who is  responsible for managing the bulk fuel program, and budget and financial  management officials with the military services to better understand any  factors that contributed to differences between actual and estimated fuel  consumption.", "To assess the steps DOD takes to report accurate and complete fuel  consumption data in annual budget requests, we analyzed DOD\u2019s budget  justification materials for fiscal years 2012 through 2015, as well as  military service and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) fuel data. We  interviewed an official from the OUSD Comptroller who is responsible for  managing the bulk fuel program, officials with military service budget and  financial management offices, and DLA to determine how O&M budget  justification materials generally, and fuel consumption estimates  specifically, are prepared, evaluated, and reported to Congress. We  interviewed officials from each military service to determine how budget  justification materials are prepared for their annual O&M budget requests.  We interviewed officials from DLA to determine how it reports its fuel  sales to the military services. To understand the differences between the  military services\u2019 fuel consumption data and DLA fuel sales, we analyzed  the military services\u2019 actual obligations for fuel consumption spending  reported in their O&M budget materials for fiscal years 2012 through 2015  against DLA data on fuel sales to the military services for these same  years. To determine the reliability of both the O&M budget justification  data and DLA fuel sales data provided to us by DOD, we obtained  information on how the data were collected, managed, and used through  interviews with and questionnaires to relevant officials. We assessed the  information against federal internal controls and accounting standards  that describe practices regarding how information should be recorded and  communicated to management and others. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to present the military services\u2019 total O&M  obligations for fuel consumption spending for fiscal years 2012 through  2015 and DLA fuel sales data to the military services for these same  years. However, as discussed in this report, we identified differences in  the fuel consumption data reported by the military services and DLA. To  understand the differences between the military services\u2019 O&M base  request for fuel and actual fuel consumption for O&M base programs and  activities, we calculated O&M base spending, because DOD does not  report this information separately from O&M OCO spending in its budget  justification materials. To do this, we compiled and summed the O&M  OCO obligations for fuel consumption spending that were reported in the  O&M OCO budget materials for each military service for fiscal years 2012  through 2015 and subtracted this amount from total O&M obligations for  fuel consumption spending reported in the military services\u2019 O&M base  budget exhibits (which included the total of O&M base obligations and  O&M OCO obligations). We then compared this amount to fuel  consumption estimates included in the military services\u2019 O&M base  budget requests for each fiscal year. We assessed this information  against the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  and Handbook of Federal Accounting Standards on how information  should be recorded and communicated to management and others.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s approach for determining the  fiscal year 2017 price charged to fuel customers is consistent with federal  budget guidance and leading practices for a credible and well- documented cost estimate, we reviewed documentation on DOD\u2019s  analysis of various methodologies it examined, as well as its justification  for the one it ultimately chose to apply for fiscal year 2017. We did not  evaluate the relative costs or benefits of the methodologies that DOD  considered\u2014such as the limitations or uncertainties that may be inherent  in selecting one methodology over another. Specifically, we determined  how DOD evaluated methodologies for setting the standard fuel price for  fiscal year 2017. To better understand the steps DOD took, we  determined how it applied OMB\u2019s Gas and Oil price index when  evaluating methodologies for setting the standard fuel price, compared to  what it did in prior years. We also interviewed an official from the OUSD  Comptroller, who is responsible for managing the bulk fuel program,  about DOD\u2019s methodology for developing its standard price in fiscal year  2017 and its plans for determining the methodology in the future. We  compared DOD\u2019s methodology for establishing the fiscal year 2017  standard price for budgeting purposes with OMB\u2019s Circular A-11, which  governs federal agencies\u2019 budget development, and with our Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, which is a compilation of best  practices, including the characteristics of a credible and well-documented  cost estimate, which federal cost-estimating organizations and industry  use to develop and maintain reliable cost estimates.", "We interviewed official, and, where appropriate, obtained documentation,  from the following organizations:", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)", "Defense Logistics Agency \u2013 Energy", "Defense Logistics Agency \u2013 Finance", "Air Force Petroleum Agency", "Naval Supply Systems Command", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Financial Management  We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to September 2016,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
