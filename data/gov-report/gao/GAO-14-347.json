In 2008, the Fostering  Connections Act was enacted, which amended title IV-E. According to  two co-sponsors of the legislation, it was intended to address  shortcomings in the existing foster care system that disconnected foster  children from family and school, leaving them ill-prepared to transition out  of care at age 18. These shortcomings are rooted in longstanding  challenges, such as finding appropriate foster homes; coordinating  between child welfare agencies, schools, and other service providers; and  ensuring housing for foster youth transitioning to independence.

As a result, more children may be eligible for federal adoption assistance  payments and states may no longer bear the entire cost of adoption  assistance payments on behalf of eligible children with special needs  removed from families that did not meet the previous income  requirements. The Fostering Connections Act also required states to  spend any savings in state expenditures resulting from the changes to the  adoption assistance eligibility criteria on child welfare services that may  be provided under title IV-E or IV-B (referred to in this report as  \u201creinvesting savings\u201d).

Nearly every state reported in our  survey that they found HHS\u2019s Program Instructions and Information  Memoranda (47), as well as regional office assistance (42), useful. One  state official told us that the ongoing assistance via teleconferences and  site visits from their regional HHS officials has been extremely helpful. In  addition, a majority of states (40) reported that they found publications,  such as practice briefs, toolkits, and other articles, useful. See figure 4 for  state views on the usefulness of HHS technical assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Not Yet Systematically Monitored State Implementation of the Fostering Connections Act", "paragraphs": ["To date, HHS\u2019s main oversight of state implementation of the Fostering  Connections Act has consisted of reviewing states\u2019 title IV-E plans to  ensure they comply with federal requirements; however, the agency has  not yet systematically reviewed actual state implementation of the act. To  review title IV-E plans, HHS staff in regional offices assess state laws,  regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with federal child  welfare requirements, including those established by the Fostering  Connections Act. A state\u2019s title IV-E plan must be amended or updated as  necessary to comply with any new federal requirements, such as changes  to the law. According to HHS, fifty states (including the District of  Columbia) currently have approved title IV-E plans reflecting all  mandatory provisions of the Fostering Connections Act (and other title IV- E requirements). According to officials in HHS regional offices that we  interviewed, HHS\u2019s other oversight activities include reviewing quarterly  expenditure data and ongoing discussions with state child welfare officials  through conference calls, site visits, technical assistance, and joint  planning with state officials around their plans for delivering and  improving child welfare services. Additionally, HHS officials in one  regional office told us that they may follow up on specific issues brought  to their attention by advocates. While these oversight activities allow HHS  to have some knowledge about state implementation of the Fostering  Connections Act, at the time of our interviews, officials at all four HHS  regional offices we spoke to told us that since the Fostering Connections  Act was enacted, they have not comprehensively evaluated compliance  with title IV-E plans within states after they have been approved.", "HHS\u2019s last 5-year round of the CFSR process to comprehensively monitor  state child welfare programs began in 2007, before the enactment of the  Fostering Connections Act. HHS regulations provide that states must  undergo a complete review of child welfare programs\u2014including title IV- E\u2014every 5 years, and HHS implements this requirement using the CFSR  process. In March 2014, HHS announced plans to conduct the next round  of CFSRs beginning in fiscal year 2015. This announcement addresses  process changes, such as not requiring stakeholder interviews if HHS  determines that data provided by the state sufficiently demonstrate state  compliance in a particular area. While the assessment instrument used by  HHS for previous CFSRs may be broad enough to capture some of the  new provisions of the Fostering Connections Act, such as placement with  siblings or school stability, HHS has not completed the assessment  instrument for the forthcoming round, so it is not clear what indicators  would be used to assess compliance with these provisions. Additionally,  the previous CFSR instrument does not address other provisions that  involve specific deadlines, such as the requirement that child welfare  agencies identify and notify relatives within 30 days after a child\u2019s removal  from his home or that youth develop a transition plan 90 days prior to  aging out of foster care. HHS officials told us that they are currently  revising this instrument in preparation for the next round of CFSRs and  expected it to be finalized in the summer of 2014.", "HHS officials told us that the next round of the CFSRs, which should have  started in 2012, was delayed because the agency was considering how to  best address comments they solicited in 2011 on improving the CFSR  process and what changes, if any, they would need to make to the  regulations to monitor implementation of the Fostering Connections Act.  In the meantime, officials in one regional office told us that with this delay  in the CFSR process, there is no other mechanism in place for HHS to  systematically examine actual state practices. Our previous work found  that regional HHS staff considered the CFSR an important complement to  a state\u2019s planning documents\u2014it enables HHS staff to determine both  whether states are providing the services they report in their planning  documents and whether those services are adequate and appropriate to  meet the needs of the state\u2019s children and families. Officials in all four  regional offices we spoke with told us that a systematic monitoring effort,  like the CFSR, could help states improve their programs. An official in one  regional office added that states can also gain the support needed to  make improvements by showing results from systematic monitoring  reviews.", "HHS also lacks adequate data to assess if states are complying with the  policies they outlined in their title IV-E plans or the effectiveness of states\u2019  actions. Internal control standards state that management should obtain  data on a timely basis for effective monitoring. Effective control  structures depend on data analysis to determine whether agencies are  effectively using resources and whether the agency is in compliance with  applicable laws and regulations. However, HHS has not yet updated  information collection requirements for case level data it collects from  states on children in foster care through the Adoption and Foster Care  Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). These data do not reflect the  new provisions added by the Fostering Connections Act, such as those  on sibling placement and school stability. HHS officials told us that they  are beginning the process of revising AFCARS completely and plan to  publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the spring of 2014. AFCARS  data are used to inform oversight activities conducted by HHS, including  the CFSR process. These data will not be revised in time for the  upcoming fiscal year 2015 CFSR process, which relies heavily on  AFCARS for the development of statewide performance indicators.  Meanwhile, officials in two states we visited told us that they were in the  process of updating their state data systems and it would be helpful for  them to know what kind of data HHS would like them to collect before  making a costly and time-intensive investment in overhauling their  system. Additionally, while some states may voluntarily collect information  about the outcomes of their programs, many do not. This lack of data  further hinders HHS\u2019s ability to evaluate implementation of the Fostering  Connections Act.", "We found examples of potential uneven implementation of state policies  in the four states we visited. For example, regarding the Fostering  Connections Act school stability provisions, officials in one state we  visited reported that while the state policy requires child welfare agencies  and schools to jointly determine whether changing schools would be in a  child\u2019s best interest, local agencies likely varied in the extent to which  they collaborated and some may not be doing so at all. A local school  official in another state observed that whether or not these best interest  determinations happen may depend on individual caseworkers.  Additionally, practices varied within the states we visited pertaining to the  requirement that caseworkers support youth in developing a transition  plan in the 90 days before they age out of care. All four of the states we  visited had updated their policies to reflect the new requirement, but local  officials in one office indicated that they did not always complete plans for  all youth before they age out of care. Caseworkers in another state told  us that while they aim to engage youth in the 90-day transition plan, the  meeting held to fulfill the requirement may not include the youth in many  cases.", "The experiences of the 29 current and former foster youth we met with  also indicate that family connections, school stability, and transitions for   For example, while  older youth may still be a concern for some youth. nine of the youth we met with reported being placed together with their  siblings or were in frequent contact, five youth said they had no contact  with their siblings or had only sporadic contact.that being able to see her sister was treated as a privilege rather than a  right, and that the privilege was taken away, for example, when she did  not perform well in school. In terms of school stability, nearly all of the  youth we met with experienced multiple school changes and one youth  reported missing a month of school upon entering foster care while  waiting for records to be transferred to a new school. The youth we met   One young woman said  with also had mixed experiences with transition planning. Ten of the youth  felt they had benefitted from their transition plans and group decision- making meetings, but eight said they did not recall having a transition  plan or being actively involved in developing it. A systematic monitoring  effort by HHS could help identify and address some of these problems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Fostering Connections Act made changes to address shortcomings  in the foster care system, and states have reported implementing  numerous practices aimed at achieving improved outcomes for children  and their families. More than 5 years after its enactment, however, HHS  has not yet monitored states\u2019 implementation of the act in a systematic  way. States reported facing major challenges with meeting requirements  for sibling placement, educational stability, and several other provisions in  the act. These challenges\u2014some of them longstanding barriers\u2014are  complex, and failure to overcome them could hamper progress toward  meeting the goals of the Fostering Connections Act. HHS has an  important role in helping assess what states have done and what else is  needed to improve outcomes for children in foster care. While HHS has  plans under way to begin monitoring through a new round of CFSRs in  fiscal year 2015, HHS has not specified how it will address changes made  by the Fostering Connections Act. Without monitoring state  implementation of these new provisions, it will be difficult for HHS to have  sufficient information to determine how these approaches are working  and whether changes to state or federal policies or federal guidance and  assistance are needed to improve outcomes for children in foster care. At  the same time, HHS has not yet updated data reporting requirements to  reflect the new provisions of the Fostering Connections Act. These data  are a fundamental element of the CFSR process, yet they will not be  relevant to the changes made by the Fostering Connections Act for the  next round of reviews. Without these data, it will be difficult for HHS to  have adequate information to evaluate implementation and assess states\u2019  progress towards meeting the needs of children in and transitioning out of  foster care. Additionally, for states that have already begun revamping  their own state data systems, incorporating federal requirements at a later  date can lead to additional delay or expense. Lastly, only 21 states  reported calculating their savings from the federal adoption assistance  income eligibility changes for fiscal year 2012, despite the Fostering  Connections Act requirement that states spend these savings on their  child welfare programs. Although states we surveyed reported challenges  performing these calculations, HHS has not issued guidance to states on  how to perform them. The amount states save could grow more  significant as the expanded eligibility criteria are phased in to include all  youth by fiscal year 2018. The state funds freed up as a result of more  children becoming eligible for federal funding could help states address  the persistent challenges they face serving children in foster care. In the  absence of further guidance, states may continue to struggle with  calculating savings and miss an opportunity to take advantage of  increased federal funds to add to limited state resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure implementation of the Fostering Connections Act and improve  outcomes for children in foster care, we recommend the Secretary of  Health and Human Services take the following three actions.", "To maximize the amount of funds states are reinvesting into child welfare  services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services should provide  guidance on how states could calculate savings from the changes to the  federal adoption assistance income eligibility criteria.", "To help identify areas where states may need additional support or  guidance in their efforts to provide children in foster care with services  and assistance under title IV-E, as amended by the Fostering  Connections Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services should  proceed with and expeditiously finalize plans to:  systematically monitor state practices for compliance with policies  outlined in their title IV-E plans that cover the new provisions  established by the Fostering Connections Act, and update AFCARS to collect relevant data from states about provisions  established by the Fostering Connections Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and the Department of  Education for review and comment.

HHS further stated that the department\u2019s implementation of  this provision to date has been driven by a desire to avoid imposing an  undue administrative burden on states and the challenge of specifying a  methodology for calculating savings that would work in all state settings.  HHS said that state officials have signed assurances as part of their title  IV-E plan submissions to calculate and reinvest these savings. HHS also  stated that independent auditors are responsible for identifying an  appropriate finding in single audit reports for any states that have not  taken steps to calculate and account for these savings. HHS said it will  work to assure that all needed corrective actions are taken to resolve any  such finding in a state\u2019s single audit.", "In response to our recommendation to expeditiously finalize plans to  systematically monitor state practices for compliance with policies  outlined in their title IV-E plans that cover the new provisions established  by the Fostering Connections Act, HHS stated that the CFSR process is  designed to provide federal oversight of states\u2019 compliance with  provisions of titles IV-B and IV-E, and the amendments made by the  Fostering Connections Act to titles IV-B and IV-E will be reflected in the  revised CFSR protocol. HHS said it is in the process of finalizing the  instruments and measures that will be used during the round of reviews  expected to begin in fiscal year 2015 and they will be shared with the  public when finalized. We continue to encourage HHS to ensure that the  new provisions introduced by the Fostering Connections Act are  incorporated into these instruments and measures and that the  department moves quickly to complete the instruments and begin the  third round of CFSR reviews.", "In response to our recommendation that HHS expeditiously finalize plans  to update AFCARS to collect relevant data from states about provisions  established by the Fostering Connections Act, HHS stated that ACF has  announced its intent to begin the regulatory process to make changes to  AFCARS by issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, projected to be  published in the spring of 2014. HHS did not discuss how these changes  would incorporate the provisions in the Fostering Connections Act nor  provide an estimate as to when these changes will be completed. We  encourage HHS to make every effort to expedite these changes within the  rulemaking process. As it is, the next round of CFSRs will proceed  without the benefit of updated data from AFCARS relevant to the  amendments made by the Fostering Connections Act.
