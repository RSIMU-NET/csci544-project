HHS computer networks and systems have numerous electronic access control vulnerabilities related to network management, user accounts and passwords, user rights and file permissions, and auditing and monitoring of security-related events. In addition, weaknesses exist in other types of controls designed to physically secure computer resources, conduct suitable background investigations, segregate duties appropriately, and prevent unauthorized changes to application software. All of these weaknesses increase the risk that unauthorized individuals can gain access to HHS information systems and inadvertently or deliberately disclose, modify, or destroy the sensitive data that the department relies on to deliver its vital services. A key reason for these control weaknesses is that the department has not yet fully implemented a departmentwide information security program. While HHS has laid the foundation for such a program by developing and documenting policies and procedures, the department has not yet fully implemented key elements of its information security program at all of its operating divisions. Specifically, HHS and its operating divisions have not fully implemented elements related to (1) risk assessments, (2) policies and procedures, (3) security plans, (4) security awareness and training, (5) tests and evaluations of control effectiveness, (6) remedial actions, (7) incident handling, and (8) continuity of operations plans. Until HHS fully implements a comprehensive information security program, security controls may remain inadequate; responsibilities may be unclear, misunderstood, and improperly implemented; and controls may be inconsistently applied.

In partnership with the states,  CMS also administers Medicaid, a means-tested health care program for  low-income Americans. Medicaid is the primary source of health care for a  large population of medically vulnerable Americans, including poor  families, the disabled, and persons with developmental disabilities  requiring long-term care. In coordination with the Medicaid program, the  State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program provides health care coverage  for children. CMS employs about 4,900 employees and has a fiscal year  2005 budget of approximately $480 billion or 83 percent of the HHS budget,  as shown in figure 1.", "HHS relies extensively on computerized systems to support its mission  critical operations and store the sensitive information it collects. It uses  these systems to support the department\u2019s financial and management  functions, maintain sensitive employee personnel information, and process  financial and medical data for millions of health care recipients. Its local  and wide area networks interconnect these systems. In addition, HHS relies  on contractor-owned systems to process departmental information and  support its mission. For fiscal year 2005, HHS planned to spend nearly $5  billion on information technology\u2014more than any other federal agency  except the Department of Defense. A significant amount of these funds will  be spent to facilitate the processing and payment of Medicare claims  processed by CMS or its Medicare contractors.", "Information system controls are a critical consideration for any  organization that depends on computerized systems and networks to carry  out its mission or business.

Because sensitive programs and information are stored on or  transmitted along networks, effectively securing networks is essential to  protecting computing resources and data from unauthorized access,  manipulation, and use. Organizations secure their networks, in part, by  installing and configuring network devices that permit authorized network  service requests, deny unauthorized requests, and limit the services that are  available on the network. Devices used to secure networks include  (1) firewalls that prevent unauthorized access to the network, (2) routers  that filter and forward data along the network, (3) switches that forward  information among segments of a network, and (4) servers that host  applications and data. Network services consist of protocols for  transmitting data between network devices.", "Insecurely configured network services and devices, including those  without current software patches, can make a system vulnerable to internal  or external threats, such as denial-of-service attacks. Because networks  often include both external and internal access points for electronic  information assets, failure to adequately secure these access points  increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure and modification of sensitive  information or disruption of service. HHS policy requires that all incoming  and outgoing connections from departmental systems and networks to the  Internet, intranets, and extranets be made through a firewall and that  effective technical controls be implemented to protect computing  resources connected to the network.", "Our analysis found that HHS did not consistently configure network  services and devices securely to prevent unauthorized access to and ensure  the integrity of computer systems operating on its networks. The reports  we reviewed identified weaknesses in the way that HHS operating divisions  and contractors restricted network access, managed antivirus software,  configured network devices, and protected information traversing the HHS  networks.

The system must also establish the validity of a user\u2019s  claimed identity by requesting some kind of information, such as a  password, that is known only by the user\u2014a process known as  authentication. The combination of identification and authentication\u2014 such as user account and password combinations\u2014provides the basis for  establishing individual accountability and for controlling access to the  system. Accordingly, agencies (1) establish password parameters, such as  number of characters, type of characters, and the frequency with which  users should change their passwords, in order to strengthen the  effectiveness of passwords for authenticating the identity of users;   (2) require encryption for passwords to prevent their disclosure to  unauthorized individuals; and (3) implement procedures to control the use  of user accounts. HHS policy requires that all operating divisions  implement and enforce logical password controls for all departmental  systems and networks.", "Our analysis of reported weaknesses showed that HHS did not adequately  control user accounts and passwords to ensure that only authorized  individuals were granted access to its systems. For example, the  department and its contractors did not always implement strong  passwords\u2014using vendor-default or easy to guess passwords. Additionally,  One CMS Medicare contractor set passwords to never expire for 28  service accounts with powerful administrative privileges. As a result, an  unauthorized individual could use a compromised user identification  and password for an indefinite period to gain unauthorized access to  server resources.", "Firewall administrators for another CMS Medicare contractor used a  shared administrative account. As a result, the actions taken by these  individuals cannot be traced back to the responsible individual.", "The minimum password length on one operating division\u2019s local area  network was set to zero. Consequently, users could create short  passwords. Short passwords tend to be easier to guess or crack than  longer passwords. In addition, passwords on this local area network  were not required to be changed at initial logon.", "Such weaknesses increase the risk that passwords may be disclosed to  unauthorized users and used to gain access to the system. They also  diminish the effectiveness of these controls for attributing system activity  to individuals.

It means that users are granted only those  access privileges needed to perform their official duties. To restrict  legitimate users\u2019 access to only those programs and files that they need to  do their work, organizations establish access rights and permissions. \u201cUser  rights\u201d are allowable actions that can be assigned to users or to groups of  users. File and directory permissions are rules that are associated with a  particular file or directory and regulate which users can access them and  the extent of that access. To avoid unintentionally giving users unnecessary  access to sensitive files and directories, an organization must give careful  consideration to its assignment of rights and permissions. HHS policy  requires that access privileges be granted to users at the minimum level  required to perform their job-related duties.", "Our analysis of OIG reports showed that HHS granted access rights and  permissions that gave some users more access to departmental information  and medical systems than they needed to perform their jobs.

The National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines suggest that agencies  determine the sensitivity of particular positions, based on such factors as  the type and degree of harm that the individual could cause by misusing the  computer system and on more traditional factors, such as access to  classified information and fiduciary responsibilities. Background  investigations help an organization to determine whether a particular  individual is suitable for a given position by attempting to ascertain the  person\u2019s trustworthiness and appropriateness for the position. The exact  type of screening that takes place depends on the sensitivity of the position  and any applicable regulations by which the agency is bound.", "HHS policy requires that all information security employees and contractor  personnel be designated with position-sensitivity levels that are  commensurate with the responsibilities and risks associated with their  position. In addition, it requires suitability background investigations to be  completed and favorably adjudicated for all personnel assigned to these  positions prior to allowing them access to sensitive HHS systems and  networks.", "Our analysis of prior reports showed that background investigations were  not always performed. For example, 13 CMS Medicare contractors had  weaknesses in their background investigation policies and procedures. Six  of the contractors reviewed were not adhering to established policies,  while the remaining seven were not performing background investigations  in a consistent manner. In addition, one operating division was unable to  provide the background investigation status for any of the 49 contractor  personnel working at its data center or for any of the 28 contractor  personnel supporting one of its general support systems.

However, the disparity in the  number of reported events among the operating divisions of relatively  similar size raises concerns. This disparity may be an indication of  inconsistency among criteria settings and configuration requirements for  the respective intrusion detection systems. The reporting disparities may  also be influenced by the type and location of the intrusion detection  systems. For example, an intrusion detection system located behind a  firewall detects fewer events than one located on the perimeter in front of a  firewall because of the firewall\u2019s ability to block certain network traffic.

A key reason for these weaknesses is that HHS has not yet  fully implemented a departmentwide information security program that  can establish and maintain effective controls. Full implementation of such  a program would provide for periodically assessing risks, establishing  appropriate policies and procedures, developing and implementing  security plans, promoting security awareness training, testing and  evaluating the effectiveness of controls, implementing corrective actions,  responding to incidents, and ensuring continuity of operations.  Implementing such a program across all operating divisions requires  effective management oversight and monitoring, especially at a department  as diverse as HHS.
