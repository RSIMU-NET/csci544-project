CSPF is one of the nation's largest multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, covering about 385,000 participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court-enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires that the plan's assets be managed by independent parties. Within 7 years, CSPF estimates that the plan's financial condition will require severe benefit cuts. GAO was asked to review the events and factors that led to the plan's critical financial status and the oversight DOL provides under the consent decree and under other federal laws.", "GAO reviewed (1) what is known about the factors that contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, (2) DOL's role in the administration of the 1982 CSPF consent decree and what actions the agency has taken under that role, and (3) what actions, if any, DOL has taken to oversee CSPF, beyond those required under the consent decree. GAO reviewed the consent decree and its amendments, relevant federal laws and regulations, agency guidance on plan management, and DOL protocols for investigating plans; interviewed CSPF representatives, International Brotherhood of Teamsters officials and members, federal officials, and industry stakeholders; and reviewed correspondence between DOL and CSPF and documents related to DOL investigations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (CSPF) was established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry workers and is one of the largest multiemployer plans. According to its regulatory filings, CSPF had less than half the estimated funds needed to cover plan liabilities in 1982 at the time it entered into a court-enforceable consent decree that provides for oversight of certain plan activities. Since then, CSPF has made some progress toward achieving its targeted level of funding; however, CSPF has never been more than 75 percent funded and its funding level has weakened since 2002, as shown in the figure below.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified numerous factors that contributed to CSPF's financial condition. For example, stakeholders stated that changes within the trucking industry, as well as a decline in union membership, contributed to CSPF's inability to maintain a healthy contribution base. CSPF's active participants made up about 69 percent of all participants in 1982, but accounted for only 16 percent in 2016. The most dramatic change in active participants occurred in 2007 when the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) withdrew from the plan. At that time, UPS accounted for about 30 percent of the plan's active participants (i.e. workers). In addition, the market declines of 2001 to 2002 and 2008 had a significant negative impact on the plan's long-term investment performance. Stakeholders noted that, while each individual factor contributed to CSPF's critical financial condition, the interrelated nature of the factors also had a cumulative effect on the plan's financial condition.", "The 1982 consent decree between the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and CSPF came about as a result of an investigation of alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and mismanagement of plan assets, and is intended to prevent their reoccurrence. In addition to reiterating the requirement that the plan comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\u2014the primary law governing the treatment of private-sector pensions in the United States\u2014the consent decree further outlines requirements for the plan to help ensure fiduciary controls and plan management, including seeking court approvals for the appointment of new trustees and changes to the plan's investment policy. The consent decree also delineates roles for DOL and other stakeholders. For example, it allows DOL to object to or comment on certain proposed plan actions, but does not require the agency to do so. GAO's review of plan documents found that the agency provided oversight and technical assistance in the areas specifically identified for its involvement under the consent decree, such as vetting proposed trustees prior to the court's approval.", "DOL is primarily responsible for enforcing the reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary provisions of ERISA for all tax-qualified pension plans, including CSPF. ERISA sets forth a \u201cprudent man standard of care\u201d in the execution of fiduciary duties that, according to DOL, focuses on the process for making proper fiduciary decisions. Plan fiduciaries are responsible for selecting and monitoring investment managers, but are generally not liable for the individual investment decisions of those managers. To enforce ERISA, DOL conducts examinations and investigations. Since the consent decree was established, DOL officials reported that the agency has completed two investigations of CSPF. The two investigations\u2014completed in 1998 and 2004\u2014were closed without adverse findings against the plan. Beyond the agencies' oversight role, DOL collaborated with CSPF and others on steps intended to improve the plan's financial position, including contributing to discussions on proposed legislation and working with CSPF on its application to reduce benefits under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. The application was not approved by the U.S. Department of the Treasury."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1955 to provide pension benefits to trucking industry  workers, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension  Fund (CSPF) is one of the nation\u2019s largest multiemployer pension plans,  with $15.3 billion in assets at the end of 2016. About 1,400 employers are  obligated to contribute to CSPF, and the plan covers almost 385,000  participants. Since 1982, the plan has operated under a court- enforceable consent decree which, among other things, requires it to  obtain approval from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Illinois, Eastern Division, for certain plan activities and allows for U.S.  Department of Labor (DOL) input prior to the court\u2019s approval.

In addition to  causing financial hardship for hundreds of thousands of CSPF retirees  who are at risk of severe benefit cuts, CSPF\u2019s projected insolvency is also  likely to coincide with the projected insolvency of the multiemployer  insurance program managed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (PBGC). The insolvency of PBGC\u2019s multiemployer program  would significantly impact the level of PBGC-guaranteed benefits to current and future beneficiaries in all multiemployer plans receiving PBGC  assistance.

For all  objectives, we reviewed CSPF and DOL documentation and available  literature; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; and interviewed  CSPF officials, federal officials, and other knowledgeable industry  stakeholders. To describe the major factors that led to CSPF\u2019s critical  financial condition, we conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with  federal agency officials and other stakeholders knowledgeable about  unions, participants and retirees, the trucking industry, collective  bargaining agreements, and multiemployer pension plans. We also  interviewed three stakeholders with actuarial expertise to specifically  understand actuarial standards and procedures. In our semi-structured  interviews we asked about key factors affecting the plan and the broader  regulatory and financial environment in which multiemployer plans  operate. We selected knowledgeable stakeholders based on a review of  literature and prior GAO work, and recommendations from other  stakeholders. Additionally, we selected stakeholders whose expertise  coincided with the scope of our objectives and who would be able to  provide a broad range of perspectives. We also collected actuarial,  financial, and other data on current and historical measures of plan  assets, liabilities, investment performance, and other factors, and  performed our own analyses of this data. The data and documentation  collected was generally from the plan or agencies that oversee pensions.  We determined the information to be generally reliable for the purposes of  our objectives.", "To describe DOL\u2019s oversight role under the consent decree and under  federal laws and regulations, we reviewed the consent decree and its  amendments, relevant federal laws and regulations, multiemployer plan  management guidance available to plans on DOL\u2019s website, and DOL\u2019s  protocols for investigating and overseeing pension plans. We also  reviewed correspondence between CSPF and DOL since 1982, when the  consent decree was put into place. Correspondence was provided by  CSPF in response to our request for documentation of DOL oversight,  and to our follow-up requests for additional documentation related to  specific time periods and topics, such as investigations and steps taken to  vet trustee candidates. DOL also provided documentation throughout the  course of our engagement, including documentation it provided between  September and October 2017 that it had not previously identified as being  relevant to our review. We completed an on-site file review at DOL in  September 2017, and DOL sent us additional electronic documentation in  September and October 2017. Overall, we reviewed extensive  documentation from DOL\u2014spanning over 10,000 pages of paper-based  and electronic files\u2014and spent substantial time cataloging and  categorizing it. However, DOL officials reported that certain  documentation related to CSPF was no longer available because it had  only been retained for the time specified in the records retention policy of  the relevant office, and that many individuals at DOL and the plan who  were involved in establishing the consent decree in 1982 and ensuring  compliance in the intervening years were no longer available.

Multiemployer plans are typically found in  industries with many small employers such as trucking, building and  construction, and retail food sales.

The labor union  typically determines how the trustees representing labor are chosen and  the contributing employers or an employer association typically  determines how the trustees representing management are chosen. The  trustees set the overall plan policy, direct plan activities, and set benefit  levels (see fig. 1).", "Multiemployer plans are \u201cprefunded,\u201d or funded in advance, primarily by  employer contributions. The employer contribution is generally  negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement, and is often based  on a dollar amount per hour worked by each employee covered by the  agreement. Employer contributions are pooled in a trust fund for  investment purposes, to pay benefits to retirees and their beneficiaries,  and for administrative expenses. Multiemployer plan trustees typically  decide how the trust fund should be invested to meet the plan\u2019s  objectives, but the trustees can use investment managers to determine  how the trust fund should be invested.", "A plan\u2019s funded percentage is its ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities.  Because the amount needed to pay pension benefits for many years into  the future cannot be known with certainty due to a variety of economic  and demographic factors, including the potential volatility of asset values,  estimates of a plan\u2019s funded percentage may vary from year to year.  Defined benefit pension plans use a \u201cdiscount rate\u201d to convert projected  future benefits into their \u201cpresent value.\u201d The discount rate is the interest  rate used to determine the current value of estimated future benefit  payments and is an integral part of estimating a plan\u2019s liabilities. The  higher the discount rate, the lower the plan\u2019s estimate of its liability.  Multiemployer plans use an \u201cassumed-return approach\u201d that bases the  discount rate on a long-term assumed average rate of return on the  pension plan\u2019s assets. Under this approach, the discount rate depends on  the allocation of plan assets. For example, a reallocation of plan assets  into more stocks and fewer bonds typically increases the discount rate,  which reduces the estimated value of plan liabilities, and therefore,  reduces the minimum amount of funding required.", "Looking at the entire \u201cmultiemployer system\u201d\u2014the aggregation of  multiemployer plans governed by ERISA and insured by PBGC\u2014shows  that while the system was significantly underfunded around 2001 and  2009, its funded position has improved since 2009.

The DOL investigation ultimately  resulted in the establishment of a federal court-enforceable consent  decree in 1982 that remains in force today. CSPF held more than $4.3  billion in Net Assets at the end of 1982 after the consent decree was  established. The plan\u2019s Net Assets peaked at nearly $26.8 billion at the  end of 2007 and declined to about $15.3 billion at the end of 2016 (see  fig. 2).

By 2015, only three of the  plan\u2019s 50 largest employers from 1980 still paid into the plan, and for each  full-time active employee there were over five nonworking participants,  mainly retirees. As a result, benefit payments to CSPF retirees have  exceeded employer contributions in every year since 1984. Thus, CSPF  has generally drawn down its investment assets.

As a result of its investigation, DOL filed suit against the former  trustees of CSPF and, in September 1982, the parties entered into a  consent decree, which remains in force today.

For  example, certain plan activities must be submitted to DOL for comment  and to the court for approval, including new trustee approvals and some  investment manager appointments.

Each program has separate insurance funds and  different benefit guarantee rules.", "The events that trigger PBGC intervention differ between multiemployer  and single-employer plans. For multiemployer plans, the triggering event  is plan insolvency, the point at which a plan begins to run out of money  while not having sufficient assets to pay the full benefits that were  originally promised when due. PBGC does not take over operations of an  insolvent multiemployer plan; rather, it provides loan assistance to pay  administrative expenses and benefits up to the PBGC-guaranteed level.  According to PBGC, only once in its history has a financial assistance  loan from the multiemployer pension insurance program been repaid. In  2017, PBGC provided financial assistance to 72 insolvent multiemployer  plans for an aggregate amount of $141 million. For single-employer plans  the triggering event is termination of an underfunded plan\u2014generally,  when the employer goes out of business or enters bankruptcy.

Specifically, deregulation of the trucking industry reduced government  oversight and regulation over interstate trucking shipping rates. The  trucking industry became increasingly dominated by nonunion trucking  companies resulting in the bankruptcy of many unionized trucking  companies, according to stakeholders. New trucking companies typically  did not join multiemployer plans because their labor force was not  unionized and this, coupled with the bankruptcy of many contributing  employers, contributed to a decrease in active participant populations for  many plans serving the industry. As the total number of active participants  in a plan declines, the resources from which to collect employer  contributions declines proportionally. Stakeholders also said these  changes were unforeseeable. Limitations on a plan\u2019s ability to increase  contributions mean that a plan has less capacity to recover from an  underfunded position or to make up for investment returns that fall short  of expectations.", "A decline in the number of active workers can also accelerate plan  \u201cmaturity,\u201d as measured by the ratio of nonworking to working  participants. Plan maturity has implications for a plan\u2019s investment  practices and the time frame over which the plan must be funded.  According to PBGC\u2019s data for the multiemployer plans it insures, there  were approximately three active participants for every nonworking  participant in 1980 (3:1); by 2014, the ratio was approximately one active  worker for every two nonworking participants (1:2). Figure 6 shows the  change in the percentages of active and nonworking participants for the  multiemployer plans that PBGC insures.", "CSPF saw an even more dramatic change in its active to nonworking  participant ratio from 1982 through 2015. In 1982, there were more than  two active workers for every nonworking participant (2:1) and by 2016  that ratio had fallen to approximately one active worker for every five  nonworking participants (1:5) (see fig. 7). Because CSPF\u2019s contributing  employers were largely trucking companies, stakeholders said this made  the fund especially vulnerable to industry-wide shocks. Like the industry  as a whole, CSPF was unable to attract new employers to replace exiting  employers, in part because of the lack of new unionized employers.", "CSPF officials said that changes to the trucking industry and its workforce  also led to other challenges for the plan. For example, contributions to the  plan declined with the shrinking number of active workers. CSPF officials  told us they could not significantly increase the contribution rate paid by  remaining employers because of the financial hardship it would cause,  and as a result, the plan\u2019s ability to recover from its underfunded position  was limited. CSPF officials said that this increased the plan\u2019s reliance on  investment returns to try to close the gap between its assets and  liabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Challenges and Investment Practices", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed cited challenges inherent in multiemployer  plans\u2019 funding and investment practices, and described how the  challenges may have contributed to the critical financial condition of some  plans, including CSPF.", "Stakeholders said that CSPF and many other multiemployer plans have  been challenged by employer withdrawals. An employer withdrawal  reduces the plan\u2019s number of active worker participants, thereby reducing  its contribution base and accelerating plan maturity. A withdrawing  employer generally must pay a share of any unfunded benefits.  Stakeholders identified several ways in which the withdrawal liability  framework could result in a withdrawing employer underpaying its share  of an unfunded liability. We have previously reported on the challenges  associated with withdrawal liability, including: withdrawal liability assessments are often paid over time, and  payment amounts are based on prior contribution rates rather than the  employer\u2019s actual withdrawal liability assessment; withdrawal liability payments are subject to a 20-year cap, regardless  of whether an employer\u2019s share of unfunded benefits has been fully  paid within this 20-year timeframe; plans often did not collect some or all of the scheduled withdrawal  liability payments because employers went bankrupt before  completing their scheduled payments; and  fears of withdrawal liability exposure increasing over time could be an  incentive for participating employers to leave a plan and a disincentive  for new employers to join a plan.", "Stakeholders we interviewed also added that the calculation used to  determine withdrawal liability may use an investment return assumption  that inherently transfers risk to the plan.", "When exiting employers do not pay their share of unfunded benefits, any  remaining and future employers participating in the plan may effectively  assume the unpaid share as a part of their own potential withdrawal  liability as well as responsibility for the exiting employer\u2019s \u201corphaned\u201d  participants. Participating employers may negotiate a withdrawal if they  perceive a risk that the value of their potential withdrawal liability might  grow significantly over time.", "In its MPRA application, CSPF cited employer withdrawals and  bankruptcies as a significant challenge for the plan. CSPF reported that  after deregulation, the number of contributing employers dropped by over  70 percent. While some of the drop could be due to the consolidation of  trucking companies after deregulation, CSPF officials cited several cases  in which employers went bankrupt or withdrew from the plan, which  reduced the plan\u2019s contribution base and accelerated its maturity.  Additionally, when employers went bankrupt, they often did not pay their  full withdrawal liability. For example, CSPF said two of its major  contributing employers left the plan between 2001 and 2003, and left  $290 million of more than $403 million in withdrawal liability unpaid after  they went bankrupt.", "Stakeholders identified funding timeframes as a factor that contributed to  the challenges facing many multiemployer plans, including CSPF.  ERISA\u2019s minimum funding standards have historically allowed  multiemployer plans to amortize, or spread out the period of time for  funding certain events, such as investment shortfalls and benefit  improvements. For example, CSPF began a 40-year amortization of  approximately $6.1 billion in underfunding on January 1, 1981, giving the  plan until the end of 2021 to fully fund that amount. Longer amortization  periods increase the risk of plan underfunding due to the number and  magnitude of changes in the plan\u2019s environment that may occur, such as  a general decline in participants or deregulation of an industry. The  Pension Protection Act of 2006 shortened amortization periods for single- employer plans to 7 years and the amortization periods for multiemployer  plans to 15 years. Shorter amortization periods provide greater benefit  security to plan participants by reducing an unfunded liability more  rapidly. In addition, shorter amortization periods can be better aligned  with the projected timing of benefit payments for a mature plan. However,  shorter periods can be a source of hardship for plans with financially  troubled contributing employers because they may require higher  contributions. According to CSPF officials, CSPF requested and received  an additional 10-year amortization extension from the IRS in 2005 after  relating that contribution requirements could force participating employers  into bankruptcy. One CSPF representative said an amortization extension  can also help avoid subjecting the plan\u2019s employers to IRS excise taxes  for failing to make required minimum contributions.", "Stakeholders we interviewed said that certain common investment  practices may have played a role in the critical financial condition of  CSPF and other mature and declining plans. In general, multiemployer  plans invest in portfolios that are expected, on average, to produce higher  returns than a low-risk portfolio, such as one composed entirely of U.S.  Treasury securities. Stakeholders also stated that these investment  practices may have been too risky because returns can be more volatile,  and the higher expected returns might not be achieved. In addition, the  Congressional Budget Office has reported that if \u201cplans had been  required to fund their benefit liabilities\u2014at the time those liabilities were  accrued\u2014with safer investments, such as bonds, the underfunding of  multiemployer plans would have been far less significant and would pose  less risk to PBGC and beneficiaries.\u201d", "Stakeholders also told us that for mature plans like CSPF, these  investment practices can pose further challenges. Mature plans, with  fewer active employees, have less ability to recoup losses through  increased contributions and have less time to recoup losses through  investment returns before benefits must be paid. Market corrections, such  as those that occurred in 2001 through 2002 and in 2008, can be  particularly challenging to mature plans and their participants, especially if  a mature plan is also significantly underfunded. Mature plans could  mitigate these risks by investing more conservatively, however, the  resulting lower expected returns from more conservative investing  necessitates higher funding targets and contribution rates, which could be  a hardship for employers in an industry with struggling employers.  Alternatively, a plan that invests more conservatively may provide lower  promised benefits to accommodate the level of contributions it can collect.  Lower investment returns from a more conservative investment policy  would cost employers more in contributions and could potentially result in  employers leaving the plan. Further, investing in a conservative portfolio  would be relatively unique among multiemployer plans, and stakeholders  said plan managers may feel they are acting in a prudent fashion by  investing similarly to their peers. Underfunded plans like CSPF may not  see conservative investment as an option if they cannot raise the  contributions necessary to fully fund their vested benefits. Officials from  CSPF told us that, because they lacked the ability to significantly increase  revenue or decrease accrued benefits, the named fiduciaries sought  incrementally higher investment returns to meet funding thresholds  required by the amortization extension they received in 2005.", "On the other hand, there are challenges associated with risk-bearing  investments. In our prior work, we reported that multiemployer plans  generally develop an assumed average rate of investment return and use  that assumption to determine funding targets, required contributions, and  the potential cost of benefit improvements. Experts we interviewed for  that report told us that using a portfolio\u2019s expected return to value the cost  of benefits increases the risk that insufficient assets could be on hand  when needed. They also told us that using the portfolio\u2019s expected return  to calculate liabilities could incentivize plans to invest in riskier assets and  to negotiate higher benefit levels because the higher returns expected  from riskier portfolios can result in lower reported liabilities.", "Plan Terms Set through Collective Bargaining  Stakeholders we interviewed said that plan terms, such as contribution  rates, which are set through the collective bargaining process, can create  an additional challenge for multiemployer plans. Employers in  multiemployer plans generally are not required to contribute beyond what  they have agreed to in collective bargaining, and these required employer  contributions generally do not change during the term of a collective  bargaining agreement. CSPF officials said that up until the early 2000s,  plan officials did not request modifications to collective bargaining  agreements, such as reallocating contribution dollars, to respond to  adverse investment returns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investment Performance and Market Downturns", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders highlighted the effects of market downturns on  multiemployer plan assets as another contributing factor to CSPF\u2019s critical  financial condition and that of other multiemployer plans. Failure to  achieve assumed returns has the effect of increasing unfunded liabilities.  For the multiemployer system in aggregate, the average annual return on  plan assets over the 2002 to 2014 period was about 6.1 percent, well  short of typical assumed returns of 7.0 or 7.5 percent in 2002.", "Many multiemployer plans were especially impacted by the 2008 market  downturn. PBGC estimated that from 2007 to 2009, the value of all  multiemployer plan assets fell by approximately 24 percent, or $103  billion, after accounting for contributions to and payments from the  plans. Although asset values recovered to some extent after 2009,  some plans continued to be significantly underfunded, and stakeholders  said this could be due to the contribution base not being sufficient to help  recover from investment shortfalls.", "CSPF\u2019s investment performance since 2000 has reflected performance  similar to other multiemployer plans and the plan went from 73 percent  funded in 2000 to about 38 percent funded in 2017. While the plan used  an assumed rate of return of 7.5 to 8.0 percent per year between 2000  and 2014, our analysis of the plan\u2019s regulatory filings shows that the  plan\u2019s weighted-average investment return over this period was about 4.9  percent per year. CSPF officials said the 2008 downturn significantly  reduced CSPF\u2019s assets and it was unable to sufficiently recoup those  losses when the market rebounded in 2009. Plan assets declined from  $26.8 billion at the beginning of 2008 to $17.4 billion at the beginning of  2009, with $7.5 billion of the decline attributable to investment losses.  Despite reporting a 26 percent return on assets during 2009, CSPF had  only $19.5 billion in assets at the end of 2009 because benefits and  expenses exceeded the contributions it collected and because it had  fewer assets generating returns for the plan. By the end of 2009, CSPF\u2019s  funding target was $35.9 billion but the fund had less than $20 billion that  could be used to generate investment returns.  If CSPF\u2019s portfolio had  returned 7.5 percent per year over the 2000-2014 period, instead of the  approximately 4.9 percent we calculated, we estimate that the portfolio  value would have exceeded $32.0 billion at the end of 2014, or 91  percent of its Actuarial Accrued Liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of UPS Withdrawal", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the factors mentioned that affected many multiemployer  plans, stakeholders we interviewed also noted the unique effect of the  UPS withdrawal on CSPF. In 2007, UPS negotiated with the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters for a withdrawal from CSPF and paid a  withdrawal liability payment of $6.1 billion. This payment was invested  just prior to the 2008 market downturn. Moreover, the loss of UPS,  CSPF\u2019s largest contributing employer, reduced the plan\u2019s ability to collect  needed contributions if the plan became more underfunded. A UPS  official said that, following the market decline of 2001-2002, the company  considered whether it should withdraw from all multiemployer plans  because it did not want to be the sole contributing employer in any plan.  According to this official, UPS considered the large number of UPS  employees in CSPF and the plan\u2019s demographics\u2014such as an older  population and fewer employers\u2014in its decision to withdraw. CSPF  officials said they did not want UPS to withdraw because its annual  contributions accounted for about one-third of all contributions to the plan.  CSPF officials also told us that, prior to the UPS withdrawal, they had  expected the population of active UPS workers in the plan to grow over  time.", "UPS\u2019 withdrawal of 30 percent of CSPF\u2019s active workers, in combination  with the significant market downturn just after UPS withdrew, reflected the  loss of working members and investment challenges on a large scale.  Additionally, stakeholders noted that although each of the factors that  contributed to CSPF\u2019s critical financial condition individually is important,  their interrelated nature also had a cumulative effect on the plan. Industry  deregulation, declines in collective bargaining, and the plan\u2019s significantly  underfunded financial condition all impaired CSPF\u2019s ability to maintain a  population of active workers sufficient to supply its need for contributions  when investment shortfalls developed. Given historical rules for plan  funding and industry stresses, CSPF was unable to capture adequate  funding from participating employers either before or after they withdrew  from the plan. The plan\u2019s financial condition was further impaired when  long-term investment performance fell short of expectations. For an  underfunded, mature plan such as CSPF, the cumulative effect of these  factors was described by some stakeholders as too much for CSPF to  overcome."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOL Has Provided Oversight in Its Role As Described in the Consent Decree", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Roles and Responsibilities Identified in the Consent Decree", "paragraphs": ["The consent decree describes roles and responsibilities for several  parties, including CSPF, its trustees, and DOL.
