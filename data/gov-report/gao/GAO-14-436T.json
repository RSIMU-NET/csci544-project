Improving the  transparency of about 700 major IT investments with the IT  Dashboard can help focus attention on troubled projects. In addition,  holding executive reviews, known as TechStat sessions, of selected  investments that are not producing results has resulted in positive  outcomes such as accelerated delivery, reduced scope, and  termination. We have made recommendations to improve the  accuracy and use of the IT Dashboard and for the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and agencies to hold more TechStat  sessions. OMB has generally concurred with our Dashboard  recommendations and has taken actions such as improving the  accuracy of the reported investment cost and schedule data.

For example, we  recently reported that the PortfolioStat initiative has the potential to  save between $5.8 and $7.9 billion. We have made multiple  recommendations to OMB and agencies to more fully implement and  report on eliminating duplicative and inefficient IT investments. OMB  agreed with some of these recommendations and subsequently  clarified its guidance on how agencies should identify potentially  duplicative investments. Further, agencies have also generally agreed  with our recommendations and taken steps such as conducting  portfolio reviews to identify duplicative investments and report those  results via the IT Dashboard.", "Addressing improper payments. The federal government serves as  the steward of taxpayer dollars and should safeguard them against  improper payments. The President\u2019s Management Agenda is  consistent with our prior reporting that predictive analytic technologies  can help agencies better identify and prevent improper payments.  Further, OMB reported that it plans to develop more detailed  categories of improper payments, which can help agencies tailor  corrective action plans to better address the root causes of improper  payments.", "In fiscal year 2013, estimated governmentwide improper payments  totaled approximately $106 billion; however, this may not cover the full  extent of improper payments throughout the federal government. In  order to determine the full extent of improper payments  governmentwide and to more effectively reduce and recover them,  continued attention is needed to (1) adopt sound risk assessment and  improper payment estimation methodologies and (2) develop effective  corrective action plans and preventive and detective controls to  address the root causes of improper payments.", "Expanding strategic sourcing. One area that could yield significant  cost savings is the expanded use of strategic sourcing, a process that  moves away from numerous individual procurements to a broader  aggregate approach. Our work has found that federal agencies could  better leverage their buying power and achieve additional savings by  directing more procurement spending to existing strategic sourcing  contracts and further expanding strategic sourcing practices to their  highest spending procurement categories. For example, most  agencies\u2019 efforts do not address their highest spending areas such as  services.", "We estimated that savings of one percent from selected large  agencies\u2019 procurement spending alone would equate to over $4  billion. In that regard, the President\u2019s Management Agenda calls on  federal agencies to expand the use of strategic sourcing to better  leverage the government\u2019s buying power and reduce contract  duplication. It did not, however, lay out specific governmentwide  metrics or savings goals. We had previously recommended that OMB  establish additional metrics to measure progress toward goals. OMB  has efforts underway to address this recommendation.", "Strengthening strategic human capital management. Consistent  with the President\u2019s Management Agenda goal to attract and retain a  talented workforce, foster a culture of excellence, and invest in the  Senior Executive Service (SES), we have reported that addressing  complex challenges such as homeland security, economic stability,  and other national priorities requires a high-quality workforce able to  work seamlessly with other agencies, levels of government, and  across sectors. Strategic human capital management has been on our  High Risk List since 2001.", "Since then, as a result of actions taken by Congress, the Office of  Personnel Management, and individual agencies, important progress  has been made. Still, additional efforts are needed in such areas as  human capital planning, building results-oriented cultures, and talent  management, such as (1) addressing government-wide and agency- specific skill gaps and enhancing workforce diversity, (2)  strengthening performance management systems to improve the \u201cline  of sight\u201d between individual performance and organizational  outcomes, and (3) fully assessing the costs and benefits of SES  training.", "Improving the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) weapons systems  and services acquisition.

DOD has made some progress in this area. Over the past  several years it has decreased the size of its major defense  acquisition program portfolio as well as its estimated total cost;  however, programs continue to experience cost growth over time.  DOD has launched its \u201cBetter Buying Power\u201d initiatives to achieve  more efficiency and reduce cost growth.", "We have tracked implementation of some of these initiatives and  found that DOD has largely been successful in implementing its  \u201cshould-cost\u201d effort to lower contract prices during negotiations and  has reported near-term cost savings as a result.

Similarly,  we have found that DOD has made mixed progress in improving its  acquisition of services. DOD leadership has demonstrated a  commitment to improving service acquisitions and management, but  the department\u2019s efforts are hindered, in part, by limited knowledge  and baseline data on the current state of service acquisitions and the  absence of goals and metrics to assess its progress.

In that regard, our work has shown that  progress has been made in implementing the GPRA Modernization Act of  2010 (GPRAMA). For example, the executive branch has taken a  number of steps to implement key provisions of GPRAMA. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) has developed cross-agency priority  goals, and agencies developed agency priority goals. Agency officials  reported that their agencies have assigned performance management  leadership roles and responsibilities to officials who generally participate  in performance management activities, including quarterly performance  reviews for agency priority goals. Further, OMB developed  Performance.gov, a government-wide website, which provides quarterly  updates on cross-agency priority goals and agency priority goals.", "While the building blocks needed for implementation are being put in  place, much more needs to be done before the provisions of the act are  fully useful to decision makers as shown in the following examples."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Developing a Comprehensive Inventory of Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["Executive branch efforts to address crosscutting issues are hampered by  the lack of a comprehensive list of programs\u2014a key requirement of the  act.

GPRAMA requires OMB  to compile and make publicly available a comprehensive list of all federal  programs identified by agencies, and to include the purposes of each  program, how it contributes to the agency\u2019s mission, and recent funding  information. OMB began implementing this provision by directing 24 large  federal agencies to develop and publish inventories of their programs in  May 2013.", "Our preliminary review of these initial inventories identified concerns  about the usefulness of the information being developed and the extent to  which it might be able to assist executive branch and congressional  efforts to identify and address fragmentation, overlap, and duplication.  OMB\u2019s guidance for developing the inventories provided agencies with  flexibility to define their programs, such as by outcomes, customers,  products/services, organizational structure, and budget structure. As a  result, agencies took various approaches to define their programs\u2014with  many using their budget structure while others used different approaches  such as identifying programs by related outcomes or customer focus.", "The variation in definitions across agencies will limit comparability among  like programs. In addition, as reported in our annual reports on  fragmentation, overlap and duplication, we have found that federal budget  and cost information is often not available or not sufficiently reliable to  identify the level of funding provided to programs or activities. For  example, agencies could not isolate budgetary information for some  programs because the data were aggregated at higher levels.", "OMB identified 12 different program types (e.g., block grants, regulatory,  credit) for agencies to assign to their programs; however, the list of  program types does not include tax expenditures, which represent a  substantial federal commitment.

However, we found that  the departments do not have a fully developed and formalized process for  systematically identifying all opportunities for new or enhanced  collaboration, potentially missing opportunities to improve health care  access and quality, and reduce costs.", "Many collaborative mechanisms, such as interagency groups and  specially created interagency offices, do not operate as effectively as they  could. These mechanisms face challenges with issues such as  identifying a common outcome and managing resources across agency  lines. Our work has found practices and corresponding effective  implementation approaches that collaborative mechanisms have used to  work effectively across agency lines. For example, we have found  practices and approaches such as agreeing on roles and responsibilities,  with corresponding accountability for both the agency and the individual  participants, creating an inventory of agency resources dedicated towards  interagency outcomes, developing outcomes that represent the collective  interests of participants, and developing performance measures that are  tied to shared outcomes, can help enhance and sustain collaboration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectively Implementing Strategic Reviews", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s 2013 guidance implementing GPRAMA directs agencies,  beginning in 2014, to conduct annual reviews of progress towards  strategic objectives\u2014the outcomes or impacts the agency is intending to  achieve.

These weaknesses are the federal government\u2019s inability to determine the full extent to which improper payments occur and  reasonably assure that appropriate actions are taken to reduce them,  identify and timely resolve information security control deficiencies and  manage information security risks on an ongoing basis, and effectively manage its tax collection activities.", "There are also risks that certain factors could affect the federal  government\u2019s financial condition in the future, including the following:", "The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is facing a deteriorating financial  situation with a lack of liquidity as it has reached its borrowing limit of $15  billion and finished fiscal year 2013 with a reported net loss of $5 billion.", "The Federal Housing Administration\u2019s (FHA) mortgage insurance portfolio  continues to grow, and its insurance fund has experienced major financial  difficulties.

As computer technology has  advanced, federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures such  as power distribution, water supply, telecommunications, and emergency  services have become increasingly dependent on computerized  information systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to  process, maintain, and report essential information. The security of these  systems and data is essential to protecting national security, economic  prosperity, and public health and safety. We have reported that (1) cyber  threats to systems supporting government operations and critical  infrastructure were evolving and growing, (2) cyber incidents affecting  computer systems and networks continue to rise, and (3) the federal  government continues to face challenges in a number of key aspects of  its approach to cybersecurity, including those related to protecting the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure. For these reasons, federal information  security has been on GAO\u2019s list of high-risk areas since 1997; in 2003, we  expanded this high-risk area to include cyber critical infrastructure  protection.", "The federal government has taken a variety of actions that are intended  to enhance federal and critical infrastructure cybersecurity. For example,  the government issued numerous strategy-related documents over the  last decade, many of which addressed aspects of the challenge areas we  identified. The administration also took steps to enhance various  cybersecurity capabilities, including establishing agency performance  goals and a tracking mechanism to monitor performance in three cross- agency priority areas.

Until then, a  broad array of federal assets and operations will remain at risk of fraud,  misuse, and disruption, and the nation\u2019s most critical federal and private  sector infrastructure systems will remain at increased risk of attack from  our adversaries.
