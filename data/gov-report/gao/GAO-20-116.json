While Office of the Secretary of Defense officials reported posting a list of working groups, the list only contains three of the more than 60 working groups GAO identified. Without a centralized list of sharing venues and points of contact, it is unclear what groups exist and who to contact to participate, which may impede sharing of best practices and lessons learned. Further, while the Army stated it established lessons learned organizations for sharing maintenance best practices and lessons learned, it did not maintain them due to organizational restructuring and resource constraints. Establishing and maintaining effective organizations dedicated to sharing materiel best practices and lessons learned would encourage knowledge sharing among the Army depots.", "DOD is experiencing benefits and taking steps to mitigate challenges with implementing best practices and lessons learned among the depots. Depots reported that implementing some best practices and lessons learned has led to benefits, including time and cost savings. For example, Navy Fleet Readiness Center Southwest, California, implemented an intermittent fault detection system from Ogden Air Logistics Complex, Utah, on its F/A-18 aircraft generators. According to officials, the depot reduced repair time from 90 days to 30 days and quadrupled the generators' time between failures. Depots reported a variety of challenges to implementing lessons learned and best practices, including a lack of resources, lengthy approval processes, and acquisition and technology restrictions.

For fiscal year 2018, DOD reported $19 billion in  total maintenance expenditures and about 84,000 personnel performing  depot-level maintenance. However, our prior work shows that DOD is  continually experiencing challenges at its depots, including deteriorating  equipment and facility condition, filling critical personnel skills, and  meeting service repair needs. These challenges can lead to delays in the  maintenance of weapon systems, which ultimately affects readiness by  impeding the military services' ability to conduct training and to provide  forces with sufficient equipment to perform operations around the world.

The Joint Technology Exchange Group was  chartered to improve coordination in the introduction of new or  improved technology, new processes, or new equipment into DOD  depot maintenance activities. To do this, the Joint Technology  Exchange Group facilitates a number of forums and working groups  centered on specific technologies, which allow representatives from  the depots to learn from other services, academia, and industry (See  fig. 4.). One example of this is cold spray, a new technology that  sprays high velocity metal particles to repair worn surfaces and  damaged parts that are unrepairable by traditional processes.  Working groups facilitated by the Joint Technology Exchange Group  have shared the usefulness of cold spray technology, and 12 depots  from all service branches reported that they have begun adopting the  technology.

Depots within each military service are  collaborating to implement best practices and lessons learned to improve  depot management processes and repairs related to weapon systems.  For example, Red River Army Depot implemented a best practice learned  from Anniston Army Depot to improve its depot management process in  meeting its production schedule. The production schedule is a plan that  identifies, among other things, working hours for maintainers, available  storage, and parts supply. To facilitate the implementation of this best  practice, Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, which  oversees these two depots, hosted a joint event for the purpose of  Anniston\u2019s sharing how a small group of individuals at its depot is  responsible for maintaining visibility of all end-item (i.e., components and  parts ready for their intended use) production schedules. According to  Army officials, Red River did not have an organization that performed a  similar function, and during the joint event, depot officials from Red River  saw this as a lesson learned that they could take back to their depot and  implement. Additionally, Anniston shared how it conducts its risk  assessments, or program reviews, and weekly execution meetings,  among other processes, in meeting its production schedules. As a result,  Army officials told us that Red River implemented the best practices they  thought would be beneficial in helping them make progress in meeting  their production schedules.", "In another example, two Air Force depots that maintain the Navy\u2019s C-130  aircraft are working together to implement a best practice, which,  according to program documentation, has led to cost and time savings  (See fig. 6.).", "Specifically, the Navy\u2019s C-130 aircraft, which, according to Ogden  officials, is maintained at Ogden Air Logistics Complex and Warner  Robins Air Logistics Complex, contains a shelf bracket, which holds the  pieces of the aircraft together. The aircraft becomes structurally  vulnerable and unfit for operations and training if the shelf bracket is  removed. The process of blasting, inspecting, plating, and reinstalling the  shelf bracket takes an average of 63 days. During this time, some  maintenance activities cannot occur until the shelf bracket is reinstalled.  To address this issue, engineers at Ogden told us they created a series of  specially-sized pins to lock the Navy\u2019s C-130 aircraft in place to help  maintain the structural integrity of the airframe while other areas of the  aircraft are being repaired. As a result of this best practice, maintainers  have eliminated 16 days in the maintenance process for the C-130. Also,  depot officials told us for a one-time cost of $13,000 for one set of  specially-sized pins, eliminating 16 days in the maintenance process in  turn generates a cost avoidance of $32,000 per day (the cost to dock the  aircraft) or more than $500,000 per aircraft. In implementing this best  practice, the total annual benefit to the C-130 fleet at Ogden amounts to  288 days of aircraft availability and about $9 million in cost avoidance.  Officials at Ogden told us they have implemented this new process and  are discussing this best practice with maintainers at Warner Robins for  implementation at their depot as well.", "Further, Air Force depots are partnering to further implement another best  practice, cold spray technology, which allows depots to repair damaged  parts instead of replacing them. Replacing these damaged parts can be  expensive or difficult if they are low in supply. Also, limited parts and long  lead times can cause delays in the supply system, and existing repair  processes have a long turnaround time. Cold spray technology has not  been fully implemented; however, even with its limited implementation,  cold spray technology has yielded cost and time benefits (See fig. 7.).", "According to Air Force officials, Ogden has been collaborating with the  Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex to cold spray its F-16 gearboxes  until Ogden can obtain adequate workload to sustain the cold spray  technology. According to Ogden officials and program documentation,  cold spraying each gearbox costs about $1,300 whereas replacing each  gearbox costs about $38,000; at 13 units per year, this amounts to almost  $500,000 in annual cost avoidances. Additionally, it would take 95 weeks  to build and receive a new gearbox unit; however, with the cold spray  repair the unit is back in service in 4 weeks. Ogden officials are currently  working to include cold spraying gearboxes for the F-15, C-5 and E-3  weapon systems to its workload.", "Inter-service collaboration. Depots from two or more military services  are collaborating to implement best practices and lessons learned which  has led to benefits. For example, the Navy\u2019s Fleet Readiness Center  Southwest implemented a best practice learned from Ogden Air Logistic  Complex to improve testing of electrical circuits. Specifically, according to  depot officials, a maintainer at Ogden created a method\u2014Intermittent  Fault Detection and Isolation System\u2014which tests systems and software  to detect, isolate, and repair intermittent problems due to open circuits,  short circuits, and poor wiring by replicating the environment of the  aircraft in flight (See fig. 8.). According to Ogden officials and program  documentation, by implementing this best practice, they have recovered  out-of-service assets and generated about $62 million in cost savings. For  example, after testing its F-16 chassis, Ogden officials recovered 138 out- of-service assets\u2014amounting to $42 million of flight hardware returning to  service.", "Moreover, officials at Fleet Readiness Center Southwest visited Ogden  during a benchmarking trip to discuss the process of implementing the  Intermittent Fault Detection and Isolation System to test their systems.  According to officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  intermittent faults due to aircraft electrical systems amounted to more  than $300 million in operating and support costs in fiscal year 2014. The  Fleet Readiness Center Southwest used the Intermittent Fault Detection  and Isolation System to test its F/A-18 aircraft generators, which provide  electrical power to the aircraft. As a result of testing these generators  using the Intermittent Fault Detection and Isolation System, the mean  time between failures for the generators has increased, according to  officials, from 104 flight hours to over 400 flight hours, and the Navy  anticipates a reduction of about 30 to 90 days of repair time.", "DOD and external entities. Depots are also partnering with private  industry to implement best practices and lessons learned, which has led  to time-savings benefits (See fig. 9.).", "For example, according to program officials, the Air Force, Navy, original  equipment manufacturer, and contractor collaborated to implement a best  practice for the U-2 aircraft. Specifically, in 2018, generators for the Air  Force\u2019s U-2 aircraft had decreased their mean time between failures from  1,000 hours to 400 hours. To sustain the fleet, the Air Force was  cannibalizing\u2014removing parts from one aircraft to another\u2014generators  from aircraft in depot maintenance to those preparing for deployment. The  U-2 program office identified the Navy\u2019s F/A-18 A/B generator as similar  to the U-2 generator and learned valuable information on the repair and  overhaul process, root cause analysis of failure of critical parts, and the  Navy\u2019s recommendation for procuring and building overhaul generator  kits. In order to implement the Navy\u2019s processes, the Air Force program  office, working with the original equipment manufacturer and contactor,  incorporated the Navy\u2019s best practices in overhauling its generator kit  concept. As a result, the Air Force is no longer cannibalizing these  generators and the mean time between failures has returned to about  1,000 hours of flight time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Been Able to Implement Some Best Practices and Lessons Learned among the 17 Depots, but Is Taking Steps to Mitigate Challenges", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not been able to implement some best practices and lessons  learned among the 17 depots, but DOD is taking steps to mitigate  challenges to implementation. In its March 2018 Report to Congress on  Sharing of Best Practices for Depot-Level Maintenance Among the  Military Services, DOD noted some of the challenges in implementing  best practices such as differing military service priorities, strategies, and  resourcing of technologies and infrastructure. In responding to our  survey, 15 of the 17 depots reported challenges in implementing best  practices and lessons learned, including insufficient resources,  restrictions related to information technology, approval process, and  acquisition and contracting policies, among others (See table 2.).", "Insufficient resources. Ten of the 17 depots reported insufficient  resources as a challenge to implementation for various reasons. First,  depots reported not having adequate time, staff, or funding to attend  knowledge sharing activities or to analyze data from best practices and  lessons learned. According to depot officials, not being able to attend  knowledge sharing activities has made networking more difficult because  these activities allowed them to discuss best practices and lessons  learned with colleagues from other depots and industry. Second, in  addition to not having adequate funding, depots also reported identifying  sources of funding as a challenge to implementing best practices and  lessons learned for specific weapon systems. For example, according to  officials from one depot, they have been unable to identify a funding  source to implement the laser de-painting system for the F-16, which  would allow the aircraft to stay in service longer and would produce less  hazardous materials than the current blasting process to remove paint  from the aircraft. Third, depots reported insufficient equipment to  implement a best practice. For example, one depot reported not having  enough hand-held tablets, which contain electronic technical data and  best practices from private industry to assist maintainers working on a  weapon system. Another depot reported that it has not implemented the  tablets and are relying on paper documentation to maintain its weapon  systems. According to depot officials, the lack of tablets has had direct  effects at the depot, such as delays in standing-up new capability and  maintainers waiting on available tablets to perform their work.", "To mitigate challenges with insufficient resources, DOD, military service,  and depot officials have taken a variety of steps. For example, officials  from the Office of the Secretary of Defense held an event through the  Joint Technology Exchange Group to discuss available funding sources  for new and emerging technologies, such as the funding sources for the  cold spray technology. According to officials at a Navy depot, depots can  petition the Office of Naval Research for federal laboratory designation.  With this designation, depots can partner with private industry to evaluate  technology in any area that is consistent with the federal laboratory\u2019s  mission and may receive funds from private industry for technology  research and development. Specific to the tablets, depot officials told us  that the materiel command has taken responsibility for managing the  funding of these assets and the depots will receive a technical upgrade  every 4 years. Moreover, in February 2019 the Office of the Secretary of  Defense launched the Enterprise Sustainment Dashboard (Dashboard), a  web-based tool that will provide access to an online central repository of  sustainment data for the military services and will allow senior leaders to  steer resources to needed programs. The Dashboard will allow users to  analyze metrics such as materiel availability (condition of a weapon  system to perform an assigned mission), operational availability  (availability of active inventory to conduct military service operations), and  cost per day availability (maintenance cost per day for a population of  weapon systems by type, model, and series). The Dashboard will also  consolidate inventory, availability, and cost data systems from each of the  military services. This Dashboard is in its early phase and the  implementation plan includes milestones extending into fiscal year 2020.", "Restrictions related to information technology. Ten of the 17 depots  reported restrictions related to information technology as a challenge to  implementation of best practices. Specifically, depots reported having  outdated and incompatible software systems and a lack of a consolidated  database for departments and product lines, which may hinder their ability  to connect computer systems to automate a repair process. Additionally,  depots stated that it may take years to obtain authority and approval to  operate information technology systems, making data collection, sharing,  and implementation of best practices difficult. For example, one depot  reported a technology tool was not user friendly and had a rigid  infrastructure, making it difficult for maintainers to use to analyze metrics  to improve depot maintenance. Specifically, depot officials told us that this  technology tool performs its functions as designed but is limited in its  scope of meeting depot requirements, such as identifying bottlenecks in  the maintenance process. In another example, one depot reported  cybersecurity concerns with commercial off-the-shelf products, which may  not be compatible with the depot\u2019s information technology system.", "To mitigate challenges related to information technology, depots reported  using information systems, such as SharePoint, as a primary source for  collecting, storing, organizing, sharing, and accessing information via a  web browser. For example, Navy officials told us that there are  SharePoint sites for different departments within their organization,  including portals dedicated to training, aircraft, and business processes  and procedures, which capture best practices and lessons learned from  subject matter experts. In another example, an Air Force depot reported  that its SharePoint portal includes a section focused on practical problem  solving methods for some of its continuous process improvement  projects, such as balancing weight on an aircraft and issues related to the  wings of the C-130T. Further, depot officials told us they conducted an  analysis to mitigate concerns about a technology tool, mentioned above,  that was not user friendly and had a rigid infrastructure. Based on this  analysis, depot officials found a modeling and simulation tool that would  help resolve challenges in several key areas, including projecting  workload and personnel required to perform depot maintenance and  determining the depot\u2019s capability for the volume of work that can be  inducted into the depot, among other areas. The modeling and simulation  tool has not been implemented yet because it was recently funded in  September 2019.", "Moreover, in 2018, we reported on steps that DOD is taking to improve its  information technology systems. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense  asked the Defense Business Board to provide actionable  recommendations that DOD could adopt to transform its six core business  processes, including acquisition and procurement, logistics and supply,  and real property management, and their supporting information  technology systems. We recommended, in part, that DOD identify  timeframes and deliverables for identifying and adopting optimal  information technology solutions. DOD concurred with this  recommendation and is taking steps to improve its information technology  systems, such as issuing its initial plan for business operations reform in  April 2019, collecting federal and private industry benchmarks, and  reviewing information technology costs.", "Approval process. Eight of the 17 depots reported that the approval  process and guidance for implementing best practices is challenging.  Specifically, depots reported that the layers of leadership approval  prevent timely implementation of best practices and, at times, can cause  enthusiasm for a project\u2019s implementation to wane. Depot officials also  told us that implementing new ideas for maintaining or repairing weapon  systems is challenging because they have to get multiple approvals from  their chain of command as well as the program manager for a specific  weapon system, thus making implementation more difficult and less  timely. For example, depot officials told us that implementing best  practices at the depot from one weapon system to another requires  retesting of the practice and approval from each program manager.  Additionally, in response to the survey, a depot reported that many of the  essential, time-sensitive engineering decisions for one of its new weapon  system reside at another location, which has caused delays in making  timely decisions. In another example, depot officials told us that they had  to get approval from individual program managers to implement the cold  spray technology and the Intermittent Fault Detection Isolation System.", "To mitigate challenges in the approval process, such as these, depot  officials told us it is beneficial when technological development that affect  the DOD-wide logistics enterprise or an entire military service occurred at  a higher organizational level, making it easier for new ideas to be  implemented at the lower levels. For example, one depot reported on the  Navy\u2019s approach of implementing a best practice across its platforms to  eliminate corrosive plating on its weapon systems. Navy officials told us  that these decisions are made at the headquarters level and implemented  across the depots. Moreover, one depot reported allowing decision  authority for specific weapon systems to reside within the depot, rather  than at another location, to help the depot make timely decisions on  implementing new ideas. Finally, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense is providing specific guidance in implementing best practices and  lessons learned, such as the memorandum issued in April 2019 on the  Intermittent Fault Detection and Isolation System directing the military  services to adopt this best practice.", "Acquisition and contracting policies. Five of the 17 depots reported  acquisition and contracting policies as a challenge to implementation.  Specifically, depots reported that current acquisition and contracting  policies are complex and time consuming, which causes government to  lag behind industry in implementing best practices. For example, officials  from one depot told us that even when two depots need the same item to  repair a weapon system, each depot was encouraged to pursue a  separate contract. Depot officials described this as an inefficient and  burdensome process, which sometimes resulted in an inferior item.  Similarly, officials from another depot told us that they started an initiative  to make equipment and software more similar across their service\u2019s  depots; however, they were unable to implement this initiative for similar  reasons.  Further, officials from one depot told us that the procurement of  a weapon system does not always include access to all data necessary to  maintain the system. According to depot officials, this limits their ability  to implement a best practice or lesson learned from a similar weapon  system because the contractor retains ownership of the intellectual  property needed to repair or optimize the system.", "To mitigate challenges related to acquisition and contracting policies,  depot officials told us that military services are purchasing enough new  technology for all their depots rather than have each depot purchase  technology individually. For example, according to Navy officials, they  purchased the equipment to implement cold spray technology across all  four shipyards, which makes implementing the best practice or lesson  learned more timely. Additionally, officials from one depot told us that they  use public-private partnerships to bridge gaps for systems that lack  access to the necessary data rights to conduct maintenance on the  systems. Our February 2019 report identified additional steps DOD is  taking to mitigate challenges related to intellectual property, especially  software sustainment. First, our prior work found that DOD is in the  early stages of addressing a statutory provision for DOD to (1) develop  policy on the acquisition or licensing of intellectual property; and (2)  establish a cadre of intellectual property experts to help support the  acquisition workforce on intellectual property matters. Second, in our  prior work, we reported that DOD officials we spoke with emphasized that  there are situations in which the data rights needed may not be known  until years into sustainment and that it would be useful if data rights could  have a pre-negotiated price and be an option as part of the initial contract.  Such an option would give the government the right, but not the  obligation, to purchase the data rights at the pre-negotiated price if  needed in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The sharing and implementation of best practices and lessons among the  17 depots is crucial to sustaining military readiness by ensuring that the  military services can regularly maintain critical weapon systems and  return them to the warfighter for use in training and operations.  Successful collaboration of maintenance best practices and lessons  learned across military services, private industry, and academia is  increasingly essential as DOD operates, and thus needs to maintain,  weapon systems. DOD shares best practices and lessons learned among  the depots through a variety of venues, including networking, working  groups, and benchmarking. However, DOD has communication  challenges, including a lack of awareness of many sharing venues, which  may hinder the ability of the depots to share best practices and lessons  learned. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has not created, shared,  or maintained a comprehensive and updated list of all depot-specific DOD  sharing venues (i.e., working groups) that includes points of contact.  Without a centralized list and points of contact, it is unclear what groups  exist and who to contact to participate, which may impede sharing of best  practices and lessons learned. Further, while the Army stated it  established lessons learned organizations for sharing materiel best  practices and lessons learned, it did not maintain them due to  organizational restructuring and resource constraints.

To ensure that the survey  questions were clear, comprehensible, and technically correct, we  conducted expert reviews of our draft survey with four subject matter  experts with knowledge and experience in auditing DOD depots. We also  conducted two pre-tests of our draft survey with the depot commanders of  Anniston Army Depot and Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex,  respectively.During each pre-test, conducted by teleconference, we read  the instructions and each survey question aloud and asked the depot  commanders to tell us how they interpreted the question. We then  discussed the instructions and questions with each depot commander to  identify any problems and potential solutions by determining whether (1)  the instructions and questions were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms  we used were accurate, (3) the survey was unbiased, and (4) the survey  did not place an undue burden on the depot officials completing it. We  noted any potential problems and modified the survey based on feedback  from the subject matter experts and depot commanders, as appropriate.  We sent a fillable survey and a cover email to 17 depots on May 29,  2019, and asked them to complete the survey and email it back to us by  June 14, 2019. We closed the survey on July 3, 2019.

To select our  sample, we considered variation in geographic location, military service  representation, and types of weapon systems maintained. At these sites,  we conducted group discussions with individuals across the depot to gain  insight into their roles in sharing best practices and lessons learned.  Qualitative data analyses were conducted by our staff who have subject  matter expertise to identify themes and select examples of best practices  or lessons learned shared through collaboration with another depot.
