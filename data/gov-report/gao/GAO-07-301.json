This funding, along with technical assistance, has helped to make improvements on a variety of specific interoperability projects. However, states that GAO reviewed had generally not used strategic plans to guide investments toward broadly improving interoperability. Further, no national plan was in place to coordinate investments across states. To its credit, DHS has required states to implement a statewide plan by the end of 2007, and DHS has recently been required to implement a National Emergency Communications Plan. However, no process has been established for ensuring that states' grant requests are consistent with their statewide plans. Until DHS takes a more strategic approach to improving interoperable communications--such as including in its decision making an assessment of how grant requests align with statewide communications plans--progress by states and localities in improving interoperability is likely to be impeded. Until recently, the private-sector coordinating body responsible for developing Project 25 standards--a suite of national standards intended to enable interoperability among the communications products of different vendors--has made little progress. Although one of the eight major subsets of standards was defined in the project's first 4 years (from 1989 to 1993), from 1993 through 2005, no additional standards were completed that could be used to develop Project 25 products. Specifications for three additional subsets of standards were defined over the past 2 years. However, ambiguities in the published standards have led to incompatibilities among products made by different vendors, and no compliance testing has been conducted to determine if these products are interoperable. Nevertheless, DHS has strongly encouraged state and local agencies to use grant funding to purchase Project 25 radios, which are substantially more expensive than non-Project 25 radios. As a result, states and local agencies have purchased fewer, more expensive radios that still may not be interoperable and thus may provide few added benefits. Until DHS modifies its grant guidance to provide more flexibility in purchasing communications equipment, states and localities are likely to continue to purchase expensive equipment that provides them with minimal additional benefits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Emergency \u201cfirst responders\u201d\u2014personnel such as firefighters, police  Emergency \u201cfirst responders\u201d\u2014personnel such as firefighters, police  officers, and ambulance services who are the first to arrive at the scene of  officers, and ambulance services who are the first to arrive at the scene of  an emergency\u2014are supported by a variety of public safety agencies,  an emergency\u2014are supported by a variety of public safety agencies,  including 911 call center staff and other local, state, and federal  including 911 call center staff and other local, state, and federal  authorities.

It is important to note that the goal of being able to communicate when  necessary and authorized is not the same as being able to communicate  with any other individual at any time\u2014a capability that could overwhelm  the communications infrastructure and would likely impede effective  communication and response time.", "Different first responder groups each have different professional practices,  public safety missions, emergency response procedures, communication  protocols, and radio frequencies.

These systems typically consist of  handheld portable radios, mobile radios, base stations, and repeaters.  Handheld portable radios are typically carried by public safety personnel  and tend to have a limited transmission range. Mobile radios are often  located in vehicles and use the vehicle\u2019s power supply and a larger  antenna, providing a greater transmission range than handheld portable  radios. Base station radios are located in fixed positions, such as public  service access points or dispatch centers, and tend to have the most  powerful transmitters. A network is required to connect the different base  stations to the same communications system. Repeaters are used to  increase the effective communications range of handheld portable radios,  mobile radios, and base station radios by retransmitting received radio  signals. Figure 1 below illustrates the basic components of a land mobile  radio system.", "The transmissions between the elements of a land mobile radio system  consist of electromagnetic waves that propagate along designated  frequencies of the radio spectrum. Each communications link uniquely  occupies a specific frequency or set of frequencies for as long as  information is being transmitted. The radio spectrum is a fixed, limited  resource that is shared among government and nongovernment entities for  many uses in addition to public safety communications, such as television  broadcasting, AM/FM radio, and aeronautical radio navigation. Most public  safety agencies use their allocated frequencies for voice communications  but are increasingly using their portion of the spectrum to support more  advanced technologies, such as data, imagery, and video transmissions.  The specific frequency bands allocated to public safety agencies are  shown in figure 2.", "Major frequency ranges that are used for public safety communications  include the very high frequency (VHF) range and the ultra high frequency  (UHF) range. VHF signals travel farther than UHF signals and thus are  useful in suburban and rural areas. However, they generally cannot  penetrate building walls very well. In contrast, UHF signals are more  appropriate for denser urban areas as they penetrate buildings more  easily, and it is less critical that the signals be able to propagate for long  distances. The frequencies used by federal agencies are managed by the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, while the  Federal Communications Commission manages state and local  government frequencies.", "Radio systems are classified as either conventional or \u201ctrunked.\u201d  Conventional radio systems have dedicated frequencies\u2014also referred to  as channels\u2014assigned to individual groups of users.

For example, emergency  agencies responding to events such as the bombing of the federal building  in Oklahoma City and the attacks of September 11, 2001, experienced  difficulties in trying to communicate with each other. The 9/11  Commission concluded that communications interoperability problems  contributed to the large number of firefighter fatalities that occurred at the  World Trade Center.", "Historically, first responder communications interoperability has been  significantly hampered by different and incompatible radio systems.  Different technologies and configurations, including proprietary designs,  by different manufacturers have limited the interoperability of public  safety wireless communications systems. These systems have also  operated on different frequencies of the radio spectrum. In particular,  public safety agencies have been assigned frequencies in new bands over  time as available frequencies became congested, and as new technologies  made higher frequencies available for use. Existing radios are unable to  transmit and receive in all of the public safety frequencies, often making  communications between first responders from different jurisdictions  difficult. Additionally, as we have previously reported, there is a need for  better frequency planning and coordination. Further, public safety  agencies have historically planned and acquired communications systems  without concern for interoperability, often resulting in multiple,  technically incompatible systems in operation throughout any given local  jurisdiction.", "A variety of technical approaches have been adopted to help improve  interoperable communications, including the following:    Swapping radios: Agencies maintain a cache of extra radios that they can  distribute during an emergency to other first responders whose radios are  not interoperable with their own. The advantage of this solution is that it  does not require that all existing radios be replaced, an important  consideration when funds to buy new equipment are limited. However,  this approach requires significant logistical support and careful  management to implement successfully.", "Patching: Two or more incompatible radio systems are connected to a  central switchboard-like system that translates a signal sent from one  connected system so that it can be received by any of the other connected  systems. The principal advantage of this solution is that agencies can  continue to use existing systems that would otherwise be incompatible. A  major disadvantage is that patching requires twice as much spectrum  because a patched transmission occupies separate channels on each  connected system.", "Shared channels or mutual aid channels: Agencies agree to set aside a  specific channel or channels for connecting to other incompatible  systems. This approach provides direct interoperable communications and  only occupies one channel per conversation. However, it can cause  congestion since these channels require dedicated frequencies and thus  have limited capacity.", "Shared systems: The use of a single or common radio system\u2014typically a  trunked system\u2014to provide service to most agencies within a region.  Shared systems are the most robust form of interoperability and do not  require dedicated channels. While this approach produces optimal  performance, it can be very expensive, because it generally requires  purchasing all new radios and transmission equipment.  Technologies that can help implement shared systems include the  following:  Internet Protocol based systems: Using the Voice over Internet Protocol,  advanced communications systems can offer the flexibility to transmit  voice conversations over a data network such as the Internet or a private  network.", "Software-defined radios: These are intended to allow interoperability  among agencies using different frequency bands, different operational  modes (digital or analog), proprietary systems from different  manufacturers, or different modulations (such as AM or FM). However,  software-defined radios are still being developed and are not yet available  for use by public safety agencies.", "However, interoperability cannot be achieved solely by implementing  technical solutions. Coordination among different agencies and  governmental entities is also critical. Response to an emergency may  involve all levels of government and many different disciplines, such as  law enforcement organizations, fire departments, emergency medical  services, transportation, natural resources, and public utility sectors. Each  of these agencies is likely to have its own policies, procedures, and  communications protocols when responding to an incident. A simplistic  example is the word \u201cfire,\u201d which to a firefighter means that something is  burning but to a police officer is a command to shoot a weapon. Resolving  such cultural and procedural differences can be challenging.", "Further, the extent to which interoperable communications are needed  among different agencies, disciplines, and levels of government (federal,  state, local, and tribal) varies based on the size, significance, and duration  of an emergency event. Increasing degrees of interoperability may be  needed for (1) routine day-to-day coordination between a few agencies in  a local area, (2) extended operations involving agencies from multiple  jurisdictions working on a larger problem (such as the 2002 sniper attacks  in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area), and (3) a major, large-scale  event that requires response from a range of local, state, and federal  agencies and disciplines (such as major wildfires, hurricanes, or the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001).", "In 2004, we reported that a fundamental barrier to successfully addressing  interoperable communications problems for public safety was the lack of  effective, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and intergovernmental planning.  We recommended that DHS take a number of actions to address this  barrier, such as determining the current status of interoperable  communications across the nation and encouraging states to establish  comprehensive statewide interoperability plans and certify the alignment  of their grant applications with their statewide plans. DHS has taken steps  to address these recommendations.

State  agencies submit proposals to DHS which form the basis for its risk-based  decisions. During the most recent grant allocation process in 2006 for the  Homeland Security Grant Program, each state and territory received a  portion of its grant funding through a base allocation. The remainder of  funds was allocated based on an analysis of risk and need. In fiscal year  2006, the UASI funds were allocated based on risk and effectiveness. DHS  estimated the relative risk of successful terrorist attacks on selected urban  areas, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequences for both asset- based and geographic factors. On the basis of this analysis, it ranked the  UASI areas and identified 35 urban areas as eligible to apply for UASI  funding. In addition, the 11 urban areas that received funding previously,  but were not identified as UASI areas in 2006, have been extended  eligibility for funding for one additional year.

As a result,  the level of interoperability across the state has improved significantly.  First responders in 64 of Florida\u2019s 67 counties are now able to have their  communications patched to each other as needed via the network.  Previously, they had no such infrastructure for achieving interoperability.  However, officials from localities in Florida raised questions about the  long-term sustainability of the network. Each connected jurisdiction must  pay the ongoing costs of their connection to the Florida Interoperability  Network, and smaller jurisdictions are likely to find this unaffordable.  Further, Florida officials remarked that training across the state is still  incomplete. Additionally, in the Miami UASI region, a majority of the  Urban Area Security Initiative funding for interoperable communications  has been used to acquire communications equipment, such as radios, and  interoperability solutions, such as devices that interconnect first  responders on disparate radios, to make improvements in Miami City and  in Miami-Dade County. However, limited UASI funding had been dedicated  to making interoperability improvements in other localities in the Miami  UASI, such as Monroe and Broward Counties.", "Kentucky: Kentucky used a portion of its DHS funding to expand the use  of mutual aid interoperability radio channels that allow agencies on  different communication systems throughout Kentucky to tune to a  dedicated, shared frequency to communicate. Prior to this initiative, first  responders operating on different frequencies were unable to  communicate. Currently, approximately 34 percent of applicable agencies  have signed a memorandum of understanding to commit to using the  mutual aid channels in accordance to standardized procedures. However,  mutual aid channels have limited capacity, and Kentucky has yet to  implement a long-term solution for a statewide voice communications  system that will allow federal, state, and local first responders to  communicate directly as needed. Kentucky has also used DHS funding to  implement a statewide wireless data communications system. The system  provides functionality such as statewide records management, real-time  crime coverage and data collection, and instant messaging. First  responders use mobile data terminals to communicate with each other  and, in many cases, retrieve information from agency databases.  Kentucky\u2019s mobile data network currently has coverage across  approximately 95 percent of the state\u2019s primary and secondary road  systems. Such capabilities were not available to Kentucky\u2019s first  responders prior to this initiative. In the Louisville UASI, local officials  have utilized DHS funding to implement patching mechanisms to connect  different communication systems throughout the region. However,  according to officials, communications channels are frequently congested  because of the amount of patching that needs to be done to connect  responders.", "New York: In New York, DHS funding is generally being utilized by  localities to address local interoperability issues within their counties and  with neighboring counties. For example, Albany County is acquiring a new  interoperable system that connects first responders on many disparate  systems within Albany County and neighboring counties. Prior to this  system, there was no single voice system or network that would allow  incident commanders and first responders to be able to communicate  directly. However, the local solutions do not always incorporate state and  federal systems. For example, the state is using state funds to develop and  implement a separate and incompatible statewide network called the  Statewide Wireless Network, which localities are not required to join.  Albany County, for example, has no immediate plans to connect their new  system to the statewide system because of uncertainties about the  expense and the expected benefits for the county. In the New York City  UASI, local officials have used a portion of DHS funding to implement a  citywide mobile wireless network. This system is intended to provide first  responders throughout the city with high-speed data access to support  large file transfers, including accessing federal and state anticrime and  antiterrorism databases, fingerprints, mug shots, city maps, and full- motion streaming video.", "Oregon: Oregon, in accordance with DHS guidance, has dedicated most of  its DHS funding to local projects that improve interoperability in specific  regions. For example, Jackson and Josephine Counties are jointly  implementing an interoperable communications system. Previously, first  responders in these two neighboring counties relied on indirect means for  establishing interoperable communications, such as radio channels,  patching mechanisms, and a mobile command vehicle equipped with a  cache of radios in different frequencies and a patching device that could  be deployed as needed. However, this new system does not include federal  or state first responders. In addition, limited DHS funding has been utilized  for developing plans for the development of the Oregon Wireless  Interoperability Network. This system is intended to replace state  agencies\u2019 deteriorating systems with a new system. It is also intended to  connect local agencies that continue to use their existing systems to other  local agencies that they do not already have interoperability with. To date,  the development of this system has not been initiated. In the Portland  UASI, DHS funding was used to install repeaters in Columbia County to  enhance interoperability with the other four counties in the urban area.  However, while it has improved the interoperability, not all Columbia  County first responders are able to utilize this solution. Therefore, the  UASI funding was also used to purchase a supply of reserve radios\u2014 referred to as a cache\u2014that can be shared.", "Table 3 shows the amount of DHS funding states and localities have  received and examples of what the money has been used for."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Lack of Statewide Plans Has Contributed to Limited Strategic Use of DHS Funding", "paragraphs": ["According to SAFECOM guidance, interoperability cannot be solved by  any one entity alone and, therefore, an effective and interoperable  communications system requires a clear and compelling statewide strategy  focused on increasing public safety effectiveness and coordination across  all related organizations. A statewide interoperability plan is essential for  outlining such a strategy. Such a plan should establish long-term  objectives but also include short-term solutions that help incrementally  achieve sustainable solutions to the long-term objectives. Thus,  establishing long-term plans helps ensure that near-term solutions are  consistent with the end goal.", "The narrow and specific use of DHS funding in the states we reviewed can  be traced in part to the lack of statewide plans; interoperability  investments by individual localities have not been coordinated toward  achieving a broader goal for the state. For example, Kentucky, which has  received grant funding totaling approximately $50 million since fiscal year  2003 according to DHS, has not yet developed a statewide  communications plan, although in January 2007, officials stated that they  had begun developing a plan. While Kentucky has recently begun working  to assess how best to address statewide needs, to date, grant reviewers at  the state level who are in charge of disbursing DHS grant money to  localities have had limited means for determining whether funding  requests for equipment and training were compatible with statewide  interoperability goals. For example, evaluators were required to assess  aspects of request proposals such as whether they fully addressed the  measurable objectives expected for a new wireless communication system  and whether they addressed how the applicant agency would  communicate with other public safety and/or public service organizations  at the local, state, and federal levels. However, the available criteria do not  provide the evaluators with an overall statewide strategy that the  evaluators could use to assess whether the localities\u2019 proposal is aligned to  it. As a result, the equipment and activities that localities have purchased  have tended to address short-term voice communication solutions for  local interoperability problems while long-term, statewide solutions have  not been addressed.

Until DHS takes  a more strategic approach to improving interoperable communications,  such as including in its decision making an assessment of how grant  requests align with statewide communications plans, and conducts a  thorough assessment to identify strategies to mitigate obstacles between  federal agencies and state and local agencies, states and localities are  likely to make limited progress in improving interoperability. Additionally,  until DHS plans another round of full-scale exercises that provide UASI  areas with sufficient planning time, the robustness and effectiveness of  UASI plans will be limited.", "The SAFECOM program has had a limited impact on improving  communications interoperability among federal, state, and local agencies.  The program\u2019s limited effectiveness can be linked to poor program  management practices, such as the lack of a plan for improving  interoperability across all levels of government, and inadequate  performance measures to fully gauge the effectiveness of its tools and  assistance. The recent establishment of the OEC creates an opportunity  for DHS to improve program management practices among formerly  separate component organizations, including SAFECOM.

However, it is no longer a goal for SAFECOM.  DHS also  stated that since 90 percent of the public safety infrastructure is owned,  operated, and maintained by local jurisdictions, state and local  interoperability is a higher priority. However, our review has shown that in  major incidents such as a terrorist attack, a major hurricane, or wildland  fire, federal, state, and local first responders will need to interoperate in  order to respond effectively to the incident.

Figure 8 is a depiction of the interoperability  network concept as currently envisioned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local Approach", "paragraphs": ["Local agencies use a wide range of radio frequencies and communication  technologies and have various strategies and solutions to improving  interoperability. In particular, Marion County uses analog UHF and VHF  systems; and trunked, as well as conventional radios. Officials stated that  they have limited interoperability with state and federal agencies and that  they, therefore, maintain a cache of 30 radios available to share, when  needed. Additionally, they can use a mobile command unit that can be  deployed to any area and contains another cache of radios.", "In the Portland UASI, four of the five counties use 800 MHz, analog,  trunked radio systems that provide direct interoperability among those  four counties. The fifth county is on a separate VHF system. They have  installed equipment to improve the interoperability with this fifth county.  Additionally, to provide interoperability with the fifth county and other  agencies outside the UASI area, the officials use mechanisms such as a  mobile trailer to patch calls and loan radios from its cache of radios.", "Jackson County agencies generally use conventional, VHF, analog radio  systems. Officials indicated that although two of the cities within the  county are digitally capable, their first responders use the analog mode  due to the fact that many of their neighboring jurisdictions do not have  digital radios. In order to interoperate with jurisdictions on different  systems, they use common radio channels, patching mechanisms, as well  as a mobile command vehicle that is equipped with a cache of radios in  different frequencies and a patching device. In addition, Jackson County  and Josephine County are developing a communications system that  connects the two counties."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, John de Ferrari, Assistant  Director; Neil Doherty; Richard Hung; Tom Mills; Shannin O\u2019Neill; Karen  Talley; Amos Tevelow; and Jayne Wilson made major contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
