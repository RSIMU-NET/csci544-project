RNs are relied on to deliver inpatient care, but VA medical centers (VAMC) face RN recruitment and retention challenges. VAMCs use a patient classification system (PCS) to determine RN staffing on inpatient units by classifying inpatients according to severity of illness to determine the amount of RN care needed. GAO reviewed VAMC inpatient units for (1) the usefulness of information generated by VA's PCS; (2) key factors that affect RN retention; and (3) factors that contribute to delays in hiring RNs. GAO performed a Web-based survey of all VAMC nurse executives; interviewed VA headquarters officials and VAMC nursing officials, and conducted RN focus groups at eight VAMCs visited by GAO. The findings of GAO's survey are generalizable to all nurse executives; however, findings from the focus groups at the eight VAMCs are not generalizable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VAMC nursing officials--nurse executives who are responsible for all nursing care at VAMCs and nurse managers who are responsible for supervising RNs on VAMC inpatient units--GAO interviewed reported that although VA inpatient RNs are required to input patient data into VA's PCS, they do not rely on the information generated by PCS because it is outdated and inaccurate. These nursing officials noted that VA's PCS does not accurately capture the severity of patients' illnesses or account for all the nursing tasks currently performed on inpatient units. Because of the shortcomings of VA's PCS, nurse managers use data from a variety of sources to help set RN staffing levels for their inpatient units. At four of the eight VAMCs GAO visited, nurse managers told GAO that they set RN staffing levels for their inpatient units by adhering to the historical staffing levels that had been established for the units. Three VAMCs GAO visited set their RN staffing levels using data on the RN staffing levels found in inpatient units in other hospitals with similar characteristics. VA reported it is proposing to develop a new RN staffing system. However, VA has not developed a detailed action plan that includes a timetable for building, testing, and implementing the new nurse staffing system. VA nursing officials reported that VA's ability to retain its RNs is adversely affected by two main factors. First, inpatient RNs reported that they spend too much time performing non-nursing duties such as housekeeping and clerical tasks. Second, even though VAMCs were authorized in 2004 to offer RNs two alternate work schedules that are generally desired by nurses--such as working three12-hour shifts within a week that would be considered full-time for pay and benefits purposes--few nurse executives reported offering these schedules; therefore, few RNs work these schedules. Specifically, according to nurse executives GAO surveyed only about 1 percent of many inpatient units offered alternate schedules and less than 1 percent of RNs actually worked these schedules. The availability of flexible work schedules, for example, working eight 10-hour shifts over a 2-week period, are more widely available among VAMCs but are still limited, according to GAO's survey of nurse executives. Nursing officials and RNs noted other factors affecting retention such as reliance on supplemental staffing strategies--for example, RN overtime--and insufficient professional development opportunities. Both VA nurse executives and nursing officials identified limitations in VA's process for hiring RNs and VA-imposed hiring freezes and lags as major contributing factors causing delays in hiring RNs to fill inpatient vacancies at VAMCs. VA nursing officials reported that hiring freezes and lags at VAMCs and delays resulting from limitations in VA's hiring process can discourage prospective candidates from seeking or following through on applications for employment at these facilities. Although VA has recently taken steps to address some of the factors that are reported to contribute to RN hiring delays, it is too early to determine the extent to which these steps have been effective in reducing hiring delays"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employed almost 43,000  registered nurses (RN) who provided care to veterans in VA medical  centers (VAMC) across the country. RNs are the largest group of health  care providers employed by VA\u2019s health care system, and VA relies on the  services provided by these nurses. Maintaining its RN workforce is critical  to VA\u2019s provision of care to its veteran population. Studies in general have  shown, for example, that a shortage of RNs, especially when combined  with increased patient workload, can adversely affect patient outcomes  and therefore the quality of care patients receive. Hospitals with lower  levels of RN staffing have been shown to have higher rates of adverse  events such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. Conversely, an  increase in RN staffing has been associated with a reduction in adverse  patient care events and with better quality outcomes such as fewer  infections.", "To ensure adequate staffing at VAMCs, Congress passed legislation in 2002  requiring VA to develop a national staffing policy, including a policy on  nurse staffing. The law required that VA establish a policy on the staffing  levels and expertise required to provide care to veterans at VAMCs. The  need for a new nurse staffing system was also highlighted in 2004 when  the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report that raised  concerns about the adequacy of RN staffing levels on VA\u2019s inpatient units  and identified instances in which bed closures or diversions of patients to  other inpatient facilities in the community resulted in part because of  inadequate staffing. The VA OIG further found that staffing challenges at  VAMCs resulted from the lack of a consistent staffing methodology and a  lack of effective recruitment and retention strategies. To address the  staffing issues raised in the OIG report and in light of the 2002 law, VA  committed to design and implement a new nurse staffing system, which it  has not yet completed. As noted in the 2004 VA OIG report, to avoid  inadequate RN-staffing levels and the consequences for patient care, two  issues are important: determining the right number and skill mix of RNs  required to care for veterans, and recruiting and retaining a sufficient  supply of RNs to meet required staffing levels.", "In determining the right number and skill mix of RNs needed to care for  patients on inpatient units, nurse managers in hospitals typically consider  various factors, including the number of patients and their care needs  based on the seriousness of their illnesses, experience and qualifications  of the RN staff, availability of support services such as housekeeping and  patient transport, and budgetary factors. In considering these factors,  many hospitals use a patient classification system (PCS) as a key tool to  help nurse managers estimate the amount of nursing care needed by  inpatients. By using such a system, nurse managers can more accurately  and consistently predict RN staffing. Over time, more of the patient care  at VAMCs has shifted from inpatient to outpatient settings, and veterans  are older and sicker and therefore have more intensive nursing care needs.  Like other hospitals with inpatient care units, the VA has a PCS that is  intended to be used to help determine appropriate RN staffing levels to  meet the nursing care needs on VAMC inpatient units. Established in the  1980s for use by its VAMCs, VA\u2019s PCS is a computer-based system that is  designed to predict the RN staffing levels needed on inpatient units based  on patient acuity, which is a measure of the type and severity of illness.  Specifically, VA\u2019s PCS produces an estimate of RN hours per patient day  (HPPD) needed by inpatient units to care for their patients. The PCS  estimates are based on data that is entered into the PCS system on a daily  basis on the number of patients in each unit and each patient\u2019s level of  acuity. This estimate can then be used to set RN staffing levels.", "With respect to retaining the RNs it currently employs and recruiting new  RNs, VA faces substantial challenges. In congressional testimony in 2007, a  VA official discussed the challenges the department faces in retaining RNs  in VA\u2019s workforce, in part, because many VA RNs are nearing retirement  eligibility age. VA data show that in fiscal year 2005, 13 percent of VA\u2019s  RNs were eligible for retirement, and VA projects this number to increase  to 22 percent by 2012. According to the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), flexible work schedules allow workers to balance their work and  personal commitments. To enhance retention of VA RNs, the Congress  passed legislation authorizing VA in 2004 to allow its VAMCs to offer RNs  two alternate work schedules that would allow RNs either to work three  12-hour shifts per week (and get paid for 40 hours) or work 9 months each  year with 3 months off (and get paid 75 percent of their salary year round).", "Further, VA, like other health care providers, also faces challenges  recruiting new RNs in order to maintain its RN workforce levels. In its  2007 to 2011 workforce succession strategic plan, VA identified recruiting  RNs as its top recruitment priority, and in 2007 congressional testimony, a  VA official reported that the department had taken steps to streamline  VA\u2019s hiring process to address delays in filling vacant RN positions. VA\u2019s  focus on recruiting RNs has occurred in the context of a nationwide RN  shortage, which has further exacerbated VA\u2019s RN recruitment challenges.  For example, the Health Resources and Services Administration\u2014an  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014has  projected that by the year 2020, 44 states will experience a shortage of  nurses, and that by 2020, the nation\u2019s RN shortage will grow to more than  one million nurses.", "This report provides information on current RN staffing practices on  inpatient units at VAMCs. We specifically discuss (1) how useful the  information generated by VA\u2019s PCS is for determining RN staffing levels on  inpatient units, (2) key factors that VAMC nursing officials and RNs  identify that affect RN retention on inpatient units, and (3) factors that  VAMC nursing officials identify as contributing to delays in hiring RNs to  fill vacant positions.", "To fulfill our objectives, we conducted a Web-based survey of VAMC nurse  executives and interviewed VA headquarters officials in the Office of  Nursing Services (ONS), VAMC nursing executives, VAMC inpatient unit  nurse managers, and VAMC human resources (HR) officers. In addition,  we conducted inpatient RN focus groups at eight VAMCs, obtained data as  of April 2008 on the number of VA RNs who use alternate work schedules,  interviewed representatives of state hospital associations, and reviewed  and analyzed industry and agency reports and studies. For the purpose of  this report, we use the term VAMC nursing officials to include VAMC nurse  executives and inpatient unit nurse managers. In conducting the Web- based survey, we surveyed all VA nurse executives at VAMCs. The survey  was sent to 140 VAMC nurse executives and obtained a 63 percent  response rate, which allows us to generalize the results to all nurse  executives at VAMCs. Based on our review of the completed surveys, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In  selecting VAMCs as sites to conduct our interviews and focus groups, we  judgmentally selected eight VAMCs located in Denver, Colorado; Houston,  Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Portland, Oregon;  Seattle, Washington; Tampa, Florida; and Togus, Maine. We selected these  VAMCs in order to include in our review the various types of inpatient  units found at these medical centers such as intensive care, surgery, and  medicine units. At the eight VAMCs we visited, 219 inpatient RNs from  three shifts (day, evening, and night) attended the focus groups. Attendees  at our focus groups included RNs of different ages, nurse experience  levels, and length of tenure at VA. The results of our analyses at these  VAMCs are not generalizable because the VAMCs selected are not  necessarily representative of all VAMCs. The information presented in our  focus group summaries accurately capture the opinions provided by the  inpatient RNs who attended the focus groups at the eight VAMCs we  visited. However these opinions cannot be generalized to all inpatient RNs  at the eight VAMCs we visited or to all inpatient RNs at VAMCs.", "We performed a systematic review of the completed Web-based survey of  VA nurse executives to assess the reliability of the data obtained from the  survey. We checked each survey for problems such as key questions left  unanswered, patterns of skipped questions, unclear written responses, and  out of scope entries. We also assessed the reliability of data obtained from  VA headquarters officials related to the number of VA RNs who use  alternate work schedules. We contacted VA headquarters officials, who  provided information on the quality checks they performed on these data.  Based on our review and the information provided to us from VA officials,  we determined that the data we used in our report were adequate for our  purposes. For a detailed description of our scope and methodology, see  appendix I. Selected results from our survey and a summary of responses  from our focus groups are provided in appendix II and appendix III. We  conducted this performance audit from May 2006 through September 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["RNs, along with other nursing support staff, provide care to patients on  inpatient units at VAMCs. VA RNs are responsible for assessing and  providing care to patients, administering medications, documenting  patients\u2019 medical conditions, analyzing test results, and operating medical  equipment. To obtain an RN license, an individual must complete a nursing  education program, meet state licensing requirements, and pass a nursing  licensing examination. Several types of clinical and ancillary support staff  assist RNs in caring for patients on inpatient units. Nursing support staff\u2014 such as licensed practical nurses (LPN) and nursing assistants (NA)\u2014 perform nursing duties such as recording patient vital signs and assisting  with bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene. In addition, ancillary support  staff perform housekeeping, patient transport, and food service duties.  Clinical support staff\u2014such as lab technicians\u2014also assist RNs in their  patient care duties, for example, by drawing and testing blood or  performing electrocardiograms (EKG).", "Recognizing that developing and maintaining a strong cadre of RNs at  VAMCs is vital to providing high quality of care to our nation\u2019s veterans,  the Congress and VA have both made efforts to better ensure that RN  staffing levels at VAMCs are appropriate and to enhance recruiting and  retention of RNs. These efforts include:    To improve RN staffing, retention and job satisfaction, and patient  outcomes, VA is actively encouraging its medical centers to take part in a  nationwide program called the Magnet Recognition Program\u00ae. This  program was developed by the American Nurses Credentialing Center  (ANCC) to recognize health care organizations that provide nursing  excellence and quality patient care. In order to attain Magnet\u2122 status,  hospitals must meet certain requirements, including requirements related  to staffing practices and quality monitoring. Some research indicates that  facilities that have attained Magnet\u2122 status have better patient outcomes,  significantly higher percentages of baccalaureate-prepared nurses, and  higher nurse job satisfaction rates. As of 2008, three VAMCs have attained  Magnet\u2122 status, four VAMCs have completed the application process, and  22 VAMCs are in the process of applying for Magnet\u2122 status.", "With respect to recruiting and hiring, VA has taken several actions. For  example, in 2007, VA launched the VA Nursing Academy, a program  designed to develop a pool of RN candidates for employment in VAMCs.  Similarly, VA\u2019s Learning Opportunities Residency program is designed to  attract baccalaureate nursing students to work as RNs at VAMCs upon  graduation. VA also has several other initiatives to enhance the  educational preparation of its health care staff and scholarships for  current employees pursuing degrees in nursing. These initiatives, which  serve as recruitment and retention tools, include an education loan  repayment program and scholarships for employees seeking health care  careers. In August 2007, a VA Recruitment Process Redesign Workgroup  made recommendations to redesign the recruiting and hiring of health  care practitioners within VA, including RNs. The work group analyzed  VA\u2019s hiring process and identified barriers and delays in hiring. The work  group\u2019s findings and recommendations included a timeline for nurse  hiring. As discussed later in this report, VA is in the process of  implementing actions recommended by this work group.", "To enhance recruiting and retention of RNs at VAMCs, the Congress  passed legislation in 2004 authorizing two alternate work schedules for  RNs employed by the VA. One of these alternate schedules allows RNs to  work three 12-hour shifts that are considered a 40-hour work week for pay  and benefits purposes. The other alternate work schedule allows RNs to  work full-time for 9 months with 3 months off duty within a fiscal year and  be paid 75 percent of the full-time work rate for each pay period of that  fiscal year. In addition to these alternate work schedules, executive  branch government agencies\u2014including the VA\u2014are authorized by OPM  to offer flexible work schedules. A flexible work schedule is an 80-hour  biweekly basic work requirement that allows an employee to determine  his or her own schedule\u2014arrival and departure times\u2014within the limits  set by the agency.

VA headquarters officials in the Office of Nursing Services  (ONS) and VA\u2019s OIG also reported that PCS has significant limitations. In  2004, VA\u2019s OIG also recommended that VA develop a new standardized  nurse staffing methodology capable of accurate staffing estimates and VA  concurred with the OIG\u2019s recommendation. According to nursing officials  we interviewed, VA\u2019s PCS was developed in the 1980\u2019s based on time and  motion studies of RNs conducted over 20 years ago; as a result, the  information the system produces does not account for all the tasks  currently performed by RNs on inpatient units. For example, VA\u2019s PCS  does not account for certain recent RN tasks\u2014such as the administration  of certain intravenous medications or monitoring of a patient\u2019s abnormal  heart activity\u2014that were once limited largely to intensive care units that  cater to sicker patients but are now performed on other inpatient units.  Similarly, VA\u2019s PCS generates estimates that do not reflect tasks  associated with VA\u2019s computerized bar code medication administration  (BCMA) system that was fully implemented in 2003, more than a decade  after the development of VA\u2019s PCS. These RN tasks include tracking,  monitoring, and reporting medication administration performed using the  BCMA on an inpatient unit.", "VAMC nursing officials also told us that VA\u2019s PCS produces inaccurate  data with respect to patient acuity levels, which in turn can generate  erroneous HPPD estimates. Specifically, a key piece of data VA nurses  enter into the VA PCS is the acuity level for each patient on an inpatient  unit. To do this, RNs use one of five PCS categories, with category 1  representing patients requiring the lowest level of care and category 5 the  highest level of care. Nursing officials we interviewed at VAMCs we visited  and officials with VA\u2019s ONS reported that VA\u2019s PCS does not accurately  capture the actual acuity level of patients on inpatient units  According to VAMC nursing officials we interviewed, nursing staff at  VAMCs are required to classify patients by acuity level on a daily basis  using VA\u2019s PCS. However, nursing officials reported that classifying  patients by acuity level using the PCS is not a productive use of their time  because the information output from the PCS is not useful for RN staffing  purposes. In addition, officials with the VA OIG and ONS told us that the  information contained in VA\u2019s Computerized Patient Record System  (CPRS)\u2014concerning a patient\u2019s illness, medical condition, and  treatments\u2014is not integrated with, or available within VA\u2019s PCS when  nurses assess and assign patients to one of the five acuity levels.", "VA\u2019s ONS is proposing to convene an interdisciplinary team\u2014consisting of  headquarters and field staff\u2014to develop a more effective RN staffing  system for VA by 2012, according to VA\u2019s Chief of Nursing Services. The  Chief told us that the new RN staffing system will include a database that  reflects up-to-date nursing tasks as well as information from patients\u2019  computerized medical records, and that this database will also be used to  evaluate the effectiveness of nursing care at VAMCs. The Chief also  reported that as part of the new RN staffing system, VA may upgrade or  replace its PCS. In developing a new or upgraded PCS, VA needs to ensure  that all current nursing tasks and patient acuity are accurately captured.

Results from the survey  show that nurse managers typically consider a combination of data to  estimate both the number of RNs and the RN skill levels their inpatient  units require. The survey results also show that the types of data most  commonly used by inpatient unit nurse managers across VAMCs are the  average number of patients typically cared for on the unit, HPPDs, the  acuity level of patients on the unit, the number of RN staff historically  assigned to the unit, and the ratio of RNs to patients on the unit.", "Nurse managers at the eight VAMCs we visited told us how they use  various data to help set RN staffing levels for their inpatient units.

A VA official told us that hiring  freezes and hiring lags are used for budgetary reasons or to manage  personnel costs.

For  example, when there is an unplanned absence, nurse managers use  supplemental staffing strategies or operate the units short-staffed. Forty\u2013 eight percent of nurse executives reported that inpatient units worked  short-staffed at some point, and 41 percent of nurse executives reported  that mandatory RN overtime was used as a supplemental staffing strategy.  Nurse managers reported that in some instances, they get an RN to work a  part of the next shift or the entire next shift, or float staff as a result of a  staff vacancy, staffing shortages, or an increase in the number of  inpatients on the unit. Moreover, one nurse manager reported that  \u201cburnout\u201d can stem from a reliance on supplemental staffing strategies.", "According to RNs who attended our focus groups, insufficient professional  development and training opportunities for inpatient RNs are RN-retention  issues.

Nursing officials identified  three areas of limitations\u2014delays in securing necessary approvals from  medical center resource boards to fill RN vacancies; poor coordination  between nursing and HR officials involved in hiring; and a shortage of  experienced and well-trained HR officials. Collectively, these factors  result in significant delays in filling RN vacancies. We surveyed VAMC  nurse executives to estimate the time it typically takes VAMCs to fill RN  vacancies and found that 44 percent reported it took 45 to 80 days to fill  inpatient RN vacancies at VAMCs in 2007 compared to the 24- to 45-day  target timelines that VA set in 2007. One-third of nurse executives we  surveyed reported that it took more than 80 days to fill RN vacancies at  their VAMCs. In contrast, local hospitals usually hired RNs in less than   21 days, according to nursing officials we interviewed. Nursing officials  during our site visits reported that these delays contribute to VAMCs\u2019  losing applicants to local hospitals as well as reliance on supplemental  staffing strategies to maintain RN staffing levels on inpatient units.", "Delays in gaining approval to fill RN vacancies: One factor VAMC nursing  officials identified as contributing to hiring delays is the period of time  during which officials wait to get approval from a VA medical center  resource board\u2014an internal board that controls the medical center\u2019s  budget and the number of authorized staff positions\u2014to fill an RN  vacancy.", "Poor coordination between nursing and HR officials: VAMC nursing  officials identified poor coordination between nursing and HR officials as  another factor that contributed to delays in filling RN vacancies. HR  officials are involved in handling application paperwork, interviewing RN  applicants, scheduling screening activities such as physical examinations  and background checks, and verifying employment references. VA\u2019s  Recruitment Process Redesign Workgroup recently issued several  recommendations aimed at improving coordination in filling RN vacancies.  Poor coordination can occur when nursing officials must wait for  information from HR officials before a job offer can be made to an  applicant. For example, VAMC nursing officials we interviewed stated that  they may have to wait a few weeks for HR officials to determine an  appropriate salary estimate based on an applicant\u2019s educational  qualifications and experience, a process that must take place before a job  offer can be made to an RN applicant. In our survey, about 65 percent of  nurse executives cited the inability to provide a salary estimate promptly  to an applicant as one of the primary reasons they lost RN applicants to  competing, non-VA hospitals. Poor coordination can also occur during the  pre-employment process. According to nursing officials, RN applicants  may make multiple visits to the medical center for pre-employment  physicals and verification of state licenses because these activities have  not been coordinated into one visit for the RN applicant.", "Shortage of experienced HR officials: VA headquarters and VAMC nursing  officials identified the shortage of experienced and well-trained HR  officials who process RN employment applications and hiring paperwork  as a factor that contributes to RN hiring delays. VAMC nursing officials we  interviewed reported that VAMCs have suffered a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of  experienced HR officials through retirement or attrition. VA noted in its  recent workforce succession strategic planning report that it faces a  challenge caused by a \u201clack of trained HR staff and expertise in the area of  human resources.\u201d VA\u2019s ability to address delays in filling RN vacancies  depends, in part, on its ability to retain experienced HR officials and to  recruit and train new ones. According to VA, new HR recruits must acquire  a good grasp of the breadth and complexity of HR knowledge and skills  required by the federal government and VA.

About  one-third of the nurse executives we surveyed indicated that these hiring  freezes contributed to delays in the hiring process, and nearly half of nurse  executives reported that a lag in hiring also contributed to delays that may  dissuade potential applicants. Some nursing officials we interviewed told  us that once the word has spread in the local community that the VAMC  has imposed a hiring freeze, the medical center has difficulty recovering  from the effects of the hiring freeze.

These recommendations may address some of the factors that contribute  to delays in filling RN vacancies. According to VA officials, these changes  are designed to increase flexibility and efficiency without weakening the  process of screening candidates\u2019 professional credentials. Collectively,  VA\u2019s recent changes consist of ways to (1) complete applicant interviews  and physical examinations on the same day, (2) make a job offer to an RN  applicant within 30 days, (3) allow use of electronic education transcripts  in lieu of paper transcripts sent through the mail, and (4) create additional  HR positions to help meet VA\u2019s future needs as its experienced HR  officials retire.", "In addition to implementing VA\u2019s nationwide efforts, nursing officials at  eight VAMCs we visited cited a number of steps that have been taken at  individual VAMCs to increase efficiency and reduce hiring delays. These  steps include:  Improved communication and coordination between HR and nursing  officials during the hiring process in various ways. For example, seven of  the eight VAMCs we visited reported that they improved coordination and  communication between nursing and HR officials involved in hiring RNs  by better tracking an applicant\u2019s paperwork and coordinating other pre- employment activities, including scheduling interviews and physical  examinations on the same day when possible. In addition, two of the eight  VAMCs have increased their interactions through regular meetings.  Nursing officials at two VAMCs we visited told us that they have  implemented a program called \u201cOn the Floor in 24,\u201d an effort which allows  the VAMC to bring an RN on board within 24 days by better coordinating  and expediting steps in the hiring process.", "Hiring RNs under temporary appointments until screening activities such  as physical examinations, drug tests, and background checks are  completed. Nursing officials at five VAMCs we visited told us that they  have hired some RNs on a temporary appointment status until screening  activities are completed. Moreover, another VAMC we visited implemented  a program called \u201cOn-Demand Hiring,\u201d established by nursing and HR  officials, which involves hiring an RN with the aid of a nurse recruiter.  VAMC nursing officials reported that the nurse recruiter may then provide  the applicant a salary range; afterwards, HR officials become involved by  making a job offer to the RN applicant and proceed with screening  activities such as arranging to have fingerprints taken for a background  check, scheduling a physical examination, and drug tests. Seven VAMCs  we visited implemented a computerized process to expedite the  verification of RNs\u2019 professional credentials.", "Hiring a nurse recruiter as a contact point between RN applicants and HR  officials to handle application paperwork.

First, it is important that the department expeditiously proceed  with planning and implementing a nurse staffing system that accurately  reflects patient needs and RN workload requirements. The inaccuracy of  VA\u2019s current PCS limits its usefulness in helping to establish adequate RN  staffing levels and reveals a larger problem\u2014VA does not have a viable  system to accurately determine the RN staffing needs for inpatient units.  VA recognizes the need to develop a new standardized nurse staffing  system capable of accurate staffing estimates. Without an accurate nurse  staffing system, VAMCs and nursing officials do not have good information  as a basis for making sound judgments about the RN staffing needs of  inpatient units and often must use supplemental RN staffing strategies to  match RN staffing levels with patient care needs. Excessive use of  supplemental RN staffing strategies can in turn adversely impact RN  morale and job satisfaction and may lead to RN retention problems.", "Second, as the number of VA RNs who may consider retirement increases  and the nation continues to face an RN shortage, it is important that VA  maximize its ability to hire new RNs, as well as to retain RNs that it  currently employs. To help address RN retention at VAMCs, VA can use  OPM-authorized flexible work schedules and congressionally authorized  alternate work schedules; however, VAMC nursing officials reported  limited availability and use of alternate and flexible schedules. VA\u2019s ability  to maintain its RN workforce could be enhanced if it can expeditiously  hire qualified applicants and offer more flexible and alternate work  schedules for RNs. Further complicating VAMC RN staffing problems is  that RNs often perform non-nursing tasks that lead to job dissatisfaction.  Where RNs must perform non-nursing tasks because ancillary and nursing  support staff are not available, it is important that nurse managers have  the ability to adjust unit RN staffing levels so that nurses have adequate  time to perform these duties. Developing a staffing approach that can  accurately determine adequate RN staffing levels may also support VA\u2019s  ability to help RNs balance their work and personal commitments through  the offering of alternate work schedules to RNs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the ability of VAMCs to determine RN staffing levels needed  for inpatient units and to recruit and retain inpatient RNs, we recommend  that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health  to implement the following three recommendations    develop a detailed action plan that includes a timetable for building,  testing, and implementing the new nurse staffing system;    ensure that the new nurse staffing system provides RN staffing estimates  that accurately account for both the actual inpatient acuity levels and  current nursing tasks performed on inpatient units and adequately take  into account the level of ancillary and nursing support that is available on  VAMC inpatient units; and    assess the barriers to wider availability of alternate and flexible work  schedules for RNs at VAMCs and explore ways to overcome these barriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, VA concurred with our findings  and recommendations and provided a description of actions that it plans  to take to address our recommendations.", "Regarding our first recommendation\u2014that VA develop a detailed action  plan for building, testing, and implementing a new nurse staffing system\u2014 VA stated that it has long recognized the need for an automated and data- driven nurse staffing methodology and noted some of the challenges in  developing and implementing such a system.

A nurse executive is a member of the executive  leadership team at a VAMC and is responsible for all nursing care  delivered at the VAMC. The survey was sent to 140 VA nurse executives  and obtained a 63 percent response rate, which allows us to generalize the  results to all VA nurse executives at VAMCs. To field the survey, we  contacted a VA headquarters official in the Office of Nursing Services  (ONS) to obtain a list of VAMC nurse executives, and the official provided  email addresses for the nurse executives. See appendix II for the results of  our VA nurse executive survey. To gain further information on RN staffing,  we interviewed VAMC nurse executives and VAMC inpatient unit nurse  managers responsible for determining inpatient RN staffing levels at eight  VAMCs we visited located in Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas;  Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Portland, Oregon; Seattle,  Washington; Tampa, Florida; and Togus, Maine.
