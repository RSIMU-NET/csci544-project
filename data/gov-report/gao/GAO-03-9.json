Through work at various levels within the organization, this report on the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)--and its two companion studies on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (GAO-03-258) and the Veterans Health Administration (GAO-03-10)--records (1) what managers considered successful efforts at creating linkages between planning and performance information to influence resource choices and (2) the challenges managers face in creating these linkages."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Administration for Children and Families' (ACF) budget and performance planning processes are clearly related but are not fully integrated. Budget and planning align more closely after ACF sends the budget request and performance plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for review. Finally, unlike budget formulation, budget execution largely occurs in the regional offices, where resource allocation is often driven by program performance. Officials in ACF's Head Start, Child Support Enforcement, and Community Services Block Grant programs described three general ways in which decisions at the programmatic level are influenced by performance: (1) training and technical assistance money is often allocated based on needs and grantee performance, (2) partnerships and collaboration help ACF work with grantees towards common goals and further the administration's agenda, and (3) organizing and allocating regional staff around agency goals allow employees to link their day-to-day activities to longer-term results and outcomes. While ACF must overcome some difficult barriers to further budget and performance integration, it has begun to identify and implement mitigation strategies for some of these issues. For example, ACF conducts much of its work through nonfederal service providers, which often limits the extent to which ACF can influence national performance goals and can seriously complicate data collection. To address this, ACF has successfully collaborated with providers to develop national performance goals and build data collection capacity. This has also raised awareness of the importance of collecting and reporting performance data uniformly. Since ACF programs are often only part of a network of long-term federal, state, and local efforts to address serious health and social concerns, attributing a particular outcome to a particular program can be difficult. ACF has addressed this issue by using program evaluations to help isolate the effects of a particular program, strengthening the link between outputs and outcomes, and identifying intermediate outputs and outcomes to help measure program performance. The organizational culture change necessary to support the linkages between resources and results takes time, but change is beginning to take root. Some managers and staff reported a noticeable difference in the use and understanding of outcomes versus outputs, and outcome-based performance agreements for managers and staff are becoming more common."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the past decade, Congress and the Executive Branch have sought to  improve federal management and instill a greater focus on results. Through  enactment of a number of major management reforms, Congress has  created a statutory framework with the Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) as its centerpiece. One of GPRA\u2019s major  purposes is to encourage a closer and clearer linkage between planning,  performance\u2014i.e., results\u2014and the budget process. Each administration  takes a slightly different approach to implementing results management.  Improving the integration of budget and performance is a high priority  initiative included in the President\u2019s Management Agenda. A central piece  of that is the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) new diagnostic  tool, the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART). PART is designed to  provide a consistent approach to reviewing program design, planning, and  goals development as well as program management and results. OMB  expects to use PART assessments in considering department and agency  budget submissions for the fiscal year 2004 President\u2019s Budget request to  Congress.", "In a number of different reports to the Congress, GAO has examined  different aspects of the resources-to-results linkage. A series of three  reports described agencies\u2019 progress over a 4-year period in linking  performance plans, budgets, and, in the most recent report, financial  statements. We found that between fiscal years 1999 and 2002, agencies  progressed significantly in showing a direct link between expected  performance and requested program activity funding levels through  structural changes or cross-walks\u2014the first step in defining the  performance consequences of budgetary decisions. We concluded that  additional effort was needed to more clearly describe the relationship  between performance expectations, requested funding, and consumed  resources. Furthermore, we said that the uneven extent and pace of  developing these relationships were reflective of mission complexity and  differences in operating environments across the government. Finally, we  observed that describing the planned and actual use of resources in terms  of measurable results was an essential long-term effort that would take  time and adaptation on the part of all agencies.", "In another approach to defining performance and resource integration, we  developed a framework of budget practices that we believe can contribute  to an agency\u2019s capacity to manage for results. We viewed these practices as  desirable dimensions of budgeting that could be implemented in many  different ways to reflect the characteristics and circumstances of a  particular agency. Both our assessments of performance and budget  account alignments and the framework of budget practices have led to the  next phase of work and the subject of this report. This report\u2014one of a  group of three\u2014looks at the resources-to-results link from the perspective  of agency managers charged with making the linkage happen.", "The objectives of this report on Administration for Children and Families  (ACF) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its  two companion studies on the Veterans Health Administration within the  Department of Veterans Affairs and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,  are to document (1) what managers in these three agencies considered  successful efforts at creating linkages between planning and performance  information to influence resource choices and (2) the challenges they face  in doing so. For the purposes of this report, we take a broad view of  performance information\u2014possible sources include GPRA, program  evaluations, grant applications, and statistical information about program  funding and grantees. We neither evaluated their choices nor critiqued their  processes. Instead, we asked managers to describe when and how planning  and performance information was included in the budget cycle, to explain  what strategies were used and why, and to provide evidence that there was  a related programmatic effect. A third purpose was to show that there are  multiple ways to get at these linkages, and that there can be successful  applications even if progress in budget and performance integration is  uneven.", "Budgeting is and will remain an exercise in political choice, in which  performance can be one, but not necessarily the only, factor underlying  decisions. However, efforts to infuse performance information into  resource allocation decisions can more explicitly inform budget  discussions and focus them\u2014both in Congress and in agencies\u2014on  expected results, rather than on inputs. We believe that showcasing  agencies\u2019 successes with and challenges in integrating budgeting and  planning may prove useful to other agencies; Congressional authorizing,  appropriation, and oversight committees; and OMB in the shared goal of  strengthening the link between program performance and resources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["ACF, a major program office within HHS, is responsible for programs that  promote the economic and social well-being of low-income and  disadvantaged children, families, and their communities. Headed by the  Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, ACF\u2019s seven program  offices and various staff offices offer policy direction, information  services, and funding through a variety of grants to third-party service  providers such as state and local governments and nongovernmental  organizations. Of the more than $45 billion provided for in fiscal year 2002,  over 85 percent went to just five program areas administered by third  parties: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ($16.7 billion), Head  Start ($6.5 billion), Foster Care and Adoption Assistance ($6.6 billion),  Child Care ($4.8 billion), and Child Support Enforcement and Family  Support ($4 billion).", "ACF\u2019s work is driven by the four GPRA goals indicated in its annual  performance plan: (1) increase economic independence and productivity  for families, (2) improve healthy development, safety, and well being of  children and youth, (3) increase the health and prosperity of communities  and tribes, and (4) build a results-oriented organization. As we have  previously reported, ACF linked these goals to its funding request by  aggregating and consolidating program activities from multiple budget  accounts and linking the associated funding requests to sets of  performance goals, which it referred to as \u201cobjectives\u201d of these four main  goals. In fiscal year 2002, ACF\u2019s leadership also established nine key  priorities to provide targeted opportunities for collaboration on mission- critical crosscutting activities.", "As figure 1 shows, ACF is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has 10  regional offices within five broad geographic areas of the country known as  hubs. Regional offices contain about 50 percent of all ACF employees and  are responsible for administering most of ACF\u2019s programs and ensuring  that program and administrative funds are spent in accordance with ACF  goals and initiatives. Headquarters is responsible for setting policy, budget  formulation, strategic planning, and legislative affairs. Table 1 describes in  further detail the responsibilities of key offices and positions as they  pertain to strategic planning and budgeting as well as regional- headquarters operations and relations.", "As a subordinate unit in HHS, ACF is not an independent entity; its  processes, activities, and goals must be seen in the context of the general  strategic direction in which HHS is moving. For example, HHS\u2019 requirement  that its agencies provide performance information with agency funding  requests for fiscal year 2003 is an outgrowth of the GPRA planning process  and recent attention to the need for timely and reliable performance  information with which to evaluate programs. In keeping with its One  Department initiative, HHS\u2019 desire to present a more standardized  performance plan for fiscal year 2004 requires its constituent agencies to  reduce their total number of performance measures by at least 5 percent  while simultaneously increasing their outcome measures by at least 5  percent. The need to respond effectively to these and other priorities and  initiatives has led to changes in ACF\u2019s work planning processes and/or how  performance is evaluated in the regional offices we visited.", "Many factors affect the nature of ACF\u2019s budget and planning process. For  example, much of ACF funding, including to some extent, how  \u201cdiscretionary\u201d funds may be spent, is directed by statute. For example,  because of the prescriptive nature of the funding requirements in the Head  Start authorizing legislation, nearly 20 percent of the $338.5 million  increase Head Start received in fiscal year 2002 was designated for teacher  salary increases. This limits the extent to which ACF controls how Head  Start funds are spent.", "Further, over 70 percent of ACF\u2019s budget funds mandatory programs in  which funding levels are determined by formula for disbursement or  eligibility rules regardless of program performance. However, ACF officials  told us that, as required by HHS, ACF has taken steps to connect resources  and performance by linking the incremental request to key ACF priorities  and goals. While this does not explicitly lead to performance-based  budget decisions, linking funding requests to expected performance is, as  we have previously reported, the first step in defining the performance  consequences of budget decisions. As discussed later in this report, it is  during budget execution, for mandatory and discretionary programs alike,  that ACF\u2019s use of training and technical assistance (T/TA) and travel funds  and use of staff resources currently show the strongest link between  resources and results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address the objectives in this report, we selected two regional offices  (Region VI, Dallas, and Region IX, San Francisco) and three diverse  programs (Head Start, Child Support Enforcement, and the Community  Services Block Grant) that represent ACF\u2019s self-described best examples of  how managers used performance information to inform the resource  allocation process.

However,  formulation does not begin with evaluating past program performance to  inform the upcoming year\u2019s budget request and performance plan. Budget  and planning become more closely aligned when the budget request and  annual performance plan are sent to the HHS budget and planning staff for  review.

For  example, last fiscal year ACF discovered that a Head Start grantee  overspent its prior year federal Head Start funds. ACF explained to the  grantee that it was unable to provide the grantee with additional funding  for its Head Start program. Because the grantee could not run its program  without receiving additional funds, ACF recommended that the grantee  consider relinquishing the grant. As a result of ACF's recommendation, the  grantee voluntarily relinquished its program due to financial  mismanagement.  Dallas officials estimate that the federal government can  save as much as $50,000 in legal fees for each grant that is relinquished  versus terminated. Further, ACF officials told us, Head Start children and  families experience less disruption in service delivery when a grant is  relinquished rather than terminated.", "San Francisco officials told us that they are beginning to use the new Grant  Application and Budget Review Instrument (GABI) in conjunction with  other information to compare actual grantee performance to performance  targets.

In theory, these payments  are intended to reward states that meet the performance measures. As a  result, states have an incentive to work towards the GPRA measures and  ACF can report on state and program performance and explicitly show  what level of program performance was achieved nationally for the level of  funding in a particular year.", "Even though a large percentage of funds is driven by formula or eligibility,  strategies that leverage resources from a variety of sources and knowledge  about grantees\u2019 capacity to deliver services can lead to more informed  resource allocation decisions during budget formulation and execution.  For example, the administration planned to request funds in fiscal year  2002 for a new program for maternity group home services. ACF had  internal discussions as to the legislative authority under which the funds  should be requested. Both the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHY)  and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs were  mentioned as possible candidates. Although at first TANF seemed the more  natural choice, ACF ultimately requested the program funding under RHY  based on information from regional officials about the state agencies and  community providers in their regions as well as their ability to successfully  administer these programs\u2014information that headquarters staff may have  been too far removed from program implementation to observe.  Theoretically, this money will be better spent and program goals are more  likely to be achieved than if the funds were appropriated through TANF.", "The Dallas and San Francisco regional offices also described several  performance-informed resource allocation decisions that occurred during  budget execution. For example, the Personal Responsibility and Work  Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 gave tribes the opportunity to run  their own CSE programs. These programs are directly related to ACF\u2019s first  and third GPRA goals: to increase economic independence and  productivity for families (goal 1) and to increase the health and prosperity  of communities and tribes (goal 3). ACF has begun to direct resources to  activities that will prepare tribes to fully support these programs. For  example, Dallas officials told us that Dallas\u2019 record for achieving results  and its experience with CSE tribal demonstration projects and special  improvement projects were part of the reason it received additional funds  from headquarters in fiscal year 2001 to develop and pilot a training  curriculum for new federal tribal child support specialists; the program  was subsequently approved by the CSE program office for use nationwide.", "In fiscal year 2002, the West-Central Hub again received additional funds to  assess tribal/state court relationships within the Hub and identify best  practices to be shared nationwide.", "Regional staff works towards achieving ACF goals and moving the  administration\u2019s agenda forward by expending T/TA resources on assisting  state and local programs that are already providing compatible services.  For example, in Texas, Dallas staff helped the state incorporate the  administration\u2019s \u201cGood Start, Grow Smart\u201d early literacy initiative into the  training curriculum for the CIRCLE initiative, an existing early literacy  training program for Texas Head Start teachers. Similarly, San Francisco  staff worked with Arizona state officials to tap into existing programs in  Arizona aimed at increasing young fathers\u2019 financial responsibility for their  children and use these programs as a vehicle to support the  administration\u2019s initiatives to promote responsible fatherhood and healthy  marriages. Arizona has implemented a program that helps couples learn  relationship, communication, and listening skills to promote healthy  marriages.", "Through participation in and representation on interagency councils, ACF  seeks to use its resources more efficiently to achieve its goals that cut  across HHS and other federal departments. For example, the San Francisco  region participates in the Region IX Federal Regional Council (FRC), an  interagency body that seeks to foster efficiency and effectiveness through  intergovernmental and public/private partnerships to achieve  administration goals and priorities. After determining that several of its  federal agency members were planning community events to address the  administration\u2019s faith-based initiative, FRC established a working group to  share information and coordinate activities, and ACF engaged with other  FRC members to organize a youth seminar on the topic.", "ACF also participated in FRC task forces to address economic  development, social, health, and environmental issues in North Richmond  and East Palo Alto, two low-income communities in the San Francisco  region. These efforts have resulted in community improvements such as  expanded Head Start services, employment of TANF recipients, and  holiday toy and book drives for needy children. Region 9 officials also  participated in community meetings in both areas and provided  information on ACF funding opportunities, programs, and services in North  Richmond. In addition, San Francisco is involved in an FRC initiative  focused on employment and economic development strategies in the San  Joaquin Valley in support of the administration\u2019s effort to move the welfare  reform agenda forward. Similarly, the HHS Regional Managers\u2019 Council  helps HHS agencies and components in Region IX work together to achieve  crosscutting goals.
