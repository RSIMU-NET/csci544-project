The stations' operations are funded in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a nongovernmental entity that receives federal appropriations. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a nonprofit organization funded by fees paid by member licensees and CPB grants, operates a satellite-based interconnection system to distribute programs to local stations. These programs are created by producers inside public television and by outside production entities. Public television stations broadcast national and local programs and provide a variety of nonbroadcast services to their communities. PBS prime-time and children's programs account for the majority of broadcast hours, to which stations add instructional and local programs tailored to meet the needs and interests of their communities. Nonbroadcast services include educational, civic engagement, health, and emergency-alert services. In 2005, public television licensees reported annual revenues of $1.8 billion, of which 15 percent came from federal sources and the rest from a variety of nonfederal sources including individuals, businesses, and state and local governments. Federal funds help licensees leverage funds from nonfederal sources. Thirty of 54 licensees GAO interviewed said that cuts in federal funding could lead to a reduction in staff, local programming, or services. In general, smaller licensees receive a higher percent of revenue from federal sources and 11 said that cuts in federal support might force the station to shut down. Substantial growth of nonfederal funding appears unlikely. The one area with growth potential is major gifts, which many licensees are pursuing with help from CPB. Program underwriting by businesses and foundations has traditionally been an important source of revenues. A few licensees believe that these revenues could be increased if restrictions on the content of on-air underwriting acknowledgments were relaxed. Many licensees, however, believe that this would go against the noncommercial character of public television and could cause a loss of funding support from other sources. Public television sometimes benefits from business ventures associated with its programs, but these opportunities are infrequent and do not generate significant revenue. Public television does not have the financial resources to invest heavily in the cost of program production to secure a larger share of any resulting back-end revenues. Moreover, the sale of merchandise associated with a program generally returns only a small percentage of the retail price to the program's producer and investors, as is also true for commercial television programs. GAO provided CPB and PBS with a draft of the report for their review and comment. CPB and PBS agreed with the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["From its beginnings in the 1950s with a small number of noncommercial  educational stations focused on formal instruction, public television has  evolved to encompass a wide range of cultural, educational, entertainment,  news, and public affairs programming offered by 349 stations nationwide.  Public television stations were built and continue to operate as nonprofit,  community-based organizations, largely funded by nonfederal sources.  Funding for programming and station operations has been a continuing  issue, given that public broadcasting operates outside of the advertising- based business model that sustains commercial television. A key point in  the evolution of public television came with the Public Broadcasting Act of  1967, which amended the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the  Communications Act) to establish the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  (CPB) and authorized federal funding to help support public television\u2019s  operations. The Communications Act\u2019s current \u201cdeclaration of policy\u201d  states that it is in the public interest of the federal government to ensure  that all citizens have access to \u201cpublic telecommunications,\u201d of which  public television is a part. The Communications Act also states that it is in  the public interest to encourage the development of programming that  involves creative risks and addresses the needs of unserved and  underserved audiences, particularly children and minorities.", "In the decades since the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act, the  position of public television as the primary source of alternative  programming to the commercial broadcasting networks (such as ABC,  CBS, Fox, and NBC) has been challenged by the emergence of cable and  satellite television providers. These companies offer their paying  subscribers dozens of channels\u2014including some devoted to subjects that  are mainstays of public television\u2014such as nature, travel, cooking, and  drama. In fact, most households today receive television service from a  cable or satellite company. However, in an era of media consolidation in  commercial television, public television stations continue to be locally  owned and operated by community-based nonprofit organizations,  universities, and state and local governments. Another important change in  the media environment is the digital television (DTV) transition, a federal  mandate requiring stations to transition from analog to digital transmission  of television signals. Digital transmission not only greatly improves picture  and sound quality, but it also enables stations to use the radiofrequency  spectrum more efficiently, thereby allowing stations to simultaneously  broadcast multiple program channels (known as multicasting) and offer  auxiliary services such as datacasting (the transmission of text, graphics,  software, and Web pages to designated users). Many public television  stations see the DTV transition as an opportunity to increase their program  offerings\u2014such as formal instruction and coverage of local government\u2014 and also enhance the services they can offer to their communities, such as  emergency communications.", "Against this backdrop of change, the issue of how to fund public  broadcasting continues to be a concern for policymakers and public  television\u2019s stakeholders, as it has been for decades. Without the financial  base of advertising that sustains commercial television, public television  stations acquire their operating revenues from diverse private and public  funding sources, including voluntary membership gifts by viewers; support  from organizations and businesses that underwrite programming and  station operations; funding from private foundations; funding from  universities; and local, state, and federal government funding. In addition,  several signature public television programs have become cultural icons  and have given rise to separate business ventures, such as sales of books,  DVDs, and children\u2019s toys, that provide additional sources of revenue.  Given these alternative sources of funding, some policymakers and public  television stakeholders have debated the continued role of federal funding  and whether public television can survive and prosper with less direct  federal support.", "In response to your request, this report examines the funding and operation  of public television. Specifically, this report provides information on (1) the  organizational structure of public television, (2) the programming and  other services that public television provides, (3) the current funding  sources for public television, (4) the extent to which public television  stations are increasing their nonfederal funding support and developing  new sources of nonfederal support, and (5) the extent to which public  television benefits financially from business ventures associated with  programming and how this compares with commercial broadcasters.", "To respond to the objectives of this report, we interviewed officials from  CPB, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the  Department of Commerce, and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). For  the first objective, we reviewed existing literature on the foundation and  current structure of public broadcasting and reviewed relevant provisions  of the Communications Act and FCC regulations. For the second, third, and  fourth objectives, we interviewed officials from 54 of the 173 public  television licensees; we selected licensees according to their type of  license, total revenues and percentage of total revenues derived from  federal funding, and by the size of the television market where the licensee  operates. We also interviewed officials from the Association of Public  Television Stations, a membership organization representing public  television stations; the Department of Education; the Federal Emergency  Management Agency of the Department of Homeland Security; the Ford  Foundation; the National Science Foundation; the Rural Utilities Service  (RUS) of the Department of Agriculture; and the Urban Institute.  Additionally, we analyzed 177 licensees\u2019 revenue sources, membership, and  programming using CPB\u2019s Stations Activities Benchmarking Study (SABS).  (In 2005, the year for which we have SABS data, there were 177 public  television licensees; currently, there are 173 licensees.) SABS is a data- gathering mechanism through which licensees provide information  annually on their finances and operations. To assess the reliability of SABS  data, we reviewed relevant information about the database, including the  user manual and a data dictionary, and we interviewed CPB officials and  subcontractors for information on data quality assurance procedures. We  also performed electronic testing to detect obvious errors in completeness  and reasonableness. We concluded that the SABS data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. For the fifth objective, we  interviewed officials from organizations producing programming for public  television, including David Grubin Productions, Ken Burns (Florentine  Films), HIT Entertainment, Insignia Films, Lumiere Productions,  Scholastic, Sesame Workshop, WETA (Arlington, Virginia), WGBH  (Boston), and WNET (New York); the Independent Television Service;  commercial broadcast networks and cable channels, including A&E  Television Networks, Fox, National Geographic Channel, Nickelodeon, and  NBC; and several experts. We also reviewed the relevant media economics  literature and materials provided by CBS.

However, public television is not a single, national  entity, nor is it identical with PBS. Public television evolved from a handful  of noncommercial educational television stations in the early 1950s to 349  stations today that reach virtually every household in the United States.  The stations were built and continue to operate as independent, nonprofit,  community-based entities offering a mix of broadcast programming and  outreach activities to their local communities. The late 1960s saw the  creation of national-level organizations to support and interconnect the  stations: CPB and PBS. With producers and distributors supplying a wide  variety of educational, cultural, entertainment, and public affairs programs,  public television today remains a locally based enterprise with a national  reach that serves the particular needs and interests of the communities  within the range of each station."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Television Stations Are Independent, Locally Based Entities That Serve Their Communities", "paragraphs": ["Public television began as, and continues to be, a largely decentralized  enterprise, with ownership and control of the stations maintained at the  state or local level.

These reserved  channels were to serve \u201cthe educational and cultural broadcast needs of  the entire community to which they are assigned.\u201d It was left to the local  communities to construct and operate television stations to use these  reserved channels, since neither FCC nor the Congress provided funds for  this purpose.", "The growth of public television\u2019s station infrastructure has been the work  of decades, as civic leaders, universities, and state and local governments  have marshaled funding and operational support from public and private  sources to establish and operate noncommercial educational television  stations to serve their communities. Today, there are 349 such stations,  owned and operated by 173 licensees, which reach at least 98 percent of  households that have a television. Figure 1 illustrates the pace of station  growth since 1953, when KUHT (Houston, Texas) became the first  noncommercial educational television licensee.", "Most public television stations broadcast under the terms of  noncommercial educational television licenses granted to them by FCC.  Under FCC rules, licensees of public television stations must be one of the  following (see fig. 2):  A nonprofit educational organization, such as a university or local  school board. For example, WKYU (Bowling Green, Kentucky) is a  university licensee.", "A governmental entity other than a school, such as a state agency.

Each  station\u2019s management decides what programs to air to meet the particular  needs and tastes of their communities. In addition, stations are typically  involved in a variety of nonbroadcast activities that extend their  educational and cultural mission and support their local communities. As  noncommercial educational licensees, the stations must support  themselves financially without reliance on the airing of commercial  advertising. Both the stations\u2019 activities and the various funding streams  that support them are discussed in more detail in later sections of this  report.", "The stations\u2019 overall operational expenses vary greatly depending on a  station\u2019s size and specific activities. In fiscal year 2005, these expenses  ranged from $881,106 for WVUT (Vincennes, Indiana) to $174,474,123 for  WGBH (Boston). Stations incur expenses associated with  construction and maintenance of broadcast towers and transmission   utilities associated with signal transmission;  office and studio facilities;  master control equipment to manage the station\u2019s broadcast traffic (see  fig. 3);  production equipment, such as television cameras;  program production and acquisition fees;  nonbroadcast community outreach activities; and  salaries for station personnel.", "Many stations have formed affinity groups, such as the Organization of  State Broadcasting Executives, the Small Station Association, and the  University Licensee Association, to deal with common concerns. Stations  may also be members of the Association of Public Television Stations, a  nonprofit organization established in 1980 to advocate for public television  interests at the national level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting Provides Federal Support to Stations and Other Public Television Entities", "paragraphs": ["Funding has been a continual concern for public television. As noted  earlier, the channels reserved for noncommercial educational television in  1952 did not come with any federal funding to get the stations up and  running. The first decade of public television saw slow growth in the  number of stations. By 1960, 49 stations were broadcasting. To spur the  construction of stations, the Educational Television Facilities Act of 1962  was enacted to provide the first direct federal funding for station infrastructure. The Educational Television Facilities Act authorized a $32  million, 5-year program of federal matching grants to licensees for  facilities. The program, however, did not cover stations\u2019 operational  expenses. In 1965, the Carnegie Corporation sponsored a commission to  study educational television\u2019s financial needs. As recommended in the  Carnegie Commission\u2019s 1967 report, President Lyndon Johnson proposed,  and the Congress enacted, the Public Broadcasting Act, which amended the  Communications Act to reauthorize funding for facilities and equipment  grants under the Educational Television Facilities Act and to authorize  additional federal funding for public television through a new entity\u2014 CPB.", "CPB was authorized under the Public Broadcasting Act to be established as  a nonprofit corporation to facilitate the growth and development of both  public television and public radio, along with the use of these media for  instructional, educational, and cultural programming. This private  corporation structure was to afford \u201cmaximum protection from extraneous  interference and control.\u201d CPB operates under the provisions of the  Communications Act, and is governed by a board of directors consisting of  nine members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  The Communications Act includes a congressional \u201cDeclaration of Policy\u201d  stating, among other things, that it is in the public interest to encourage the  growth of public radio and television, as well as the development of  programming that involves creative risks and serves the needs of unserved  and underserved audiences, particularly children and minorities. The  declaration also states that public telecommunications services (including  public television and radio) constitute a valuable local community resource  for addressing national concerns and local problems, and that it is in the  interest of the federal government to ensure that all citizens have access to  these services.", "CPB\u2019s main responsibility is distributing congressionally appropriated  funds to benefit public broadcasting (both public television and public  radio). CPB allocates its appropriated funds (which constitute virtually its  entire budget) in accordance with the provisions of the statute. The  statute directs CPB to allocate yearly 6 percent of its appropriated funds  for \u201csystem support\u201d (largely royalty fees, station interconnection costs,  and projects and activities to enhance public broadcasting) and not more  than 5 percent for CPB\u2019s administrative expenses. Of the remaining funds  (about 89 percent), 25 percent is to be allocated for public radio and 75  percent for public television. There is a further division of the funds for  public television: 75 percent is to be made available for distribution to  station licensees and 25 percent for national programming. Because the  distribution formula is defined by statute, changes in CPB\u2019s yearly  appropriation affect both public television and public radio licensees.", "The principal mechanism by which CPB distributes federal funding to  public television licensees is the Community Service Grant program. CPB  currently administers the program by providing each licensee that operates  an on-air public television station with a \u201cbasic\u201d grant of $10,000. In  addition to the basic grant, eligible licensees receive two component grants  in their Community Service Grant\u2014a \u201cbase\u201d grant and an \u201cincentive\u201d grant.  Base grants are determined by the statutory allocations noted above, CPB\u2019s  annual appropriation, the number of licensees eligible for grants, and a  fixed grant funding level set by CPB\u2019s board of directors. Incentive grants  are designed to encourage stations to maintain and stimulate new sources  of nonfederal funding support. Accordingly, the size of an incentive grant  depends on the amount of revenues that an individual licensee raises from nonfederal sources. (See app. II for detailed information on the  components of Community Service Grants.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Public Broadcasting Service Is a Nonprofit Organization That Provides Technical and Programming Support to Stations", "paragraphs": ["One of the goals of the Public Broadcasting Act was to establish a system to  interconnect the individual public television stations for the distribution of  programming. The Communications Act, as amended by the Public  Broadcasting Act, authorizes CPB to assist in the establishment and  development of one or more interconnection systems, but in keeping with  the concept of local control, CPB is expressly prohibited from owning the  interconnection systems or from producing, scheduling, or disseminating  programs. To fill these needs, CPB worked with the stations and other  stakeholders to create PBS in 1969 as an entity for managing an  interconnection system and acquiring and distributing programs. PBS was  established as a private, nonprofit organization made up of licensees of  noncommercial television stations. Today, nearly all public television  licensees have chosen to be members paying assessments for access to  PBS national programming. PBS is governed by a board with a majority of  members representing stations. PBS\u2019s activities and services include the  following:  acquiring and promoting the programs for children\u2019s and prime-time  broadcast that make up PBS\u2019s \u201cNational Programming Service;\u201d  operating a satellite-based interconnection system for distributing  programming to member stations for broadcast to their local  communities;  providing educational services, such as its Web-based TeacherSource;   assisting member stations with fund-raising and development support,  as well as a variety of engineering and technology development issues,  such as the digital transition.", "As a result of agreements with the stations at the time of its creation, PBS  was authorized to coordinate the development of a national program  schedule, but not to produce broadcast programming of its own.  Programming comes from individual public television stations, outside  production companies, and independent producers.

Producers  of programming for public television are both internal to public television,  such as producing stations, and external to public television, such as  outside producers.", "Producing Stations. A small number of the larger public television  stations regularly produce and coproduce programs and series designed for  national audiences that are included in PBS\u2019s National Programming  Service. Examples include WGBH (Boston): NOVA, Mystery!, Frontline,  and Masterpiece Theatre; WNET (New York): American Masters, Great  Performances, and Nature; WETA (Arlington, Virginia): The NewsHour  with Jim Lehrer and Washington Week; and OPB (Portland, Oregon):  History Detectives and The New Heroes. Other public television stations  may, from time to time, produce a show that is chosen by PBS for national  broadcast or by individual stations for local broadcast.", "Local Production. Aside from broadcasting programs developed for a  national audience, stations produce and broadcast their own local  programs that are designed to meet the special needs and interests of their  individual communities. Because program production can be expensive,  the amount of a station\u2019s local production is closely tied to its budgetary  resources and underwriting support from the business community.  Examples of such locally produced programs include WVPT\u2019s  (Harrisonburg, Virginia) farm report, Rural Virginia, and WTTW\u2019s  (Chicago) showcase of local events and people, Chicago Tonight.", "Outside Producers. These producers are not public television entities but  are independent production companies and individual producers who  create programming that is acquired by PBS or individual stations for their  broadcast schedules. One such production company is Sesame Workshop,  the producer of Sesame Street. Although this long-running program has  become strongly identified with public television and PBS, Sesame  Workshop is a nonprofit educational organization. (See app. IV for a  description of Sesame Workshop.) An example of a for-profit production  company is HIT Entertainment, the producer of shows such as Barney &  Friends and Bob the Builder. There are also independent producers of  public television programming, who are generally not affiliated with a  studio, a television station, or a major production company. Ken Burns, for  example, has produced some of public television\u2019s best-known series, such  as The Civil War, Baseball, and Jazz, as well as profiles of notable  Americans, such as Mark Twain and Frank Lloyd Wright. International  producers are another source of programming. British productions, in  particular, have been a regular feature of public television for decades.", "The Independent Television Service (ITVS). In 1988, the Congress  directed CPB to provide adequate funds to an independent television  production service. Pursuant to this mandate, CPB provides annual  funding to ITVS. ITVS funds, distributes, and promotes new programs  developed by independent producers primarily for public television. ITVS  looks for proposals that increase diversity on public television and present  a range of subjects and viewpoints that complement and provide  alternatives to existing public television offerings. An example of ITVS\u2019s  programs include And Thou Shalt Honor. . ., which explores the increasing  role of caregiving for elderly Americans.", "Non-PBS Distributors of Programming. Although PBS is the principal  distributor of children\u2019s and prime-time shows for its member stations,  other distributors also provide stations with programs. One is American  Public Television (APT), which distributes shows such as Lidia\u2019s Italian- American Kitchen and Rick Steves\u2019 Europe.

To a far lesser extent,  stations rely on APT and NETA for nationally distributed programming.  Finally, stations dedicate about 4 percent of broadcast hours to local  programs.", "The DTV transition expands the programming opportunities for public  television stations through multicasting. For example, in the Washington,  D.C., television market, WETA (channel 26) broadcasts 26.1, 26.2, 26.3, and  26.4, or four separate digital video signals in addition to its analog signal,  expanding the amount of programming that WETA can broadcast. Among  the stations we contacted that are broadcasting a digital signal, most are  simulcasting (or repeating) their analog signal on one of these digital  signals. Most stations we contacted that broadcast in digital also provide  additional programming streams such as \u201cPBS HD,\u201d PBS\u2019s high-definition  programming service; \u201cWorld,\u201d an aggregation of PBS and other nonfiction  programs; and \u201cCreate,\u201d lifestyle and how-to programs. In addition, some  stations offer instructional or regional programming. For example, KET  (Lexington, Kentucky) offers two instructional channels for Kentucky  schools and KAMU (College Station, Texas) offers \u201cThe Research Channel.\u201d  KTCA (St. Paul, Minnesota) offers \u201cMinnesota Channel,\u201d which features a  variety of programming that is from or about Minnesota and its close  neighbors, and WFSU (Tallahassee, Florida) provides \u201cThe Florida  Channel,\u201d a C-SPAN-type channel focusing on Florida. Some station  officials with whom we spoke indicated that their future multicasting plans  include providing a broader range of programming that is more tailored to  the needs of their communities. For example, some stations indicated that  they plan to offer additional programming from packaged programming  streams, such as \u201cV-me,\u201d a channel planned for launch in early 2007 that  will feature Spanish language programs on a variety of topics, or \u201cMHz  WORLDVIEW,\u201d which offers international programming. In addition, some  stations plan to create their own programming streams tailored to local  audiences. For example, WYES in New Orleans, Louisiana, is collaborating  with local organizations to develop a tourist-oriented channel, and South  Dakota Public Broadcasting (Vermillion, South Dakota) is working with  local and state organizations to create a channel that would focus on  instructional programming for classroom use during the day and children\u2019s  programs in the evening.", "We identified several types, or streams, of programming broadcast by  public television stations. These streams of programs include PBS non- children\u2019s, children\u2019s, local, and instructional programming. While most  public television stations share some common programming, such as PBS  Primetime and PBS Kids, additional programming choices, such as local  and instructional programming, vary from station to station.", "PBS Programming. Almost all public television stations carry PBS  programming. PBS programming represents about half of the broadcast  hours provided by public television stations and is a cost-effective  approach to acquire and broadcast programming.

Children\u2019s programming constitutes an  important portion of broadcast time, and many station officials told us that  it is one of the strengths of public television. We found that children\u2019s  programming accounts for 16 percent of all program hours broadcast by  public television stations. Children\u2019s programming represents over 40  percent of the weekday programming schedule for many stations. Many  stations broadcast about 8 to 10 hours of children\u2019s programming per  weekday, often beginning before 8:00 a.m. and ending between 5:00 p.m.  and 6:00 p.m. Stations often design their weekday schedule to include  programming oriented toward the prekindergarten age group during the  school day and toward school-age children, after school.", "PBS Kids features nonviolent, curriculum-based content that promotes  skills such as literacy, math, problem solving, and social skills. Several  prominent examples of children\u2019s programming include Sesame Street,  which encourages the development of preschool level skills, such as those  needed for reading, writing, math, and science; Between the Lions, which  fosters literacy skills among 4 to 7 year olds; Maya & Miguel, which  encourages children to appreciate other cultures and builds understanding  of English among 6 to 11 year olds; and Cyberchase, which promotes math  problem-solving skills among 8 to12 year olds. PBS and member stations  leverage the concepts taught in these and other children\u2019s programs via  Web resources, including lesson plans, activities, parent guides, book  suggestions, and links to other resources related to the skills promoted in  specific programs.", "Local Programming. Most public television stations produce and  broadcast some local programming in order to meet specific needs of their  audiences. On average, local programming represents about 4 percent of  total broadcast hours for public television stations. Some stations we  contacted indicated that they would like to provide more local  programming, but that local production is expensive. Although local  programming does not constitute a large percentage of the programming  provided by public television, some stations we contacted emphasized the  unique nature of public television\u2019s local programming or the importance of  local programming to their communities.

Funding from other sources, especially  foundations, is generally restricted to specific projects or programs,  potentially limiting the licensee\u2019s ability to respond to changing needs.  Second, licensees incur relatively minimal costs to secure federal funding,  compared with funding from other sources. Finally, some licensees noted,  federal funds are a vehicle to attract other funds. For example, WVPB  (Charleston, West Virginia) said that the state government considers  federal funding a source of matching support, and the state government is  willing to appropriate state funds because the licensee will also receive  federal funding.", "If federal funding were reduced or eliminated, some licensees would need  to reduce their level of service.

Twelve licensees with whom we spoke  noted that another source of funds does not exist that could fill the void  that would be left if federal funding were reduced or eliminated. Eleven  licensees said that the station would discontinue operations if federal  funding were eliminated; these were generally smaller licensees in smaller  television markets. However, a larger number (30) said that they would  need to reduce staff, local programming, or services.

According to a study prepared by  McKinsey and Company for CPB, increased competition for gifts from a  growing number of nonprofit entities, more viewer choices, and less  familiarity with public television are expected to contribute to declines in  the number of members and basic membership revenue. Additionally, the  free-rider problem hinders the ability of licensees to acquire members. The  free-rider problem refers to the tendency of individuals not to contribute to  a service that they can receive free of charge; in the case of broadcast  television, individuals can view the station\u2019s signal without contributing.  Furthermore, officials at licensees with whom we spoke said that  increasing the number of members and basic membership revenue is  difficult for the following reasons:  Competition for charitable gifts has increased because more nonprofit  entities are seeking gifts.", "Viewers have many more choices since the advent of cable and satellite  television and as a result are less familiar with public television than in  the past.", "In some areas, a poor local economy limits the number of viewers that  are able to make charitable gifts.

Acquiring major gifts requires one-on-one contact  with current and potential donors, instead of the retail-oriented effort  associated with on-air membership campaigns. The major giving initiative  also requires station management and staff alter their traditional roles. For  example, the station manager must focus not just internally on station  operations, but also externally on fund-raising. The capacity building  program consists of four elements:  team leadership meetings attended by the station\u2019s chief executive  officer, board members, and chief development officer to involve top  station management;  curricula delivered via Web lectures once a month for 6 months, with  follow-up teleconferences among various station groups to share  experiences;  on-site consulting to help the stations implement their specific plans;   a set of Web-based tools, including (1) information about best practices  and budgeting, (2) on-air spots for station use, and (3) videos to show at  donor gatherings.", "According to CPB, 110 of 177 licensees are participating in the major giving  initiative.

Furthermore, CPB  does not anticipate that increases in major giving revenues will offset  decreases in basic membership revenues for several years.

In a 2003 report for CPB, McKinsey and Company suggested  that underwriting represented a potential source of revenue growth.  Consistent with this assessment, 11 licensees said that underwriting  revenues have increased. Among factors contributing to the increases in  underwriting revenues, licensees cited hiring new staff, implementing a  packaged strategy through which companies sponsor a single program over  an extended period of time, and adding local sports to the programming  schedule. However, eight licensees said that underwriting revenues have  decreased. These licensees cited increased competition for corporate  dollars, a lack of staff or turnover among underwriting staff, and poor  economic conditions in the local area as contributing to the decrease in  their underwriting revenues.", "Among the 54 licensees with whom we spoke, some noted that corporate  consolidation and an increased advertising focus among corporations have  negatively affected underwriting. Twelve licensees said that corporate  consolidation hinders underwriting activities. For example, some licensees  mentioned that corporate offices and facilities have moved from their  service area, thereby eliminating a source of underwriting support.  Similarly, some licensees said that distant corporate headquarters limit the  discretion of local branch operations in terms of underwriting and other  charitable contributions. Twenty-two licensees said that corporations  increasingly adopt an advertising approach to underwriting. Some  licensees note that corporate marketing departments and national  advertising agencies increasingly handle underwriting activities, rather  than corporate philanthropy departments. With the greater emphasis on  advertising, corporations and advertising agencies seek out programming  with high ratings and targeted demographics.", "In response to the changing environment, some licensees favor less  restrictive underwriting regulations and policies. In particular, 11 licensees  favor greater flexibility for on-air underwriting acknowledgments,  including perhaps permitting calls to action and price quotes. The licensees  favoring greater underwriting flexibility serve large television markets or  an entire state. These licensees said that greater underwriting flexibility  would enable the licensee to increase underwriting revenues; would allow corporations to use the same advertisement on commercial  and public television, thereby enabling them to avoid the cost of  developing multiple advertisements;  would not represent a significant change, since underwriting  acknowledgments and pledge drives have already become  commercialized; and  would not threaten the licensee\u2019s mission, because licensees operate as  nonprofit entities and therefore would not focus on low-quality, high- ratings programming.", "In the early 1980s, public television conducted a limited experiment with  greater underwriting flexibility. In 1981, the Congress amended the  Communications Act and established the Temporary Commission on  Alternative Financing for Public Telecommunications to conduct  demonstrations of limited advertising. The amendments authorized 10  public television stations to experiment with paid commercials for 18  months. Following the experiment, the commission concluded that  potential revenues from advertising were limited in scope and that the  avoidance of significant risks to public broadcasting could not be ensured.  However, one licensee with whom we spoke that participated in the experiment said that all sources of its revenues increased, including both  membership and underwriting revenues.", "Among licensees with whom we spoke, 19 oppose greater flexibility. These  licensees said that greater underwriting flexibility  would not generate increased underwriting revenues, since  corporations and advertisers desire programming with high ratings and  a targeted demographic, which some licensees said public television  cannot deliver;  would upset viewers and contribute to a decline in membership support;  could threaten a licensee\u2019s ability to receive financial support from a   would be inconsistent with the mission of public television and could  alter programming decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ancillary Revenues Are a Minor Source of Funding for Many Licensees", "paragraphs": ["Ancillary and miscellaneous revenues represent another nonfederal  funding source.

Broadcast networks typically produce programming for certain  parts of the day internally, including morning shows, news and new  magazines, and sports; daytime, prime-time, and children\u2019s programming  are more likely to be externally produced. Among the three cable channels  we contacted, one relies primarily on internal production while the other  two primarily purchase programming from external suppliers.", "In commercial television, investment in the up-front development and  production of a program influences the relative distribution of back-end  revenues. We were told that the financing and rights associated with a  program are as unique as the program itself, and therefore each financing  and rights structure arrangement is unique. However, the extent of up-front  investment in the development and production of programming greatly  influences the financing and rights structure. Because of the large costs  and risks associated with developing and producing television  programming, entities providing a significant share of the funding and  assuming the financial risk seek and generally receive a greater portion of  the rights to back-end revenues.

The producing stations operate as a production  company, producing programming internally and also coproducing  programming with outside suppliers. Independent producers deliver  programming directly to PBS or producing stations. For example, Ken  Burns, Scholastic, and Sesame Workshop produce programming for public  television.", "Much like their counterparts in commercial television, CPB and PBS  negotiate financing and rights arrangements with producing stations and  independent producers. One academic expert with whom we spoke said  that two factors influence the rights structure: the size of the up-front  investment and the importance of PBS as a distribution outlet for an  outside supplier. For public television as for commercial television, a larger  up-front investment generally leads to a greater portion of the back-end  rights and associated revenues. The importance of PBS as a distribution  outlet is such that, several producers said that they prefer to distribute  their programming through public television. For example, two producers  of children\u2019s programming said they prefer to distribute their programs  through public television because of the high-quality, education-based  programming distributed by PBS and public television. In these instances,  CPB and PBS might receive a more favorable back-end rights arrangement  than the extent of their up-front investment would ordinarily warrant  because these producers desire PBS distribution for their programs.", "In response to criticism about its arrangement with the producer of Barney  & Friends, CPB revised its revenue-sharing policy in 1997. The stated  objectives of the revised policy include ensuring the availability of quality  programming, reflecting consideration of producers\u2019 objectives, and  capturing windfall revenues. To fulfill these objectives, CPB created three  categories of programming, each with a somewhat different rights  structure.", "Children\u2019s Programming. For 15 years, CPB receives a 50/50 share of  the net proceeds from the program, after the producer recoups any  production deficit. For example, the 50/50 share implies that if CPB  provides 25 percent of the project\u2019s cost, CPB receives 12.5 percent of  the net proceeds. The net proceeds represents the revenues less the  expenses associated with producing, marketing, and distributing the  ancillary products and uses. Between years 15 and 20, the producer may  retain CPB\u2019s share of the net proceeds as long as the producer applies  those proceeds to future children\u2019s programs. Otherwise, CPB receives  its share of the net proceeds.", "Major Events. This category includes programs with a production  budget exceeding $500,000 per hour or music, theater, and similar genre  programming.

This category includes all other  programming, which CPB reports would include the majority of its  programming. For 15 years, CPB receives a 50/50 share of the net  proceeds from the program, after a $250,000 threshold. The producer  can retain the $250,000 threshold amount as long as the producer uses  the proceeds for any public television purpose.", "Like CPB, PBS negotiates for back-end rights with producing stations and  independent producers. PBS staff said that the organization does not take a  formulaic approach to rights management. Rather, the rights structure  varies from program to program. In general, PBS holds rights to back-end  revenues in perpetuity. However, several factors influence the percentage  of back-end revenues that PBS receives. According to PBS staff, these  factors include the extent of PBS\u2019s investment in the production, the  program genre and existence of a production deficit, and obligations to  third parties. The program genre is a factor because PBS typically receives  a larger percentage of back-end revenues from children\u2019s programming  than it does from prime-time programming. PBS believes that its  distribution adds considerable value to children\u2019s programming; and  therefore, it possesses greater leverage with producers of such  programming. This allows PBS to negotiate a more favorable rights  structure for children\u2019s programming, compared with prime-time  programming. With prime-time programming, PBS frequently allows  producers to recoup much of the production deficit before PBS begins  sharing the back-end revenues. With children\u2019s programming, PBS  frequently receives a share of back-end revenues proportional to its up- front investment and typically receives these revenues sooner than it would  with prime-time programming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Television Is Unlikely to Realize Significant Back- End Revenues", "paragraphs": ["CPB and PBS both receive back-end revenues.

According to PBS staff, since 2000, PBS has received between $7 million  and $10 million annually from back-end sources. PBS\u2019s back-end revenues  exceed CPB\u2019s because (1) PBS funds a greater percentage of children\u2019s  programming, which more frequently generates back-end revenues; and (2)  CPB allows PBS to retain and reinvest CPB\u2019s share of back-end revenues  earned on many programs that CPB funds through PBS. Thus, in aggregate,  CPB and PBS receive about $7 million to $10 million annually from back- end sources.", "Commercial broadcast networks and cable channels also receive back-end  revenues. According to some networks and cable channels, ancillary  revenues from product sales are not a major source of revenue. Cable  channels rely on advertising and subscriber fees for revenue and do not  depend on ancillary sales for financial sustainability. For example, one  cable channel told us that ancillary product sales represent about 1 percent  of the channel\u2019s total revenues. However, syndication can represent  another source of revenue for broadcast networks.", "Given its statutorily defined mission and limited financial resources, it  would likely be difficult for public television to substantially increase back- end revenues. We identified four constraints to public television\u2019s realizing  significant back-end revenues: (1) relatively few programs are successful,  (2) net proceeds are a small percentage of gross retail sales, (3) public  television does not generally make significant up-front investments in  program development and production, and (4) public television faces  competition in the distribution of programming.", "Few Programs Are Successful. In commercial television, relatively few  programs achieve long-term success. A broadcast network might receive  500 to 800 proposals yearly for new programs, and of these, the network  might place orders for 12 to 14. Furthermore, only about one-third of new  programs return the following year. Thus, we were told that picking a hit is  risky. To earn syndication revenue, a program generally must air for 4  years. Regarding ancillary product sales, we were told that a couple of  programs might yield most of a cable channel\u2019s revenues. Because success  is infrequent and uncertain, commercial television production is a portfolio  business, and a company must have many programs in the pipeline at any  given time to ensure that some are successful.", "Officials from CPB and PBS, as well as major producing stations WGBH  and WNET, said that their organizations do not base funding or  programming decisions on the potential to generate back-end revenues.  Rather, these organizations make funding and programming decisions that  further the mission of public television. As a result, most public television  programs do not generate significant back-end revenues. We were told that  children\u2019s programming and Ken Burns\u2019 productions have the greatest  likelihood of commercial success. However, these programs are anomalies  and are not guaranteed to generate back-end revenues. For example,  WGBH staff mentioned that Between the Lions generates little back-end  revenue, even though it has been successful in attracting viewers. Similar  to the experience of commercial networks and cable channels, PBS staff  said that in 2005, 90 percent of their organization\u2019s back-end revenues came  from just 23 series.", "Net Proceeds Are a Small Percentage of Gross Retail Sales. For both  commercial and public television, we found that the net proceeds to  producers and investors in program-related business ventures are a small  fraction of the retail sales prices. For general merchandise associated with  a television program, such as toys, the producer enters into an arrangement  with one or more manufacturers. The manufacturer produces and  distributes the merchandise and pays the program producer a royalty for  the sale of merchandise associated with the television program. These  royalties are typically 5 to 15 percent of the wholesale price, which is  typically 50 percent of the retail price. Thus, for example, on a $20 sale, the  royalty will typically be $0.50 to $1.50. The difference represents reductions  for manufacturing, distribution, and retail. Figure 7 depicts this  relationship.", "Similar discounts apply to other business ventures associated with  television programs. According to CPB staff, a video distributor generally  pays the producer 15 percent of the wholesale price for video products  associated with a television program. For books, the producer typically  receives between 5 and 10 percent of the retail price. Finally, when a  producer syndicates a television program, the producer usually receives  50 to 65 percent of the sales price, and the syndication agent retains the  remainder.", "In some instances, the producer does not own the underlying intellectual  property associated with the program. For example, Norman Bridwell  created Clifford the Big Red Dog and Marc Brown created Arthur. In these  instances, the authors and owners of the intellectual property must be paid  from the royalty proceeds.", "Public Television Does Not Generally Make Significant Up-front  Investments. In general, CPB and PBS contribute less than 50 percent of  the production budget associated with programming. PBS staff said that  the organization generally provides seed money to producers, who must  leverage these funds with funds from other organizations. From 2000  through 2005, PBS contributed between 22 and 27 percent of the total  production budgets for nationally distributed programs. Producing stations  and independent producers confirmed that CPB and PBS contribute  relatively modest amounts to programming. PBS provided about 25 percent  of WNET\u2019s total production budget over a 3-year period, and PBS\u2019s net  contribution to Sesame Workshop is less than 10 percent of the total  production costs for Sesame Street. Thus, CPB and PBS appear to  contribute less to the total production budget for programming than is  typical in commercial television, where the license fee may cover one-half  to two-thirds of the production costs.", "Since CPB and PBS contribute modestly to up-front program development  and production, the organizations must share the resulting back-end  revenues with other participants. As discussed above, rights to back-end  revenues are positively correlated with the share of up-front investment.  Given their relative contributions to program development and production,  it is not surprising that CPB and PBS share in the rights to back-end  revenues. Because CPB and PBS provide a modest portion of the up-front  program development and production budget, producers must secure the  remaining funds from other sources, perhaps requiring the producers to  establish relationships with many organizations. For example, WNET said  that it cannot fund its productions with just one or two major  participants. Producers may also sell some of the rights to back-end  revenues in return for up-front funding or in-kind support. Finally, some  producers are unable to obtain external funding for an entire program and  thus incur production deficits. In these instances, the back-end revenues  allow the producer to recoup the production deficit. According to PBS and  one producer, most programs are deficit financed.", "Increasing the proportion of up-front investment in programming appears  to be beyond the financial capacity of CPB and PBS and could expose the  organizations to significant risks. First, PBS supplies programming for over  170 public television licensees. To accomplish this, CPB and PBS provide  some funding to producing stations and independent producers, and rely  on these organizations to secure the remainder of the necessary funding.  We were told that CPB and PBS do not have sufficient resources to both  contribute significant amounts to individual programs and ensure adequate  programming for the remainder of the broadcast year. Second, investing in  program development and production involves risks. As noted above,  relatively few programs are successful, and it is difficult to predict which  programs will be successful. Thus, as one broadcast network told us,  television production is a portfolio business in which a few winners offset  losers. Without a significant pool of resources to develop a portfolio of  programming, CPB and PBS could be exposed to significant financial risk if  the organizations made relatively large investments in a small number of  programs. In particular, if the organizations made relatively large  investments in programs and those programs did not generate sufficient  back-end revenues, the organizations might be unable to adequately supply  programming for the remainder of the broadcast year.", "Public Television Faces Competition in the Distribution of  Programming. Even with their modest up-front investments, CPB and PBS  could seek greater rights to back-end revenues; however, it is unclear  whether the organizations could receive greater rights because of the  presence of other distribution outlets. We were told that if CPB and PBS  became too aggressive in seeking rights to back-end revenues, producers  could distribute their programming through alternative outlets, such as  cable channels. For example, Nickelodeon represents an alternative  distribution outlet for children\u2019s programming. In fact, Sesame Workshop  already distributes two programs\u2014the Upside Down Show and Pinky  Dinky Doo\u2014through cable channels.
