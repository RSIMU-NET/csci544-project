These weaknesses were due in part to IRS's inconsistent implementation of its agency-wide security program, including not fully implementing GAO recommendations. The table below shows the status of prior and new GAO recommendations as of the end of its fiscal year (FY) 2015 audit of IRS's information security. GAO concluded that these weaknesses collectively constituted a significant deficiency for the purposes of financial reporting for fiscal year 2015.

According to officials, criminals used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-agency sources to gain unauthorized  access to information on approximately 100,000 tax accounts. These  data included Social Security information, dates of birth, and street  addresses. In an August 2015 update, IRS reported this number to be  about 114,000, and reported that an additional 220,000 accounts had  been inappropriately accessed. In a February 2016 update, the  agency reported that an additional 390,000 accounts had been  accessed. Thus, about 724,000 accounts were reportedly affected.

In our most recent review we determined that IRS had improved access  controls, but some weaknesses remain.", "Identifying and authenticating users\u2014such as through user  account-password combinations\u2014provides the basis for establishing  accountability and controlling access to a system. IRS established  policies for identification and authentication, including requiring  multifactor authentication for local and network access accounts and  establishing password complexity and expiration requirements. It also  improved identification and authentication controls by, for example,  expanding the use of an automated mechanism to centrally manage,  apply, and verify password requirements. However, weaknesses in  identification and authentication controls remained. For example, the  agency used easily guessable passwords on servers supporting key  systems. In addition, while IRS continued to expand the use of two- factor access to its network, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration reported that IRS had not fully implemented unique  user identification and authentication or remote electronic  authentication that complies with federal requirements.", "Authorization controls limit what actions users are able to perform  after being allowed into a system and should be based on the concept  of \u201cleast privilege,\u201d granting users the least amount of rights and  privileges necessary to perform their duties. While IRS established  policies for authorizing access to its systems, it continued to permit  excessive access in some cases. For example, users were granted  rights and permissions in excess of what they needed to perform their  duties, including for an application used to process electronic tax  payment information and a database on a human resources system.", "Cryptography controls protect sensitive data and computer  programs by rendering data unintelligible to unauthorized users and  protecting the integrity of transmitted or stored data. IRS policies  require the use of encryption, and the agency continued to expand its  use of encryption to protect sensitive data. However, key systems we  reviewed had not been configured to encrypt sensitive user  authentication data.", "Audit and monitoring is the regular collection, review, and analysis  of events on systems and networks in order to detect, respond to, and  investigate unusual activity. IRS established policies and procedures  for auditing and monitoring its systems and continued to enhance its  capability by, for example, implementing an automated mechanism to  log user activity on its access request and approval system.

In addition, IRS received an additional $290 million for  fiscal year 2016 to improve customer service, IDT identification and  prevention, and cybersecurity efforts.", "The agency has also taken actions to improve customer service related to  IDT fraud by, for example, providing an increased level of service to  taxpayers calling its identity theft toll-free phone line. In addition, IRS has  worked with tax preparation professionals, states, and financial  institutions to better detect and prevent IDT fraud.", "These efforts notwithstanding, fraudsters continue to adapt their schemes  to identify weaknesses in IDT defense, such as by gaining access to  taxpayers\u2019 tax return transcripts through IRS\u2019s online Get Transcript  service. According to IRS officials, this allows fraudsters to create  historically consistent returns that are hard to distinguish from one filed by  a legitimate taxpayer.", "These continuing challenges highlight the need for additional actions by  IRS. As we have reported, there are steps IRS can take to, among other  things, better authenticate the identity of taxpayers before issuing  refunds. In January 2015 we reported that IRS\u2019s authentication tools have  limitations. For example, individuals could obtain an e-file PIN by  providing their name, Social Security number, date of birth, address, and  filing status for IRS\u2019s e-file PIN application. Identity thieves can easily find  this information, allowing them to bypass some, if not all, of IRS\u2019s  automatic checks. After filing an IDT return using an e-file PIN, the  fraudster could file a fraudulent return through IRS\u2019s normal return  processing. Accordingly, we recommended that IRS assess the costs,  benefits, and risks of its authentication options.", "In November 2015, IRS officials told us that the agency had developed  guidance for its Identity Assurance Office to assess costs, benefits, and  risk of authentication tools. In February 2016, officials told us that this  office plans to complete a strategic plan for taxpayer authentication  across the agency in September 2016.
