But as nations faced increasing financial strains, many governments decided to shift the responsibility to an independent air navigation service provider (ANSP) that operates along commercial lines. As of March 2005, 38 nations worldwide had commercialized their air navigation services, fundamentally shifting the operational and financial responsibility for providing these services from the national government to an independent commercial authority. GAO selected five ANSPs--in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom--to examine characteristics and experiences of commercialized air navigation services. These ANSPs used different ownership structures and varied in terms of their size, amount of air traffic handled, and complexity of their airspace. This testimony, which is based on ongoing work, addresses the following questions: (1) What are common characteristics of commercialized ANSPs? (2) What do available data show about how the safety, cost, and efficiency of air navigation services have changed since commercialization? (3) What are some initial observations that can be made about the commercialization of air navigation services?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The five commercialized ANSPs that GAO selected for review have a number of common characteristics: Each operates as a business, making and carrying out its own strategic, operational, and financial decisions. Each generates and manages its own revenue to cover its costs, charging fees to users and borrowing funds from private markets instead of relying on annual governmental appropriations. Each has also put commercial financial and performance data systems in place. All five ANSPs have retained safety as their primary goal, and each is subject to some external safety regulation. Each ANSP is largely a monopoly provider of air navigation services and undergoes some form of economic review or follows some guidelines for setting prices. The ANSPs report that, since commercialization, each has maintained safety, controlled costs, and improved efficiency. Data from all five indicate that safety has not eroded. For example, data from New Zealand and Canada show fewer incidents involving loss of separation (the required distance between an aircraft and another object). All five ANSPs have taken steps, such as consolidating facilities, to control their operating costs. Finally, all five ANSPs have invested in new technologies that the ANSPs say have lowered their costs by increasing controllers' productivity and produced operating efficiencies, such as fewer or shorter delays. Such measures have generally resulted in lower fees for major carriers, but some smaller, formerly subsidized users now pay new or higher fees and are concerned about future costs and service. GAO's work to date suggests a number of observations about commercialized ANSPs: A contingency fund can help an ANSP cover its costs without greatly increasing user fees during an economic decline; economic regulation by an independent third party can ensure that an ANSP sets prices fairly; providing a forum for stakeholders gives attention to their needs; and special measures may be necessary to reconcile the inability of some users to pay the full costs of services at some small communities and the ANSP's need to recover its costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on our work  related to commercialized international air navigation service providers  (ANSP). Since 1987, 38 nations have commercialized their air navigation  services, fundamentally shifting the responsibility for providing air  navigation services from the national government to an independent ANSP  that operates as a performance-based organization along commercial  lines. In the United States, of course, the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s Air Traffic Organization was created as a performance- based organization in 2000, but has not been commercialized and remains  entirely within the federal government.", "In the past, governments worldwide owned, operated, and regulated air  navigation services, viewing them as a governmental function. But as air  navigation technologies grew more complex and as nations faced  increasing financial strains, many governments reevaluated existing  structures for providing air navigation services, and some decided that  shifting the responsibility for operating and, in some cases owning, the  services to an independent commercial authority could produce  efficiencies that would benefit both users and the government. In general,  the responsibility for regulating the safety of the services is independent of  the ANSP.", "Today I will discuss how different countries have commercialized their air  navigation services and how commercialization has affected those  services. Specifically, my statement addresses the following questions:    What are common characteristics of commercialized ANSPs?", "What do available data show about how the safety, cost, and efficiency of  air navigation services have changed since commercialization?", "What are some initial observations about the commercialization of air  navigation services?", "To address these questions, we reviewed the characteristics and  performance of five ANSPs, which we selected as illustrative of  similarities and differences in the size and scope of commercialized  ANSPs. These ANSPs\u2014Australia\u2019s Airservices Australia; Canada\u2019s NAV  CANADA; Germany\u2019s Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS); New  Zealand\u2019s Airways Corporation of New Zealand, Ltd.; and the United  Kingdom\u2019s (UK) National Air Traffic Services, Ltd. (NATS)\u2014were  commercialized between 1987 and 2001 and have been operating ever  since as performance-based organizations along commercial lines.  Because of the size of our sample, our results cannot be generalized to  other commercialized ANSPs, and our purpose is not to assess or evaluate  the selected commercialized organizations.", "Comparisons of performance before and after commercialization are  generally not feasible because data for assessing performance are typically  unavailable for the time before commercialization, or the measures have  changed in the years following commercialization. Furthermore,  comparisons between or among ANSPs are difficult because each ANSP  may define its measures of cost, safety, and performance differently. We  did not verify the data gathered and reported by the five ANSPs; however,  their financial information is subject to independent audits, and their  safety and operating performance data are publicly reported. As a result,  we considered the data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.  The information presented in this testimony is based on ongoing work and  may be updated as additional information becomes available. At the  request of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, its Subcommittee on Aviation, and Senators John McCain  and Trent Lott, we are planning to issue a more detailed report later this  year on the topics discussed in this testimony. We performed our work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards from  August 2004 through April 2005.", "Let me turn now to the results of our review. In summary:  The five commercialized ANSPs that we selected for review have a  number of common characteristics: Each operates as a business rather  than a government organization, making and carrying out its own  strategic, operational, and financial decisions. Additionally, each generates  and manages its own revenue to cover its operating and capital costs.  Each assesses fees on users of air navigation services (e.g., major  commercial air carriers, regional air carriers, and in some cases general  aviation operators) and is able to borrow funds from private markets,  instead of relying on annual appropriations from the government. All five  ANSPs have retained safety as their primary goal, and each is subject to  some external safety regulation. Finally, each ANSP is largely a monopoly  provider of air navigation services and undergoes some form of economic  review or follows some guidelines for setting prices.", "Available data from the five ANSPs we reviewed indicate that since  commercialization, the safety of air navigation services has remained the  same or improved, each has taken steps to control costs, and each has  reportedly lowered costs and improved efficiency through modernization.  Though some opponents have raised concerns that commercialization  would compromise safety, data from all five indicate that safety has not  eroded. For example, data from New Zealand and Canada show fewer  incidents involving loss of separation (the required distance between an  aircraft and another object). Additionally, anecdotal information suggests  that safety regulation improved when the regulator was separated  organizationally from the ANSP. All five ANSPs have taken steps to control  their operating costs, whether by eliminating some administrative and  middle management positions or by consolidating facilities. Furthermore,  all five ANSPs have invested in and benefited from new technologies and  equipment, which the ANSPs say have lowered their costs by increasing  controllers\u2019 productivity and produced operating efficiencies, such as  fewer or shorter delays. As a result, some ANSPs have been able to lower  the prices they charge the airlines for certain services. However, the  ANSPs have also instituted or increased fees for general aviation  operators. In Australia, a government subsidy for services to smaller  airports is scheduled to expire later this year, raising concerns about the  affordability and availability of services to those airports.", "Our work to date suggests a number of initial observations about  commercialized ANSPs. First, having a contingency fund or other  mechanism to offset a revenue shortfall can help an ANSP weather a  decline in air traffic such as the aviation industry experienced, particularly  after September 11, 2001. Second, because the ANSPs are largely  monopoly providers of air navigation services, economic monitoring or  regulation by an independent third party can protect users and ensure a  fair pricing process. Third, addressing the concerns of stakeholders,  especially air traffic controllers, is essential to initiate and sustain  commercial operations, and providing a forum for communication can  ensure subsequent attention to their needs and priorities. Fourth, the  conflict between the inability of some users (e.g., smaller air carriers or  general aviation operators) to pay the full costs of providing services to  small communities and the ANSPs\u2019 need to recover their costs means that  special measures may be necessary to protect service to some locations.  Fifth, when a government sells its interest in an ANSP to private investors  as part of the commercialization, the ANSP\u2019s assets have to be  appropriately valued to protect taxpayer interests and create a basis for  sound financial decision-making. Sixth, when operations are separated  from regulation during commercialization, it is important to ensure that  the regulator can attract and retain sufficient personnel with the skills and  expertise needed to provide uninterrupted safety regulation. Finally,  developing baseline safety, cost, and efficiency measures prior to  commercialization will allow the ANSP and others to compare the  performance of the ANSP before and after commercialization and over  time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Before commercialization, air navigation services under government  control faced increasing strain. Many were underfunded, as evidenced by  air traffic controller wage freezes and insufficient funds to replace aging  technologies. In some instances, the country as a whole faced widespread  fiscal problems and the commercialization of air navigation services was  simply part of a larger movement to reform government enterprises such  as rail, telecommunications, and electricity.", "With commercialization, the government typically retains full or partial  ownership of the air navigation system and continues to regulate  operational safety, but an independent ANSP is responsible for operating  the system. The independent ANSP is subject to corporate financial and  accounting rules and, in line with today\u2019s current management theories, is  generally designed as a performance-based organization\u2014that is, an  organization that develops strategies, goals, and measures and gathers and  reports data to demonstrate its performance. In the five countries whose  air navigation services we reviewed, the ANSP continued to provide  nationwide services after commercialization and, with certain exceptions,  remained the sole provider of air navigation services.", "Each ANSP offers en route, approach control, and terminal air traffic  services. However, in some cases, an ANSP may not be the sole provider  of approach control and terminal services in a country. Although technical  definitions may vary slightly among ANSPs, these services broadly  correspond to the services provided in U.S. air traffic centers, approach  control centers, and towers. All but Germany\u2019s DFS also offer oceanic air  navigation services. All five ANSPs are responsible for providing air traffic  services to both civil and military aviation. In addition, the ANSPs may  offer other air-navigation-related services, such as meteorological services,  fire and rescue, training, and consulting. The ANSPs also charge for these  services.", "Discussions about the commercialization of air navigation services often  use a number of terms interchangeably. Among these terms are  restructuring, privatization, outsourcing, and corporatization, as well as  commercialization. The Civil Air Navigation Services Organization  (CANSO), which represents the interests of ANSPs worldwide, uses the  term corporatization. Others, such as the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO), which establishes international civil aviation  standards and recommends practices and procedures for ANSPs, use the  term commercialization. Some note that an organization can be  \u201ccommercialized\u201d but not \u201ccorporatized\u201d (i.e., established under prevailing  company law).

Their air navigation service fees are based on ICAO\u2019s cost  recovery principles, which call for recovering the ANSP\u2019s operating costs.  Despite some variation across ANSPs, the fees are generally as follows:    The air navigation fees cover operating and capital costs associated with  both en route and terminal services. These charges are based on a weight- distance formula. If applicable, ANSPs also levy charges for oceanic  control.", "ANSPs may also charge for tower-related services. However, not all ANSPs  are the sole providers of tower services. In the UK and Germany, for  example, private firms may provide tower services. These tower charges  are distinct from the landing fees typically charged by airports, which are  usually weight-based.", "ANSPs may charge general aviation operators a flat fee for services or  additional fees in particular circumstances rather than charging the  weight-distance fees typically assessed to larger air carriers.", "ANSPs may also charge additional fees, as applicable, for other services,  such as meteorological, aeronautical information, training, and consulting  services.", "The five ANSPs vary in their treatment of any operating profits or losses. If  an ANSP generates revenues from charges in excess of its costs (i.e.,  operating profits), it may rebate them to the users, lower the charges for  the next year, pay some form of dividend to shareholders, or retain them  in reserve to protect against future losses. If costs exceed revenues,  ANSPs use different strategies to meet those shortfalls. For example, NAV  CANADA established a \u201crate stabilization fund,\u201d which it used to store  revenues when the aviation industry was healthy. The fund could then be  used to cover costs and keep rates stabilized when the industry was ailing.  The fund was capitalized by operating profits earned before September 11,  2001, but depleted following the economic downturn caused by the events  of September 11 and the SARS outbreak of 2003. In 2003, the rate  stabilization fund had reached a cumulative deficit of C$116 million.  According to NAV Canada\u2019s 2004 annual report, the C$116 million deficit  has been reduced to C$32 million.

Before commercialization, the ANSPs  relied on annual appropriations for capital projects; now, all five can  borrow funds through access to private capital and debt financing. For  example, NAV CANADA can seek debt financing in private markets. NAV  CANADA has a borrowing capacity of C$2.9 billion. In Germany, DFS  mainly finances its capital expenditures by drawing on a capital market  program, which issues short-, medium- , or long-term notes (i.e., debt  issuance and commercial paper) each amounting to \u20ac 500 million for a  total of \u20ac 1 billion to private investors in the market.

In New Zealand, for  example, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent regulatory  authority that establishes civil aviation safety and security standards and  monitors adherence to those standards. CAA carries out accident and  incident investigations and uses information from these investigations to  establish an industrywide safety picture and develop safety initiatives  ranging from education campaigns to increased monitoring and regulatory  action.", "All five selected ANSPs have established formal safety programs.

According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots  Association\u2014New Zealand, Airways Corporation of New Zealand charges  general aviation operators a fee of NZ$100 for 50 landings. In addition,  Airways eliminated the en-route charge for light aircraft.", "Some governments have subsidized air navigation services at small,  remote, general aviation, and regional airports, viewing such services as a  public good. Australia, for instance, provides a subsidy for service to some  remote areas under the Remote Air Subsidy Scheme. Similarly, to protect  service to remote locations and ensure equity of service to smaller  communities, Canada legislatively requires NAV CANADA to maintain  service to such locations. For instance, service to the Northern region,  which is designated as \u201cremote,\u201d is guaranteed under the legislation.

Recently, the ACCC rejected a proposal by  Airservices for a temporary fee increase to address the revenue losses that  followed September 11 and the SARS outbreak, as well as the collapse of  Australia\u2019s second largest airline. In rejecting the proposal, ACCC  considered the fact that the industry took exception to these increases,  raising concerns about the need for longer-term price certainty. ACCC  ruled in favor of the industry and rejected the temporary price increases,  instead deciding that a longer-term arrangement be considered. ACCC  directed Airservices to focus on 5-year pricing plans to encourage long- term planning, emphasizing that the robustness of the airlines should be  taken into account when a price is set.", "Canada has no formal regulation of fee setting.

Controllers in Canada supported the transition following a 5-year salary  freeze and hiring freezes. However, Canadian controllers\u2019 support for  commercialization has diminished, mainly because of differences over  collective bargaining issues such as wage increases, the right to strike and  controller fatigue.

Under this pricing scheme, an ANSP charges a fee for service that matches  the cost of providing that service to a specific location. As a result, some  communities may be subject to higher charges than others. By contrast,  two ANSPs have used network pricing, a scheme that charges the same fee  for air navigation services to every airport, regardless of size or location,  even though the costs of providing the services to some airports may be  greater than to others. Under network pricing, the service to heavily used  airports subsidizes the service to others.", "Two of the ANSPs have adopted location-specific pricing for some air  navigation services. (Airport services are provided by competition in the  U.K., which may result in different prices.) Often, the minimum costs of  service to small or remote communities are higher per plane than the costs  of service to large communities because the cost of air navigation services  must be spread among fewer operators, usually with smaller aircraft. If  airlines decide that service to such communities is not commercially  viable, they may ultimately discontinue service to these communities.  Similarly, general aviation operators may be threatened if they are  required to pay fees that cover the full costs of the air navigation services  they receive. Continuing to serve small communities and operators may  require special efforts to balance public service needs and business  interests.", "In addition to the Remote Air Subsidy Scheme mentioned earlier, Australia  also provided a subsidy that allowed prices to be capped at most general  aviation and regional airports. This subsidy was designed to ease the  transition to location specific pricing for select airports and is scheduled  to end in June 2005. Consequently, Airservices Australia reported that, in  order to compensate, it will be increasing charges over the next 5 years at  these locations and that these increases have been approved by the  regulator. These increases have been moderated to balance the effect on  aviation at airports frequently used by general aviation operators.
