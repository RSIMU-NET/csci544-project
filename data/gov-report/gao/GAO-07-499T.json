The program uses biometric identifiers (digital fingerscans and photographs) to screen people against watch lists and to verify that a visitor is the person who was issued a visa or other travel document. The program is also to biometrically confirm the individual's departure. For over 3 years, GAO has reported on US-VISIT capability deployments and shortfalls, as well as fundamental limitations in DHS's efforts to define and justify US-VISIT's future direction and to cost-effectively manage the delivery of program capabilities on time and within budget. GAO was asked to testify on (1) the status of the program's implementation and (2) the program's progress in addressing longstanding management weaknesses. Given where US-VISIT is today and the challenges and uncertainties associated with where it is going, GAO believes that DHS is long overdue in demonstrating that it is pursuing the right US-VISIT solution and that it is managing US-VISIT the right way."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["After spending almost 4 years and more than $1 billion, DHS has implemented entry capabilities at most ports of entry; however, it has not implemented a biometric exit capability or a suitable alternative. As of December 2006, US-VISIT had deployed and was operating entry capability at 115 airports, 14 seaports, and 154 of 170 land ports of entry. However, the implementation of a biometric land exit capability is currently not feasible, according to program officials, because the only proven technology available would require additional staffing and infrastructure demands, and cause delays with potential impacts on trade and commerce. Also, testing and analysis of a non-biometric solution identified numerous performance and reliability problems, and such an alternative technology does not meet legislative requirements. DHS believes that advances over the next 5 to 10 years will allow solutions that do not require major infrastructure changes, but the prospects for such technology are uncertain. DHS continues to face longstanding US-VISIT management challenges and future uncertainties. For almost 4 years, DHS has continued to pursue US-VISIT without producing the program's operational and technological context. According to program officials, an immigration and border management strategic plan was drafted in March 2005 to show how US-VISIT is aligned with DHS's organizational mission and to define an overall immigration and border management vision. After almost 2 years, this plan has not yet been approved, but the Acting Director said that it is currently with OMB for approval. At the same time, DHS has launched other major security programs without defining the relationship between US-VISIT and these programs. DHS has yet to economically justify its investment in US-VISIT increments or assess their operational impacts. For over 3 years, we reported that the program did not adequately assess the increment's costs and benefits because the assessments were unclear and insufficient, and the cost estimates upon which they were based did not meet key criteria for reliable cost estimating. GAO further reported that the program had not assessed the impact of the entry and exit capabilities on operations and facilities, in part, because the scope of the evaluations performed were too limited. DHS has not implemented key acquisition and financial management controls. For example, GAO reported that the program had not effectively overseen contract work performed on its behalf by other DHS and non-DHS agencies, and these agencies did not always establish and implement effective contract oversight activities. Without these management controls, there is greater risk that US-VISIT will not produce the right solution, and be managed the right way. Accordingly, GAO has made numerous recommendations to address these management challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing on the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator  Technology (US-VISIT). US-VISIT is multibillion-dollar program of  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that is intended to  achieve a daunting set of goals: to enhance the security of our  citizens and visitors and ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration  system while facilitating legitimate trade and travel and protecting  individuals\u2019 privacy. To achieve these goals, US-VISIT is to record  selected travelers\u2019 entry and exit to and from the United States at  over 300 ports of entry (POEs) around the country, verify their  identity, and determine their compliance with the terms of their  admission and stay.", "Since fiscal year 2002, the House and Senate Appropriations  Committees have provided valuable oversight and direction for  US-VISIT as the Congress directed DHS to submit annual  expenditure plans that had to meet certain conditions, and directed  GAO to review these plans. Our reviews have produced five reports,  including the latest on the fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan, which  we issued earlier this week. These reports and our recent reports to  the House Committee on Homeland Security on US-VISIT contract  and financial management and US-VISIT operations at land POEs  have identified fundamental challenges that the DHS continues to  face in meeting program expectations (i.e., delivering program  capabilities and benefits on time and within cost). In light of these  challenges, we continue to believe that the program carries an  appreciable level of risk and must be managed effectively if it is to  be successful.", "Our testimony today draws on this body of completed work to  provide a snapshot of what US-VISIT capabilities have and have not  been delivered, what work has recently begun to enhance already  delivered capabilities, and the range of longstanding challenges that  hamper DHS efforts to establish and live up to program  expectations and commitments. All the work on which this  testimony is based was performed in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, after spending almost 4 years and more than $1 billion,  DHS is operating US-VISIT entry capabilities at most POEs, has  conducted various exit demonstration projects at a small number of  POEs, and has begun to work to move from 2 to10 fingerprint  biometric capabilities and expand electronic information sharing  with stakeholders. Of particular note is the fact that a US-VISIT  biometric-based entry screening capability is operating at 115  airports, 14 seaports, and 154 land POEs. However, a biometric exit  capability is not. According to program officials, this is due to a  number of factors. For example, at this time the only proven  technology available for biometric land exit verification would  necessitate mirroring the processes currently in use for entry at  these POEs, which would create costly staffing demands and  infrastructure requirements, and introduce potential trade,  commerce, and environmental impacts. Further, a pilot project to  examine an alternative technology at land POEs did not produce a  viable solution.", "Where US-VISIT stands today owes largely to the manner in which it  has been managed. In this regard, we have reported a range of  program management weaknesses related to ensuring that the  program, as defined, is the right thing to do and that it is done the  right way. To be the right thing to do, the program needs to fit  properly within DHS\u2019s strategic plans and related operational and  technology blueprints, and it needs to produce benefits in excess of  costs over its useful life. Relatedly, program impacts and options  need to be considered and addressed. To be done the right way,  critical acquisition management processes need to be established  and followed to ensure that program capabilities and expected  mission outcomes are delivered on time and within budget. These  processes include effective project planning, requirements  management, contract tracking and oversight, test management, and  financial management. As we have reported for several years, DHS  has yet to adequately do these things. While program officials have  stated that all the areas are being addressed, progress has been  slow.

Before they arrive, these visitors generally are subject to  prescreening via passenger manifests that are forwarded to CBP by  commercial air or sea carriers. By contrast, foreign nationals  entering the United States at land POEs are generally not subject to  prescreening because they arrive in private vehicles or on foot and  there is no manifest to record their pending arrival. Thus, when  foreign nationals subject to US-VISIT arrive at a land POE in  vehicles, they enter the primary inspection area where CBP  officers\u2014often located in booths--are to visually inspect travel  documents and query the visitors about such matters as their place  of birth and proposed destination. Visitors arriving as pedestrians  enter an equivalent primary inspection area, generally inside a CBP  building. If the CBP officer believes a more detailed inspection is  needed or if the visitors are required to be processed under US- VISIT for the first time, the visitors are to be referred to the  secondary inspection area that is generally inside a facility away  from the primary inspection area.

Compounding  these program challenges was the fact that the systems that were to  be used in building and deploying a biometric entry capability were  managed and operated by a number of the separate agencies that  had been merged to form the new department, each of which was  governed by different policies, procedures, and standards.", "Moreover, DHS reports that US-VISIT entry capabilities have  produced results. According to US-VISIT's Consolidated Weekly  Summary Report, as of December 28, 2006, there have been more  than 5,400 biometric hits in primary entry, resulting in more than  1,300 people having adverse actions, such as denial of entry, taken  against them. According to the report, about 4,100 of these hits  occurred at air and sea ports of entry and over 1,300 at land ports of  entry. Further, the report indicates that more than 1,800 biometric  hits have been referred to DHS's immigration enforcement unit,  resulting in 293 arrests. We did not verify the information in the  consolidated report.", "Another potential consequence, although difficult to demonstrate, is  the deterrent effect of having an operational entry capability.  Although deterrence is not an expressly stated goal of the program,  officials have cited it as a potential byproduct of having a publicized  capability at the border to screen entry on the basis of identity  verification and matching against watch lists of known and  suspected terrorists. Accordingly, the deterrent potential of the  knowledge that unwanted entry may be thwarted and the  perpetrators caught is arguably a layer of security that should not be  overlooked.", "Despite these results, US-VISIT\u2019s entry capability at land POEs has  not been without operational and system performance problems.  During recent visits to land POEs, we identified some space  constraints and other capacity issues. For example, at the Nogales- Morley Gate POE in Arizona, where up to 6,000 visitors are  processed daily (and up to 10,000 on holidays), equipment was  installed but not used because of CBP concerns about its ability to  carry out the US-VISIT process in a constrained space while  thousands of other people not subject to US-VISIT are processed  through the facility daily. Thus, visitors that are to be processed  into US-VISIT from Morley Gate are directed to return to Mexico (a  few feet away) and to walk approximately 100 yards to the Nogales- DeConcini POE facility, which has the capability to handle  secondary inspections of this kind. In addition, we found that POEs  had experienced system downtime associated with US-VISIT. In  particular, 12 of the 21 land POEs that we visited stated that they  had experienced computer-processing problems that had an impact  on processing times and traveler delays. In June 2006, a CBP data  center official confirmed that POEs had experienced slowdowns  associated with certain US-VISIT data queries. The CBP official  also told us that these computer processing problems have since  been identified and resolved, and that performance had greatly  improved. We did not verify whether the actions taken fully resolved  these problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "US-VISIT Is Unable to Implement a Biometric Exit Capability at Land Ports of Entry Due to Several Constraints and Testing of Non-biometric Exit Solution Has Identified Performance Problems", "paragraphs": ["Several logistical, infrastructure, cost, and technological constraints  have precluded DHS from implementing a biometric exit capability  at land POEs. According to program officials, the major constraint  at this time is that the only proven technology available to  biometrically verify individuals upon exit at land POEs would  necessitate mirroring the processes currently in use for entry. Such  a process would require CBP officers to perform the same processes  as for entry, including examining the travel documents of those  leaving the country, taking fingerprints, comparing visitors\u2019 facial  features to photographs, and, if questions about identity arise,  directing the departing visitor to secondary inspection for additional  questioning. The program office concluded in January 2005 that a  mirror image solution was \u201can infeasible alternative for numerous  reasons, including but not limited to, the additional staffing  demands, new infrastructure requirements, and potential trade and  commerce impacts.\u201d", "More specifically, program officials told us that implementing such a  solution could result in delays at land POEs with a heavy daily  volume of visitors, and would require both additional lanes for  exiting vehicles and additional inspection booths and staff (though  they had not determined precisely how many). It is unclear how new  vehicle lanes and new facilities could be built at land POEs where  space constraints already exist, such as those in congested urban  areas. For example, San Ysidro, California, currently has 24 entry  lanes, each with its own staffed booth, and 6 unstaffed exit lanes.  Thus, if full biometric exit capability were implemented using a  mirror image approach, San Ysidro\u2019s current capacity of 6 exit lanes  would have to be expanded to 24 exit lanes. As shown in the  following photo and confirmed during our site visit to the San Ysidro  POE, the facility is surrounded by dense urban infrastructure,  leaving little, if any, room to expand in place. Some of the 24 entry  lanes for vehicle traffic heading north from Mexico into the United  States appear in the bottom left portion of the photograph, where  vehicles are shown waiting to approach primary inspection at the  facility; the six exit lanes (traffic towards Mexico), which do not  have fixed inspection facilities, are at the upper left.", "Other POE facilities are similarly spatially constrained. For  example, the Nogales-DeConcini, Arizona facility is bordered by  railroad tracks, a parking lot, and industrial or commercial  buildings. Further, CBP has identified space constraints at selecte rural POEs, such as the Thousand Islands Bridge POE at Ale xandria  Bay, New York, which is situated in what POE officials described as  a \u201cgeological bowl,\u201d with tall rock outcroppings potentially  hindering the ability to expand facilities at the current location.  Officials told us that in order to accommodate existing and  anticipated traffic volume upon entry, they are in the early stages planning to build an entirely new POE on a hill about a half-m ile  south of the present facility.", "DHS also identified the cost o capability as a constraint. In 2003, the program office estimated that  it would cost approximately $3 billion to implement US-VISIT entry  and exit capability at land POEs where US-VISIT was likely to be  installed, and that such an effort would have a major impact on  f implementing a biometric exit  facility infrastructure at land POEs. We did not assess the reliabili of the 2003 estimate, but would note that while the estimate did  separately break out costs for entry and exit construction, it did  factor in the cost for building additional exit vehicle lanes and  booths as well as buildings and other infrastructure that would be required to accommodate a mirror image of entry capabilities.  Program officials told us that they did not move ahead with this  option. No subsequent cost estimate updates had been prepared ,  and DHS\u2019s annual budget requests have not included funds to bui the infrastructure that would be associated with the required  facilities.", "In light of  nonbiometric technology to record travelers\u2019 departure, but testing  showed numerous performance and reliability problems. Because  there is at present no biometric technology that can be used to  verify a traveler\u2019s exit from the country at land POEs without also  making major and costly changes to POE infrastructure and  facilities, the program office tested radio frequency identification  (RFID) technology as a nonbiometric means of recording visitors as  they exit. RFID technology can be used to electronically identify and  gather information contained on a tag\u2014in this case, a unique  identifying number embedded in a tag on a visitor\u2019s arrival/departure  form\u2014which an electronic reader at the POE is to detect.  these various constraints, the program office has tested  While RFID technology required few facility and infrastruc changes, testing and analysis at five land POEs at the northern and  southern borders identified numerous performance and reliability  problems, such as the failure of RFID readers to detect a majority of travelers\u2019 tags during testing. For example, the program office  reported that of 166 vehicles tested during a one-week period at the  Blaine-Pacific Highway, readers correctly identified 14 percent\u2014a  sizable departure from the target read rate of 70 percent.ture  Another problem that arose were \u201ccross-reads,\u201d in which multiple  RFID readers installed on poles or structures over roads, called  gantries, picked up information from the same visitor, regardless of  whether the individual was entering or exiting in a vehicle or on  foot. Thus, cross-reads resulted in inaccurate record-keeping.  According to a January 2006 corrective-action report, remedying  cross-reads would require changes to equipment and infrastructure  on a case-by-case basis at each POE, because each has a different  physical configuration of buildings, roadways, roofs, gantries, poles,  and other surfaces against which the signals can bounce and cause  cross-reads. Each would therefore require a different physical  solution to avoid the signal interference that triggers cross-reads.  Although cost estimates or time lines for such alterations to  facilities and equipment have not been developed, it is possible that  having to alter each POE\u2019s physical configuration in some regard  and then test each separately to ensure that cross-reads had been  eliminated would be both time consuming and potentially costly.", "Moreover, even if RFID deficiencies were to be fully addressed and  deadlines set, the RFID solution does not meet the legislative  requirement for a biometric exit capability. By design, an RFID tag  embedded in an I-94 arrival/departure form cannot provide the  biometric identity-matching capability that is envisioned as part of a  comprehensive entry/exit border security system that uses  biometric identifiers for tracking overstays and others entering,  exiting, and re-entering the country. That is, the RFID tag in the I-94  form cannot be physically tied to an individual. This situation means  that while a document may be detected as leaving the country, the  person to whom it was issued at time of entry may be somewhere  else. Thus, the technology that had been tested cannot meet a key  program goal\u2014ensuring that visitors who enter the country are the  same ones who leave.", "According to program officials, technological advances over the  next 5 to 10 years will make it possible to utilize alternative  technologies that provide biometric verification of persons exiting  the country without major changes to facility infrastructure and  without requiring those exiting to stop and/or exit their vehicles,  thereby mitigating traffic backup, congestion, and resulting delays.  Further, the program reports that although limitations in technology  currently preclude the use of biometric identification because  visitors would have to be stopped, the prospect of the as-yet- undeveloped biometric verification technology supports the lon term US-VISIT vision. such technology or device currently exists that would not have a  major impact on facilities. The prospects for its development,  manufacture, deployment and reliable utilization are thus uncerta although a prototype device that would permit a fingerprint to  be  read remotely without requiring the visitor to come to a full stop is  under development.", "US-VISIT, Increment 2C Operational Alternatives Assessment\u2014FINAL (Rosslyn, Va:  Jan. 31, 2005)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Continues to Face Longstanding US-VISIT Management Challenges and Future Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["Our work and other best practice research have shown that applying  disciplined and rigorous management practices improves the  likelihood of delivering expected capabilities on time and within  budget.

Of these, the first enhancement is  underway and is to provide several new capabilities, including what  the program refers to as \u201cUnique Identity,\u201d which is to include the  migration from the 2-fingerprint to 10-fingerprint collection at  program enrollment. It is also to interoperate US-VISIT\u2019s IDENT  system and the Department of Justice\u2019s IAFIS system. Currently, the  US-VISIT officials plan to complete Unique Identity in several  phases and have it fully operational by December 2009, although  these plans have not yet approved by DHS.", "At this same time, DHS has launched other major border security  programs without adequately defining the relationships to US-VISIT  and each other. For example, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism  Prevention Act of 2004 directs DHS and the Department of State to  develop and implement a plan, no later than June 2009, that requires  U.S. citizens and foreign nationals of Canada, Bermuda, and Mexico  to present a passport or other document or combination of  documents deemed sufficient to show identity and citizenship to  enter the United States (this is currently not a requirement for these  individuals entering the United States via sea and land POEs from  most countries within the western hemisphere). This effort, known  as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, was first announced in  2005. In May 2006, we reported that DHS and the Department of  State had taken some steps to carry out the initiative, but they had a  long way to go to implement their proposed plans. Among other  things, key decisions had yet to be made about what documents  other than a passport would be acceptable when U.S. citizens and  citizens of Canada enter or return to the United States. Further,  while DHS and Department of State had proposed an alternative  form of passport, called a PASS card, that would rely on RFID  technology to help DHS process U.S. citizens re-entering the  country, DHS had not made decisions involving a broad set of  considerations that include (1) utilizing security features to protect  personal information, (2) ensuring that proper equipment and  facilities are in place to facilitate crossings at land borders, and (3)  enhancing compatibility with other border crossing technology  already in use.", "DHS has also initiated another border security program, known as  the Secure Border Initiative (SBI)\u2014a multi-year program to secure  the borders and reduce illegal immigration by installing state-of-the- art surveillance technologies along the border, increasing border  security personnel, and ensuring information access to DHS  personnel at and between POEs. Under SBI and its component,  called SBInet, DHS plans to integrate personnel, infrastructures,  technologies, and rapid response capability into a comprehensive  border protection capability. DHS reports that, among other things,  SBInet is to encompass both the northern and southern land  borders, including the Great Lakes, under a unified border control  strategy whereby CBP is to focus on the interdiction of cross-border  violations between and at the land POEs, funneling traffic to the  land POEs. As part of SBI, DHS also plans to focus on interior  enforcement\u2014disrupting and dismantling cross-border crime into  the interior of the United States while locating and removing aliens  who are present in the United States in violation of law. However, it  is unclear how SBInet will be linked, if at all, to US-VISIT so that the  two can share technology, infrastructure, and data.", "Clearly defining the dependencies among US-VISIT and programs  like the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative and SBI is important  because there is commonality among their strategic goals and  operational environments. For example, both US-VISIT and SBI  share the goal of securing the POEs. Moreover, there is overlap in  the data that each is to produce and use. For example, both US- VISIT and the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative will require  identification data for travelers at POEs.", "Despite these dependencies, DHS has yet to define these  relationships or how they will be managed. Further, according to a  March 6, 2006 memo from the DHS Joint Requirements Council, the  US-VISIT strategic plan did not provide evidence of sufficient  coordination between the program and the other entities involved in  border security and immigration efforts. The council\u2019s  recommendation was that the strategic plan not be approved until  greater coordination between US-VISIT and other components was  addressed.", "According to the Acting Program Director, a number of efforts are  underway to coordinate with other entities, such as with CBP on  RFID, with the Coast Guard on development of a mobile biometric  reader, and with State on standards for document readers. Without a  clear, complete, transparent, and understood definition of how  related programs and initiatives are to interact, US-VISIT and other  border security and immigration enforcement programs run the risk  of being defined and implemented in a way that does not optimize  DHS-wide performance and results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Economically Justified US-VISIT Increments or Assessed Their Operational Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The decision to invest in any system or capability should be based  on reliable analyses of return on investment. That is, an agency  should have reasonable assurance that a proposed program will  produce mission value commensurate with expected costs and  risks. According to OMB guidance, individual increments of major  systems should be individually supported by analyses of benefits,  cost, and risk. Thus far, DHS has yet to develop an adequate basis  for knowing whether its incrementally deployed US-VISIT  capabilities represent a good return on investment, particularly in  light of shortfalls in DHS\u2019s assessments of the program\u2019s operational  impacts, including costs of proposed capabilities. Without this  knowledge, DHS will not know until after the fact whether it is  investing wisely or pursuing cost-effective and affordable solutions.", "US-VISIT had not assessed the cost and benefits of its early  increments. For example, we reported in September 2003 that it had  not assessed the costs and benefits of Increment 1. Again, in  February 2005, we reported that although the program office  developed a cost-benefit analysis for its land entry capability, it had  not justified the investment because the treatment of both benefits  and costs were unclear and insufficient. Further, we reported that  the cost estimates on which the cost-benefit analysis was based  were of questionable reliability because effective cost-estimating  practices were not followed. Most recently, in February 2006, we  reported again that the program office had not justified its  investment in its air and sea exit capability. For example, we  reported that while the cost-benefit analysis explained why the  investment was needed, and considered at least two alternatives to  the status quo, which is consistent with OMB guidance for cost- benefit analyses, it did not include a complete uncertainty analysis  for the three exit alternatives evaluated. Specifically, it did not  include a sensitivity analysis for the three alternatives, which is a  major part of an uncertainty analysis. A complete analysis of  uncertainty is important because it provides decision makers with a  perspective on the potential variability of the cost and benefit  estimates should the facts, circumstances, and assumptions change.  Further, the cost estimate upon which the analysis was based did  not meet key criteria for reliable cost estimating. For example, it did not include a detailed work breakdown structure, which serves to  organize and define the work to be performed so that associated  costs can be identified and estimated.", "Further, as we state in the report that we issued earlier this week,  DHS has devoted considerable time and resources toward  establishing an operational exit capability at land, air, and sea POEs.  For example, over the last 4 years, DHS has committed over $160  million to evaluate and operate exit pilots at selected air, sea, and  land POEs. Notwithstanding this considerable investment of time  and resources, the US-VISIT program still does not have either an  operational exit capability or a viable exit solution to deploy to all  air, sea, and land POEs.", "Moreover, US-VISIT exit pilot reports have raised concerns and  limitations. For example, as we previously stated, land exit pilot  experienced several performance problems, such as the failure of  RFID readers to detect a majority of travelers\u2019 tags during testing  and cross-reads, in which multiple RFID readers installed on poles  or structures over roads, called gantries, picked up information from  the same visitor.", "Notwithstanding these results, we reported earlier this week that  the program office planned to invest another $33.5 million to  continue its air and sea exit pilots. However, neither the fiscal year  2006 expenditure plan nor other exit-related program  documentation adequately defined what these efforts entail or what  they will accomplish. In particular, the plan and other exit-related  documentation merely state that $33.5 million will be used to  continue air and sea exit pilots while a comprehensive exit solution  is developed. They do not adequately describe measurable outcomes  (benefits and results) from the pilot efforts, or related cost,  schedule, and capability commitments that will be met. Further, the  plan does not recognize the challenges revealed from the prior exit  efforts, nor does it show how proposed exit investments address  these challenges. In addition, the plan allocates more funding for  continuing the air and sea exit pilots ($33.5 million) than the prior  year\u2019s plan said would be needed to fully deploy an operational air  and sea exit solution ($32 million). According to program officials,  the air and sea exit pilots are being continued to maintain a  presence intended to provide a deterrent effect at exit locations, and  to gather additional data that could help support planning for a  comprehensive exit solution.", "Moreover, US-VISIT reported in August 2006 that it planned to spend  an additional $21.5 million to continue its land exit demonstration  project without adequate justification. However, we reported earlier  this week that these plans lacked adequate justification in light of  the problems we discussed earlier in this statement. Accordingly,  program officials told us that they intend to terminate the land exit  project until a comprehensive exit strategy can be developed. They  have also stated that a small portion of the $21.5 million is to be  used to close out the demonstration project and have requested that  the remainder of the money be reprogrammed to support Unique  Identity.", "DHS Did Not Adequately Assess the Impact of Entry Capabilities on Land Ports of Entry  Operations and Planned Capability Enhancements Carry Potential Cost Implications  Knowing how planned US-VISIT capabilities will impact POE  operations is critical to US-VISIT investment decision makers. In  May 2004, we reported that the program had not assessed how  deploying entry capabilities at land POEs would impact the  workforce and facilities. We questioned the validity of the program\u2019s  assumptions and plans concerning workforce and facilities, since  the program lacked a basis for determining whether its assumptions  were correct and thus whether its plans were adequate.  Subsequently, the program office evaluated the operational  performance of the land entry capability with the stated purpose of  determining the effectiveness of its performance at the 50 busiest  land POEs. For this evaluation, the program office established a  baseline for comparing the average time it takes to issue and  process entry/exit forms at 3 of these 50 POEs, and then conducted  two evaluations of the processing times at the three POEs, one after  the entry capability was deployed as a pilot, and another one 3  months later, after the entry capability was deployed to all 50 POEs.  The evaluation results showed that the average processing times  decreased for all three sites. Program officials concluded that these  results supported their workforce and facility investment  assumptions that no additional staff was required to support  deployment of the entry capability and that minimal modifications  were required at the facilities.", "However, the scope of the evaluations was not sufficient to satisfy  the evaluations\u2019 stated purpose for assessing the full impact of the  entry capability. For example, the selection of the three sites,  according to program officials, was based on a number of factors,  including whether the sites already had sufficient staff to support  the pilot. Selecting sites based on this factor is problematic because  it presupposes that all not POEs have the staff needed to support  the land entry capability. In addition, evaluation conditions were not  always held constant: specifically, fewer workstations were used to  process travelers in establishing the baseline processing times at  two of the POEs than were used during the pilot evaluations.", "Moreover, CBP officials from a land port of entry that was not an  evaluation site (San Ysidro) told us that US-VISIT deployment had  not reduced but actually lengthened processing times. (San Ysidro  processes the highest volume of travelers of all land POEs.)  Although these officials did not provide specific data to support  their statement, their perception nevertheless raises questions about  the potential impact of land entry capabilities on the 47 sites that  were not evaluated.", "Exacerbating this situation is the fact that DHS plans to introduce  changes and enhancements to US-VISIT at land POEs to verify the  identity of individuals entering the country, including a transition  from digitally scanning 2 fingerprints to 10. While such changes are  intended to further enhance border security, deploying them may  have an impact on aging and spatially-constrained land POEs  facilities because they could increase inspection times and  adversely affect POEs operations. Moreover, the increase from 2 to  10 fingerprints can affect the capacity of the systems and  communications networks processing because of the larger data  sets being processed and transmitted (10 vs 2 fingerprints). This  need for increased capacity will in turn affect program costs.", "US-VISIT Did Not Adequately Evaluate Exit Capability Impacts on Operations at Air and  Sea Ports of Entry  The impact of planned exit capabilities at air and sea POEs has also  not been adequately analyzed, and is thus not available to inform  investment decisions. In February 2005, we reported that the  program office had not adequately planned for evaluating its exit  pilot at air and sea POEs because the pilot\u2019s evaluation scope and  timeline were compressed. As a result, the US-VISIT program office  extended the pilot from 5 to 11 POEs (nine airports and two  seaports). Notwithstanding the expanded scope of the pilot, the exit  alternatives were not sufficiently evaluated. Specifically, the  program office evaluated these alternatives against three criteria,  including compliance with the exit process. According to the exit  evaluation plan report, the average compliance rate across all three  alternatives was only 24 percent. The evaluation report cited  several reasons for the low compliance rate, including that  compliance during the pilot was voluntary. As a result, the  evaluation report concluded that national deployment of the exit  solution will not meet the desired compliance rate unless the scope  of the exit process is expanded to incorporate an enforcement  mechanism, such as not allowing persons to reenter the United  States if they do not comply with the exit process or not allowing  persons to board a carrier until they are processed by an airline or  the Transportation Security Administration. As of February 2006,  program officials had not conducted any formal evaluation of  enforcement mechanisms or their possible effect on compliance and  cost, and according to the Acting Program Director, they do not plan  to do so.", "DHS Has Not Adequately Justified Increases in, and Disclosed the Scope and Nature of,  Program Management-Related Fiscal Year 2006 Expenditures  Program management is an important and integral aspect of any  system acquisition program. The importance of program  management, however, does not by itself justify any level of  investment in such activities. Rather, investments in program  management capabilities should be viewed the same as investments  in any program capability, meaning the scope, nature, size, and  value of the investment should be disclosed and justified in relation  to the size and significance of the acquisition activities being  performed.", "As the report that we issued earlier this week states, US-VISIT\u2019s  planned investment in program management-related activities has  risen steadily over the last 4 years, while planned investment in  development of new program capabilities has declined. Figure 3  shows the breakdown of planned expenditures for US-VISIT fiscal  year 2002 through 2006 expenditure plans.", "Specifically, the fiscal year 2003 expenditure plan provided $30  million for program management and operations and about $325  million for new development efforts, whereas the fiscal year 2006  plan provided $126 million for program management-related  functions\u2014an increase of $96 million\u2014and $93 million for new  development. This means that the fiscal year 2006 plan proposed  expending $33 million more for program management and  operations than it is for new development.", "The increase in planned program management-related expenditures  is more pronounced if it is viewed as a percentage of planned  development expenditures. Figure 4 shows planned US-VISIT  expenditures for program management and operations as a  percentage of development for fiscal years 2002 thru 2006.", "Specifically, planned program management-related expenditures  represented about 9 percent of planned development in fiscal year  2003, but represented about 135 percent of fiscal year 2006  development, meaning that the fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan  proposed spending about $1.35 on program management-related  activities for each dollar spent on developing new US-VISIT  capability.", "Moreover, the fiscal year 2006 expenditure plan did not explain the  reasons for this recent growth or otherwise justify the sizeable  proposed investment in program management and operations on the  basis of measurable and expected value. Further, the plan did not  adequately describe the range of planned program management and  operations activities.", "Program officials told us that the DHS Acting Undersecretary for  Management raised similar concerns about the large amount of  program management and operations funding in the expenditure  plan. In January 2007, DHS submitted a revised expenditure plan to  the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland  Security, at the committee\u2019s direction, to address their concerns.  The revised plan allocates some program management funds to  individual increments and to two new categories--program services  and data integrity and biometric support, and program and project  support contractor services. However, the revised plan still shows a  relatively sizeable portion of proposed funding going toward  program management-related activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Fully Implemented Key US-VISIT Acquisition and Financial Management Controls", "paragraphs": ["Managing major programs like US-VISIT requires applying discipline  and rigor when acquiring and accounting for systems and services.  Our work and other best practice research have shown that applying  such rigorous management practices improves the likelihood of  delivering expected capabilities on time and within budget. In other  words, the quality of IT systems and services is largely governed by  the quality of the management processes involved in acquiring and  managing them. Some of these processes and practices are  embodied in the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) Capability  Maturity Models\u00ae, which define, among other things acquisition  process management controls that, if implemented effectively, can  greatly increase the chances of acquiring systems that provide  promised capabilities on time and within budget. Other practices are  captured in OMB guidance, which establishes policies for planning,  budgeting, acquisition, and management of federal capital assets.", "Over the last several years, we have made numerous  recommendations aimed at strengthening US-VISIT program  management controls relative to acquisition management, including  for example configuration management, security and privacy  management, earned value management (EVM), and contract  tracking and oversight.", "The program office has taken steps to lay the foundation for  establishing several of these controls. For example, the program  adopted the SEI Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI\u00ae)  to  guide its efforts to employ effective acquisition management  practices, and approved an acquisition management process  improvement plan dated May 16, 2005. The goal, as stated in the  plan, was to conduct an independent CMMI assessment in October  2006 to affirm that requisite process controls were in place and  operating.", "In September 2005, the program office completed an initial  assessment of 13 key acquisition process areas that revealed a  number of weaknesses. To begin addressing these weaknesses, the  program office narrowed the scope of the process improvement  activities from 13 to 6 (project planning, project monitoring and  control, requirements development and management, configuration  management, product and process quality assurance, and risk  management) of the CMMI process areas and revised its process  improvement plan in April 2006 to reflect these changes. In May  2006, the program conducted a second internal assessment of the  six key process areas, and according to the results of this  assessment, improvements were made, but weaknesses remained in  all six process areas. For example,  \u25cf  a number of key acquisition management documents were not  adequately prepared and processes were not sufficiently defined,  including those related to systems development, budget and finance,  facilities, and strategic planning (e.g., product work flow among  organizational units was unclear and not documented); and  \u25cf  roles, responsibilities, work products, expectations, resources, and  accountability of external stakeholder organizations were not well- defined.", "Notwithstanding these weaknesses, program officials told us that  their self-assessments show that they have made incremental  progress in implementing the 113 practices associated with the six  key processes. (See figure 5 for US-VISIT\u2019s progress in implementing  these practices.) However, they also recently decided to postpone  indefinitely the planned October 2006 independent appraisal.  Instead, the program intends to perform quarterly internal  assessments until the results show that they can pass an  independent appraisal. Further, the program has not committed to a  revised target date for having an external appraisal.", "The acquisition management weaknesses in the six key process  areas are exacerbated by weaknesses in other areas. For example,  we recently reported that the US-VISIT contract tracking and  oversight process suffers from a number of weaknesses.  Specifically, we reported that the program had not effectively  overseen US-VISIT-related contract work performed on its behalf by  other DHS and non-DHS agencies, and these agencies did not always  establish and implement the full range of controls associated with  effective management of contractor activities. Further, the program  office and other agencies did not implement effective financial  controls. In particular, the program office and other agencies  managing US-VISIT\u2013related work were unable to reliably report the  scope of contracting expenditures. In addition, some agencies  improperly paid and accounted for related invoices, including  making a duplicate payment and making payments for non-US-VISIT  services from funds designated for US-VISIT.", "Fully and effectively implementing the above discussed key  acquisition management and related controls takes considerable  time. However, considerable time has elapsed since we first  recommended establishment of these controls and they are not yet  operational and it is unclear when they will be. Therefore, it is  important that these improvement efforts stay on track. Until these  capabilities are in place, the program risks not meeting its stated  goals and commitments.", "US-VISIT has not yet implemented other key management practices,  such as developing and implementing a security plan and employing  an EVM system to help manage and control program cost and  schedule. As we previously reported, the program\u2019s 2004 security  plan generally satisfied OMB and the National Institute of Standards  and Technology security guidance. Further, the fiscal year 2006  expenditure plan states that all of the US-VISIT component systems  have been certified and accredited and given full authority to  operate. However, the 2004 security plan preceded the US-VISIT risk  assessment, which was not completed until December 2005, and the  security plan was not updated to reflect this risk assessment.", "According to program officials, they intend to develop a security  strategy by the end of 2006 that reflects the risk assessment. We  have ongoing work for the Senate Committee on Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs to review the information security  controls associated with computer systems and networks  supporting the US-VISIT program.", "Regarding EVM, the program is currently relying on the prime  contractor\u2019s EVM system to manage the prime contractor\u2019s progress  against cost and schedule goals. According to the fiscal year 2006  expenditure plan, the program office has assessed the prime  contractor\u2019s EVM system against relevant standards. However, in  reality, this EVM system was self-certified by the prime contractor in  December 2003 as meeting established standards. OMB requires that  agencies verify contractor self-certifications. The program office has  yet to do this, although program officials told us that they plan to  retain the services of another contractor to perform this validation.  This needs to be done quickly. Our review of the integrated baseline  review, which agencies are required by OMB to complete to ensure  that the EVM program baseline is accurate, showed that it did not  address key baseline considerations, such as cost and schedule  risks.

As we reported, CBP  officials at 12 of 21 land POE sites that we visited told us about US- VISIT-related computer slowdowns and freezes that adversely  affected visitor processing and inspection times at 9 of the 12 sites,  but noted that these problems were not always reported to CBP\u2019s  computer help desk, as required by CBP guidelines. Although  various controls are in place to alert US-VISIT and CBP officials to  problems as they occur, these controls did not alert officials to all  problems (they had been unaware of the problems we identified  before we brought them to their attention). These computer  processing problems have the potential to not only inconvenience  travelers because of the increased time needed to complete the  inspection process, but to compromise security, particularly if CBP  officers are unable to perform biometric checks\u2014one of the critical  reasons US-VISIT was installed at POEs.", "In addition, to permit meaningful program oversight, it is important  that expenditure plans describe how well DHS is progressing against  the commitments made in prior expenditure plans. However, US- VISIT\u2019s expenditure plan for fiscal year 2006 (the fifth expenditure  plan) continued a longstanding pattern of not describing progress  against commitments made in previous plans. For example,  according to the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan, the prime  contractor was to begin integrating the long-term Increment 4  strategy into the interim US-VISIT system\u2019s environment and the  overall DHS enterprise architecture, and that US-VISIT and the  prime contractor would work with the stakeholder community to  identify opportunities for delivery of long-term capabilities under  Increment 4. However, the fiscal year 2006 plan does not discuss  progress or accomplishments relative to these commitments.", "Additionally, the expenditure plan committed to begin deploying the  most effective exit alternative for capturing biometrics at air and sea  POEs during fiscal year 2005. In contrast, the 2006 expenditure plan  states that the exit pilots will continue throughout fiscal year 2006 and does not address whether the fiscal year 2005 schedule  deployment commitment was met. Also, the fiscal year 2006  expenditure plan did not address all performance measures cited in  the fiscal year 2005 plan. Specifically, the 2005 plan included 11  measures. In contrast, the 2006 plan listed 7 measures, 4 of which  are similar, but not identical to, some of the 11 measures in the 2005  plan. This means that several of the 2005 plan\u2019s measures are not  addressed in the 2006 plan. Moreover, even in cases of similar  performance measures, the fiscal year 2006 plan does not  adequately describe progress in meeting commitments. For  example, the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan cited a performance  measurement of \u201cPre-entry watch list hits on biometrically enabled  visa applications.\u201d The fiscal year 2006 plan cites the performance  measure of \u201cNumber of biometric watch list hits for visa applicants  processed at consular offices.\u201d According to the latter plan, in fiscal  year 2005 there were 897 such hits; however, neither plan cites a  performance target against which to gauge progress, assuming that  the two performance measures mean the same thing. Without such  measurements, program performance and accountability can suffer.", "In closing, we would emphasize that after a considerable investment  of time and resources, US-VISIT has met some fairly demanding  legislative requirements for deployment of entry capabilities at most  POEs, and that this achievement owes largely to the hard work and  dedication of individuals in the US-VISIT program office and the  close oversight of the House and Senate Appropriations  Committees. Nevertheless, core capabilities, such as exit, have not  been implemented, and fundamental questions about the program\u2019s  future direction and fit within the larger homeland security context  as well as its return on investment remain unanswered. Moreover,  the program is overdue in establishing the means to ensure that it is  pursuing the right US-VISIT solution, and that it is managing it the  right way.  The longer the program proceeds without these, the  greater the risk that the program will not optimally support mission  operations and will fall short of commitments. Measuring and  disclosing the extent to which these commitments are being met are  also essential to holding the department accountable. We look  forward to continuing to work constructively with the US-VISIT  program to better ensure the program\u2019s success.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our statement.
