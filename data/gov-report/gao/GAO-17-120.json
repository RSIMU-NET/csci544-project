To conduct this work, GAO analyzed agency policies from 2013-2015 (most recent available); interviewed agency officials; and analyzed coordination efforts against relevant key practices GAO identified previously.

Both agencies have improved their collaboration since GAO last reported on the DFC program in 2008. Their current efforts to jointly manage the DFC Support program are consistent with GAO's relevant key collaboration practices. For example, ONDCP and SAMHSA defined and agreed upon common outcomes, such as prioritizing efforts to increase participation from under-represented communities. The two agencies have also funded a range of DFC grantees' activities and report on these activities in their annual evaluation reports. For example, ONDCP reported that from February through July 2014, grantees educated more than 156,000 youth on topics related to the consequences of substance abuse. To illustrate, the 10 grantees GAO interviewed described their specific efforts, including programs for", "Enhancing Skills: To enhance the skills of those in the community, one grantee sponsored a session for local realtors on precautions to take when preparing for open houses\u2014warning them that leftover prescriptions in medicine cabinets present the potential for abuse among those walking through the home for sale.", "Enhancing Access/Reducing Barriers: To reduce cultural barriers, another grantee developed signs with text in the multiple languages spoken throughout the community that shopkeepers could display to emphasize the legal purchase age for alcohol.", "Providing Information: To provide greater information to parents on the consequences of providing alcohol in their homes, a grantee created a slogan to remind parents of their children's needs, \u201cBe my Parent, not my Bartender.\u201d", "The agencies have operating procedures in place, but could enhance grantee compliance and performance monitoring. In particular, SAMHSA does not consistently follow documentation and reporting procedures to ensure grantees' compliance with governing statutes. SAMHSA also has not been accurately reporting to ONDCP on grantee compliance. Specifically for the files GAO reviewed, SAMHSA followed all processes for ensuring that initial applicants had submitted required documentation before awarding them initial grant funding. However, SAMHSA was less consistent in adhering to procedures for confirming documentation in later years of the program. For example, 14 of the 18 grantees that should have had sustainability plans in their files did not. These plans outline how the grantee intends to maintain necessary resources to achieve long-term goals after exiting the program. Prior to GAO's review, ONDCP and SAMHSA officials were not aware of the missing data in the grant files. Without close adherence to existing procedures, and a mechanism to ensure that the documentation it reports to ONDCP is accurate and complete, SAMHSA's performance monitoring capacity is limited and it cannot be certain that grantees are engaging in intended activities and meeting long-term goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SAMHSA develop an action plan with time frames to strengthen DFC grant monitoring and ensure it sends complete and accurate information to ONDCP.

To help curb youth substance abuse, the Drug- Free Communities Act of 1997 established the Drug-Free Communities  (DFC) Support Program\u2014a federal program providing grants for the  establishment of community-based, youth-focused, drug abuse  prevention efforts. The DFC Support Program focuses its efforts on the  prevention and reduction of the use of four primary substances, referred  to in this report as drugs: (1) alcohol, (2) tobacco, (3) marijuana, and (4)  the illicit use of prescription drugs. The Office of National Drug Control  Policy (ONDCP) administers the DFC Support Program, in coordination  with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). In addition,  ONDCP is responsible for, among other things, overseeing and  coordinating the implementation of the Administration\u2019s national drug  control strategy.", "The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006  includes a provision that we routinely assess ONDCP\u2019s programs and  operations. In 2008, we reported on the DFC Support Program and  found weaknesses in grant program administration. We recommended that ONDCP (1) strengthen internal controls; (2) ensure that funded grant  applicants satisfy statutory eligibility criteria; and (3) more clearly define  its own and SAMHSA\u2019s roles and responsibilities. ONDCP agreed and  has made significant improvements and implemented all three  recommendations. This report addresses: (1) the extent to which ONDCP  and SAMHSA use leading practices to coordinate program administration  and the types of activities the DFC Support Program recently funded; and  (2) the extent to which ONDCP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s operating procedures  both ensure DFC grantees comply with governing statutes and provide a  basis for performance monitoring.", "To assess the extent to which ONDCP and SAMHSA use leading  practices to coordinate program administration, we analyzed relevant  documentation, such as policies and procedures including ONDCP\u2019s and  SAMHSA\u2019s inter-agency agreements for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and  2015 (the most recent data available). In addition, we interviewed officials  responsible for the management of the DFC Support Program to discuss  ONDCP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s collaboration practices and assessed them  against leading practices from prior GAO work. We used a subset of  three key practices among the eight key practices previously reported  because we identified these three as the most relevant to the scope and  nature of ONDCP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s partnership. To determine the types  of activities the DFC Support Program has recently funded, we reviewed  grant files from a non-generalizable random sample of 30 grantees from  fiscal year 2015. (See below for more specific details about sample  selection.) We reviewed documents in these files to identify the nature  and frequency of key activities that grantees reported semi-annually to  SAMHSA in their progress reports. We also analyzed an evaluation  summary report for grantees funded in fiscal year 2013 that an ONDCP  contractor produced to gather additional detail on grantees\u2019 activities and  spoke with the contractor for more details on how the information was  collected and summarized. In addition, we interviewed a subset of 10  grantees that we selected at random from our file review sample to gain  greater insights into the specific activities and initiatives in which they  engaged, as well as to learn more about their interactions with agency  officials who oversee the DFC Support Program.", "To assess the extent to which ONDCP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s grant  administration procedures ensure grantees comply with governing  statutes and the agencies have program controls in place to provide a  basis for monitoring and reporting on grantee performance, we reviewed  and analyzed agency policies, guidance documents, and procedures that  were in effect for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015. We then assessed  these procedures and controls against Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government. Further, we reviewed the files we obtained  from the non-generalizable sample of 30 out of 697 grantees awarded  funds in fiscal year 2015. Additionally, since in any given year, some  grantees will be first time grant recipients and others will be more tenured,  we widened our review to include the files for fiscal years 2013 and 2014  for any selected grantee in continuation status. Overall, our review  included 79 individual grant files for the 30 selected grantees. Since an  individual DFC Support Program grantee can be in any year of two 5-year  cycles, we divided grantees into three categories\u2014years 1 and 6 of the  grant; years 2 through 5; and years 7 through 10. This categorization also  aligned with how the program establishes grantee documentation  requirements, since for each category the program requires different  forms and reports from grantees. We then randomly selected 10 grantees  from each category. Specifically, we reviewed and analyzed the more  than 20 types of required documents to assess the extent to which the  agencies follow their policies and procedures and ensure grantee  compliance. We also assessed the reliability of data included in the grant  files by interviewing agency officials responsible for maintaining and  managing the systems that store and produce the data. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting  objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to February  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

SAMHSA  officials also acknowledged that they were not aware of the number of  reports from grantees that were omitted from the record.", "Of the 26 grantees that should have had continuation application  packages in their official grantee files, 9 were missing the required  Federal Financial Report. The Federal Financial Report is a  document in which the grantee details its expenditures,  disbursements, and cash receipts. SAMHSA requires grantees to  submit the Federal Financial Report within 90 days of the fiscal year\u2019s  end. SAMHSA officials acknowledged that the Federal Financial  Reports were likely missing because the grantees did not provide  them and SAMHSA staff did not follow up to obtain them. When we  discussed this finding with SAMHSA officials, they were unaware of  the omission.", "Of the 18 grantees that should have had sustainability plans in their  official grantee files, 14 were missing the required plans. These  sustainability plans are to outline how the grantee intends to maintain  the resources necessary to achieve its long-term goals and continued  progress after exiting the DFC Support Program. According to  SAMHSA officials, 12 of the 14 grantees were missing the  sustainability plans because SAMHSA staff had not uploaded them to  the system of record, and the remaining 2 grantees never submitted  them and the grants management specialist did not follow up to obtain  the document. SAMHSA officials were unaware of these omissions.", "SAMHSA\u2019s policies and procedures require that the official award file  contain the formal, complete record of the history of an award, such as  documents that support verification of statutory eligibility. SAMHSA  officials also told us that its staff is responsible for ensuring that all files  are stored in a shared database system, in accordance with SAMHSA  policy. In addition, the IAA between ONDCP and SAMHSA outlines that  SAMHSA is responsible for ensuring grantees have submitted all required  documents, following up as needed, and reporting to ONDCP on  grantees\u2019 status. According to ONDCP and SAMHSA officials, SAMHSA  did routinely relay reports to ONDCP on grantees\u2019 status. However,  SAMHSA officials acknowledged that they were unaware that files were  missing, which calls into question the effectiveness of their program  monitoring. It also challenges the accuracy and validity of the grantee  status reports that SAMHSA provided to ONDCP. In particular, ONDCP  officials told us they were never made aware that any required grantee  documents were not included in the official record.", "SAMHSA officials said that in March 2016, to strengthen their grants  administration process, they instituted a new internal review process in  which they randomly select 50 grant files per month from their various  grant programs to assess the completeness and accuracy of grantees\u2019  documentation. As part of the internal review process, SAMHSA has also  taken other steps including enhancing training, developing policies and  procedures, and implementing a step-by-step guide and training for grant  managers on entering information into the official grant file. While this  review process had not included the DFC Support Program initially, in  November 2016, while our audit work was nearing completion, officials  said they were planning to expand their focus to incorporate all of  SAMHSA\u2019s grant programs. While officials provided information on how  they planned to address particular deficiencies on a case by case basis,  they did not explain how they planned to ensure systemic remediation of  any issue found repeatedly or a timeframe for implementing the changes.  According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  managers are to (1) promptly evaluate findings from audits and other  reviews, including those showing deficiencies and recommendations, (2)  determine proper actions in response to these findings and  recommendations, and (3) complete, within established time frames, all  actions that correct or otherwise resolve the matters brought to  management\u2019s attention.  Ensuring this new review process is fully  implemented in a sustainable manner will be critical for SAMHSA as it  aims to strengthen DFC grants monitoring. Further, developing an action  plan with time frames for addressing any deficiencies it finds through its  reviews and making systemic changes to mitigate deficiencies on a  prospective basis will also help its management of the DFC program.", "Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that all transactions and other significant events need to be clearly  documented and should be readily available for examination. For the DFC  Support Program, such transactions include SAMHSA\u2019s collection,  storage, and review of grantee documentation. It also includes  SAMHSA\u2019s documentation and reporting of grantee status to ONDCP.  Additionally, control activities\u2014policies, procedures, and mechanisms\u2014 should enforce management\u2019s directives and help ensure that actions are  taken to address risks, such as ensuring DFC grantees are not remiss in  meeting statutory and program requirements. Related, internal controls  for monitoring should generally be designed to assure that ongoing  monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations. This includes  regular management and supervisory activities, comparisons, and  reconciliations. Deficiencies found during ongoing monitoring or through  separate evaluations should be communicated to the individual  responsible for the function and serious matters should be reported to top  management. Control activities like these should be an integral part of an  entity\u2019s accountability for stewardship of government resources.  SAMHSA\u2019s lack of follow up with grantees and its lack of visibility over  omitted documents resulted in incomplete and inaccurate documentation  of status in its reports to ONDCP. Without a method to ensure that  grantee status reporting to ONDCP is complete and accurate, SAMHSA  cannot be certain that grantees are engaging in intended activities, that  funds are being used in accordance with program requirements, and that  all other statutory requirements and grant program terms and conditions  have been met."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, ONDCP and SAMHSA have taken steps to improve the DFC  Support Program by employing leading collaboration practices and  funding a variety of drug prevention activities. However, SAMHSA\u2019s  inconsistent adherence to some procedures, particularly with respect to  grantees that are funded year after year, has resulted in the persistence  of missing or incomplete documentation in the official grantee files, which  has limited performance monitoring. Developing an action plan that  includes time frames for addressing deficiencies found through its grant  file reviews and making systemic changes based on its findings, as well  as developing a method for ensuring complete and accurate grantee  status reporting to ONDCP, would position SAMHSA officials to further  strengthen monitoring efforts.
