Within statutorily defined rural areas (RHS-eligible areas):", "Both agencies served large numbers of rural borrowers, but FHA served over 35 percent more than RHS, while RHS reached a greater number of borrowers in the more rural parts of RHS-eligible areas.", "Most of the borrowers served by each agency had annual incomes below $60,000. But consistent with RHS's statutory income limits, the median borrower income for RHS ($44,000) was well below that for FHA ($57,000).", "RHS and FHA borrowers had similar credit scores (around 685 at the median) and ratios of housing expenses to monthly gross income (23\u201324 percent at the median).", "Borrowers in both programs had high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios (loan amount divided by home value). But RHS's no-down-payment requirement and FHA's statutorily required 3.5 percent down payment resulted in higher LTV ratios for RHS than for FHA (medians of 101 and 96.5 percent, respectively).", "Significant portions of RHS and FHA borrowers could have met the criteria of the other program. For example, at least 36 percent of RHS borrowers could have met FHA's criteria, including the 3.5 percent minimum down payment.", "In RHS-eligible areas, RHS loans guaranteed in fiscal years 2010\u20132011 performed worse than corresponding FHA loans after 3 years. Specifically, for borrowers whose incomes fell within RHS limits, RHS's 3-year troubled loan rate (the share of loans 90 or more days late, in foreclosure, or terminated with a claim) was 7 percent, compared with 6 percent for FHA. GAO estimated that RHS's loans would be expected to perform worse than FHA's due partly to RHS borrowers' higher LTV ratios.", "Borrower costs\u2014at loan closing and paid monthly\u2014were lower for RHS loans than for FHA loans. Due to differences in down-payment requirements, a borrower purchasing a $125,000 home in 2014 would have paid $4,375 more in up-front costs with an FHA loan than with an RHS loan. Also, FHA (which must maintain a capital reserve) charged borrowers a higher annual guarantee fee than RHS, which has no capital requirement. Due largely to the difference in this fee (charged monthly), a borrower's initial monthly payments would have been about 7 percent lower with an RHS loan (assuming a 3.75 percent interest rate).", "GAO's analysis provides additional evidence of how the programs overlap in terms of income, location, and borrower qualifications. It also highlights issues for RHS and FHA to consider in evaluating opportunities to consolidate these programs, as GAO recommended in 2012. Specifically, differences in the performance and borrower costs of RHS and FHA loans underscore important tradeoffs. Higher LTV ratios and lower guarantee fees help make mortgages more affordable. However, these features also may elevate financial risks to the federal government from increased loan defaults and less revenue to cover unanticipated costs. Agency consideration of these issues would aid congressional decision-making about potential program consolidation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no new recommendations in this report but maintains that RHS and FHA should evaluate and report on opportunities to consolidate their similar housing programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Rural Housing Service (RHS)  has helped more than 1 million low- and moderate-income families in  rural communities finance homes through its Single Family Mortgage  Guarantee Program. The program protects private lenders against  losses on loans that finance the purchase of properties in areas statutorily  designated as rural (RHS-eligible areas) or that refinance existing RHS  mortgages. At the end of fiscal year 2015, RHS had a portfolio of more  than $112 billion in outstanding guarantees. The Department of Housing  and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA)  also protects lenders against losses on single-family mortgage loans (by  providing mortgage insurance) and has a much larger program. At the  end of 2015, FHA had a portfolio of more than $1 trillion in outstanding  guarantees. FHA\u2019s program has no geographic or borrower income  restrictions; therefore, it too guarantees loans in rural areas.", "Although the programs have some salient differences, in an August 2012  report, we found overlap in the products offered, borrowers\u2019 income  levels, and geographic areas reached by the RHS and FHA single-family  mortgage guarantee programs. We concluded that there were  opportunities for increased collaboration and consolidation in the  programs. Although Congress ultimately would have to decide on actions  requiring statutory change, we noted that agencies (including RHS and  FHA) could further this effort by exploring the potential benefits and costs  of consolidating overlapping programs. Such analyses represent a key  step on the path to determining the viability of consolidation and helping  inform Congress\u2019s decision-making process. Thus, in 2012, we  recommended that the agencies evaluate and report on the specific  opportunities for consolidating similar housing programs, including those  requiring statutory changes. The agencies (including RHS and FHA)  generally agreed with our recommendation, but they have yet to report on  such opportunities, and our recommendation remains unaddressed.", "Additionally, relatively little is known about how the loan performance of  the two programs compares. For example, one of RHS\u2019s performance  goals is to be within a specified range of FHA\u2019s delinquency rates. RHS  has generally met this goal and reported to Congress in April 2015 that  during the prior 5 years (2010\u20132014) RHS-guaranteed loans generally  performed slightly better than FHA-guaranteed loans. However, our  March 2016 report found RHS\u2019s analysis did not account for the age of  the loans, property location, or other loan and borrower characteristics  that can influence performance. We recommended that RHS improve its  measures comparing RHS and FHA loan performance, potentially by  making comparisons on a cohort basis and limiting comparisons to loans  made in similar geographic areas. RHS has yet to make changes to its  performance measures and our 2016 recommendation remains  unaddressed.", "You asked us to expand on the analysis in our 2012 report and compare  the characteristics and performance of rural single-family loans  guaranteed by RHS and FHA. This report (1) compares the property,  borrower, and loan characteristics of RHS- and FHA-guaranteed loans in  RHS-eligible areas; (2) estimates the number of RHS and FHA borrowers  in RHS-eligible areas who could have met key criteria for the other  program and describes factors borrowers consider in choosing between  the two programs; and (3) compares the performance of RHS- and FHA- guaranteed loans in RHS-eligible areas.", "To compare the property, borrower, and loan characteristics of RHS- and  FHA-guaranteed loans, we analyzed loan-level data on mortgages for  home purchases guaranteed by the agencies in RHS-eligible areas in  2010\u20132014. In addition to focusing on home purchase loans in RHS- eligible areas (the areas in which both agencies can operate), we took  other steps to make the RHS and FHA data comparable, such as by  limiting our analysis to 30-year, fixed-rate loans, and by excluding loans  for units in condominium and cooperative developments. We compared  the distributions and number of loans for key property characteristics  (such as the state and census region); borrower characteristics (such as  credit score and debt burden ratios); and loan characteristics (such as  loan amount and down-payment percentage) at the time the mortgages  were originated. To further differentiate the geographic comparisons of  the loans, we used Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes (developed by  USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service and the U.S. Health Resources and  Services Administration) to assess the \u201crurality\u201d of a property location (as  measured by factors such as commuting patterns and population  density).", "To assess the extent to which borrowers could have met key criteria for  both RHS- and FHA-guaranteed home purchase mortgages and the  factors borrowers consider in choosing between the two programs, we  reviewed RHS and FHA documentation on their underwriting  requirements and qualifying benchmarks to understand similarities and  differences in program eligibility and qualification criteria. We analyzed  RHS and FHA data for loans guaranteed in 2010\u20132014 and applied  general agency requirements and benchmarks to estimate the number  and percentage of RHS and FHA borrowers who could have met key  criteria for each program. Our estimates represent the minimum number  of borrowers who could have met key criteria for the other program. We  also analyzed the costs for RHS- and FHA-guaranteed loans and  calculated illustrative up-front and monthly borrower costs for each  program under various home price and interest rate scenarios. To confirm  key observations from this analysis, we interviewed a nonprobability  sample of eight mortgage lenders selected to capture variation in the  geographic areas served, volume of guaranteed loans originated, and mix  of RHS and FHA business. To gain additional perspective on mortgage  lending in rural areas, we interviewed mortgage industry groups selected  to cover a range of stakeholders in the RHS and FHA guarantee  programs. These included the Independent Community Bankers of  America, National Association of Mortgage Brokers, National Association  of Realtors, and Mortgage Bankers Association.", "To compare the performance of RHS- and FHA-guaranteed loans for  home purchases in RHS-eligible areas, we analyzed RHS and FHA loan- level data and determined the performance status (current, delinquent, in  the foreclosure process, prepaid, or terminated with a claim) of loans  guaranteed in 2010\u20132012 at 12-month intervals (anniversary months)  starting from the month the first payment was due until September 30,  2014. For this comparison, we limited the FHA-guaranteed loans to  those obtained by borrowers with incomes within the county-level  household income limits set by RHS (which we determined using  borrower income). We restricted the data in this way to account for  RHS\u2019s household income limits and FHA\u2019s lack of such limits, which  resulted in some FHA borrowers with higher incomes than RHS is  allowed to serve. We classified loans as troubled if they were 90 or more  days delinquent during the anniversary month, were in the foreclosure  process, or had terminated with a claim. We compared the performance  of RHS- and FHA-guaranteed loans after 2 and 3 years of performance  through the end of September 2014. In addition, we developed a  statistical model to examine the extent to which differences between RHS  and FHA troubled loan rates (the number of troubled loans divided by the  number of loans guaranteed) after 2 and 3 years stemmed from the  characteristics of their guaranteed portfolios (for example, loan and  borrower characteristics).", "To assess the reliability of the RHS and FHA data, we tested the data for  missing values, outliers, and obvious errors and reviewed documentation  on the process that RHS and FHA used to collect and ensure the  reliability and integrity of their data. We also interviewed knowledgeable  RHS and FHA officials to discuss interpretations of various data fields.  We concluded that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for  purposes of comparing the characteristics and performance of RHS- and  FHA-guaranteed loans and for estimating the percentage of borrowers  who could have met key criteria for both programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to September  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The guaranteed loans generally feature attractive interest rates  (comparable to those of prime loans), but serve borrowers who may have  difficulty qualifying for conventional mortgage credit (that is, mortgage  loans without government guarantees). The programs protect the private  lender or other mortgage holder, because the federal government  commits to pay part or all of a loan\u2019s outstanding principal and interest if  the borrower defaults. In exchange, borrowers are required to pay up- front and annual guarantee fees. Both the RHS and FHA single-family  programs guarantee 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages for borrower-occupied  homes. The mortgage proceeds can be used to buy, build, or refinance  homes. The mortgage loans require little or no down payment from  borrowers and allow financing of up-front guarantee fees. These terms  generally result in high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios (the amount of the loan  divided by the value of the home at origination), including LTV ratios  greater than 100 percent.", "As shown in figure 1, both the RHS and FHA loan guarantee programs  have requirements and benchmarks that lenders use to assess borrower  eligibility and qualifications. For example, to be eligible for an RHS loan,  the property must be located in an RHS-eligible area and the borrower\u2019s  household income must not exceed 115 percent of the area median  income, based on household size (which effectively limits the loan  amount). Although FHA does not have income or geographic limits, the  amount of the loans it guarantees is limited by statute. Both programs  also require lenders to assess the borrower\u2019s willingness and ability to  repay the loan. To make this assessment, lenders use information  collected during the loan origination process\u2014including a borrower\u2019s  credit score, a numeric value ranging from 300 to 850 (calculated based  on credit reports from the national credit bureaus) that indicates a  borrower\u2019s ability to repay future obligations; payment-to-income (PTI)  ratio, the percentage of a borrower\u2019s income that goes toward total  mortgage debt payments; and the debt-service-to-income (DTI) ratio, the  percentage of a borrower\u2019s income that goes toward all recurring debt  payments. RHS and FHA established specific benchmarks lenders use to  evaluate the borrower\u2019s qualifications. RHS and FHA also allow lenders to  consider loans for approval that differ from these benchmarks by  considering compensating factors (such as proof of continuous  employment or cash reserves) that demonstrate the borrower\u2019s ability to  repay the loan.", "Both RHS and FHA lenders evaluate the overall creditworthiness of a  loan guarantee applicant and determine the associated risk of default  using a version of FHA\u2019s automated mortgage score card.

In addition, for RHS borrowers who could not  have met the down-payment requirement, the extent to which they could  have obtained funds from other sources to meet the requirement is  unknown.

They stated that borrowers typically  prefer the RHS-guaranteed loan over the FHA-guaranteed loan because  the borrower\u2019s up-front and monthly costs (measured by the amounts  borrowers are required to pay) are lower.

They told us that  for borrowers who meet the criteria for both programs, differences  between the programs\u2014except for cost\u2014were small and had a minimal  impact on borrowers. For example, lenders told us that there is little  difference in how borrowers access the programs. Specifically, borrowers  can access both RHS- and FHA-guaranteed loans through a variety of  channels, including nationwide lenders, local banks, and mortgage  brokers. Similarly, they explained that RHS\u2019s 2-stage process for issuing  guarantees versus FHA\u2019s 1-stage process did not cause borrowers to opt  for FHA-guaranteed loans. In addition, a 2016 survey found that up-front  and monthly costs were a factor borrowers consider in choosing a home  mortgage and that the importance of costs increased for borrowers with  lower household incomes.", "Both RHS and FHA borrowers pay certain up-front and monthly costs for  their guaranteed loans. In addition to closing costs and fees such as  payments for home inspections and appraisals, RHS and FHA borrowers  pay an up-front guarantee fee, any required down payment, and an  annual guarantee fee (charged monthly). RHS and FHA charge the up- front and annual guarantee fees to help offset the cost to taxpayers of the  loan guarantee programs. The guarantee fee amounts differ, in part  because the programs have different requirements and goals for covering  their long-term costs. According to RHS officials, since 2010 RHS has  had the goal of making each year\u2019s new cohort of guaranteed loans  credit-subsidy-neutral. That is, initially the present value of the lifetime  estimated revenue (cash inflow) equals the present value of lifetime  estimated expenses (cash outflow).", "In contrast, FHA historically has estimated that its loan guarantee  program has a negative subsidy rate for each new cohort. That is, initially  the present value of lifetime estimated revenue exceeds the present value  of lifetime estimated expenses. FHA\u2019s approach is consistent with the  statutory requirement that it maintain a 2 percent reserve for its primary  mortgage guarantee fund. FHA\u2019s capital reserve represents the  amounts in excess of those needed for estimated claims or other costs  and is used to cover unanticipated increases in those estimated costs  before FHA draws on funds available through its permanent indefinite  budget authority. RHS does not have a similar requirement, and  therefore draws directly on its permanent and indefinite budget authority  to cover all estimated cost increases.", "As described in the hypothetical example below, borrower costs (as  measured by amounts required at loan closing and paid monthly) would  be lower for an RHS-guaranteed loan than for an FHA-guaranteed loan  for the same property. On the basis of statements by most of the  lenders we spoke with, the example assumes the same interest rate for  both loans.", "As described previously, FHA requires borrowers to make a 3.5  percent down payment, but RHS has no down-payment  requirement. Thus, RHS borrowers would not need to bring any  cash for a down payment to closing.", "RHS\u2019s up-front guarantee fee is higher than FHA\u2019s. In 2014, RHS\u2019s  fee was 2 percent of the loan amount and FHA\u2019s was 1.75 percent.  However, according to lenders with whom we spoke, most RHS and  FHA borrowers finance their up-front guarantee fee into the loan  amount and therefore do not need to bring cash to closing to cover  this payment.", "Both programs require borrowers to pay an annual guarantee fee  (charged monthly) for the life of the loan, which is calculated based on  the scheduled outstanding loan balance. In 2014, RHS\u2019s fee was 0.5  percent and FHA\u2019s minimum fee (for loans of $625,000 or less with  LTV ratios of 95 percent or more) was 1.2 percent.", "As shown in figure 14, a hypothetical RHS borrower purchasing a  $125,000 home in 2014 (near the median loan amount for home  purchases made with RHS-guaranteed loans from 2010\u20132014) would  have had lower up-front costs (based on the required down payment and  assuming financing of up-front guarantee fees) than a borrower with an  FHA-guaranteed loan. Assuming a 3.75 percent interest rate, the monthly  mortgage payments (including the annual guarantee fee) during the first  year would have been $50 less, or 7 percent lower, with an RHS- guaranteed loan than with an FHA-guaranteed loan. Over the life of the  loan, assuming the borrower made all monthly scheduled payments for  30 years, the RHS borrower would have paid approximately 58 percent  less in annual guarantee fees than the FHA borrower (approximately  $11,000 for the RHS borrower versus $27,000 for the FHA borrower).", "While RHS-guaranteed loans have lower up-front and monthly costs, they  often have higher LTV ratios than FHA-guaranteed loans, because RHS  does not require a down payment. In the hypothetical situation presented  in figure 14, the RHS borrower\u2019s LTV ratio at origination is 102 percent (a  negative equity position), compared with 98 percent for the FHA  borrower. Because RHS borrowers often start off with negative home  equity, they may have fewer options than FHA borrowers to avoid default  if they experience financial troubles. For example, they may find it more  difficult to sell or refinance their homes to relieve unsustainable mortgage  payments. Additionally, RHS borrowers may take longer than FHA  borrowers to build sufficient home equity to refinance into a conventional  loan without needing to pay additional guarantee fees.", "RHS loans\u2019 higher LTV ratios and lower guarantee fees relative to FHA  loans help make loans more affordable. However, these features may  also increase financial risks to the federal government from increased  loan defaults and less revenue to cover unanticipated costs. Specifically,  as discussed further in the next section of this report, higher LTV ratios  are associated with a higher probability of troubled loan performance.  Furthermore, in setting guarantee fees, RHS does not have to raise  sufficient revenue to maintain a capital reserve as FHA does. As a result,  RHS\u2019s program is not designed to cover unanticipated cost increases  without drawing on its permanent and indefinite budget authority.

For RHS and  FHA separately, we analyzed the statistical relationships between the  variables and the probability of the guaranteed loans becoming troubled  after 3 years (that is, we estimated changes in the troubled loan rate  associated with variations in the value of the variables). In general, we  found that the statistical relationships between the variables were similar  for both agencies. These similarities suggest that the way the agencies  and lenders implement the two guarantee loan programs, including  methods for evaluating default risk and ensuring compliance with  underwriting standards, would be expected to yield similar troubled loan  rates for loans with comparable characteristics.

We maintain that there is significant  overlap between the RHS and FHA loan guarantee programs in RHS- eligible areas, as evidenced by the estimated 36 percent of RHS  borrowers and 22 percent of FHA borrowers who could have met the  criteria for both programs. Furthermore, we found that the majority of  RHS borrowers could have met individual FHA eligibility requirements  (99 percent for loan amount and 51 percent for down payment) and  individual qualifying benchmarks (99 percent for credit score, 85  percent for PTI ratio, and 79 percent for DTI ratio).", "Regarding our estimate of RHS borrowers with sufficient liquid assets  to make a 3.5 percent down payment, USDA noted that many of them  would have had little or no savings left to meet the additional  expenses associated with homeownership if they had made such a  down payment. USDA also said that the greater affordability of RHS  loans compared with FHA loans helps families meet other financial  needs. Our report discusses differences in RHS and FHA borrower  costs, including the down payment and guarantee fees that make  RHS loans more affordable. It also recognizes the view that some  borrowers may want to use their liquid assets to improve the home,  cover other expenses, or maintain savings for future use rather than  make a down payment. However, our report also describes important  trade-offs associated with these lower costs. For example, because  RHS borrowers are not required to make a down payment and can  finance their up-front guarantee fee, they often start off with negative  home equity (LTV ratios over 100 percent). As we note in our report,  they therefore may have fewer options than FHA borrowers to avoid  default if they experience financial trouble. Additionally, RHS\u2019s higher  LTV ratios and lower guarantee fees relative to FHA also may  increase financial risk to the federal government from higher potential  loan defaults and less revenue to cover unanticipated costs of the  loan guarantees.", "USDA said that for methodological reasons, it did not believe that the  differences we identified between expected RHS and FHA troubled  loan rates were meaningful. USDA stated that RHS\u2019s higher expected  troubled loan rates were partly attributable to RHS\u2019s higher LTV ratios  (often greater than 100 percent) and that our performance analysis  did not fully account for differences in LTV ratios between the RHS  and FHA portfolios. USDA added that there could be intraregional  differences in loan characteristics between RHS and FHA that were  not reflected in our analysis. We maintain that the differences  between expected troubled loan rates for RHS and FHA are  meaningful and that our methodology properly accounted for  differences between the RHS and FHA portfolios regarding LTV ratios  and geographic areas served. Our statistical model included an LTV  variable with four categories, including a category for loans with LTV  ratios at or above 100 percent (which accounted for most of RHS\u2019s  portfolio) and a category for loans with ratios of 96 to 99.9 percent  (which accounted for most of FHA\u2019s portfolio). We used that structure  based on our analysis of RHS loans, which found that loans with LTV  ratios slightly above 100 percent performed worse than those with  ratios slightly below 100 percent. We specifically highlight this issue in  appendix VI of our report. This appendix contains discussion and  analysis showing the importance of differentiating loans at the high  end of the LTV range in modeling expected RHS loan performance  and comparing the performance of the RHS and FHA portfolios. In  addition, our analysis of expected loan performance took multiple  steps to account for the potential impact of geographic differences  between the RHS and FHA portfolios on loan performance.  Specifically, we (1) restricted FHA loans to those for properties in  RHS-eligible areas, (2) differentiated, within RHS-eligible areas,  between areas that were more rural and more urbanized, (3) included  a set of variables in our model to control for house price appreciation  at the state level, and (4) included a set of regional indicator variables  (representing the nine census divisions) in our model to help control  for factors not directly measured by other explanatory variables but  that might differ by region.", "Finally, USDA said it did not believe that \u201ca single monolithic housing  department\u201d would best serve the highly differentiated housing market  in rural America and that it was committed to seeking opportunities for  intra-agency collaboration to expand mortgage access and improve  the quality of housing for rural families. Our report does not state or  intend to suggest that a single agency or single program is  necessarily the best way to serve rural housing needs. Rather, our  report analyzes the extent of overlap between two similar programs  and identifies issues that should be considered in assessing  opportunities for consolidation.

Based on our  analysis of the program requirements for RHS and FHA refinance loans,  we determined that certain aspects of RHS\u2019s and FHA\u2019s program policies  made direct comparison of the two programs problematic.

Key static information at loan origination includes  borrower income, credit score, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, loan amount,  debt-service-to-income (DTI) ratio, mortgage interest rate, and an  indicator for whether the borrower was a first-time homebuyer. These  characteristics are associated with loan performance, as follows.", "Borrowers with higher credit scores are less likely to have missed  payments than borrowers with lower credit scores.", "Equity, which is defined as the value of the property minus the  balance of the mortgage, is associated with better loan performance.  The LTV ratio measures initial equity; larger down payments at loan  origination are associated with better loan performance.", "Larger loan amounts require larger payments, which can put more  financial stress on households struggling to fulfill various financial  commitments.", "DTI ratio is a measure of how stretched a household may be to make  scheduled mortgage and other debt payments.", "Higher interest rates are associated with larger payments, and a  mortgage rate with a large spread over a reference rate may  represent the lender\u2019s assessment that the borrower presents higher  risk of troubled loan performance. Rather than incorporating the  mortgage interest rate directly, we calculate the spread of the  mortgage rate over the constant maturity 10-year Treasury rate in the  month of loan origination.", "First-time homebuyer status can be a risk factor, potentially reflecting  a new homeowner\u2019s limited experience with the risks and costs of  homeownership.", "A borrower can build equity over time if housing values appreciate or by  paying down their mortgage balance. We used data from a Federal  Housing Finance Agency house price index to develop a house price  appreciation measure, using state-level indexes of house prices for the  nonmetropolitan portions of each state (or a neighboring state in three  instances) over the specific interval linking a loan\u2019s origination to a  specific payment anniversary. We also included a set of census division  dummy variables, a set of first payment quarter dummy variables, and a  set of \u201ccommunity type\u201d dummy variables based on USDA\u2019s Rural-Urban  Commuting Area code construct. These dummy variables may help  control for other factors not directly measured by the other explanatory  factors listed, including any that may have varied by region of the country,  time of loan origination, or community type.", "We also included information for RHS borrowers on the amount of liquid  assets available to the borrower at loan origination. This permitted us to  explore the effects of a financial cushion at the time of loan origination for  RHS loans, but not for FHA loans separately or for the model using RHS  and FHA data pooled together."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RHS Program Considerations and Comparable FHA Loans", "paragraphs": ["To present an appropriate comparison group of FHA loans, we  considered other issues related to RHS program features so that we  could exclude FHA loans that would not qualify for the RHS program.  First, RHS has a rural focus, and its loans are available only in specific  mapped (RHS-eligible) areas. FHA loan availability is not restricted by  geography. To avoid comparing RHS loans to FHA loans outside of RHS- eligible areas, which may perform differently from loans in RHS-eligible  areas, we excluded from our analysis FHA (and RHS) loans in census  tracts for which less than 95 percent of the tract\u2019s land area is in an RHS- eligible area. As shown in table 43, this excluded most FHA loans but  relatively few RHS loans.", "Second, to qualify for an RHS loan, a borrower\u2019s household income may  not exceed 115 percent of the area median income, a threshold that  varies across the country and over time. FHA borrowers are not subject to  income restrictions. Thus, there will be FHA borrowers with incomes  exceeding the RHS program limits in RHS-eligible areas. To avoid  comparing RHS loans to FHA loans that went to higher-income  borrowers, we excluded borrowers with incomes that exceeded the RHS  program limits. For instance, the borrowers who received the 203,319  FHA loans in table 43 that were made in RHS-eligible areas also had  incomes that met the RHS program limits. The number of FHA loans in  RHS-eligible areas without regard to borrower income limits was  276,933. We also present results for a subset of loans that are in  communities in RHS-eligible areas considered to be the most rural, as  defined using the Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selection of Anniversary Month and Performance Status", "paragraphs": ["We faced a trade-off between the number of loans we could include in the  statistical analysis and the degree of loan seasoning we could select.  September 2014 is the last month for which we could determine status for  any loan, and the earliest loans in our data set were originated in the  beginning of fiscal year 2010. As a general approximation, no loan  originated after fiscal year 2011 will have a 36-month (3-year) anniversary  by the end of fiscal year 2014. In contrast, all loans originated before  fiscal year 2014 will have a 12-month (1-year) history available by the end  of fiscal year 2014. Typically, relatively few loans exhibit troubled  performance early in their history (for instance, at their 1-year  anniversary). Thus, more seasoned loans are likely to provide a better  indicator of the ultimate performance of a group of loans. Figure 18 shows  the relationship between the numbers of loans that would be available for  our analysis given the selection of alternative anniversary periods. For  illustration, the number of loans refers to the number of loans that would  have the requisite history given a choice of anniversary month.  Performance of these loans is defined in terms of the share of loans that  are troubled. Less than 1.5 percent of loans show troubled performance  at 1 year, while more than 6 percent of loans show troubled performance  by 3 years.", "We chose to measure status as of the 3-year anniversary period to model  loan performance, although we do present some results in which we use  the 2-year anniversary period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Functional Form", "paragraphs": ["In terms of functional form, we express each continuous variable as a  series of dummy variables that exhaust the continuous variable\u2019s range.

This permitted  flexibility in determining the effects of changes in the value of an  explanatory factor on changes in performance, and for comparing the  effects as estimated on the set of RHS loans to the effects as estimated  on the set of FHA loans. We used this feature to trace the relationship  between changes in an explanatory factor across its range and the  expected probability of troubled performance.", "We provide a table of mean values for this specification later, but table 44  presents information on the distribution of these variables in a more  conventional form. These values are for the specification using a 3-year  anniversary period, loans in the RHS-eligible areas, and borrowers with  incomes meeting the RHS program limits.", "Notably, and as discussed elsewhere in this report, the distributions of  some key characteristics are quite similar between the two sets of  loans\u2014particularly credit score and interest rate spread values. RHS  borrowers had lower incomes, smaller loan amounts, and lower DTI  ratios. House price appreciation was slightly more favorable for RHS  than for FHA. A greater share of RHS borrowers were first-time  homebuyers.", "Both the RHS and FHA programs feature low or no down payments.  However, the programs have different down-payment requirements,  which affect the distribution of LTV ratios. FHA loans are concentrated at  an LTV value of 96.5 percent, while many RHS loan amounts exceed the  value of the property at loan origination\u2014that is, have an LTV ratio  exceeding 100 percent. The dummy variable construct helps to model  LTV effects given the skewed distribution of values.", "We developed two sets of dummy variables to capture LTV effects: one  with three categories in which the top category includes all loans with LTV  values at or above 96, and the second with four categories in which the  top category includes all loans with LTV values at or above 100 and the  next-to-top category includes LTV values at or above 96 but less than  100. Most loans for both agencies exceed an LTV value of 96, but the  three-category model does not distinguish a value of 102 from a value of  98. The four-category model makes this distinction, but given the nature  of the two programs, almost all of the loans that have LTV values  exceeding 100 are RHS loans.", "The model includes only fixed-rate loans with 30-year terms for home  purchases. In addition, we excluded loans for units in condominiums  and cooperative developments; observations with missing or extreme  values of explanatory variables; observations for which certain date  values seem inappropriate\u2014for example, mortgages that appear to  terminate before they originate; and observations for which we could not  determine an unambiguous measure of the performance status."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Performance Comparison Using Agency-Specific Model Results", "paragraphs": ["We compared the performance of RHS loans to that of FHA loans by first  examining agency-specific model results.

In particular, we compared the predicted performance of a  loan with average RHS characteristics to a loan with average FHA  characteristics for particular characteristics of interest.

At the same time, there are some differences. For instance,  increases in borrower credit scores decrease the expected probability of a  loan being troubled by the 3-year anniversary, and there are dramatic  declines as credit scores increase from the lower to the higher portions of  the credit score range for both RHS and FHA loans (see fig. 19).  However, at the lower portions of the range, RHS loans have a higher  probability of being troubled, holding other factors constant, than FHA  loans. But in both cases these probabilities decrease rapidly throughout  the credit score range and converge by the high end of the range.  Differences between RHS and FHA estimated coefficients are statistically  significant except at the high end of the credit score range, suggesting  that loans to RHS borrowers with low credit scores are somewhat more  likely to perform worse, other factors held constant, than loans to FHA  borrowers with low credit scores.", "Increases in borrower income were associated with decreased probability  of a loan being troubled by the 3-year anniversary (see fig. 20). There  were no significant differences between the estimated RHS and FHA  coefficients.", "As shown in figure 21, larger loan amounts were associated with higher  probabilities of troubled performance by the 3-year anniversary. There  were no significant differences between the estimated RHS and FHA  coefficients.", "As shown in figure 22, increases in the DTI ratio were associated with  modest increases in the probability of troubled performance by the 3-year  anniversary. The differences in the estimated coefficients in the greater- than-31-to-36 category and the greater-than-46 category were statistically  significant (although relatively few RHS borrowers were in the latter  category).", "There were some differences between the agencies in the estimated  effects of mortgage rate spread (see fig. 23). For both agencies, higher  spreads were associated with higher estimated probabilities of troubled  performance by the 3-year anniversary. However, the estimates for RHS  exhibit a relatively flat pattern (that is, the probability of troubled  performance was not as sensitive to changes in the mortgage rate  spread) compared with the FHA estimates.", "As previously noted, both the RHS and FHA programs have low or no  down-payment features, and more than one-half of RHS borrowers had  LTV ratios at origination that exceeded 100 percent. However, fewer than  1 percent of FHA loans had LTV ratios exceeding 100 percent, which  provides little rationale for modeling FHA loan performance on a stand- alone basis using a four-category LTV specification\u2014that is, using a  specification with a separate category for loans with LTVs of 100 percent  or more. The four-category specification is more appropriate for modeling  RHS loan performance. For both agencies, the expected probability of a  loan being troubled by the 3-year anniversary increases with LTV values,  with the exception of the top category for FHA loans. Our results show  that for RHS loans, moving to the LTV category with values at or  exceeding 100 percent was associated with an increase in the probability  of a loan being troubled by the anniversary date (see fig. 24). The  differences between the RHS and FHA coefficient estimates were not  statistically significant.", "As shown in figure 25, the influence of house price appreciation was  modest for RHS and FHA loans, possibly in part because overall rates of  house price appreciation were moderate during the period covered by our  analysis. The differences between the estimated RHS and FHA  coefficients were not statistically significant.", "The estimated effects of first-time homebuyer status differed in the  agency-specific regressions. Both programs are attractive to first-time  homebuyers because of the low (or no) down-payment requirements. In  our data set, 85 percent of RHS borrowers and 76 percent of FHA  borrowers were first-time homebuyers. However, the share of FHA  borrowers who were first-time homebuyers was greater in locations that  are not eligible for the RHS program. In the FHA regression, the  estimated coefficient for first-time homebuyer status is positive (it is  associated with a higher expected probability of troubled loan  performance) and statistically significant. In the RHS regression, the  estimated coefficient is not statistically significant at the 10 percent level.  This suggests that non-first-time homebuyer status is not associated with  better loan performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Comparison Using Pooled Agency Data", "paragraphs": ["In general, we believe that the performance of RHS and FHA loans is well  explained by the model. Additionally, given the similar patterns of  association between key explanatory characteristics and the expected  probability of troubled loan performance, we believe it is reasonable to  use the model and a pooled data set\u2014that is, data from both agencies  combined\u2014to investigate how differences between the portfolio  characteristics of the two agencies influence loan performance. The  presence of a similar underlying model structure is evidenced by the RHS  and FHA stand-alone regressions, which showed similar decreasing  relationships between borrower credit scores and the expected probability  of troubled loan performance (that is, high expected values at low credit  scores and steep declines in expected values as scores increase). While  the estimates were significantly different across portions of the credit  score range, for other important characteristics the similarity of the  underlying model structure was confirmed by similarities in the  association with troubled loan status and the absence of statistically  significant differences between the two agencies. In particular, we  observed similar decreasing relationships between borrower income and  the expected probability of troubled loan performance and similar  increasing relationships between loan amount and expected troubled loan  performance.", "The advantage in assuming a common model structure and using a  pooled data set is that we can use the estimated coefficients to calculate  the expected probability of a loan with particular characteristic values  being in a troubled status by the 36th month anniversary. One  comparison is to calculate these probabilities using the mean values for  the entire set of explanatory characteristics observed for each agency  (agency-specific mean values). Another method of comparison is to  calculate these probabilities using the mean values of the pooled  characteristics (pooled mean values) to provide a base value, and then to  substitute agency-specific mean values for particular characteristics. For  example, if RHS borrowers had riskier characteristics than FHA  borrowers, then given the set of coefficient estimates for the pooled data,  the expected probability of a loan being troubled by the anniversary  period would be higher for RHS than for FHA. To the extent that each  agency\u2019s borrower characteristics are similar, the expected probabilities  for each agency will be similar. To the extent that the characteristics  diverge, the probabilities will diverge.

This had  the effect of including many more FHA observations with relatively  higher incomes\u2014improving expected FHA performance\u2014and serves  to highlight the importance of borrower income.", "Second, we also estimated a model specification with three LTV ratio  categories instead of four. That is, we combined the top two  categories of the range, so that the top category included all LTV ratio  values greater than or equal to 96 percent. Given the categorical  nature of the way variables are defined, in this specification it  becomes impossible to distinguish between LTV ratio values that are  slightly less than 100 percent from those that are slightly above. In  contrast to the primary specification, this specification predicts better  performance for RHS than for FHA for reasons described below.", "Third, we also chose a specification in which we included only those  locations that were the most rural in character (large rural towns and  small town and isolated rural areas) on the basis of the Rural-Urban  Commuting Area codes. This permitted us to analyze loan  performance in the more rural portions of the RHS-eligible areas. This  specification produced similar results to the primary specification in  terms of the two agencies\u2019 relative loan performance.", "Finally, we chose a specification that used a 2-year anniversary  period. This specification produced almost identical expected  performance for both agencies.", "Under the first alternative model specification, many FHA borrowers  within RHS-eligible areas have incomes exceeding RHS income limits.  Since higher incomes are associated with a lower risk of a loan being  troubled, actual and predicted FHA performance improves when these  observations are not excluded from the estimation. Figure 27 shows the  results of this first alternative specification. Compared with the results for  the primary model specification (see fig. 26 above), the expected  probability of a loan becoming troubled by its 3-year anniversary is lower  with all characteristics at their pooled mean values. Additionally, the  expected probability of troubled loan performance is considerably higher  with all characteristics at RHS-specific mean values than it is with all  characteristics at FHA-specific mean values. Borrower income is  particularly important to this outcome, suggesting that the inclusion of  higher-income borrowers in RHS-eligible areas is associated with better  FHA performance.", "Under the second alternative model specification, we examined the  importance of the top end of the LTV ratio range. While few FHA loans  had an LTV ratio exceeding 100 percent, many RHS loans did. Within the  RHS stand-alone regression, moving from an LTV ratio below 100  percent to one above 100 percent has a positive and significant effect on  the probability of troubled loan performance. The second alternative  specification uses only three categories of LTV ratio (rather than the four  categories used in the primary specification), with the highest category  starting at 96 percent.", "Figure 28 shows the results of this second alternative specification. In  contrast to the results for the primary specification (see fig. 26 above), the  expected probability of troubled loan performance is lower with all  characteristics at RHS-specific mean values than it is with all  characteristics at FHA-specific mean values. In particular, the contribution  of LTV ratio appears to favor rather than disadvantage RHS performance  because FHA has a larger proportion of loans than RHS in the highest  category (which does not distinguish between LTV ratios of 96 to 99.9  percent and those of 100 percent or more). Taken together, our analyses  suggest that for RHS borrowers, beginning homeownership with negative  equity is associated with a higher probability of troubled performance than  beginning with low but positive equity.", "Under the third alternative specification, we focused on the possibility that  loan performance may be different in the most rural parts of RHS-eligible  areas. In this specification, we included only observations corresponding  with Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes for locations less integrated into  urban areas. Commuting-to-work patterns are an important component of  the Rural-Urban Commuting Area classification scheme so that, for  example, if a rural area is close enough to an urban area to be attractive  to commuters, housing market transactions in those areas may be more  standardized than in more rural areas with fewer employment  opportunities. There also may be differences in the characteristics of RHS  and FHA borrowers in these areas. When we restricted our analysis to  observations in large rural towns and small town and isolated rural areas  within RHS-eligible areas, we found that the overall incidence of troubled  loans was lower in these more rural areas. However, the effects of  portfolio characteristics on expected probabilities of troubled loan status  were generally similar to those we found in RHS-eligible areas overall  (see fig. 29). As a result, figure 29 resembles figure 26 (which does not  impose the additional geographic restriction) in many respects.", "Finally, we estimated a fourth alternative specification that is the same as  our primary specification except that it focuses on a 2-year anniversary  period. As with the case of the 3-year specification, we believe that stand- alone estimates for each agency suggest a common underlying structure.  Fewer loans are troubled after 2 years than after 3 years; however, we  were able to increase the number of observations because more loans  had 2 years of history available by the end of fiscal year 2014 than had 3  years of history. In contrast to the 3-year actual troubled loan rates, we  found that the agencies had almost identical 2-year actual troubled loan  rates (3.8 percent for RHS and 3.9 percent for FHA).", "Using the pooled data set, the effects of particular characteristics after 2  years of performance were similar to those observed in the 3-year case  (see fig. 30). In contrast to figure 26 above (which describes the results of  our primary 3-year specification), the expected probability of troubled  performance is slightly lower with all characteristics at RHS-specific mean  values than with all characteristics at FHA-specific mean values. This  result is consistent with the fact that the actual RHS troubled loan rate,  although quite similar to FHA\u2019s, was slightly lower.
