Under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), revenue raised from selling BLM lands is available to the agencies, primarily to acquire nonfederal land within the boundaries of land they already own--known as inholdings, which can create significant land management problems. To acquire land, the agencies can nominate parcels under state-level interagency agreements or the Secretaries can use their discretion to initiate acquisitions. FLTFA expires in 2010. GAO was asked to determine (1) FLTFA revenue generated, (2) challenges to future sales, (3) FLTFA expenditures, and (4) challenges to future acquisitions. To address these issues, GAO interviewed officials and examined the act, agency guidance, and FLTFA sale and acquisition data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since FLTFA was enacted in 2000, through May 2007 BLM has raised $95.7 million in revenue, mostly from selling about 17,000 acres. About 92 percent of the revenue raised, or $88 million, has come from land transactions in Nevada--1 of the 11 western states. Nevada accounts for the lion's share of the sales because of a rapidly expanding population, plentiful BLM land, and experience with federal land sales in southern Nevada. Most BLM field offices have not generated sales revenue under FLTFA. BLM faces several challenges to raising revenue through future FLTFA sales. In particular, BLM state and field officials most frequently cited the limited availability of knowledgeable realty staff to conduct the sales. These staff are often not available because they are working on higher priority activities, such as reviewing and approving energy rights-of-way. We identified two additional issues hampering land sales activity under FLTFA. First, while BLM has identified land for sale in its land use plans, it has not made the sale of this land a priority during the first 7 years of the program. Furthermore, BLM has not set goals for sales or developed a sales implementation strategy. Second, GAO found that some of the additional land BLM has identified for sale since FLTFA was enacted would not generate revenue for acquisitions because the act only allows the deposit of revenue from the sale of lands identified for disposal on or before the date of the act. The four land management agencies have spent $13.3 million of the $95.7 million in revenue raised under FLTFA: $10.1 million using the Secretaries' discretion to acquire nine parcels of land and $3.2 million for administrative expenses to prepare land for FLTFA sales. The agencies acquired the land between August 2007 and January 2008--more than 7 years after FLTFA was enacted, and BLM spent the administrative funds between 2000 and 2007, primarily for preparing FLTFA sales in Nevada. As of October 2007, no land had been purchased through the state-level interagency nomination process, which the agencies envisioned as the primary mechanism for acquiring land. Agencies face several challenges to completing future land acquisitions under FLTFA. Most notably, the act requires that the agencies use most of the funds to purchase land in the state in which the funds were raised; this restriction has had the effect of making little revenue available for acquisitions outside of Nevada. Furthermore, progress in acquiring priority lands has been hampered by weak agency performance in identifying inholdings and setting priorities for acquiring them, as required by the act. In addition, GAO found that the agencies have not established procedures to track implementation of the act's requirement that at least 80 percent of FLTFA revenue raised in each state be used to acquire inholdings in that state or the extent to which BLM is complying with agreed-upon fund allocations among the four participating agencies. Of the revenue generated by FLTFA sales, the agencies have agreed to allocate 60 percent to BLM, 20 percent to the Forest Service, and 10 percent each to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Park Service."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The four major federal land management agencies\u2014the U.S. Department  of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife  Service, and National Park Service, and the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service\u2014administer approximately 628 million acres,  or about 28 percent of the land area in the United States. These public  lands are mostly in the 11 western states and Alaska, where the four  agencies manage lands that constitute significant portions of the states\u2019  acreage, ranging from about 28 percent in Washington state to about 81  percent in Nevada. These lands have multiple uses, from preserving  cultural and natural treasures to accommodating the development of  resources, such as oil and gas, among other things. Historically, many  controversies have arisen over the agencies\u2019 management of these lands,  including the selling of federal land and the purchasing of private land. In  these controversies, the agencies have had to balance the need to protect  resources in the land they manage with the need to respect the rights of  private landowners.", "One particularly controversial issue has been managing federal lands with  inholdings, which are nonfederal lands within the boundaries of national  parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and other designated areas. In 2005, the  agencies estimated there were at least 70 million acres of inholdings  within the lands they manage. Inholdings can create significant  management problems for federal agencies in maintaining boundaries,  providing security, and protecting resources, among other things. The  federal land management agencies have had the authority to acquire  inholdings, but have had limited funding for exercising this authority.", "Congress enacted the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act of 2000  (FLTFA), in part, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of federal  land management by allowing the four land management agencies to  acquire inholdings to promote the consolidation of ownership of public  and private lands in a manner that would allow for better overall resource  management. Revenue generated by the sale or exchange of public lands  under FLTFA has created another funding source available to the four  agencies to acquire land when appropriations for acquisitions have been  declining. These funds are available to the agencies without further  appropriation.", "BLM, which manages approximately 256 million acres of federal land, is  authorized to sell or exchange land identified in its land use plans;4,  the  other three land management agencies have limited or no sales authority.  Therefore, the funds for FLTFA acquisitions must come from the revenue  generated by BLM sales or equalization payments derived from exchanges.  BLM may dispose of land that meets certain criteria, including land that is  difficult to manage, no longer needed, or needed for community  expansion. Thus, when BLM sells land, the sale generates revenue and  reduces the burden on its land managers to accomplish such tasks as  monitoring scattered acreage and boundaries.", "The authority is provided in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of  1976 (Pub. L. 94-579) (1976) (codified at 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 et seq.). FLPMA defines the 11  contiguous western states as Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New  Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming (43 U.S.C. 1702, \u00a7 103 (o)). BLM\u2019s Alaska  State Office is not currently participating in FLTFA because of its priority to settle Alaska  Native land claims. created by FLTFA. However, the act limits the revenue deposited into this  account to that generated from sales or exchanges of public lands  identified for disposal in a land use plan in effect as of July 25, 2000\u2014the  date of FLTFA\u2019s enactment. Money in the new account is available to BLM  and the other three agencies to purchase inholdings, and in some cases,  land adjacent to federally designated areas and containing exceptional  resources. The act expires in July 2010, and the Administration has  proposed revising and extending it.", "BLM sells its land in one of three ways: competitive sales; modified  competitive sales, which provide a preference to existing land users or  adjoining landowners; and direct sales, which occur in special situations,  such as when parcels are completely surrounded by one landowner and  there is no public access. BLM prefers competitive sales because these  usually generate the most revenue and, therefore, are more likely to  increase the revenue available under FLTFA for land acquisitions. BLM  staff in headquarters, its 12 state offices, and 144 field offices nationwide  manage and conduct these sales. About 300 full-time equivalent staff, out  of a workforce of about 10,500 full-time equivalent staff, are responsible  for land and realty management in BLM. These staff are directly  responsible for land sales and acquisitions, along with other realty  responsibilities, such as processing energy rights-of-way and leasing and  permitting on public lands.", "The federal land agencies have two methods for identifying land to acquire  under FLTFA. First, the agencies can nominate parcels through a process  laid out in state-level implementation agreements that were developed  under the direction of a national memorandum of understanding (MOU)  that implemented the program. Under the process, state-level interagency  teams are to review proposals for land acquisitions and forward their  nominations to the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior for  approval. Second, the Secretaries can directly use a portion of FLTFA  revenue to acquire specific parcels of land at their own discretion. The  national MOU laid out the expectation that most acquisitions would occur  through the state-level process.", "FLTFA places several restrictions on using funds from the new U.S.  Treasury account. Among other things, FLTFA requires that (1) no more  than 20 percent can be used for BLM\u2019s administrative and other activities  necessary to carry out the land disposal program; (2) of the amount not  spent on administrative expenses, at least 80 percent of the revenue must  be expended in the state in which the funds were generated; and (3) at  least 80 percent of FLTFA revenue required to be spent on land  acquisitions within a state must be used to acquire inholdings (as opposed  to adjacent land) within that state. In addition, the national MOU sets the  allocation of funds from the FLTFA account for each agency\u201460 percent  for BLM, 20 percent for the Forest Service, and 10 percent each for the  Fish and Wildlife Service and the Park Service, but the Secretaries may  vary from these allocations by mutual agreement.", "With FLTFA expiring in July 2010, you asked us to (1) determine the  extent to which BLM has generated revenue for the FLTFA program, (2)  identify challenges BLM faces in conducting future sales, (3) determine the  extent to which agencies have spent funds under FLTFA, and (4) identify  challenges the agencies face in conducting future acquisitions.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed FLTFA, other applicable  authorities, and agency guidance, and interviewed FLTFA program leads  at the four agencies\u2019 headquarters, officials with Interior\u2019s Office of the  Solicitor, and officials with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Land  and Minerals Management on FLTFA implementation. We also obtained  and analyzed data from BLM\u2019s Division of Business Services on program  revenue and expenditures and visited the Division of Business Services  accounting officials in Lakewood, Colorado, to discuss the management of  the FLTFA account. We conducted semistructured interviews and  collected data from (1) the 10 BLM state officials responsible for the  FLTFA program in their office on the program\u2019s status, completed and  planned FLTFA land sales and acquisitions, and the challenges faced in  conducting sales and acquiring land; (2) officials at the 7 BLM field offices  that have raised 97 percent of the FLTFA revenue; and (3) a  nongeneralizable sample of 11 of the 137 remaining BLM district and field  offices that had not conducted a competitive sale under FLTFA as of May  31, 2007 to determine why such sales have generally not occurred and  challenges faced to conducting future sales. With regard to acquisitions,  we reviewed available documentation for land acquisition proposals  considered by the 10 FLTFA interagency teams at the state level, agency  headquarters, and the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior. During  our visits to BLM state offices (California, Nevada, New Mexico, and  Oregon) and field offices (Carson City, Nevada, and Las Cruces, New  Mexico), we interviewed officials and visited planned land acquisition  sites to learn about the details of the land acquisition process. A more  detailed description of our scope and methodology is presented in  appendix I. We performed our work between November 2006 and  February 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FLTFA, commonly called the \u201cBaca Act,\u201d provides for the use of revenue  from the sale or exchange of BLM land identified for disposal under land  use plans in effect as of the date of its enactment\u2014July 25, 2000.

The program lead duties are sometimes split between  land and realty staff who specialize in sales and others who specialize in  the acquisition process. In addition, to facilitate the use of FLTFA funds  for acquisition, the other three agencies sharing in the revenue, the Forest  Service, the Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, have also  designated realty staff to participate in interagency groups to decide on  acquisitions in each BLM state.

The sales authority, as stated in FLTFA, is provided by the  Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). FLPMA  authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of certain federal  lands\u2014through sale and exchange, among other disposal methods\u2014and  authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to acquire  certain nonfederal lands. FLPMA also authorizes the Secretary of  Agriculture to exchange land. FLPMA requires the Secretary of the Interior  to develop land use plans to determine which lands are eligible for  disposal and acquisition. The level of specificity differs in land use plans,  from describing general areas to naming specific parcels. In developing  these land use plans, agencies must work closely with federal, state, and  local governments and allow for public participation. Land use plans are  typically revised every 15 to 20 years to address changing land use  conditions in the area covered.", "Sales and acquisitions must comply with requirements of FLPMA and  other applicable laws, which can require, among other things, an  assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed land  transaction, assessment of natural and cultural resources, preparation of  appraisals, and public involvement. Furthermore, with regard to land sales  specifically, FLPMA requires that land be sold at the appraised fair market  value or higher.", "Although BLM policy states that competitive sales are preferred when a  number of parties are interested in bidding on a parcel for sale, regulations  for the FLPMA land sales authority provide for other methods of sale  when certain criteria are met. The regulations state that modified  competitive sales may be used to permit the current grazing user or  adjoining landowner to meet the high bid at the public sale. This  procedure allows for limited competitive sales to protect ongoing uses, to  assure compatibility of the possible uses with adjacent land, and to avoid  dislocating current users. The regulations state that a direct sale may be  used when the land offered for sale is completely surrounded by land in  one ownership with no public access, when the land is needed by state or  local governments or nonprofit corporations, or when the land is  necessary to protect current equities in the land or resolve inadvertent  unauthorized use or occupancy of the land.", "In completing the steps necessary to purchase land, third-party  organizations, such as The Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public  Land, often provide assistance to the federal government. For example,  third parties may assist by purchasing desired land for eventual resale to  the federal government or by negotiating an option with the seller to  purchase land within a specified period of time, which provides additional  time for the federal agency to secure necessary funding for the purchase  or to comply with laws and regulations governing the acquisition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Land Acquisition Funding", "paragraphs": ["The primary source for land acquisition funding for BLM, the Park Service,  the Forest Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, has traditionally  been the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which was created  to help preserve, develop, and assure access to outdoor recreation  resources. To receive LWCF funding, the agencies independently identify  and set priorities for land acquisitions and then submit their list of priority  acquisitions in their annual budget request to Congress. LWCF funding is  available for land acquisition purposes only if appropriated by Congress,  unlike the funds in the FLTFA account, which are available without  further appropriation.", "LWCF land acquisition appropriations have been declining in recent years.  Specifically, funds for the four agencies declined from $453.4 million  appropriated in fiscal year 2001 to $120.1 million appropriated in fiscal  year 2006, as depicted in figure 1. BLM has traditionally received the  lowest amount of LWCF land acquisition funding among the four agencies.  For example, in fiscal year 2006, BLM\u2019s share of total appropriated LWCF  land acquisition funding was only $8.6 million, or about 7 percent of the  total appropriation. BLM\u2019s land sales eligible under FLTFA have created  another funding source for the four agencies to acquire land.

In addition, BLM Nevada  staff had previous experience with SNPLMA, the land sales program in the  Las Vegas area. In fact, the Nevada office used procedures and staff from  this program to initiate FLTFA\u2019s sales and acquisition programs.

Revenue reached a peak in  fiscal year 2006, when a total of $71.1 million was collected. BLM officials  said the land sales market in Nevada has cooled since its peak in 2006.

These staff may not be available because they  are working on activities that BLM has identified as a higher priority, such  as reviewing and approving energy rights-of-way. We identified two  additional issues hampering land sales activity under FLTFA. First, while  BLM has identified land for sale in its land use plans, it has not made the  sale of this land a priority during the first 7 years of the program.  Furthermore, BLM has not set goals for FLTFA sales. Goals are an  effective management tool for measuring and achieving results. Some BLM  state offices reported that they have planned FLTFA sales through 2010,  but BLM has no overall implementation strategy to generate funds to  purchase inholdings, as mandated by FLTFA. Since BLM has not laid out a  clear roadmap for FLTFA and did not make land sales a priority, it is  difficult to determine if BLM took full advantage of the opportunities for  generating revenue under the act. Second, BLM has revised some of its  land use plans since 2000 and identified additional land for disposal.  However, revenue from these potential sales is not eligible for the FLTFA  account because the act only applies to land that was identified for  disposal in a land use plan on or before the date of the act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BLM State and Field Officials Most Frequently Cited Availability of Knowledgeable Staff as a Challenge to Conducting FLTFA Sales", "paragraphs": ["According to BLM state and field officials, they face five challenges to  raising FLTFA revenue through sales. First, the most frequently identified  is the availability of knowledgeable realty staff to conduct the sales. This  challenge is followed, in order of frequency cited, by the time, cost, and  complexity of the land sales process; external factors, such as public  opposition to a sale; program and legal restrictions; and the land use  planning process. Except for FLTFA-specific program and legal  restrictions, the other challenges that BLM state and field offices cited are  probably faced in many public land sales. The following provides  examples of these challenges:    The availability of knowledgeable realty staff to conduct the sales. BLM  staff said realty staff must address higher priority work before land sales.  For example, Colorado BLM staff said that processing rights-of-way for  energy pipelines takes a huge amount of realty staff time, 100 percent in  some field offices, and poses one of the top challenges to carrying out  FLTFA sales in Colorado. In Idaho, staff also cited the lack of realty  staffing, which is down 40 percent from 10 years ago. Adding to the  staffing issue, the workload for energy-related uses in Idaho, such as  approving rights-of-way for transmission lines, has doubled. Other offices  cited turnover in staff and the lack of staff with training and experience to  conduct sales.", "Time, cost, and complexity of the sales process. Much preparation must  be completed before a property can be sold. For example, several offices  cited the cost and length of the process that ensures a sale complies with  environmental laws and regulations. In addition, obtaining clearances  from experts related to cultural and natural resources on a proposed sale  can be time-consuming. For example, in the sale of 396 acres by the Las  Cruces District Office, officials said that the sale of the property was  delayed by the discovery of a significant cultural resource on the site. This  was eventually resolved by BLM retaining the small portion of the original  parcel containing the cultural resource.", "External factors. BLM officials cited such factors such as public  opposition to a sale, market conditions, or lack of political support as  challenges. For example, Colorado BLM officials said that they have faced  strong local opposition to sales, and the El Centro Field Office staff in  California cited the lack of demand for the land from buyers as a  challenge. Some offices have experienced diminishing support of sales by  local governments over the time a sale is prepared.", "Program and legal restrictions. The Arizona State Office staff and the  Elko Field Office staff cited the sunset date of FLTFA, less than 3 years  away, as a challenge because the sunset date may not allow enough time  to complete many more sales. Other offices said the MOU provision  requiring a portion of the land sale proceeds to be used by the three other  agencies reduces BLM\u2019s incentive to do land sales because BLM keeps  only 60 percent of the revenue. Another challenge to the disposal of land  under FLTFA, especially in Nevada, has been the passage of land bills for  Lincoln and White Pine counties. The Lincoln County Land Act of 2000,  as amended, directs BLM to deposit most of the proceeds from the  disposal of not more than 103,328 acres into an account established by the  act. The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development  Act of 2006 directs BLM to deposit most of the proceeds from the disposal  of not more than 45,000 acres into a similar account.

The other most commonly cited challenges  were, in the order of frequency cited, (1) identifying a willing seller, (2) the  availability of knowledgeable staff to conduct acquisitions, (3) the lack of  funding to purchase land, (4) restrictions imposed by laws and regulations,  and (5) public opposition to land acquisitions. Some of the challenges BLM  state and field officials cited are likely typical of many federal land  acquisitions. Because they have had little experience with FLTFA  acquisitions, officials from the other three agencies had few comments  about challenges. The following provides examples of each of these  challenges:    Time, cost, and complexity of the land acquisition process. To complete  an acquisition under FLTFA, four agencies must work together to identify,  nominate, and rank proposed acquisitions, which must then be approved  by the two Secretaries. Officials at two field offices estimated the  acquisition process takes about 2-1/2 to 3 years. BLM officials from the  Wyoming State Office and the Las Cruces Field Office said that, with this  length of time, BLM must either identify a very committed seller willing to  wait to complete a transaction or obtain the assistance of a third party in  completing an acquisition. A third party could help either by purchasing  the land first, holding it, and then selling it to the government at a later  date, or by negotiating with the seller an option to buy the land within a  specified period. In terms of cost, some offices noted that they did not  have the funding required to complete all of the work involved to prepare  land acquisitions. In terms of complexity, a Utah State Office official said  BLM has more control over the process for submitting land acquisitions  under LWCF than FLTFA because FLTFA requires four agencies in two  departments to coordinate their efforts.", "Identifying a willing seller. Identifying a willing seller can be problematic  because, among other things, the seller might have higher expectations of  the property\u2019s value. For example, an Ely Field Office official explained  that, because of currently high real estate values, sellers believe they can  obtain higher prices from developers than from the federal government.  Further, an Idaho State Office official said that it is difficult to find a seller  willing to accept the appraised price and wait for the government to  complete the purchase.", "Even when land acquisition nominations are approved, they may not result  in a purchase. For example, in 2004, under FLTFA, two approved  acquisitions for inholdings within a national forest in Nevada were  terminated. In one case, property values rose sharply during the  nomination process and, in an effort to retain some of their land, the seller  decided to reduce the acres for sale but maintain the price expectation.  Furthermore, the landowner decided not to grant access through the  parcel they were retaining to the Forest Service, thus eliminating the  opportunity to secure access to an inaccessible area of the national forest.   In the other case, during the course of the secretarial approval process, the  landowner sold portions of the land included in the original transaction to  another party, reducing the land available for the Forest Service to  purchase. According to Forest Service officials, in both cases the purchase  of the remaining parcels would not fulfill the original purpose of the  acquisitions due to reductions in resource benefits.  Therefore, the Forest  Service terminated both projects. Similarly, the SNPLMA program in  Nevada has had many terminated land acquisitions. Specifically, of the 116  land acquisition projects approved by the Secretary of the Interior from  enactment in October 1998 through September 2007, 41 have been  completed, 55 have been terminated, and 20 are pending. This represents a  47 percent termination rate. BLM did not report why these acquisitions  were terminated.", "Availability of knowledgeable staff to conduct acquisitions. As is the case  with selling federal land, BLM officials reported that they lack  knowledgeable realty staff to conduct land acquisitions, as well as other  BLM or department staff to conduct appraisals, surveys, and resource  studies. Staff are occupied working on higher priority activities,  particularly in the energy area.", "Lack of funding to purchase land. BLM officials in some states said they  lack adequate funds to acquire land under FLTFA. For example, according  to a field office official in Burns, Oregon, just one acquisition in a nearby  conservation area would nearly drain that state\u2019s FLTFA account.", "Restrictions imposed by laws and regulations. BLM officials said that  legal and other restrictions pose a challenge to acquiring land. BLM  Arizona and Grand Junction, Colorado, officials said that some federally  designated areas in their jurisdictions were established after the date of  FLTFA\u2019s enactment, making the land within them ineligible for acquisition  under the act. BLM New Mexico officials said that FLTFA\u2019s requirement  that land be inholdings or adjacent land is too limiting and argued that the  law generally should allow for the acquisition of land that has high  resource values. In terms of regulations, BLM Carson City Field Office  officials told us that the requirements they must follow regarding the  processing of title, survey, and hazardous materials issues pose a  challenge to conducting acquisitions.", "Public opposition to land acquisitions. According to BLM officials from  the Elko and Ely Field Offices in Nevada, the public does not support the  federal government\u2019s acquisition of federal land in their areas, arguing that  the government already owns a high percentage of land and that such  acquisitions result in the removal of land from the local tax base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance with Specific Provisions in FLTFA Continue to Pose Challenges to Future Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["FLTFA\u2019s restriction on the use of funds outside of the state in which they  were raised continues to limit acquisitions.

According to BLM\u2019s Assistant Director for  Minerals, Realty, and Resource Protection, the four agencies met this  requirement through their 2003 MOU. The official explained that the MOU  establishes \u201ca program for identification of eligible lands or interests in  lands, and a process for prioritizing such lands or interests for  acquisition.\u201d However, we found that the MOU only restates the basic  statutory language for this requirement and states that the Secretaries are  to establish a mechanism for identifying and setting priorities for acquiring  inholdings. We found no such mechanism or procedure at the national  level. While the state-level agreements do establish a process for reviewing  proposed acquisitions, six minimally elaborate and three do not elaborate  on the basic FLTFA criteria: the date the inholding was established, the  extent to which the acquisition will facilitate management efficiency, and  other criteria the Secretaries consider appropriate. One exception to this  is the Nevada state-level agreement. Because the agencies involved in  SNPLMA had already developed an interagency agreement to implement  that act, they modified that agreement to include FLTFA. The Nevada  agreement is generally more detailed than other state agreements and  includes more criteria for considering land acquisitions because of the  differences between the SNPLMA and FLTFA land acquisition authorities.  Also, unlike the other state agreements, the Nevada agreement uses a  quantitative system to rank acquisitions. Table 9 is a summary of criteria  each state-level agreement includes beyond the FLTFA criteria for  acquisition nominations.", "When the agencies decided in 2006 to use the Secretaries\u2019 discretionary  authority to make the initial FLTFA acquisitions, officials from all four  agencies told us they generally relied on acquisition proposals previously  identified for LWCF funding to quickly identify the parcels to acquire.

The  BLM FLTFA program lead said BLM considers this requirement when  making land acquisition decisions but has not established a system to  track it. The program lead noted that the requirement to use 80 percent for  inholdings is hard to track, as the act is written, because the acquisition  proposals are submitted in a piecemeal fashion.", "With respect to the national MOU, BLM has not established a procedure to  track agreed-upon fund allocations\u201460 percent for BLM, 20 percent for  the Forest Service, and 10 percent each for the Fish and Wildlife Service  and the Park Service.

However, officials from the BLM Division  of Business Services and BLM\u2019s Budget Office told us there is no  mechanism to track these allocations and were unable to tell us whether  the allocations should be followed at the state or national level. Knowing  whether the MOU fund allocations are set at the state or national level is  important because allocations that apply nationally provide more  flexibility than allocations at the state level. While BLM did not track the  allocations, most state-level interagency agreements provide guidance on  consideration of nominations that exceed the established allocations and  some BLM state office officials we spoke with were mindful of these  allocation targets. For example, in California, the interagency team had  agreed to \u201clend\u201d BLM the funds from their allocations for a proposed BLM  acquisition because they themselves could not effectively use the small  portions of funding allocated to them. In contrast, in Oregon, BLM officials  said they had not considered such an arrangement.

BLM has raised most of the funds for the  FLTFA account with land sales in just one state, and it and the other land  management agencies have made limited progress in acquiring inholdings  and adjacent land with exceptional resources. Because there are less than  3 years remaining until FLTFA expires and a significant amount of time is  needed to complete both sales and acquisitions, relatively little time  remains to improve the implementation of FLTFA.", "We recognize that a number of challenges have prevented BLM from  completing many sales in most states, which limits the number of possible  acquisitions. Many of the challenges that BLM cited are likely faced in  many public land sales, as FLTFA did not change the land sales process.  However, we believe that BLM\u2019s failure to set goals for FLTFA sales and  develop a sales implementation strategy limits the agency\u2019s ability to raise  revenue for acquisitions. Without goals and a strategy to achieve them,  BLM field offices do not have direction for FLTFA sales. Moreover, the  lack of goals makes it difficult to determine the extent of BLM\u2019s progress  in disposing of unneeded lands to raise funds for acquisitions.", "As with sales, progress in acquiring priority land has been hampered by  weak agency performance in developing an effective mechanism to  identify potential land acquisitions and set priorities for inholdings and  adjacent land with exceptional resources, which FLTFA requires. Without  such a mechanism, it is difficult to assess whether the agencies are  acquiring the most significant inholdings and, thus, enabling them to more  effectively and efficiently manage federal lands. Although the agencies do  have systems to identify and set priorities for land acquisitions under  LWCF that could potentially be adapted for the FLTFA acquisitions as  well, they have not done so. Moreover, because the agencies have not  tracked the amounts spent on inholdings and agency allocations, they  cannot ensure compliance with the act or full implementation of the MOU.", "As Congress considers the Administration\u2019s proposal to amend and  reauthorize FLTFA, it may wish to reconsider the act\u2019s requirements that  eligible lands are only those designated in the land use plans at the time  FLTFA was enacted and that most FLTFA revenue raised must be spent in  that state. Adjusting the eligibility of land use plans, as the Administration  has proposed, could provide additional resources for land acquisitions  under FLTFA. In addition, providing the agencies with more flexibility  over the use of funds may allow them to acquire the most desirable land  nationwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If Congress decides to reauthorize FLTFA in 2010, it may wish to consider  revising the following provisions to better achieve the goals of the act:    FLTFA limits eligible land sales to those lands identified in land use  plans in effect as of July 25, 2000. This provision excludes more recently  identified land available for disposal, thereby reducing opportunities for  raising additional revenue for land acquisition.", "The requirement that agencies spend the majority of funds raised from  eligible sales for acquisitions in the same state.

We also assessed the reliability of data BLM provided  on revenue generated and on expenditures to date under FLTFA.", "For all four objectives, we reviewed FLTFA, other applicable laws,  regulations, and agency guidance. We interviewed the FLTFA program  leads at the headquarters offices for BLM, the Fish and Wildlife Service,  and the Park Service within the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the  Forest Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture on program  status, goals, and management oversight for the program. To understand  BLM\u2019s interpretation of key provisions of the act, we interviewed officials  with Interior\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals  Management and Office of the Solicitor and, in some cases, requested the  department\u2019s views on these provisions in writing.", "To determine the extent to which BLM has generated and expended  FLTFA program revenue, we obtained and analyzed data from BLM\u2019s  Division of Business Services on program revenue and visited Division of  Business Services accounting officials in Lakewood, Colorado, to discuss  the management of the FLTFA account. Using information provided by the  Division of Business Services and information we obtained from the  Federal Register, we prepared summary information on completed sales  by state and asked the 10 BLM state office officials responsible for the  FLTFA program in their state to verify and update that information. As  part of the request to state offices, we obtained data on planned FLTFA  land sales and completed and planned acquisitions through 2010. We  subjected the data provided by the field offices to electronic and logic  testing and followed up with the field contacts regarding questions. With  regard to acquisitions, we reviewed available documentation for land  acquisition proposals considered by the 10 FLTFA interagency teams at  the state level, agency headquarters, and the Secretaries of Agriculture and  of the Interior. During our visits to selected BLM state offices (California,  Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon) and field offices (Carson City, Nevada,  and Las Cruces, New Mexico), we interviewed officials and visited  planned land acquisition sites to learn about the land acquisition process.  During these visits we also interviewed selected officials with the Fish and  Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, and the Park Service to learn about  their experience in drafting state-level interagency agreements and with  implementing land acquisitions under FLTFA. To assess the reliability of  data provided by the Division of Business Services on revenue and  expenditures, we interviewed staff responsible for compiling and reporting  the data at the Division of Business Services and at the state office and  field locations visited. We examined reports of this data from BLM\u2019s  financial systems and related guidance and sought documentation on  selected entries into the system.", "To determine whether BLM has sufficient internal controls over FLTFA  receipts and expenditures, we interviewed officials at the bureau\u2019s  Division of Business Services and obtained, reviewed, and assessed the  system of internal controls for the U.S. Treasury account established  under FLTFA, including management\u2019s written policies and procedures, as  well as control activities over collections, expenditures, and the records  for these transactions. We also reviewed documentation for a non- probability sample of 7 nonlabor FLTFA expenditures totaling $54,967 that  were charged by the Las Cruces Field Office to ensure proper  documentation. As of July 20, 2007, BLM offices had made a total of 15,706  expenditure transactions\u2014858 nonlabor and 14,848 labor\u2014nationwide.  The seven we chose included expenditures for appraisals and cultural  evaluations on properties being prepared for sale under FLTFA. We chose  these transactions because they were the largest ones and included a  single vendor. We also chose one expenditure made on a charge card  because it was slightly less than a reporting limit. We checked to ensure  that documentation for these expenditures included (1) an agreement or  contract between BLM and the entity to have specific work completed, (2)  an invoice detailing work performed, and (3) evidence of BLM supervisory  approval to pay for such services. After our review of the internal control  policies and procedures, testing and verification of data on revenue, and  obtaining documentation of the selected expenditures, the revenue and  expenditure data was considered sufficiently reliable for our report.", "To identify challenges to conducting land sales and acquisitions, we  reviewed the FLTFA national memorandum of understanding, state-level  interagency agreements, and documentation of headquarters and state- level interagency team activities to learn about the policies and  procedures established for the implementation of FLTFA. We conducted  semistructured interviews using a web-based protocol with (1) the 10 BLM  state officials responsible for the FLTFA program in their state\u2014Arizona,  California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,  Oregon/Washington, Utah, and Wyoming; (2) officials at the seven BLM  field offices that have raised 97 percent of the FLTFA revenue (as shown  in table 10); and (3) a nongeneralizable sample of 11 of the 137 remaining  BLM field offices that had not conducted a competitive sale under FLTFA  as of May 31, 2007 (as shown in table 11). From the field offices with no  competitive sales, we choose at least one office from each of the ten state  offices under FLTFA and we considered the proximity of lands managed  by field offices to urban areas. For California, we selected two additional  field offices\u2014Palm Springs and Eagle Lake. We chose the Palm Springs  Field Office because it planned a major sale during our review and we  chose the Eagle Lake Field Office because, although it is located in  California, it manages some land in Nevada and has had no competitive  sales. Because all of the Nevada field offices have had competitive sales  and four Nevada offices were among the high revenue offices selected, we  decided to select the Eagle Lake office. To analyze the narrative responses  to some of the semistructured interview questions, we used the web-based  system to perform content analyses of select open-ended responses. To  conduct the content analyses to develop statistics on agreement among  the answers, two reviewers per question collaborated on developing  content categories based on survey responses and independently assessed  and coded each survey response into those categories. Intercoder  reliability (agreement) statistics were electronically generated in the  coding process, and agreement on all categories were 90 percent or above.  Coding disagreements were resolved through reviewer discussion. In  addition, analyses of the closed-ended responses were produced with  statistical software.", "We also interviewed a range of officials about the land acquisition process.  These officials included FLTFA program leads at each agency\u2019s  headquarters and selected state or regional-level contacts with each  agency, as well as officials from third-party organizations involved with  the land acquisition process, such as The Nature Conservancy and The  Trust for Public Land.", "We performed our work between November 2006 and February 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
