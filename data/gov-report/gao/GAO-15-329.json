GAO found that casualty reports\u2014incidents of degraded or out-of-service equipment\u2014have doubled over the past 5 years and that the material condition of overseas-homeported ships has decreased slightly faster than that of U.S.-homeported ships (see figure below). In addition, the Navy has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on overseas infrastructure and base operating costs since 2009, while moving large numbers of sailors, dependents, and ship repair work overseas. GAO also found that the high pace of operations the Navy uses for overseas-homeported ships limits dedicated training and maintenance periods, which has resulted in difficulty keeping crews fully trained and ships maintained.", "The Navy has not identified or mitigated the risks its increasing reliance on overseas homeporting poses to its force over the long term. GAO found that some ships homeported overseas have had consistently deferred maintenance that has resulted in long-term degraded material condition and increased maintenance costs, and could shorten a ship's service life. The Navy began implementing a revised operational schedule in 2014 for U.S.-based ships that lengthens time between deployments, citing the need for a sustainable schedule. However, the Navy has not determined how\u2014or whether\u2014it will apply a more sustainable schedule to all ships homeported overseas. Although the Navy's decision process for moving individual ships overseas identifies actions and resources needed, it does not assess risks that such moves pose to costs, readiness, or expected service lives of ships that the Navy can expect based on its historical experience operating ships from overseas homeports. Without a sustainable operational schedule and a comprehensive risk assessment on overseas homeporting, the Navy lacks information needed to make informed homeporting decisions and it will be difficult for the Navy to identify and mitigate the risks its homeporting decisions pose to its budget, readiness, and ship service lives over the long term."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy develop and implement a sustainable operational schedule for all ships homeported overseas and conduct a comprehensive assessment of the risks associated with overseas homeporting.

Navy  ships provide forward presence through a combination of three  deployment models: (1) deployments of ships and crews from homeports  in the United States; (2) forward-deployed naval forces where ships are  homeported overseas and the crews and their families reside in the host  country; and (3) rotational crewing of ships, where crews rotate on and off  a ship that is deployed for extended periods from a U.S. homeport. To  meet the increasing demands of combatant commanders for forward  presence in recent years, the Navy has extended deployments; increased  operational tempos; and shortened, eliminated, or deferred training and  maintenance. The Navy has also assigned more surface combatants and  amphibious warfare ships to overseas homeports, has been using  rotational crewing on the littoral combat ship, and is considering various  homeporting options for its new class of destroyers, the DDG 1000.  According to the Navy, homeporting ships overseas is an efficient method  for providing forward presence, with one ship operating continuously  overseas providing the same level of presence as four ships deploying  from homeports in the United States. However, Navy leadership has  acknowledged that, to achieve these operational benefits, it incurs  increased infrastructure costs and operations and sustainment costs.", "The House report accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 included a provision that we review  and analyze the Navy\u2019s process for deciding to homeport ships overseas  and identify the relative costs and benefits of various approaches.

We compared the  operational benefits, costs, and readiness effects of the different  homeporting assignments for these ship classes using a variety of  factors\u2014including amount of forward presence provided to combatant  commanders, ship operations and support costs, readiness data, ship  inspection scores, and maintenance execution rates. For these analyses,  we focused on comparisons between cruisers, destroyers, and  amphibious warfare ships (amphibious assault ships, amphibious  transport dock ships, dock landing ships, and amphibious command  ships) homeported in the United States and those homeported overseas  because these have historically been the ship classes most commonly  homeported overseas and, therefore, the Navy has the most robust data  available for them. We selected time frames for each of the data series,  primarily ranging from 5 to 10 years of historical data, after assessing  their availability and reliability to maximize the amount of data available  for us to make meaningful comparisons. We assessed the reliability of  each of the data sources by reviewing Navy documentation and  discussing with Navy officials the structure of its systems, data-collection  processes and procedures, and data-quality controls. We determined that  they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the operational  benefits, costs, and readiness effects of homeporting ships in the United  States and overseas. We did not include mine countermeasures ships  and patrol coastal ships in our comparative analysis because these ship  classes have had relatively little recent experience deploying from U.S.  homeports over the past 5 years according to Navy officials and limited  comparative data were available.", "To understand the effects of overseas homeporting on infrastructure  investments and base operating costs, we examined Navy  documentation, such as leadership briefings on decisions to move ships  to overseas homeports from 2009 through 2014 where officials stated  additional infrastructure was required. These moves included decisions to  homeport destroyers in Rota, Spain, and patrol coastal and mine  countermeasures ships in Bahrain. We also analyzed cost data from 2009  through 2014 for family housing and operation and maintenance, which  includes these ship moves, as well as military construction at overseas  homeports. We assessed these data by reviewing Navy documentation  and discussing with Navy officials data-collection processes and  procedures and determined that they were reliable for the purposes of  reporting the infrastructure investments and operating costs for overseas- homeported ships. To understand the economic effects of homeporting  ships overseas, we reviewed the projected maintenance workload for  large surface combatants that involved moving maintenance workload to  overseas locations. These workload estimates included the destroyers  moving from U.S. homeports to Rota, Spain (four ships) and Yokosuka,  Japan (two ships) from the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations for the  approximately 7- to 10-year period these ships are expected to be  homeported overseas.

For example, the transfer of four destroyers from U.S.  homeports to Rota, Spain, beginning in 2014 was based on a presidential  decision to provide ballistic missile defense in Europe. The process of  moving a ship to an overseas homeport involves changing the overseas  force structure, which can include the physical movement of a military  unit, the introduction or removal of military capability, treaty notification,  host-nation notification, and public announcement of physical overseas  force structure. Overseas force-structure changes require the approval  of the Secretary of Defense and coordination with the U.S. State  Department. According to Navy officials, forward-deployed ships are  typically homeported overseas for a period of 7 to 10 years before being  replaced with a ship of the same class from the United States.

Having ships homeported overseas  provides more opportunities for this regional partnership building,  according to Navy officials. For example, the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet,  headquartered in Bahrain, led the largest international mine  countermeasures exercise to date in the Persian Gulf during the  autumn of 2014. The exercise involved navies from 44 countries  including the four U.S. Navy mine countermeasures ships homeported  in Bahrain.

For  example, Navy officials added that the security against aggression  that U.S. ships provide to European allies is of tangible value to these  countries.", "Maintenance flexibility: Navy officials responsible for scheduling  maintenance overseas, including those from 5th Fleet, 6th Fleet, and  U.S. Pacific Fleet, cited the flexibility, capacity, and diversity of the  types of maintenance that can be performed on overseas-homeported  ships since they are not subject to certain legal restrictions and  limitations on maintenance that apply to U.S.-homeported ships.  These statutory provisions require U.S.-homeported ships to be  maintained primarily at U.S. shipyards, with only voyage repairs  allowable in overseas shipyards.", "Reduced crisis response time: Navy officials state that ships  operating forward can more quickly and effectively respond to crises  and contingencies. Ships homeported overseas can assist when a  surge of force is needed to respond to an emerging crisis, as do U.S.- homeported ships in that area of operations while deployed. For  example, ships homeported in Japan were able to provide timely  humanitarian assistance to the Philippines as part of Operation  Damayan following the destruction wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in  2013 (see fig. 3). Navy officials cite the importance of having forward  presence distributed globally to more effectively conduct missions by  reducing transit time. For example, transit from the United States to  areas like the Persian Gulf or South China Sea can take weeks,  whereas ships homeported in Bahrain or Japan are already present  and can access these areas in a matter of hours or days.", "Meeting presence requirements with current force structure:  Navy officials stated that overseas homeporting allows the Navy to  meet rising forward-presence requirements from the combatant  commanders with the available force structure. For example, officials  stated that the Navy would need many more ships deployed from the  United States to provide the same level of presence that overseas- homeported ships are currently providing.", "The Navy uses at least three metrics to assess a ship\u2019s ability to provide  forward presence: (1) how long the ship is in the operational area, (2) how  much the ship is available for tasking, and (3) the amount of time the ship  is actually under way. Navy officials cite the importance of measuring  presence and operational availability in concert with deployed days under  way. For example, they emphasized that there are intangible benefits  gained by having a U.S. ship in an overseas port even if it is not  operationally available.", "Presence is the number of days a ship spends in an area of  operations\u2014excluding depot maintenance periods\u2014divided by 365.  Ships homeported overseas are always physically in an area of  operations (i.e., in the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th Fleet areas of operations);  therefore, the Navy calculates that they provide as much as four times  more presence than U.S.-homeported ships, which must travel long  stretches of ocean before entering one of the overseas areas of  operations and then return to the United States after a multimonth  deployment.", "Operational availability is the number of days a ship is available for  operational tasking in a year. Operational availability measures the  amount of time that a ship can get under way and execute a mission  as required. For example, a ship can be considered operationally  available even if it is in maintenance, if it is able to get under way and  execute a mission in a short period of time. The Navy calculates that  ships homeported overseas provide over three times more operational  availability than U.S.-homeported ships.", "Deployed underway time is the number of days a ship spends away  from port, referred to as underway days, deployed in the 4th, 5th, 6th,  or 7th Fleet areas of operations. This metric tracks the number of  days that a ship is out of port, at sea, and performing a mission in  these areas of operations. Our analysis of the number of deployed  underway days provided by ships homeported in the United States  and overseas from fiscal years 2003 through 2012 estimated that the  average ship homeported overseas spent about 42 additional  deployed days under way, compared to the average ship that was  homeported in the United States (see fig. 4).", "The Navy faces certain challenges associated with homeporting ships  overseas. For example, unforeseen host-nation policy changes can affect  renegotiation of international agreements, which may restrict base usage,  or possibly remove the Navy presence entirely. This occurred in 1991,  when a long-standing agreement between the Philippines and the United  States ended, followed by the closing of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay  Naval Base, which at that time served as the 7th Fleet\u2019s primary logistics  and repair hub and was home to over 12,000 Navy personnel and  dependents. Through status-of-forces agreements, host nations may  negotiate the size and scope of the naval footprint, and seek to place  parameters on how those ships can be employed. These agreements are  periodically renegotiated, and changes can affect Navy and U.S.  policymaker flexibility. Finally, Navy officials explained that ships  homeported overseas have difficulty identifying appropriate training  ranges for certain exercises and noted that utilizing foreign ports presents  unique threat and security challenges compared to U.S. homeports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Reduces Training and Maintenance Periods on Ships Homeported Overseas", "paragraphs": ["Homeporting a ship overseas saves transit time to and from an area of  operations and allows it be in this area longer. However, our analysis  shows that the primary reason for the greater number of deployed  underway days provided by overseas-homeported ships results from the  Navy\u2019s decision to truncate training and maintenance periods on these  ships in order to maximize their operational availability. Ships homeported  overseas do not operate within the traditional fleet response plan cycles  that apply to U.S.-based ships. Since the ships are in permanent  deployment status during their time homeported overseas, they do not  have designated ramp-up and ramp-down maintenance and training  periods built into their operational schedules. Because the Navy expects  these ships to be operationally available for the maximum amount of time,  their intermediate and depot-level maintenance is instead executed  through more frequent, shorter maintenance periods, or deferred until  after the ship returns to a U.S. homeport, according to Navy officials.  These officials explained that U.S.-homeported ships typically operate  under the Navy\u2019s fleet response plan, which, by contrast, provides for  designated maintenance and training periods that prepare ships for  deployment to areas of operations. These ships deploy for a notional  period of 6 months (which in the past several years has frequently been  extended to 8 to 10 months) and then return to their U.S. homeports to  undergo postdeployment depot maintenance and leave and training  periods for the crew.", "Our analysis of the operational cycles of ships homeported in the United  States and those homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, and Rota, Spain,  found that, based on their notional operational cycles alone, Navy ships  homeported overseas provide more deployed time than ships  homeported in the United States primarily because the Navy reduces  their training and maintenance periods (see fig. 5). For example, our  analysis of the Navy\u2019s plans for U.S.-based cruisers and destroyers  shows that the Navy plans for them to spend 41 percent of their time  deployed or available for deployment and 60 percent of their time in  dedicated training and maintenance periods. In contrast, the Navy plans  for its Japan-based cruisers and destroyers to spend 67 percent of their  time deployed, 33 percent of their time in maintenance, and do not  include a dedicated training period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overseas-Homeported Ships Incur Additional Costs and Adverse Effects on Readiness and Ship Condition Higher Operations and Support Costs", "paragraphs": ["The operational benefits the Navy describes that result from homeporting  ships overseas also result in costs to the Navy and DOD more broadly.

We also found that the Navy spent about $5.8 million more  on sustainment in the year after the average ship returned to the  United States after being homeported overseas than the average  U.S.-homeported ship that was never homeported overseas (these  costs would be incurred outside of those presented in table 1). This is  consistent with the Navy\u2019s practice of conducting more sustainment  spending and depot maintenance when a ship returns from an  overseas homeport to a U.S. homeport.", "Personnel costs: Overseas-homeported ships incurred an estimated  $1.3 million more per year in personnel costs, on average, than ships  homeported in the United States due to higher housing allowances,  cost of living adjustments, and permanent change of station costs.", "To better understand differences in personnel costs, we analyzed specific  personnel costs associated with homeporting ships overseas, such as  overseas housing allowances and cost of living adjustments. We found  that when we factored overseas housing allowances and cost of living  adjustments, the total compensation for sailors at overseas locations is  greater than the compensation they would have received at homeports in  the United States. These additional costs, as well as the generally  higher costs of moving and housing sailors and their families at overseas  locations, contribute to the higher overall operations and support costs for  overseas-homeported ships presented in table 1. Moreover, these  differences will likely be larger than they currently are once four  destroyers are moved from Norfolk, Virginia (three ships) and Mayport,  Florida (one ship) to Rota, Spain, by the end of 2015. For example, the  Navy estimates that the increased housing allowances and cost of living  adjustments for Rota-based sailors will be approximately $18 million per  year, or an 89 percent increase in compensation costs based on the  previous homeports of Norfolk, Virginia, and Mayport, Florida.", "Further, Navy 5th and 7th Fleet officials explained that permanent change  of station costs are also higher for personnel stationed overseas. For  example, the costs of shipping household goods to Bahrain or Japan are  higher than the costs for a comparable move between locations in the  United States. Additionally, due to hardship conditions in Bahrain, sailors  there rotate more frequently than sailors homeported in the United States  and other overseas locations. Further, unaccompanied sailors in Bahrain  have the option to move their families anywhere in the United States for  the duration of their 1-year tour, potentially doubling the number of moves  associated with Bahrain-based assignments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Infrastructure Investments and Base Operating Costs", "paragraphs": ["In addition to operations and support costs, the Navy seeks to provide  consistent shore installation services and support, which for ships  homeported overseas can require shore support investments.

Specifically, the Navy does not track infrastructure cost data on an  individual ship basis to allow for an accurate comparison as U.S. and  overseas bases support homeported as well as other transiting ships.

In contrast, the high operational tempo of ships  homeported overseas has resulted in a \u201ctrain on the margins\u201d approach.  According to Navy officials, \u201ctraining on the margins\u201d means that there is  little to no dedicated training time set aside for the ships, so that crews  train while under way or in the limited time between underway periods.  Officials told us that the training periods for destroyers based in Spain  overlap with maintenance periods and that the high operational tempo of  these ships means that training has to be planned and coordinated with  precision to help ensure that crews are properly trained.

For example, casualty report data  provide information on individual pieces of equipment or systems that are  degraded or out of service, the lack of which will affect a ship\u2019s ability to  support required mission areas. We analyzed monthly casualty report  data from January 2009 through July 2014 to estimate trends for  overseas- and U.S.-homeported ships separately. We found a  statistically significant increase in casualty reports for both overseas- homeported ships and U.S.-homeported ships during this period,  indicating declining material condition across the fleet. Furthermore, we  found that the number of casualty reports is increasing at a slightly faster  rate for overseas-homeported ships compared to U.S.-homeported ships  (about 1 additional casualty report a year). For example, while overseas- homeported ships had lower daily average numbers of casualty reports  per ship from 2009 through 2012, over the past 2 years overseas- homeported ships have had more casualties than U.S.-homeported ships,  indicating that these ships may have lower material condition when  compared to U.S.-homeported ships and a worsening trend in overall ship  readiness (see fig. 6).", "Our analysis showed that casualty reports have nearly doubled for both  overseas-homeported ships and U.S.-homeported ships over the past 5  years. To further analyze these observed differences over time, we  conducted a multivariate statistical analysis that held constant certain  factors that varied across ships and over time (see app. VI). Based on  this analysis, we estimated that overseas-homeported ships had, on  average, about 25 (+/-11.6) casualty reports and U.S.-homeported ships  had about 20 (+/-1.7). However, these numbers of casualty reports for  U.S.- and overseas-homeported ships are not statistically distinguishable  from one another. The casualty reports over the past 5 years comprise  mostly category 2 casualty reports. We found that category-2 casualties\u2014 those that indicate that a deficiency exists in mission-essential equipment  that causes a minor degradation in a ship\u2019s primary mission or a major  degradation or total loss of a secondary mission\u2014are much more  prevalent than more-serious category 3 and 4 casualties. For example,  in 2014, we found that the average number of casualty reports for all  ships was about 27, and category 3 and 4 reports accounted for about 1.0  of these. Navy officials acknowledged the increasing amount of casualty  reports on Navy ships and a worsening trend in material ship condition.  They stated that casualties require unscheduled maintenance and have a  negative impact on fleet operations since there is an associated capability  or capacity loss. Additionally, officials noted that two factors may have  contributed to this increase, including (1) a cultural shift in the Navy  emphasizing the timely identification and reporting of casualties and (2)  adoption of an automated system for reporting casualties beginning in  2010, which may have made it easier to report casualties.", "In addition, the ships homeported overseas get lower scores when  inspected than U.S.-homeported ships. In addition to analyzing the  reports of equipment casualties reported by the ships themselves, we  also reviewed surface and amphibious ships\u2019 inspection reports  conducted in fiscal years 2007 through 2014. The Navy uses material  inspection reports from the Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV),  the Navy\u2019s ship-inspection entity, to determine the condition of ships.  Ships undergo INSURV inspections about once every 6 years. The data  gathered include inspection results for structural components, individual  pieces of equipment, and broad systems, as well as assessments of a  ship\u2019s warfighting capabilities. The Navy uses INSURV data to make life- cycle decisions on whether to retain or decommission Navy ships.

These scores are based on inspection of a ship\u2019s functional  areas (e.g., propulsion, information systems, weapons) and performance  on various operational demonstrations (e.g., steering, full power ahead,  gunnery firing). We found that ships homeported overseas have lower  overall Figure of Merit scores and are rated lower in 62 percent of the  functional areas and demonstrations. For example, ships homeported  overseas had lower scores in functional areas, such as information  systems and operations, and demonstrations, such as steering and  anchoring.

Overseas-homeported ships are maintained  differently than those homeported in the United States, which has led to  maintenance deferrals and higher maintenance costs. Maintenance  officials told us that the focus for ships homeported overseas is on  mission readiness, so overseas-homeported ships place priority on the  maintenance of combat systems, for example, while systems with the  potential to reduce ship service life\u2014such as fuel and ballast tanks that  require extended in-port periods to properly maintain\u2014are subject to  maintenance deferrals in order to allow the ship to sustain a high  operational tempo. These officials added that if such systems are left  unmaintained, corrosion of these tanks and other lower-priority ship  components can fester to a critical point where more costly replacement  or overhaul is ultimately required. Deferring this maintenance may yield  benefits like greater operational availability in the short term, but it may  lead to higher depot-level maintenance costs or service-life implications in  the longer term. This is consistent with what we found in September 2012  that deferring maintenance can affect ship readiness and increase the  costs of later repairs. For example, we found that the Navy had calculated  that deferring maintenance on ballast tanks to the next major  maintenance period will increase costs approximately 2.6 times.", "The systematic deferral of maintenance that occurs on some overseas- homeported ships can also lead to situations where it becomes cost- prohibitive to keep a ship in service, which could result in retiring a ship  before it reaches its expected service life. To better understand the extent  of deferred maintenance on surface and amphibious ships, we analyzed  the average ratio of executed to required labor days for maintenance on  ships homeported overseas and in the United States. We found that,  while cruisers and destroyers homeported overseas have their required  maintenance executed at a higher rate than their U.S.-homeported  counterparts, the amphibious ships homeported overseas have  maintenance executed at a rate that is both much lower than what is  required and much lower than what is executed on U.S.-homeported  amphibious ships. Navy officials said that the results of our analysis are  consistent with the historical high operational tempo and utilization of  amphibious ships while they are homeported overseas.", "A July 2014 Navy report to Congress stated that high operational tempo  causes unplanned wear on equipment, which can reduce the expected  service life of ships. Propulsion, electrical generation, and combat  systems (e.g., radars and sonars) are used more extensively when a ship  is under way, and rough sea states can induce more stress on a ship and  its systems. The report adds that recovering this service life requires  longer and more costly maintenance periods, which strain the  maintenance base and compress time available for operations and  training. Other Navy reports, such as the February 2010 Admiral Balisle  surface ship readiness report, highlight the negative effects of high  operational tempo, namely the reduction in expected service life for given  ship classes, and a July 2011 Center for Naval Analyses study found that  increases in operational tempo require increases in depot-level  maintenance.", "Moreover, the Navy Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program,  which oversees maintenance requirements for surface and amphibious  ships and monitors life-cycle repairs, has found that the current  maintenance strategy for amphibious ships homeported overseas will  jeopardize their attainment of expected service lives. Specifically, the  program found that the primary shortfall of the current strategy is that it  does not include scheduled dry-docking periods necessary to conduct  large scale tank and void maintenance while homeported in Sasebo,  Japan. This, along with other contributing factors such as the ships\u2019 high  operational tempo, has led to overall degraded material condition of  amphibious ships homeported there. For example, Navy officials stated  that maintenance on the USS Essex, an amphibious assault ship, had  been systematically deferred while the ship was homeported in Japan  from June 2000 through February 2012, causing the ship to require the  costliest depot maintenance work in surface Navy history when it returned  to the United States (see fig. 7). During this depot maintenance period,  the Essex required over twice the amount of maintenance work the Navy  expected to perform. According to the Navy Surface Maintenance  Engineering Planning Program documentation, the Navy used 364,280  labor days on the Essex compared to the 177,206 labor days that were  planned for this depot availability.", "Given the Navy\u2019s and our prior findings on the detrimental effect of high  operational tempo and maintenance deferrals on ship service life\u2014 particularly with respect to the Navy\u2019s fleet of amphibious warfare ships\u2014 we worked with the Congressional Budget Office to determine the impact  of potential decreases in the service lives of overseas-homeported ships  on the amphibious fleet inventory. The Congressional Budget Office  completes an annual assessment of the Navy\u2019s 30-year shipbuilding plan  and uses an internal model to show the annual inventories of selected  categories of ships under the Navy\u2019s plan and how they align with the  Navy\u2019s goals for those categories of ships. We asked the Congressional  Budget Office to use its model to deduct 6 years from the service lives of  the Amphibious Ready Group (one amphibious assault ship, two dock  landing ships, and one amphibious transport dock ship) homeported in  Sasebo, Japan, in order to illustrate the effects of these potential losses in  service life on the amphibious fleet inventory. We deducted 6 years of  service life based on discussions with Navy fleet and headquarters  officials with the goal of choosing an appropriate time frame to illustrate  the potential effects of reducing ship surface lives. For example, the  upper time-frame limit we considered was based on the Navy\u2019s prior  proposal to retire an amphibious ship homeported overseas 16.5 years  prior to the end of its expected service life. Navy officials agreed that 6  years is a reasonable time frame for illustrative purposes. We recognize  that this is one potential outcome if the Navy chooses not to make the  significant investments in depot maintenance that would be required to  mitigate the effects on the service lives of ships returning from overseas  homeports. According to the Navy, a minimum force of 33 amphibious  ships represents the limit of acceptable risk in meeting amphibious  assault force requirements. Figure 8 shows the results of the  Congressional Budget Office analysis and that, if the overseas- homeported amphibious ships do not achieve their expected service lives,  the Navy would not meet its goal for amphibious ship inventory beginning  in 2035, and would worsen the gap projected by the Navy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Is Taking Steps to Address High Operational Tempo for U.S.-Homeported Ships but Has Not Determined Whether Those Steps Will Apply to All Ships Homeported Overseas", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has taken steps to mitigate the risks of high operational tempo  on U.S.-homeported ships by developing the optimized fleet response  plan, which seeks to instill predictable operational schedules conducive to  ensuring ships are able to adequately address their training and  maintenance requirements.

The Navy\u2019s optimized fleet response plan seeks to provide a more  sustainable force-generation model for Navy ships, as it reduces  deployment lengths and injects more predictability for maintenance and  training into ship schedules. According to the policy, this framework  establishes a readiness-generation cycle that operationally and  administratively aligns forces while aligning and stabilizing manning,  maintenance and modernization, logistics, inspections and evaluations,  and training. According to Navy officials, adherence to this new force- generation model is necessary in order to protect the long-term readiness  and sustainability of the force. As a result, it is implementing, beginning in  2014, a revised operational schedule, referred to as the optimized fleet  response plan, which is based on a 36-month cycle, with 7-month  deployments for U.S.-homeported ships and designated periods for crew  training and ship maintenance (see fig. 9).", "While the Navy has recognized the challenges the high pace of  operations poses to the U.S.-based fleet and has begun implementing the  optimized fleet response plan for carrier strike groups deployed from  U.S. homeports, according to Pacific Fleet and Fleet Forces Command  officials, it has not determined how\u2014or whether\u2014it will apply the  optimized fleet response plan or a similar sustainable operational  schedule to all ships homeported overseas.

Specifically, Navy officials  provided the following data from authoritative Navy sources:", "Navy Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs\u2014 operations and support costs per ship in constant fiscal year 2014  dollars, fiscal years 2004 through 2013;", "Navy Energy Usage Reporting System\u2014deployed underway days per  ship, fiscal years 2003 through 2012;", "Commander, Navy Installations Command\u2014family housing, operation  and maintenance, and military construction costs by overseas  homeport location, fiscal years 2009 through 2018 (programmed);", "Fleet Forces Command\u2014daily numbers of casualty reports per ship,  January 2009 through July 2014;", "Board of Inspection and Survey\u2014material inspection data per ship,  fiscal years 2007 through 2014; and", "Office of the Chief of Naval Operations\u2014maintenance execution  rates, life of each ship.", "We selected the time frames for each of the data series above after  assessing their availability and reliability to maximize the amount of data  available for us to make meaningful comparisons. We assessed the  reliability of each of the data sources. The Navy provided information  based on our questions regarding data reliability, including information on  an overview of the data, data-collection processes and procedures, data  quality controls, and overall perceptions of data quality. The Navy  provided documentation of how the systems are structured and what  written procedures are in place to help ensure that the appropriate  information is collected and properly categorized. Additionally, we  interviewed Navy officials to obtain further clarification on data reliability,  discuss how the data were collected and reported, and explain how we  planned to use the data. After assessing the data, we determined that  they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the operational  benefits, costs, and readiness effects of homeporting ships in the United  States and overseas.", "For our comparative analyses, we focused on comparisons between  cruisers, destroyers, and amphibious warfare ships (amphibious assault  ships, amphibious transport dock ships, dock landing ships, and  amphibious command ships) homeported in the United States and those  homeported overseas because these historically have been the ship  classes most commonly homeported overseas and, therefore, the Navy  has the most robust data available for them. We did not include mine  countermeasures ships and patrol coastal ships in our comparative  analysis because these ship classes have had relatively little recent  experience deploying from U.S. homeports over the past 5 years,  according to Navy officials, and limited comparative data were available.  To understand the effects of overseas homeporting on infrastructure  investments and base operating costs, we examined Navy  documentation, such as leadership briefings on several recent decisions  to move ships to overseas homeports from 2009 through 2014 where  officials stated additional infrastructure was required. These moves  included decisions to homeport destroyers in Rota, Spain, and patrol  coastal and mine countermeasures ships in Bahrain. We also analyzed  cost data from 2009 through 2014, which includes these ship moves, for  family housing, operation and maintenance, and military construction at  overseas homeports. We assessed these data by reviewing Navy  documentation and discussing with Navy officials data-collection  processes and procedures and determined that they were reliable for the  purposes of reporting the infrastructure investments and operating costs  for overseas-homeported ships. We also obtained and analyzed Navy  policies and procedures for determining surface force readiness and ship  operational cycles.", "We also analyzed the economic effects of homeporting ships overseas;  specifically, the decreases in maintenance labor hours in the United  States that results from maintenance work being performed in foreign  shipyards while Navy ships are homeported overseas. To do so, we  obtained the projected maintenance workload for the large surface  combatants\u2014destroyers moving from U.S. homeports to Rota, Spain  (four ships) and Yokosuka, Japan (two ships)\u2014from the Office of the  Chief of Naval Operations for the approximately 7- to 10-year period  these ships are expected to be homeported overseas. Rota, Spain, and  Yokosuka, Japan, represent the only overseas homeports that the Navy  plans to relocate ships to in the next several years. We converted this  number of maintenance labor hours into full-time equivalents. For this  analysis, we assumed 2,080 hours of work per full-time equivalent,  recognizing that ship repair industry workers receive vacation and  holidays but also work high levels of overtime, according to Navy officials.  We also applied the fiscal year 2014 labor rates associated with  shipyards in each port that the destroyers were leaving in the United  States\u2014Norfolk, Virginia; Mayport, Florida; and San Diego, California\u2014to  determine the annual economic losses in U.S. shipyards in terms of  maintenance expenditures and full-time equivalents. We calculated  maintenance losses based on revenue transfers from labor and did not  include material cost-related transfers because Navy officials explained  that some portion of the material could be purchased in the United States.", "We interviewed officials from the Naval Sea Systems Command;  Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Commander, Naval  Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; Fleet Forces Command; U.S. Pacific  Fleet; 5th Fleet; 6th Fleet; and 7th Fleet to discuss these data, our  analyses, and their observations on the costs, readiness effects, and  operational benefits of homeporting ships overseas.", "To assess the extent to which the Navy has identified and taken steps to  mitigate any risks from homeporting ships overseas, we analyzed (1) key  Navy and Department of Defense (DOD) guidance and policies for  assigning ships to homeports in the United States and overseas and (2)  the Navy\u2019s required actions for evaluating, planning, and implementing  changes to overseas force structure. We interviewed Navy and State  Department officials to discuss these documents and determine whether  decision-making processes are in place and are being followed and what  factors, data, and lessons learned the Navy considers in making these  decisions. We also examined Navy force-structure requirements and the  2014 Navy Strategic Laydown and Dispersal Plan to understand the  basing construct for Navy ships, as well as any planned changes to the  laydown. We also analyzed previous Navy reports that studied the effect  of high operational tempo, different deployment approaches, and deferred  maintenance on the overall material condition of surface ships and on a  ship\u2019s service life.", "To illustrate the effect of potential decreases in ship service life on the  amphibious fleet inventory, we worked with the Congressional Budget  Office, which completes an annual assessment of the Navy\u2019s 30-year  shipbuilding plan and uses an internal model to show the annual  inventories of selected categories of ships under the Navy\u2019s plan and how  they align with the Navy\u2019s goals for those categories of ships. The  Congressional Budget Office published results of this model in December  2014 (see the upper panel of fig. 8). We asked the Congressional Budget  Office to use the model to deduct 6 years from the service lives of the  Amphibious Ready Group (one amphibious assault ship, two dock landing  ships, and one amphibious transport dock ship) homeported in Sasebo,  Japan, in order to determine the effects of these potential losses in  service life on the amphibious fleet inventory. The Congressional Budget  Office used its model to conduct this analysis and provided us with the  outputs found in the lower panel of figure 8. We summarized the results,  and Congressional Budget Office officials concurred that our  representation accurately depicts the predicted effects of reduced service  life on the amphibious fleet inventory. We deducted 6 years of service life  based on our discussions with Navy fleet and headquarters officials  regarding what constituted a reasonable reduction to a ship\u2019s service life.  For example, the upper time-frame limit we considered was based on the  Navy\u2019s prior proposal to retire an amphibious ship homeported overseas  16.5 years prior to the end of its expected service life. We recognize that  this is one potential outcome if the Navy chose not to make the significant  investments in depot maintenance required to mitigate effects to ship  service life for ships returning from overseas homeports. We chose the  Sasebo-based ships because this is the primary homeport for amphibious  ships located outside of the United States. Finally, we also reviewed the  Navy\u2019s plan to implement a revised operational schedule\u2014referred to as  the optimized fleet response plan\u2014and interviewed Navy officials to  discuss this plan, its purpose, expected benefits, and impact on ships\u2019  time allocated to maintenance, training, deployment, and operational  availability.

Days under way are periods when ships cannot enter depot maintenance,  which would prevent the Navy from spending large amounts on  sustainment. Accordingly, we estimated that an additional 50 days under  way in the prior year was associated with $0.7 million  more  spending on sustainment in the current year. The data suggest that the  Navy performs maintenance in roughly 2-year cycles. Ships rotate in and  out of higher operational tempo, and the Navy concentrates sustainment  spending on specific periods.", "Given this pattern, overseas homeporting should be associated with more  sustainment spending in the year when the ship returns to U.S.- homeported status and has more opportunities for depot maintenance.  Accordingly, based on model 2.2, we found that Navy spent about $5.8  million  more on sustainment in the year after the average ship  returned to a U.S. homeport, compared to the average ship that was  never homeported overseas.

Table 9 provides  the average daily number of CASREPS per ship by month and type of  homeport.", "In this appendix, we describe the statistical methods we used and the  results of our analysis for the average daily number of CASREPs per  ship. Our use of statistical methods provides limited assurance that our  results reflect the influence of overseas homeporting, rather than other  related factors. This improves upon simple comparisons of the raw data,  as in table 9. However, we did not design the analysis to account for all  relevant factors, and therefore our results are not conclusive causal  estimates.", "First, we fit time-series regression models with autoregressive errors (AR  lag of 1) to the monthly data from ships homeported overseas and in the  United States to account for the positive autocorrelation. We used these  models to estimate the trend for all ships and for each deployment status  separately. The purpose of this analysis of the CASREP data was to  analyze changes in the daily averages from month to month to describe  the trends from January 2009 through July 2014. Table 10 provides  estimates of the model\u2019s key parameters.", "Based on these models, we estimated that there is a significant upward  trend for both overseas- and U.S.-homeported ships. The trend for ships  homeported overseas is increasing at a slightly and statistically significant  higher rate than ships homeported in the United States (about 1  additional report per year). Specifically, the estimated trend for the  average daily number of casualty reports per ship is increasing at a rate  of about 3.7 per year (0.3062*12 months) for overseas-homeported ships  and about 2.4 per year (0.2014*12 months) for U.S.-homeported ships.", "Next, we fit the following statistical model to our data:  Casrepsit = \u03b4 Overseasit + \u03bc + \u03c4 + eit  For ship i and month t, Casreps measured the number of deployed days  underway, Overseas indicated being homeported overseas, \u03bc + \u03c4 were  vectors of ship and monthly fixed effects, respectively, and e was random  error.", "The fixed effects held constant all ship characteristics that did not change  over time, such as class, and year commissioned. The monthly fixed  effects in \u03c4 held constant all changes over time observed among all ships.  Table 11 provides estimates of the model\u2019s key parameters, which we  derived using least squared methods with asymptotic robustness  correction for potentially nonindependent errors with ships and for  heteroskedasticity.", "Based on the model, we did not identify a statistically significant  association between higher numbers of casualty reports and a ship being  homeported overseas. However, we estimated that ships homeported  overseas had, on average, about 25 casualty reports (+/-11.6) and ships  homeported in the United States had about 20 casualty reports (+/-1.7).  The differences between these estimates are not statistically significant at  the 95 percent confidence level."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary and Limitations of the Results", "paragraphs": ["Our statistical analysis described the associations among homeport type,  the average number of daily CASREPs per ship holding constant factors  such as ship type, age, and common trends in military operations.

Despite  its ability to account for certain alternative explanations and quantify  uncertainty, our analysis has certain limitations that affect the  interpretation and use of its findings.", "The variation in homeport type over time within ships allowed us to use  ship and fiscal year fixed effects, which can be powerful methods to  control for many unobserved factors without explicitly measuring them.  Nevertheless, the validity of our findings is limited by the lack of available  data on other factors that could vary over time within ships. Our results  are biased to the extent that these factors exist.
