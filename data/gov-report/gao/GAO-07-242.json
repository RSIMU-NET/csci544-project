Congress created section 38 as well as section 39, which required regulators to prescribe safety and soundness standards related to noncapital criteria, to address weaknesses in regulatory oversight during the bank and thrift crisis of the 1980s that contributed to deposit insurance losses. The 2005 act also required GAO to report on changes to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) deposit insurance system. This report (1) examines how regulators have used PCA to resolve capital adequacy issues at depository institutions, (2) assesses the extent to which regulators have used noncapital supervisory actions under sections 38 and 39, and (3) describes how recent changes to FDIC's deposit insurance system affect the determination of institutions' insurance premiums. GAO reviewed regulators' PCA procedures and actions taken on a sample of undercapitalized institutions. GAO also reviewed the final rule on changes to the insurance system and comments from industry and academic experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the financial condition of depository institutions generally has been strong, which has resulted in the regulators' infrequent use of PCA provisions to resolve capital adequacy issues of troubled institutions. Partly because they benefited from a strong economy in the last decade, banks and thrifts in undercapitalized and lower capital categories decreased from 1,235 in 1992, the year regulators implemented PCA, to 14 in 2005, and none failed from June 2004 through January 2007. For the banks and thrifts GAO reviewed, regulators generally implemented PCA in accordance with section 38. For example, regulators identified when institutions failed to meet minimum capital requirements, required them to implement capital restoration plans or corrective actions outlined in enforcement orders, and took steps to close or require the sale or merger of those institutions that were unable to recapitalize. Although regulators generally used PCA appropriately, capital is a lagging indicator and thus not necessarily a timely predictor of problems at banks and thrifts. In most cases GAO reviewed, regulators had responded to safety and soundness problems in advance of a bank or thrift's decline in required PCA capital levels. Under section 38 regulators can take noncapital supervisory actions to reclassify an institution's capital category or dismiss officers and directors from deteriorating institutions, and under section 39 regulators can require institutions to implement plans to address deficiencies in their compliance with regulatory safety and soundness standards. Regulators generally have made limited use of these authorities, in part because they have chosen other informal and formal actions to address problems at troubled institutions. According to the regulators, other tools, such as cease-and-desist orders, may provide more flexibility than those available under sections 38 and 39 because they are not tied to an institution's capital level and may allow them to address more complex or multiple deficiencies with one action. Regulators' discretion to choose how and when to address safety and soundness weaknesses is demonstrated by their limited use of section 38 and 39 provisions and more frequent use of other informal and formal actions. Recent changes to FDIC's deposit insurance system tie the premiums a bank or thrift pays into the insurance fund more directly to the estimated risk the institution poses to the fund. In the revised system, FDIC generally (1) differentiates between larger institutions with current credit agency ratings and $10 billion or more in assets and all other, smaller institutions and (2) requires all institutions to pay premiums based on their individual risk. Most bankers, industry groups, and academics GAO interviewed and many of the organizations and individuals that submitted comment letters to FDIC on the new system generally supported making the system more risk based, but also had some concerns about unintended effects. FDIC and the other federal banking regulators intend to monitor the new system for any adverse impacts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the failure of more than 2,900 federally insured banks and thrifts in  the 1980s and early 1990s, federal regulators were criticized for failing to  take timely and forceful action to address the causes of these failures and  prevent losses to the deposit insurance fund and taxpayers. In response to  the federal banking regulators\u2019 failure to take appropriate action, Congress  passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of  1991 (FDICIA), implementing significant changes to the way banking  regulators supervise the nation\u2019s depository institutions. FDICIA created  two new sections in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA)\u2014sections  38 and 39\u2014that required the federal banking regulators to create a two- part framework to supplement their existing supervisory authority to  address capital deficiencies and unsafe or unsound conduct, practices, or  conditions. The addition of sections 38 and 39 to FDIA were intended to  improve the ability of regulators to identify and promptly address  deficiencies at an institution to better safeguard the deposit insurance  fund. Specifically, section 38 requires regulators to classify depository  institutions into one of five capital categories based on their level of  capital\u2014well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,  significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized\u2014and take  increasingly severe actions, known as prompt corrective action (PCA), as  an institution\u2019s capital deteriorates. Section 38 primarily focuses on  capital as an indicator of trouble, thus the supervisory actions authorized  under it are almost exclusively designed to address an institution\u2019s  deteriorating capital level (for example, requiring undercapitalized  institutions to implement capital restoration plans). However, section 38  also authorizes noncapital supervisory actions (for example, removing  officers and directors or downgrading an institution\u2019s capital level).  Section 39 required the banking regulators to prescribe safety and  soundness standards related to noncapital criteria, including operations  and management; compensation; and asset quality, earnings, and stock  valuation, and allows the regulators to take action if an institution fails to  meet one or more of these standards. Since the passage of FDICIA, banks  and thrifts have benefited from a strong economy, but this has not  diminished the importance of the need for regulators to take early and  forceful action to address capital and noncapital deficiencies.", "FDICIA also granted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  the authority to establish and maintain a system\u2014the deposit insurance  system\u2014to assess the relative risk of federally insured banks and thrifts  and charge them premiums based on that risk. In February 2006, Congress  granted FDIC the authority to make substantive changes to the deposit  insurance system, including the way the regulator assesses risk and  assigns premiums. FDIC issued its final rule implementing changes in  November 2006.", "This report responds to the mandate contained in section 6 of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 requiring  the Comptroller General to report on issues relating to the federal banking  regulators\u2019 administration of the PCA program under section 38 of FDIA as  well as various aspects of FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance system. Because the  banking regulators also monitor the safety and soundness of depository  institutions using criteria other than capital levels, this report also includes  a review of the federal banking regulators\u2019 use of safety and soundness  standards under section 39. Specifically, this report (1) describes trends in  the financial condition of banks and thrifts and federal regulators\u2019  oversight of these institutions since the passage of FDICIA, (2) evaluates  how federal regulators have used PCA to resolve capital adequacy issues  at the institutions they regulate, (3) evaluates the extent to which federal  regulators have used the noncapital supervisory actions of sections   38 and 39 to address weaknesses at the institutions they regulate, and   (4) describes FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance system and how recent changes to  the system affect the determination of institutions\u2019 risk and insurance  premiums.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and  regulators\u2019 policies and procedures and interviewed officials from the four  federal banking regulators\u2014FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)\u2014as well as  industry officials and academics. We also reviewed our previous reports  on PCA. To describe trends in the financial condition of banks and thrifts  and regulators\u2019 oversight of these institutions since the passage of FDICIA,  we reviewed relevant industry reports and analyses. We also analyzed  regulator and industry data to determine, among other things, the number  of well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, and undercapitalized  institutions and the number of institutions appearing on the problem  institutions list since 1992, the year regulators implemented FDICIA. To  assess how federal regulators have used PCA to resolve capital adequacy  issues at the institutions they regulate, we reviewed section 38 and its  implementing regulations, as well as regulators\u2019 policies and procedures.  We also examined reports of examination, informal and formal  enforcement actions, and institution-regulator correspondence for a  nonprobability sample of 24 institutions from a population of 157  institutions that fell below one of the three lowest PCA capital thresholds  at least once from 2001 through 2005. We chose this period for review  based on the availability of examination- and enforcement-related  documents and to reflect the most current policies and procedures used  by the regulators. The sample reflects a mix of institutions regulated by  each of the four regulators as well as a mix of the three lowest PCA capital  categories. In 6 of these 24 cases, regulators did not implement PCA  because they determined that it was not warranted. In addition, we  reviewed the material loss reviews of all banks and thrifts that failed from  1992 through 2005 and in which the primary regulator implemented PCA to  address capital adequacy issues. To determine the extent to which  federal regulators have used the noncapital supervisory actions of sections  38 and 39 to address weaknesses at the institutions they regulate, we  reviewed regulators\u2019 policies and procedures related to sections  38(f)(2)(F) and 38(g) (the provisions for dismissal of officers and directors  and reclassification of a capital category, respectively) and section 39, as  well as data on the number of times and for what purposes they used these  noncapital authorities. To provide context on the extent of regulators\u2019 use  of these noncapital provisions, we also obtained data on the number of  times regulators used their authority under section 8(e) of FDIA to remove  officers and directors from office and section 8(b) to enforce compliance  with safety and soundness standards. Finally, to describe how changes in  FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance system affect the determination of institutions\u2019  risk and insurance premiums, we reviewed FDIC\u2019s notice of proposed rule  making on deposit insurance assessments, selected comments to the  proposed rule, and FDIC\u2019s final rule on deposit insurance assessments.  We also interviewed representatives of five depository institutions (three  large and two small) and two trade groups representing large and small  institutions and two academics to obtain their views on the impact of  FDIC\u2019s changes to the system. Appendix I contains a more detailed  description of our scope and methodology. We conducted our work in  Washington, D.C., and Chicago from March 2006 through January 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Four federal banking regulators\u2014FDIC, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and  OTS\u2014oversee the nation\u2019s banks and thrifts to ensure they are operating  in a safe and sound manner.

FDICIA also required FDIC to establish a system  to assess the risk of depository institutions insured by the deposit  insurance fund."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Regulation of Banks and Thrifts", "paragraphs": ["FDIC insures the deposits of all federally insured depository institutions,  generally up to $100,000 per depositor, and monitors their risk to the  deposit insurance fund. In addition, FDIC is the primary regulator for  state-chartered nonmember banks (that is, state-chartered banks that are  not members of the Federal Reserve System), the Federal Reserve is the  primary regulator for state-chartered member banks (state-chartered  banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System) and bank holding  companies, OCC is the primary regulator of federally chartered banks, and  OTS is the primary regulator of federally and state-chartered thrifts and  thrift holding companies.", "Federal regulators have defined several categories of risk to which  depository institutions are exposed\u2014credit risk, compliance risk, legal  risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputational risk, and  strategic risk (see table 1).", "Banks and thrifts, in conjunction with regulators, must continually manage  risks to ensure their safe and sound operation and protect the well-being  of depositors\u2014those individuals and organizations that act as creditors by  \u201cloaning\u201d their funds in the form of deposits to institutions to engage in  lending and other activities. Regulators are responsible for supervising the  activities of banks and thrifts and taking corrective action when these  activities and their overall performance present supervisory concerns or  have the potential to result in financial losses to the insurance fund or  violations of law. Losses to the insurance fund may occur when an  institution does not have sufficient assets to reimburse customers\u2019 insured  deposits and FDIC\u2019s administrative expenses in the event of closure or  merger.", "Regulators assess the condition of banks and thrifts through off-site  monitoring and on-site examinations. Examiners use Reports of Condition  and Income (Call Report) and Thrift Financial Report data to remotely  assess the financial condition of banks and thrifts, respectively, and to  plan the scope of on-site examinations. As part of on-site examinations,  regulators more closely assess institutions\u2019 exposure to risk and assign  institutions ratings, known as CAMELS ratings, that reflect their condition  in six areas: capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and  sensitivity to market risk. Each component is rated on a scale of 1 to 5,  with 1 the best and 5 the worst. The component ratings then are used to  develop a composite rating also ranging from 1 to 5. Institutions with  composite ratings of 1 or 2 are considered to be in satisfactory condition,  while institutions with composite ratings of 3, 4, or 5 exhibit varying levels  of safety and soundness problems. Also as part of the examination and  general supervision process, regulators may direct an institution to  address issues or deficiencies within specified time frames.", "When regulators determine that a bank or thrift\u2019s condition is  unsatisfactory, they may take a variety of supervisory actions, including  informal and formal enforcement actions, to address identified  deficiencies and have some discretion in deciding which actions to take.  Regulators typically take progressively stricter actions against more  serious weaknesses. Informal actions generally are used to address less  severe deficiencies or when the regulator has confidence that the  institution is willing and able to implement changes. Informal actions  include, for example, commitment letters detailing an institution\u2019s  commitment to undertake specific remedial measures, board resolutions  adopted by the institution\u2019s board of directors at the request of its  regulator, and memorandums of understanding. Informal actions are not  public agreements (meaning, regulators do not make them public through  their Web sites or other channels) and are not enforceable by the  imposition of sanctions. In comparison, formal enforcement actions are  publicly disclosed by regulators and enforceable and are used to address  more severe deficiencies or when the regulator has limited confidence in  an institution\u2019s ability to implement changes. Formal enforcement actions  include, for example, PCA directives, cease-and-desist orders under  section 8(b) of FDIA, removal and prohibition orders under section 8(e) of  FDIA, civil money penalties, and termination of an institution\u2019s deposit  insurance.", "All four regulators have policies and procedures that describe for  examiners the circumstances under which they should recommend the use  of informal and formal enforcement actions to address identified  deficiencies. Each federal banking regulator also has established a means  through which senior management of the applicable federal regulator  reviews all enforcement recommendations to ensure that the proposed  actions are the best and most efficient means to bring an institution back  into compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and best practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capital and Noncapital Actions of FDIA", "paragraphs": ["Section 38 of FDIA requires regulators to categorize depository  institutions into five categories on the basis of their capital levels.  Regulators use three different capital measures to determine an  institution\u2019s capital category: (1) a total risk-based capital measure, (2) a  tier 1 risk-based capital measure, and (3) a leverage (or non-risk-based)  capital measure (see table 2). To be considered well capitalized or  adequately capitalized, an institution must meet or exceed all three ratios  for the applicable capital category. Institutions are considered  undercapitalized or worse if they fail to meet just one of the ratios  necessary to be considered at least adequately capitalized. For example,  an institution with 9 percent total risk-based capital and 6 percent tier 1  risk-based capital but only 3.5 percent leverage capital would be  undercapitalized for PCA purposes.", "Under section 38, regulators must take increasingly severe supervisory  actions as an institution\u2019s capital level deteriorates. For example, all  undercapitalized institutions are required to implement capital restoration  plans to restore capital to at least the adequately capitalized level, and  regulators are generally required to close critically undercapitalized  institutions within a 90-day period. Section 38 allows an exception to the  90-day closure rule if both the primary regulator and FDIC concur and  document why some other action would better achieve the purpose of  section 38\u2014resolving the problems of institutions at the least possible  long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund.", "Resolving failed or failing institutions is one of FDIC\u2019s primary  responsibilities under PCA. In selecting the least costly resolution  alternative, FDIC\u2019s process is to compare the estimated cost of  liquidation\u2014basically, the amount of insured deposits paid out minus the  net realizable value of an institution\u2019s assets\u2014with the amounts that  potential acquirers bid for the institution\u2019s assets and deposits. FDIC   has resolved failed or failing institutions using three basic methods:   (1) directly paying depositors the insured amount of their deposits and  disposing of the failed institution\u2019s assets (depositor payoff and asset  liquidation); (2) selling only the institution\u2019s insured deposits and certain  other liabilities, with some of its assets, to an acquirer (insured deposit  transfer); and (3) selling some or all of the failed institution\u2019s deposits,  certain other liabilities, and some or all of its assets to an acquirer  (purchase and assumption). Within this third category, many variations  exist based on specific assets that are offered for sale. For example, some  purchase and assumption resolutions also have included loss-sharing  agreements\u2014an arrangement whereby FDIC, in order to sell certain assets  with the intent of limiting losses to the deposit insurance fund, agrees to  share with the acquirer the losses on those assets.", "Section 38 also authorizes several non-capital-based supervisory actions  designed to allow regulators some flexibility in achieving the purpose of  section 38. Specifically, under section 38(g) regulators are permitted to  reclassify or downgrade an institution\u2019s capital category to apply more  stringent operating restrictions or requirements if they determine, after  notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an institution is in an unsafe and  unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Under  section 38(f)(2)(F) regulators can require an institution to make  improvements in management, for example, by dismissing officers and  directors who are not able to materially strengthen an institution\u2019s ability  to become adequately capitalized.", "Section 39 directs regulatory attention to noncapital areas of an  institution\u2019s operations and activities in three main safety and soundness  areas: operations and management; compensation; and asset quality,  earnings, and stock valuation. As originally enacted under FDICIA, section  39 required regulators to develop and implement standards in these three  areas, as well as develop quantitative standards for asset quality and  earnings. However, in response to concerns about the potential regulatory  burden of section 39 on banks and thrifts, section 318 of the Riegle  Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994  amended section 39 to allow the standards to be issued either by  regulation (as originally specified in FDICIA) or by guideline and  eliminated the requirement to establish quantitative standards for asset  quality and earnings. The regulators chose to prescribe the standards  through guideline rather than regulation, essentially providing them with  flexibility in how and when they would take action against institutions that  failed to meet the standards. Under section 39, if a regulator determines  that an institution has failed to meet a prescribed standard, the regulator  may require that the institution file a safety and soundness plan specifying  the steps it will take to correct the deficiency. If the institution fails to  submit an acceptable plan or fails to materially implement or adhere to an  approved plan, the regulator must require the institution, through the  issuance of a public order, to correct identified deficiencies and may take  other enforcement actions pending the correction of the deficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deposit Insurance System", "paragraphs": ["In addition to adding sections 38 and 39 to FDIA to address capital  inadequacy and safety and soundness problems at depository institutions,  FDICIA also required FDIC to establish a system\u2014the deposit insurance  system\u2014to assess the risk of federally insured depository institutions and  charge premiums to finance a deposit insurance fund meant to protect  depositors in the event of future bank and thrift failures.", "At the urging of FDIC, in February 2006 Congress enacted legislation  granting the regulator authority to make substantive changes to the  deposit insurance system, including the way it assesses the risk of  institutions and determines their premiums. In July 2006, FDIC issued its  proposed rule outlining proposed changes to the deposit insurance system  and opened a public comment period. FDIC adopted a final rule in  November 2006.

Historical data show  that the interval between full-scope, on-site examinations for all  institutions peaked in 1986 when it reached 609 days. Subsequent to the  enactment of FDICIA in December 1991, the average interval between  examinations for all institutions declined to 373 days in 1992.

In  its material loss review for the bank, the FDIC IG noted that even though  FDIC examiners applied PCA in accordance with regulatory guidelines,  other factors, including the bank\u2019s failure to abide by FDIC  recommendations related to the administration of its loan program,  resulted in an overstatement of both net income and capital and limited  PCA\u2019s effectiveness in minimizing losses to the insurance fund. In our  review of FDIC\u2019s reports of examination and other information for the  bank, we found that FDIC examiners continually informed the bank of its  capital status and made repeated requests to management to recapitalize.  However, the bank\u2019s reported capital level never fell to critically  undercapitalized\u2014the point at which FDIC has the authority to close an  institution under section 38.", "In 6 of the 24 sampled cases we reviewed, we determined that use of PCA  was not required to address declines in capital reported on quarterly Call  and Thrift Financial Reports (see table 4)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators Used Other Enforcement Actions to Address Deficiencies in Sampled Institutions Prior to Declines in Their PCA Capital Categories", "paragraphs": ["Although PCA requires regulators to take regulatory action when an  institution fails to meet established minimum capital requirements, capital  is a lagging indicator and thus not necessarily a timely predictor of  problems at banks and thrifts. Although capital is an essential and  accepted measure of an institution\u2019s financial health, it does not typically  begin to decline until an institution has experienced substantial  deterioration in other areas, such as asset quality and the quality of bank  management. As a result, regulatory actions focused solely on capital may  have limited effects because of the extent of deterioration that may have  already occurred in other areas. All four regulators generally agreed that  by design, PCA is not a tool that can be used upon early recognition of an  institution\u2019s troubled status\u2014in all of the cases we examined, regulators  took steps, in addition to PCA, to address institutions\u2019 troubled conditions.", "For example, 12 of the 18 banks and thrifts subject to PCA that we  examined experienced a decline in their CAMELS ratings to composite  ratings of 4 or 5 prior to or generally concurrent with becoming  undercapitalized. CAMELS ratings measure an institution\u2019s performance in  six areas\u2014capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and  sensitivity to market risk. These ratings are a key product of regulators\u2019  on-site monitoring of institutions, providing information on the condition  and performance of banks and thrifts, and can be useful in predicting their  failure. The FDIC IG found a similar trend among the banks it examined as  part of an evaluation of FDIC\u2019s implementation of PCA.", "All of the 18 institutions we examined also appeared on at least one of  three regulator watch lists\u2014the FDIC problem institutions list, the FDIC  resolution cases list, and the FDIC projected failure list\u2014prior to or  concurrent with becoming undercapitalized (see fig. 6). Regulators use  these and their own watch lists to monitor the status of troubled  institutions and, in some cases, ensure their timely resolution (that is,  facilitating the merger or closure of institutions to prevent losses to the  insurance fund); the lists were another means through which regulators  monitored and addressed problems or potential problems at the 18  institutions prior to declines in PCA capital categories.", "Consistent with banks and thrifts exhibiting declining CAMELS ratings and  appearing on one or more watch lists prior to or concurrent with  becoming undercapitalized, at least 15 of the 18 banks and thrifts that we  reviewed had informal or formal enforcement actions in place prior to  becoming undercapitalized.

Because PCA was not  implemented timely in these cases, it was not effective in containing losses  to the deposit insurance fund.", "According to the Treasury IG, Keystone\u2019s operating strategy entailed  growth into the high-risk areas of subprime lending and selling loans for  securitization. The bank\u2019s growth in these areas occurred without  adequate management systems and controls, and inaccurate financial  records masked the bank\u2019s true financial condition. At the time of the  bank\u2019s failure, allegations of fraud were under investigation. In its material  loss review of the bank, the IG noted that if OCC had reclassified the  bank\u2019s capital category from well capitalized to adequately capitalized  following an examination in late 1997, OCC could have restricted the  bank\u2019s use of brokered deposits and applied certain interest-rate  restrictions in an effort to curb the bank\u2019s growth 6 months before its  capital levels showed serious signs of decline. Instead, these restrictions  were not put in place until June 1998 when OCC required the bank to  adjust its reported capital based on examination findings\u2014this adjustment  resulted in a downgrade in the bank\u2019s capital category from well  capitalized to undercapitalized and trigged PCA restrictions.

Our 2002 testimony on the failure of Superior Bank and the IG\u2019s material  loss review suggested that had OTS acknowledged problems at Superior  Bank when examiners became aware of them in 1993, PCA would have  been triggered sooner and might have slowed the bank\u2019s growth and  contained its losses to the deposit insurance fund. The IG further noted  that OTS\u2019s delayed detection of so many critical problems suggests that  the advantage of PCA as an early intervention tool depends as much on  timely supervisory detection of actual, if not developing, problems as it  does on capital."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Made Limited and Targeted Use of the Noncapital Supervisory Actions Available under Sections 38 and 39", "paragraphs": ["Under section 38 regulators have the ability to reclassify an institution\u2019s  capital category and dismiss officers and directors from deteriorating  banks and thrifts.

In practice, this means that regulators may, in certain  circumstances, treat a well-capitalized institution as if it were adequately  capitalized, an adequately capitalized institution as if it were  undercapitalized, and an undercapitalized institution as if it were  significantly undercapitalized. Regulators are prohibited from reclassifying  or downgrading an institution more than one capital category and cannot  downgrade a significantly undercapitalized institution to critically  undercapitalized.

They said that the PCA authority occupies the middle ground between  moral suasion and the removal and prohibition authority under section  8(e) of FDIA. According to the regulators, the first step in confronting  problem officers and directors is moral suasion\u2014that is, reminding the  board of directors that it has an obligation to ensure that the institution is  competently managed. In many cases, we were told that this reminder  often is enough to force the resignations of problem individuals.  Dismissal under section 38 represents a \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d option\u2014it  results in a ban from serving as an officer or director in the institution in  question. In order to be reinstated, the dismissed individual must  demonstrate that he or she has the capacity to materially strengthen the  institution\u2019s ability to become adequately capitalized or correct unsafe or  unsound conditions or practices. Regulators also have a more severe  option\u2014removal under section 8(e), which results in an industrywide  prohibition and consequently, requires proof of a high degree of  misconduct or malfeasance. Data show that regulators have used section  8(e) with some regularity (see fig. 11). The regulators said that if an  individual\u2019s misconduct rises to the level required to support removal and  prohibition under section 8(e), use of that authority generally is preferable  to dismissal under section 38.", "The regulators also noted that moral suasion and section 8(e) are not  necessarily capital based, meaning that both can be used at times when  PCA cannot. The regulators acknowledged that section 38 permits them to  reclassify an institution\u2019s capital category to dismiss an officer or director;  however, they said that because section 38 only allows them to dismiss  individuals from institutions that are undercapitalized or worse by PCA  standards, the tool generally is not available to them in these good  economic times when all or most of the institutions they regulate are well  capitalized. OCC was of the view that section 38\u2019s dismissal authority  could be more useful if it were uncoupled from capital and instead  triggered by less-than-satisfactory ratings in the management component  of the CAMELS rating. In particular, OCC officials said that linking the  authority to the CAMELS rating could provide regulators with the  authority to dismiss individuals who did not meet the criteria for removal  and prohibition under section 8(e) and from institutions with boards that  were unresponsive to regulators\u2019 moral suasion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Use Section 39 to Address Targeted Safety and Soundness Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Changes to section 39 in 1994 gave regulators considerable flexibility over  how and when to use their authority under the section to address safety  and soundness deficiencies at the institutions they regulate.

Based on its capital levels  and supervisory ratings, an institution fell into one of nine risk categories  (see table 6). However, the vast majority of institutions\u201495 percent at  year-end 2005\u2014fell into category 1A, even though, according to FDIC  officials, there were significant differences among individual institutions\u2019  risk profiles within the category.", "Further, according to FDIC, in 2005, 95 percent of institutions did not pay  premiums into the insurance fund because the agency was barred from  charging premiums to well-managed and well-capitalized institutions when  the deposit insurance fund was at or above its designated reserve ratio,  and was expected to remain there.

The general method uses two sources of  information as inputs to a statistical model designed to predict the  probability of a downgrade in an institution\u2019s CAMELS rating: (1) financial  ratios (such as an institution\u2019s capital, past-due loans, and income) and   (2) CAMELS ratings. According to FDIC officials, little other information is  readily available to assess risk for these institutions. However, FDIC data  show that the higher on the CAMELS scale institutions are rated, the  higher the rate of failure\u2014the 5-year failure rate is 0.39 percent for  CAMELS 1-rated banks, 3.84 percent for 3-rated banks, and 46.92 percent  for 5-rated banks\u2014thus making CAMELS ratings and financial ratios a  reasonable basis for assessing risk.", "The large-institution method also uses CAMELS ratings. But rather than  employ financial ratios, it incorporates market-based information\u2014credit  agency ratings of an institution\u2019s debt offerings. FDIC officials told us that  incorporating debt ratings provides a fuller, market-based picture of an  institution\u2019s condition than do financial ratios. For example, some large  institutions concentrate in certain activities, such as transactions  processing or credit cards, while others provide more general services.  According to FDIC officials, financial ratios may not adequately  distinguish among such different activities. Also, credit ratings determine  how much institutions must pay to obtain funds in capital markets\u2014well- rated banks and thrifts will pay less, while institutions the market judges  as riskier will pay more. Thus, according to FDIC officials, it makes sense  to align premiums with these market-based funding costs. In addition to its  ability to use the CAMELS and credit ratings, FDIC also has the flexibility  to adjust premiums for large institutions up to 0.5 basis points up or down  based on other relevant information (such as market analyst reports,  rating-agency watch lists, and rates paid on subordinated debt) as well as  stress considerations (such as how an institution would be expected to  react to a sudden and significant change in interest rates). If a large  institution does not have an available credit agency rating, its premium is  calculated according to the general method.", "The new insurance system places banks and thrifts into one of four risk  categories, each of which has a corresponding premium or range of  premiums. These \u201cbase rate\u201d premiums range from 2 to 4 basis points for  banks and thrifts in the best-rated category, risk category I, to 40 basis  points for institutions in the bottom category, risk category IV (see table  7). Thus, for example, under the base rate schedule the riskiest  institutions (risk category IV) pay a premium rate 20 times greater than the  best-rated banks and thrifts (minimum rate, risk category I). Even within  the best category, riskier institutions pay twice the rate paid by the safest  banks and thrifts, reducing the tendency for subsidies under the old  system. The same premium schedule applies to all institutions, regardless  of their premium assessment method.", "Under the new system, FDIC has limited authority, without resorting to  new rule making, to vary premiums from the base rates as necessary and  appropriate. For assessments beginning in 2007, FDIC has used this  flexibility to increase premiums by 3 basis points over the base rates.  Thus, the current rate for risk category I is 5 to 7 basis points, rather than 2  to 4 basis points; for risk category II, the premium is 10 basis points; for  risk category III, the premium is 28 basis points; and for risk category IV,  the premium is 43 basis points. According to FDIC, the increase in  premiums for 2007 was necessary because of strong growth in insured  deposits and the availability of premium credits to many institutions under  the terms of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005.", "In general, to set the premium rates for each of the four risk categories,  FDIC officials told us they considered both what the differences should be  in premiums among risk categories and, taking those differences into  account, the level at which the premiums should be established.  Considering the two together, the goal was to create a schedule of rates  with the best chance of maintaining the insurance fund with a designated  reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of insured deposits, with  the former representing the required minimum under the Federal Deposit  Insurance Reform Act of 2005, and the latter being the level at which  mandated rebates of premiums to banks and thrifts must begin. FDIC  officials told us they established the level of premiums based on four  factors: (1) historical data on insurance losses, (2) FDIC operating  expenses, (3) projected interest rates and their effect on FDIC investment  portfolio income, and (4) expected growth of insured deposits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Focusing More on Risk, the New System Stops Short of Completely Risk-Based Pricing", "paragraphs": ["Although the new system ties premiums more specifically to the risk an  individual institution presents to the insurance fund, it does not represent  completely risk-based pricing. As a result, some degree of cross-subsidy  still exists in the new system. In particular, as estimated by FDIC,  institutions in risk category IV would need to pay premiums of about 100  basis points to cover the expected losses of the group. However, FDIC has  chosen to set the base rate premium for these banks and thrifts at 40 basis  points, or 60 percent below the indicated premium. In doing so, FDIC  officials told us they sought to address long-standing concerns of the  industry, regulators, and others that premiums should not be set so high as  to prevent an institution that is troubled and seeking to rebuild its health  from doing so. In contrast, some have suggested that capping premiums to  address such concerns ultimately may cost the insurance fund more in the  long run\u2014lower premiums for riskier institutions may allow them to  remain open longer, resulting in greater losses if and when they eventually  fail. FDIC officials said that the number of institutions in category IV is  small and thus the trade-off between lower premiums for troubled  institutions and potentially larger losses later is not significant. Further,  they said that the 40 basis point base rate applicable to the highest risk  institutions represents a sizable increase over the assessment rate for  these institutions under the previous system.", "Another way FDIC\u2019s new premium pricing system stops short of being  completely risk based is that it does not take into account \u201csystemic risk.\u201d  In a fully risk-based system, premiums would be set to reflect two major  components: expected losses plus a premium for systemwide risk of  failure or default. According to academics we spoke to, FDIC\u2019s new  system reflects the first component, but not the second. Incorporating the  notion of systemic risk into the premium calculation would acknowledge  that failure of some banks could have repercussions to the financial  system as a whole and that such failures are more likely during economic  downturns. FDIC officials told us that the new system does not reflect  systemic risk for several reasons. First, there is an alternative mechanism  for capturing what is effectively a systemic risk premium. Second, FDIC  officials said that charging an up-front premium for systemic risk could  prevent institutions from getting the best premium rate on the basis of  their size, which is not permitted under the 2005 Federal Deposit  Insurance Reform Act. And finally, FDIC officials said that FDIC has  other sources of financing available to address losses resulting from large- scale failures, including borrowing from the industry, a $30 billion line of  credit with Treasury, and the ability to borrow from the Federal Financing  Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Industry Officials and Academics Generally Support the New System, but Have Voiced Concerns about Certain Aspects", "paragraphs": ["In our review of selected comments to FDIC\u2019s proposed rule and  interviews with bankers, industry trade groups, and academics, we found  that the industry generally supported the concept of a more risk-based  insurance premium system. However, several of those to whom we spoke  and many organizations that submitted comments to FDIC raised several  concerns about the new system. First, many said that the new system  places too much weight on subjective factors, which could result in  incorrect assessments of institutions\u2019 actual risk. Specifically, officials  from two trade associations and one small bank who we interviewed  questioned the inclusion of, or the weight given to, the management  component of the CAMELS ratings. One considered this component to be  the most subjective of the CAMELS component areas. Six additional  organizations noted in comment letters their concern with FDIC\u2019s plan to  assign different weights to the CAMELS components, noting in at least one  case that FDIC had provided no evidence to support using a weighted  rating in place of the composite rating. FDIC officials said that the weights  were set in consultation with the other federal banking regulators and  represent the relative importance of each component as it pertains to the  risk an institution presents to the insurance fund. Specifically, FDIC  officials said that asset quality, management, and capital are often key  factors in an institution\u2019s failure and any subsequent losses to the  insurance fund, and thus warrant more consideration than other factors in  the calculation of risk.", "Similarly, in comment letters to FDIC, five large banks, three trade groups,  and one financial services company expressed concern with the part of the  rule that gives FDIC flexibility to adjust large institutions\u2019 premiums up or  down based on other information, including other market information and  financial performance and conditions measures (such as market analyst  reports, assessments of the severity of potential losses, and stress factors).  All of these organizations cautioned that to do so would undermine the  assessments of institutions\u2019 primary regulators regarding their  performance and health (as expressed in CAMELS ratings, a primary  component of FDIC\u2019s system). According to FDIC, this authority to adjust  ratings in consultation with other federal regulators is necessary to ensure  consistency, fairness, and the consideration of all available information.  FDIC officials said that the agency plans to clarify its processes for making  any adjustments to ensure transparency and plans to propose and seek  comments on additional guidelines for evaluating whether premium  adjustments are warranted and the size of the adjustments.", "Related to these concerns, officials from one large bank, one small bank,  and one trade association and one of the academics with whom we spoke  said that FDIC\u2019s new system is overly complicated and that it might not be  readily apparent to bank or thrift management how activities at their  respective institutions could affect the calculation of their insurance  premiums. Seven others expressed similar concerns in comment letters to  FDIC. In its final rule, FDIC stated that while the pricing method is  complex, its application is straightforward. For example, if an institution\u2019s  capital declines, its premium will likely increase. Further, FDIC officials  said that the FDIC Web site contains a rate calculator that allows an  institution to determine its premium and to simulate how a change in the  value of debt ratings, supervisory ratings, or financial ratios would affect  its premium.", "Officials we interviewed from all three of the large banks said that the  level and range of premiums for top-rated institutions generally was too  high, given the actual risk they believe their institutions pose to the  insurance fund. Officials from one large bank and one trade association  we spoke with said that the best-rated banks and thrifts should pay no  premiums, or that the base rate range of premiums should be reduced  from 2 to 4 to 1 to 3 basis points. An additional nine organizations  supported similar changes in their comment letters. Risk category I, the  top-rated premium category, accounts for the majority of total deposits,  meaning that even small changes in premium assessment rates could  produce a significant difference in revenue to the insurance fund, and  hence assessments to the industry. FDIC officials said that the 2 to 4 basis  point spread is more likely to satisfy the insurance fund\u2019s long-term  revenue needs than a 1 to 3 basis point spread. FDIC officials also said that  FDIC could, based on authority in the final rule, reduce rates below the  current base rate \u201cfloor\u201d of 2 to 4 basis points if the agency determined  that such a reduction was warranted.", "Further, one bank official we spoke to said that the new system was  incorrectly based in the idea of institutions failing, rather than on the more  nuanced notion of actual losses expected to be suffered by the deposit  insurance fund if failures occurred. As a result, he said, FDIC failed to give  appropriate credit to how large banks handle risk. Three organizations  that submitted comments on FDIC\u2019s new system supported this notion,  saying that FDIC should not assess premiums on all domestic deposits  because losses suffered by uninsured depositors should impose no burden  on the insurance fund\u2014the magnitude of any loss would be lessened to  the extent that depositors in foreign branches, other uninsured depositors,  general creditors, and holders of subordinated debt absorbed such losses.  FDIC officials, citing research the agency has done on failures and losses,  said that the differences in rates and categories were empirically based,  and thus adequately reflected all institutions\u2019 risk. Further, FDIC officials  said that loss severity is one of the many factors the agency is permitted to  consider as part of its assessment of the risk of large institutions.", "Officials from the two small banks, one large bank, and both industry  trade groups and the academics with whom we spoke questioned FDIC\u2019s  choice on initial placement of institutions into risk categories. Because  most institutions are now healthy, FDIC placed them into the best-rated  premium category, risk category I, for which base rate premium charges  range from 2 to 4 basis points. Within this top-rated category, FDIC  initially assigned approximately 45 percent of institutions to receive the  minimum rate of 2 basis points, and 5 percent of institutions to receive the  highest rate of 4 basis points. The remainder fell in the middle of the range.  These officials and academics generally agreed that FDIC should establish  risk criteria, and then assign institutions to appropriate groups based on  those criteria, rather than start with a predetermined distribution in mind.  Three additional organizations expressed similar concerns in comment  letters to FDIC. Further, officials from the other two large banks with  whom we spoke said that given the economic good times and institutional  good health, the 45 percent of institutions with the lowest rate was too  small a grouping and, as a result, healthy institutions arbitrarily would be  bumped into higher premiums. FDIC officials said that based on the  agency\u2019s experience, a range of 40 to 50 percent appeared to be a natural  breaking point in the distribution of institutions by risk, and that over  time, the percentage of institutions assigned the lowest premium in the  top-rated category may vary.", "Some also thought the new system had the potential to create tension or  discourage cooperative relations between bank management and federal  examiners. Under the old system, there was no difference in premiums for  well-capitalized, 1-rated institutions and well-capitalized 2-rated  institutions. However, under the new system, such a difference could lead  to higher premiums because CAMELS ratings are factored into premium  calculations. As a result, according to officials we interviewed from one  trade group, management might be less willing to discuss with examiners  issues or problems that could prompt a lower rating, although raising and  resolving such problems ultimately might be good for both the institution  and the insurance fund. FDIC officials acknowledged the concern, and  said that FDIC and the other federal regulators plan to monitor the new  system for adverse effects. However, they said that it was important to  include CAMELS ratings in the assessment of risk because the ratings  provide valuable information about institutions\u2019 financial and operational  health.", "Finally, officials from one trade association and one of the large banks  with whom we spoke also expressed concern that regional or smaller  institutions could be disadvantaged under the new system. Officials from  two credit rating agencies echoed this view, saying that larger, more  diverse institutions (by virtue of factors such as revenue, geography, or  range of activities) typically have steadier income, which increases  security and decreases risk. In contrast, regional or smaller institutions  can have geographic or line-of-business concentrations in their lending  portfolios that could hurt supervisory or credit ratings, leading to higher  deposit insurance premiums. FDIC said that while size or geography could  affect an institution\u2019s risk profile, management could offset that risk by  maintaining superior earnings or capital reserves, requiring higher  collateral requirements on loans, or using hedging vehicles.", "FDIC officials told us that the agency plans to monitor the new deposit  insurance system to ensure its proper functioning and the fair treatment of  the institutions that pay premiums into the deposit insurance fund. For  example, in addition to assessing whether the new system creates friction  between examiners and bank and thrift management, as discussed above,  FDIC officials also said that the agency will, among other things, assess  over time whether the percentage of institutions paying the lowest rate in  risk category I\u2014those receiving the best premium rate\u2014should be  increased and whether different financial ratios should be considered in  the calculation of premiums."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided FDIC, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS with a draft of this  report for their review and comment.

Our review focused on FDIC, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift  Supervision (OTS) and was limited to depository institutions.", "To describe trends in the financial condition of banks and thrifts, we  summarized financial data (including total assets, net income, returns on  assets, returns on equity, the number of problem institutions, and the  number of bank and thrift failures) from 1992, the year FDICIA was  implemented, through 2005. We obtained this information from FDIC  Quarterly Banking Reports, which publish industry statistics derived from  Reports on Condition and Income (Call Report) and Thrift Financial  Reports. All banks and thrifts must file Call Reports and Thrift Financial  Reports, respectively, with FDIC every quarter. We also analyzed Call and  Thrift Financial Report data for 1992 through 2005 that FDIC provided to  determine (1) the number of well-capitalized, adequately capitalized,  undercapitalized, significantly capitalized, and critically undercapitalized  depository institutions from 1992 through 2005 and (2) the amount of  capital well-capitalized banks and thrifts carried in excess of the well- capitalized leverage capital minimum for each year from 1992 through  2005. We chose to use Call and Thrift Financial Report data because the  data are designed to provide information on all federally insured  depository institutions\u2019 financial condition, and FDIC collects and reports  the data in a standardized format. We have tested the reliability of FDIC\u2019s  Call and Thrift Financial Report databases as part of previous studies and  found the data to be reliable. In addition, we performed various electronic  tests of the specific data extraction we obtained from FDIC and  interviewed FDIC officials responsible for providing the data to us. Based  on the results of these tests and the information we obtained from FDIC  officials, we found these data to be sufficiently reliable for purposes of this  report.", "To describe federal regulators\u2019 oversight of banks and thrifts since the  passage of FDICIA, we reviewed the provisions of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act (FDIA) requiring regulators to conduct annual, on-site, full- scope examinations of depository institutions as well as several GAO and  industry reports discussing the federal regulators\u2019 oversight of depository  institutions prior to the failures of the 1980s and early 1990s and after the  enactment of FDICIA, including their use of PCA to address capital  deficiencies. We also obtained data from each of the four federal  regulators on the interval between examinations for each year, from 1992  through 2005. We interviewed officials from FDIC, the Federal Reserve,  OCC, and OTS to assess the reliability of these data. Based on their  responses to our questions, we determined these data to be reliable for  purposes of this report.", "To determine how federal regulators used PCA to address capital  adequacy issues at the institutions they regulate, we reviewed section 38 of  FDIA, related regulations, regulators\u2019 policies and procedures, and past  GAO reports on PCA to determine the actions regulators are required to  take when institutions fail to meet minimum capital requirements. We  then analyzed Call and Thrift Financial Report data to identify all banks  and thrifts that were undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or  critically undercapitalized (the three lowest PCA capital categories) during  at least one quarter from 2001 through 2005. We chose this period for  review based on the availability of examination- and enforcement-related  documents and to reflect the regulators\u2019 most current policies and  procedures. From the 157 institutions we identified as being  undercapitalized or lower from 2001 to 2005, we selected a nonprobablity  sample of 24 institutions, reflecting a mix of institutions supervised by  each of the four regulators and institutions in each of the three lowest PCA  capital categories. We reviewed their reports of examination, informal and  formal enforcement actions, and institution-regulator correspondence for  a period covering four quarters prior to and four quarters following the  first and last quarters in which each institution failed to meet minimum  capital requirements to determine how regulators used PCA to address  their capital deficiencies. As discussed above, we have tested the  reliability of Call and Thrift Financial Report data and found the data to be  reliable. To supplement our sample, we also reviewed material loss  reviews from 14 banks and thrifts that failed with material losses from  1992 through 2005 and in which regulators used PCA to address capital  deficiencies. Because of the limited nature of our sample, we were unable  to generalize our findings to all institutions that were or should have been  subject to PCA since 1992.", "To determine the extent to which federal regulators have used the  noncapital supervisory actions of sections 38 and 39 of FDIA to address  weaknesses at the institutions they regulate, we reviewed regulators\u2019  policies and procedures related to sections 38(f)(2)(F) and 38(g)\u2014the  provisions for dismissal of officers and directors and reclassification of a  capital category, respectively\u2014and section 39, which gives regulators  authority to address safety and soundness deficiencies. We analyzed  regulator data on the number of times and for what purposes the  regulators used these noncapital authorities. To provide context on the  extent of regulators\u2019 use of these noncapital provisions, we also obtained  data on the number of times regulators used their authority under section  8(e) of FDIA to remove officers and directors from office and section 8(b)  of FDIA to enforce compliance with safety and soundness standards.  Based on regulators\u2019 responses to our questions related to these data, we  determined the data to be reliable for purposes of this report.", "Finally, to describe how changes in FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance system affect  the determination of institutions\u2019 risk and insurance premiums, we  reviewed FDIC\u2019s notice of proposed rule making on deposit insurance  assessments, selected comments to the proposed rule, and FDIC\u2019s final  rule on deposit insurance assessments. We also interviewed  representatives of three large institutions, two small institutions, and two  trade groups representing large and small institutions and two academics  to obtain their views on the impact of FDIC\u2019s changes to the system. We  selected the large institutions based on geographic location and size and  the small institutions based on input from the Independent Community  Bankers Association on which of its member organizations were familiar  with FDIC\u2019s proposed changes to the deposit insurance system. We also  interviewed officials from two credit rating agencies on the factors\u2014 financial, management, and operational\u2014they consider when rating  institutions\u2019 debt offerings.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., and Chicago from March  2006 through January 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kay Kuhlman, Assistant Director;  Gloria Hernandez-Saunders; Wil Holloway; Tiffani Humble; Bettye  Massenburg; Marc Molino; Carl Ramirez; Omyra Ramsingh; Barbara  Roesmann; Cory Roman; and Christopher Schmitt made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
