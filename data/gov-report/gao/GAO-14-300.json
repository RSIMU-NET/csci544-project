To help meet the changing medical needs of the  veteran population, including a greater need for outpatient services, VA  has increasingly leased the facilities from which it provides its health care  services. According to VA, leasing medical facilities rather than owning  them allows VA to provide more veterans with accessible health-care  services and gives VA the flexibility to respond to changing service  demands, demographic shifts, and improvements in medical technology.  Depending on the facility\u2019s size and scope of services, VA outpatient  clinics can provide primary care; dental care; pharmacy, laboratory, and  radiology services; nutritional medicine; women\u2019s health care; mental  health and suicide prevention services; and other types of specialty care.", "VA is required to submit a prospectus to Congress for all major medical- facility leases and construction projects.

As of fiscal year 2013, VA had 1,889 leases, of which 1,192  were medical outpatient clinics and other medical facilities, varying in size  and cost. Leased medical space generally consists of outpatient clinics,  mental health clinics, readjustment-counseling centers, research, and  other types of clinical leases. Non-medical space generally consists of  administrative, warehouse, data center, parking, and regional office  leases. According to VA, much of the non-medical space is integral to  providing medical services in other locations. See table 1 for the numbers  of VA leased properties from fiscal years 2004 through 2013.", "VA has recognized the need to modernize its facilities and realign its real  property portfolio to provide accessible, high-quality, and cost-effective  services. However, much of VHA\u2019s infrastructure was designed and built  decades ago when there was a greater focus on hospital-centered,  inpatient care. VA officials recognize that VHA\u2019s infrastructure does not  fully align with the health care needs of the current veteran population  and that VHA faces challenges in updating its infrastructure, such as: providing medical services for returning veterans from Afghanistan  and Iraq, who increasingly require specialized care for injuries such as  the treatment of spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries;  keeping pace with advancements in health care services and  technologies that often dramatically change the physical infrastructure  requirements of hospitals and clinics; and addressing changes in veteran demographics, including the differing  treatments and care required for veterans of different generations and  the shifts in veteran populations among different areas of the country  that place continued demands on the capital-asset portfolio.", "To plan for future infrastructure needs, VA established its Strategic  Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process for its fiscal year 2012  budget submission to Congress. As part of this planning effort, VA  annually reviews its real property priorities and conducts a gap analysis to  identify its need for medical facilities. The SCIP process includes major  construction projects and leasing projects. Local plans are centrally  validated, evaluated, and consolidated into a prioritized national project  list. VA also uses this planning process to develop a 10-year long-range  plan, which prioritizes a list of projects targeted to reduce service gaps. submit a prospectus to Congress for all major medical facility leases.

We found that 39 of the 41  congressionally authorized outpatient clinic projects we reviewed  experienced schedule delays, ranging from 6 months to 13.3 years, with  an average delay of 3.3 years, while 2 projects experienced schedule  time decreases. Our data analysis showed that 94 percent of these  delays occurred prior to entering into the lease agreement. For all but one  of the projects that experienced a delay, the delay occurred during the  pre-lease agreement stage. We also compared the length of delays that  occurred during the pre-lease agreement stage to the length of delays  that occurred once a lease agreement was entered into with the  development firm. We found that the average delay during the pre-lease  agreement stages for all 41 projects totaled nearly 3.1 years.Conversely, the average project delay once a lease agreement was  finalized totaled approximately 2.5 months, and 11 outpatient clinic  projects actually experienced schedule decreases during this stage. VA  officials at 6 of our 11 outpatient clinic projects selected for detailed  review mentioned that the large majority of schedule delays occur during  the period prior to entering into a lease agreement. See figure 1 for an  overview of schedule changes experienced by the 41 outpatient clinic  projects we reviewed during the pre-lease agreement stage. (See app. II  for schedule information for individual clinic projects.)", "For the 41 lease projects we reviewed, we found that several factors  contributed to delays:  VHA\u2019s Late or Changing Requirements. According to data we analyzed  and VA officials we interviewed, late or changing requirements were the  most common reasons for delays. Requirements can pertain to facility  size, types of treatment rooms, types of medical equipment, electrical  voltage needs, and other details. We found that in many instances, CFM  either did not receive VHA\u2019s requirements on time, or VHA changed its  requirements during the solicitation of offers, necessitating a re-design  that affected the schedule. In evaluating VA data, we found that 23 of the  41 leasing projects (56 percent) experienced delays because VHA was  late in submitting space requirements to CFM, or VHA changed space  requirements and thus the scope of the project. For example, the size of  the Jacksonville outpatient clinic had increased by 29 percent, and the  Austin outpatient clinic site we visited had increased by 36 percent from  the time the prospectuses for these projects were submitted to Congress.  Furthermore, officials at the Austin outpatient clinic said delays or  changes to VHA\u2019s requirements necessitated the project\u2019s re-design,  which, in turn, caused a delay of 19 months. Specifically, the initial  authorization request for the Austin project was for 85,000 square feet  and 400 parking spaces. VHA revised the space plan to 135,322 square  feet to accommodate projected increases in patient visits, and  subsequently approved a second revised space plan of 185,822 square  feet and 1,200 parking spaces. VA did notify Congress of its intent to  increase the size of clinic by more than 10 percent. The completed  solicitation for offers was not finalized until July 2009, though several  amendments were issued in October 2009 due to revised specifications.  Consequently, VA had to extend the due date for the offers to provide  bids.", "Site Selection Challenges. In analyzing VA data, we found that 20 of the  41 outpatient clinic projects we reviewed (49 percent) experienced delays  due to difficulties in locating or securing a suitable site. For example, an  increase in scope to the Jacksonville project resulted in a larger building  design that then required more land. To accommodate these changes,  the landowner worked to acquire additional properties around the already  selected site. Although the developer was ultimately successful in  obtaining additional land for the project, this process led to delays.  According to VA officials, prior to entering into the lease agreement, there  were delays associated with difficult negotiations with the developer. In  addition, there were significant environmental clean-up requirements at  the site, which needed to occur before construction began. The original  site\u2019s location was obtained in December 2002, but the larger site was not  obtained until December 2009, a delay of 7 years. VA officials said that  without these negotiations, it is likely that the project would have been  significantly more expensive. Site selection challenges were also noted  by VA officials in Las Vegas. According to those officials, the site VA  selected for a new outpatient clinic was located under the Nellis Air Force  Base fly-over space, and VA discovered contamination issues on the  property. These problems forced VA to alter the location of the outpatient  clinic on the property, contributing to delays.", "Outdated Guidance. We found that outdated policy and guidelines  resulted in challenges for VA staff in completing leasing projects on time  at the sites we reviewed. For example, officials from the four Las Vegas  outpatient sites we visited stated that VA\u2019s policies for managing leases  seem to change for each project, creating uncertainty regarding CFM job  responsibilities. An official from the Ft. Wayne outpatient clinic also stated  that VA\u2019s leasing process is confusing and seems to frequently change. A  contracting official from one of the Las Vegas clinics said she had to call  various VA headquarters officials while involved in the planning phase to  obtain the latest management procedures, because some of VA\u2019s  guidance had not been updated since 1998. VA is now drafting its leasing  Handbook Guidance 7815, which VA officials said they plan to finalize by  the end of fiscal year 2014. As we will discuss in more detail later in the  report, this handbook covers the authorities, roles and responsibilities,  policies, procedures, administration, and management of VA\u2019s real  property leasing program.", "In commenting on our draft, VA noted that many lease delays resulted  from external influences to VA\u2019s leasing process and out of VA\u2019s control.  VA also noted that other factors could cause delays including site  selection issues involving the National Environmental Policy Act  requirements, stakeholder concerns, procurement and lessor issues,  solicitation/award protects, and post-award contracting issues.  Furthermore, these comments stated that some projects required updates  to space requirements to accommodate improved delivery of care for  veterans. VA noted that as delays to a lease occur, VHA re-evaluates and  updates the design and space program to ensure the contemplated lease  project will meet VA\u2019s latest requirements and optimally serve veterans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Project Cost Increases", "paragraphs": ["In addition to substantial delays, VA also experienced cost increases to  its outpatient clinic projects when compared to the costs in the projects\u2019  prospectuses. VA provided cost data for its outpatient clinic lease projects  in January 2014. Table 3 includes a description of the key cost data  elements we reviewed.", "When compared to the prospectus costs for the 31 projects with complete  cost data,million to $172.2 million, an increase of nearly $19 million (12 percent).  For the 31 projects, the total prospectus\u2019 first year rent was estimated at  $58.2 million, but the total awarded first-year rent for these projects  equaled $92.7 million as of January 2014, an increase of $34.5 million (59  percent). Such increases in rent have long term implications for VA,  because the Department must pay the higher rent over the lifetime of the  lease agreement. For example, all 31 VA lease projects included in this  cost analysis have lease terms of 20 years, and the increase in rent must  be paid for the duration of the contract.   we found that total first-year costs increased from $153.4  The causes of the total cost increase can be attributed primarily to  increases in the projects\u2019 awarded first-year rent due to the schedule  delays and changes to the design or scope of a project that we discussed  previously. Schedule delays can increase costs because of changes in  the local leasing market during the period of the delay. Therefore, when  VA estimates costs as part of the prospectuses submitted to Congress in  the annual budget request, an automatic annual escalation is applied to  each project to account for rising costs and market forces that make  construction and leased space more expensive over time. VA officials  said the escalation ensures that the authorized cost of the project is in  line with the realities of the real estate and construction markets. As  discussed earlier, the average schedule delay for the 41 outpatient clinics  we reviewed was approximately 3.3-years per project. Because VA  annually adjusts a project\u2019s cost by an increase of 4 percent for each year  the project is delayed, project delays directly result in cost increases.  Additionally, we found that projects we reviewed increased in total size by  203,000 square feet. Changes in a project\u2019s size expand the scope of the  project, requiring design changes, which can result in schedule delays,  further adding to costs. More specifically, the VA outpatient clinic in  Austin, Texas, discussed above, increased in size by 36 percent and first  year rent and build-out costs increased from $6.2 million to $19.8 million,  a total increase of $13.6 million, or 219 percent.", "Although first year rents increased for the 31 projects\u2014increasing overall  total costs\u2014VA\u2019s total build-out costs were lower than reported in the  projects\u2019 prospectuses. As described in table 3, build-out costs are one- time, lump-sum payments VA makes to developers for special purpose,  medically related improvements to buildings when VA accepts the  projects as completed. For example, once a building is constructed to  provide standard office space, changes to transform the building to a  medical clinic, such as providing a nurses\u2019 station, would be considered a  build-out cost. In the prospectuses, VA estimated that build-out costs for  the 31 projects would total $95.2 million, but the total awarded build-out  costs totaled $79.5 million as of January 2014, a decrease of $15.7  million (16.5 percent). VA officials said the decrease in build-out costs  from those originally estimated in the prospectuses was due to the  national downturn in the commercial real estate market starting in 2008.  According to VA officials, this created more competition among  developers and helped VA realize more competitive pricing on its medical  build-out requirements than was anticipated in the prospectuses.

The Handbook is intended to establish consistent planning criteria  and standardized expectations. The handbook is widely used by VA  officials and provides important guidance, in particular, clarifying the  differing responsibilities of officials and departments and the legal  authorities of the leasing process. However, this guidance is so out of  date that it no longer adequately reflects the roles and responsibilities of  the various VA organizations involved in major medical facilities leasing  projects.

The lack of updated  guidance can affect coordination among stakeholders, which could  contribute to schedule delays and cost increases. Using outdated  guidance can lead to miscommunications and errors in the planning and  implementing of veterans\u2019 leased clinics. Furthermore, the policy,  planning criteria, and business plan format were developed based on an  old planning methodology that VA no longer uses, thus the guidance  does not reflect VA\u2019s current process.", "As of November 2013, VHA\u2019s leasing program has a long-term liability of  $5.5 billion and growing, but its guidance on outpatient clinics is a decade  old and no longer relevant. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government calls for federal agencies to develop and maintain internal  control activities, which include policies and procedures, to enforce  management\u2019s directives and help ensure that actions are taken to  address risks.

In looking closer at the leasing program, we found that VA  is taking steps toward improving its management of the program; steps  that may help address these issues. Most notably, VA\u2019s Construction  Review Council should improve management of both the construction and  leasing program. Furthermore, the improvements VA is planning based  on the findings of the council and our work\u20141) requiring more detailed  design requirements, 2) improving the process for handling scope  changes, and 3) providing Congress with more complete information\u2014 represent a good start. However, these efforts are still in the early stages,  and some were undertaken during the course of our review. Thus, the  success of those efforts will depend on how quickly and effectively VA  implements them. Furthermore, the guidance used by all staff involved in  planning and implementing leasing projects is outdated and does not  reflect recent organizational changes affecting the way leasing projects  are managed. Without current guidance, stakeholders may have difficulty  knowing with whom to coordinate, and projects could continue to  experience delays and cost increases resulting from late-stage design  changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management of VA\u2019s leased outpatient-clinic projects, we  recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs update VHA\u2019s guidance  for leasing outpatient clinics to better reflect the roles and responsibilities  of all VA staff involved in leasing projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment. In its  written comments, VA concurred with our recommendation and discussed  actions under way to implement it. However, VA cited concerns that the  report did not fully reflect the reasons for lease delays. VA noted that  many lease delays resulted from influences external to VA\u2019s leasing  process and out of VA\u2019s control. For example, other factors that could  cause delays include site selection issues involving the National  Environmental Policy Act\u2019s requirements, stakeholders\u2019 concerns,  procurement and lessor issues, solicitation/award protects, and post- award contracting issues. Furthermore, these comments stated that some  projects required updates to the space requirements to accommodate  improved delivery of care for veterans. VA also noted that as delays to a  lease occur, VHA re-evaluates and updates the design and space  program to ensure the contemplated lease project will meet VA\u2019s latest  requirements and optimally serve veterans. We added this information in  the section of the report that discussed contributing factors to delays at  VA projects.
