For example, the Niobrara Valley Preserve can spend money to fulfill The Nature Conservancy\u2019s biological diversity goal only when it raises money. In addition, the Conservancy requires all of its preserves to strive for financial self-sufficiency and allows them to retain most of the revenue that they generate.

In addition, the agency had reduced staffing from about 46,000 permanent positions in fiscal year 1992 to about 39,400 in fiscal year 1996, or by about 14 percent. However, generating revenue and reducing costs are not mission priorities for the agency, and managers lack both flexibility to make choices and accountability for results.", "The low priority assigned to increasing revenue and decreasing costs results, in part, from the importance or emphasis given to ecological, social, and other values and concerns. Statutory language implies that maximizing revenue should not be the overriding criterion in managing the national forests. Requirements in environmental and planning laws and their judicial interpretations have increasingly required the Forest Service to shift its emphasis from uses that generate revenue to those that do not. In recent years, legislative and administrative decisions have set aside or withdrawn an increasing percentage of Forest Service lands for conservation and, in keeping with the existing legislative framework, the Forest Service is moving away from, rather than toward, financial self-sufficiency. The agency is required to continue providing certain goods and services at less than their fair market value. Finally, certain congressional expectations and revenue-sharing provisions serve as disincentives to either increasing revenue or decreasing costs.", "When the Congress has provided the Forest Service with the authority to obtain fair market value for goods or recover costs for services, the agency often has not done so. The Forest Service also has not always acted to contain costs, even when requested to do so by the Congress. Underlying these shortcomings is the failure to hold the agency adequately accountable for its performance for increasing revenue or decreasing costs.

When proposing a project, such as a timber sale, the Forest Service bears the burden of demonstrating that its actions will not be likely to jeopardize listed species. Other laws enacted primarily during the 1960s and 1970s\u2014such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the National Forest Management Act\u2014and their judicial interpretations and implementing regulations also establish minimum requirements for these components of natural systems.", "In response to these requirements, the Forest Service has, during the last 10 years, increasingly shifted the emphasis under its broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate from revenue-generating uses (primarily producing timber) to uses that do not generate revenue (primarily sustaining wildlife and fish and their habitats). For example, in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California, federal lands, managed primarily by the Forest Service, represent almost half (47.8 percent) of the total lands suitable for commercial timber harvesting. In western Washington State, western Oregon, and northern California, 24.5 million acres of federal land were available for commercial timber harvesting. However, about 7.6 million acres, or 31 percent of the available acreage, have been set aside or withdrawn as habitat for species that live in old-growth forests, including the threatened northern spotted owl, or as riparian reserves to protect watersheds. To protect the forests\u2019 health, only limited timber harvesting and salvage timber sales are allowed in some of these areas. In addition, requirements for maintaining biological diversity under the National Forest Management Act\u2014as well as for meeting standards for air and water quality under the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, respectively\u2014may limit the timing, location, and amount of harvesting that can occur. Moreover, harvests from these lands could be further reduced by plans to protect threatened and endangered salmon.", "Requirements in environmental and planning laws have also necessitated the use of more costly and time-consuming timber-harvesting methods.For example, in June 1992, the Forest Service announced plans to reduce the amount of timber harvested by clear-cutting by as much as 70 percent from fiscal year 1988 levels in order to manage the national forests in a more environmentally sensitive manner. This policy change has increased the timber program\u2019s costs, since clear-cutting is a relatively economical method of harvesting. However, according to the Forest Service, these increased costs may be offset to some unknown degree by reductions in the number of administrative and legal challenges to individual timber sales.", "The Forest Service\u2019s ability to generate revenue is not static and changes on the basis of new information and events, such as the listing of a species as endangered or threatened; the results of analyses, monitoring, and evaluation; and new judicial interpretations. For example, the Forest Service is required by the National Environmental Policy Act to assess activities occurring outside the national forests in deciding which uses to emphasize on its lands. A January 1997 habitat conservation plan between Washington State\u2019s Department of Natural Resources and two federal regulatory agencies and similar agreements\u2014which now cover 18 million acres of state and private land\u2014require that any additional mitigation deemed necessary to protect listed species covered by the plans first be accomplished on federal lands. Therefore, while these agreements are expected to reduce costs and to provide more regulatory certainty and predictability on nonfederal lands, they may increase costs and regulatory uncertainty on Forest Service lands.

Among the factors contributing to this low rate of return is that the agency is prohibited by law from charging fees for the use of most recreational sites and areas that it manages directly. In addition, the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-333) included a new fee system for ski areas that was developed by the ski industry.

For example, in a June 1997 report, we compared the operations of a state forest (the Bladen Lakes) and two national forests (the Nantahala and Pisgah) in North Carolina. The state forest generated enough revenue to make it almost financially self-sufficient, while the two national forests generated enough to cover only about 4 percent of their operating costs.

Under the act\u2019s provisions, the federal government receives no financial compensation for hardrock minerals, such as gold and silver, extracted from Forest Service and other federal lands. In 1990, hardrock minerals worth at least $1.2 billion were extracted from federal lands, while known, economically recoverable reserves of hardrock minerals remaining on federal lands were valued at $64.9 billion. In contrast, the 11 western states that lease state-owned lands for mining purposes impose a royalty on minerals extracted from those lands. The 104th Congress considered, but did not enact, several bills that would have imposed royalties on hardrock minerals extracted from federal lands. A bill to impose royalties on hardrock minerals extracted from federal lands has also been introduced in the 105th Congress.

Thus, neither the agency nor the states and counties have an incentive to control costs.", "For example, from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1994, the Forest Service spent about $1.3 billion to prepare and administer timber sales. During that period, the agency collected nearly $3 billion in timber sales receipts. Instead of being required to return the money it spent to the Treasury, the Forest Service was allowed to retain about $1.7 billion, or 57 percent, in various funds and accounts for specific purposes, such as the reforestation of harvested areas, preparation and administration of salvage timber sales, removal of brush, control of erosion, and building of roads that provide access to the timber sales areas, as provided for by law. Another $887 million, or 30 percent, was distributed to the states in which the forests are located. The funds can be used by the states to benefit roads and schools in the counties where the receipts were earned. The remaining $437 million was deposited in, or transferred to, the General Fund of the Treasury.

Fees for such activities are the second largest generator of revenue for the agency, after timber sales. The Forest Service\u2019s fee system, which sets fees for most commercial uses other than ski operations, had not been updated for nearly 30 years and generally limited fees to less than 3 percent of a permittee\u2019s gross revenue.

On the basis of information provided by the agency, we estimated that in 1994 the costs to review and process special-use permits were about $13 million.

As of October 1996, the agency had pending claims with potential damages of about $61 million, and it could incur at least an additional $198 million in damages.

Since the late 1980s, the Forest Service had been developing new regulations and a new timber sales contract that would limit the government\u2019s liability on canceled timber sales contracts and redistribute the risk between the agency and the purchaser. However, the Forest Service had not finalized either the regulations or the contract, and agency officials believe that additional congressional appropriations may be required to help pay for pending and future claims.", "Similarly, the Forest Service could incur significant costs because the Eldorado National Forest in northern California failed to comply with the requirements of planning and environmental laws. Forest officials decided to proceed with a number of timber sales on the basis of cursory, out-of-date environmental assessments that did not adequately analyze the sales\u2019 potential effects on fish, wildlife, plants, cultural resources, and water quality and did not consider significant new information, as required under regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. The contracts that were awarded have since been suspended. As a result, the Forest Service could incur $30 million in potential damages.", "Concerned with the escalating costs of the Forest Service\u2019s timber program, the Congress, in fiscal year 1991, asked the agency to develop a multiyear program to reduce the costs of its timber program by not less than 5 percent per year.

Underlying these shortcomings is the failure to hold the agency adequately accountable for its performance for increasing revenue or decreasing costs.
