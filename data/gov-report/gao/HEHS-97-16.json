These plans typically have a financial incentive to hold down costs; in fact, Medicare\u2019s method for paying risk contract health maintenance organizations (HMO)\u2014Medicare\u2019s principal managed care option\u2014was designed to save the program 5 percent of the costs for beneficiaries who enroll in HMOs. However, a decade of research has found that enrolled beneficiaries would have cost the program less if they had stayed in the fee-for-service (FFS) sector. The research shows that Medicare\u2019s rate-setting method produces excess payments to HMOs because it overstates the costs of HMO enrollees.

We also developed a method for estimating enrollees\u2019 costs using the data Medicare collects to determine HMO payments and applied the method to each of the 58 counties in California, a state that has about 36 percent of the total Medicare risk HMO population.

Medicare law stipulates that the capitation rate be set at 95 percent of the costs Medicare would have incurred for HMO enrollees if they had remained in FFS. In implementing the law\u2019s rate-setting provisions, HCFA estimates a county\u2019s average per-beneficiary cost and multiplies the result by 0.95.The product is the county adjusted average per capita cost rate.", "HCFA then applies a risk-adjustment factor to the county rate. Under HCFA\u2019s risk-adjustment system, beneficiaries are sorted into groups according to their demographic traits (age; sex; and Medicaid, institutional, and working status). These traits serve as proxy measures of health status. HCFA calculates a risk factor for each group\u2014the group\u2019s average cost in relation to the cost of all beneficiaries nationwide. For example, in 1995 the risk factor for younger seniors (65- to 70-year-old males) was .85, whereas for older seniors (85-year-old or older males) it was 1.3.

Much has been written about the inadequacy of Medicare\u2019s risk adjuster to account for the tendency of HMOs to experience favorable selection. More than a decade of research has concluded that beneficiaries enrolling in HMOs are, on average, healthier than those remaining in FFS.Studies of pre-1990 data found that Medicare HMO enrollees\u2014in a period just prior to their HMO enrollment\u2014had health care costs that were from 20 percent to 42 percent lower than those of FFS beneficiaries with the same demographic characteristics. Studies of post-1990 data also showed costs of Medicare HMO enrollees ranging from 12 percent to 37 percent lower than those of their FFS counterparts.", "The problem for Medicare posed by favorable selection is that HMO enrollees are healthier than FFS beneficiaries within the same demographic group; for example, 70-year-old males in HMOs are, on average, healthier than 70-year-old males in FFS. Medicare\u2019s risk adjuster is said to be inadequate because, while making broad distinctions among beneficiaries of different age, sex, and other demographic characteristics, it does not account for the significant health differences among demographically identical beneficiaries. The cost implications of health status differences can be dramatic for two demographically alike beneficiaries: one may experience occasional minor ailments while the other may suffer from a serious chronic condition.", "Devising a risk adjuster sensitive enough to capture health status differences, however, is such a technically complex and difficult task that years of independent research and HCFA-sponsored research have not yet produced an ideal risk adjuster. In reports issued in 1994 and 1995, we identified several promising, practical risk adjusters and suggested that HCFA implement an interim improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA Could Improve Its Rate-Setting Method by Including HMO Enrollees in Its Calculations of County Average Cost", "paragraphs": ["Independent of risk adjustment, modifying the method for calculating county rate would help reduce Medicare\u2019s excess HMO payments. HCFA currently estimates the average Medicare costs of a county\u2019s beneficiaries using the costs of only those beneficiaries in Medicare\u2019s FFS sector. This method would be appropriate if the average health cost of FFS beneficiaries were the same as that of demographically comparable HMO enrollees. However, in counties where there are cost disparities between Medicare\u2019s FFS and HMO enrollee populations, this method can either overstate the average costs of all Medicare beneficiaries and lead to overpayment or understate average costs and lead to underpayment.", "Suppose a county has 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries with identical demographic characteristics. Of these, 800 beneficiaries are in Medicare\u2019s FFS program and cost Medicare on average $100 a month. The remaining 200 beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs, but these beneficiaries would have cost an average of $75 a month had they remained in the FFS program. For all 1,000 beneficiaries, the county average cost would be $95 a month. HCFA\u2019s method excludes the HMO enrollees with their lower costs from its calculations, producing a county average of $100 a month. Consequently, HCFA overestimates this county\u2019s average monthly cost by $5, producing $1,000 a month in excessive Medicare payments to HMOs (200 beneficiaries times $5).", "The difficulty in correcting this problem comes from the inability to observe the costs HMO enrollees would have incurred if they had remained in the FFS sector. In the illustration above, HCFA needs a way to estimate that the beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs would have cost $75 a month in the FFS sector rather than $100. Therefore, we developed a method to estimate HMO enrollees\u2019 expected FFS costs using information available to HCFA. Our method consists of two main steps:", "First, we computed the average costs of new HMO enrollees during the year before they enrolled\u2014that is, while they were still in FFS Medicare. These FFS costs are available through HCFA\u2019s claims data.", "Next, we adjusted this amount to reflect the expectation that an enrollee\u2019s use of health services will, over time, rise.", "Having completed these steps, we combined the result with an estimate of the average cost of FFS beneficiaries. This new average produced a county rate that reflected the costs of all Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, our method helps prevent biasing HMO payments with either overgenerous estimates of enrollees\u2019 initial health costs or low estimates that fail to compensate for the likelihood of rising health costs over time.

Specifically, for the counties that we analyzed, we estimated that total excess payments in 1995 amounted to about $1 billion of the roughly $6 billion in total Medicare payments to risk HMOs in the state. (App. III discusses excess payment estimates in further detail.) Applying our method for setting county rates would have reduced the excess by about $276 million.", "We also found that the excess payments attributable to inflated county rates were concentrated in 12 counties with large HMO enrollment and ranged from less than 1 percent to 6.6 percent of the counties\u2019 total HMO payments, representing between $200,000 and $135.3 million.

Nonetheless, HHS\u2019 example assumes excess payments and HMO penetration are inversely related (higher penetration rate, lower excess payments). Though some counties may display this pattern, the counties we examined do not.", "In discussing its example, HHS seemingly endorses the current method of paying Medicare HMOs as an interim strategy and, consequently, considers it appropriate to ignore the problem of large excess payments in counties like A, at least for several years. In contrast, our recommended modification of the current method would reduce excess payments significantly and promptly. While it is true that HMOs in B would be paid less than in A, correcting such discrepancies is the role of improved health status adjusters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommended Revision Could Be Readily Implemented", "paragraphs": ["HHS commented that our modification to the current payment method may be difficult to implement, citing both conceptual issues and resource requirements. For example, HHS suggested that \u201cthe issue of when to begin counting for the regression (toward the mean) effect is problematic\u201d because many beneficiaries switch plans or switch between managed care and FFS. To overcome this potential difficulty, HCFA could consider time spent in various HMOs with brief spells in FFS as continuous enrollment in managed care. If the beneficiary spent a significant length of time in FFS, HCFA could reset the regression effect for that beneficiary to zero. This approach would be conservative in that it would tend to increase the estimated FFS costs of HMO enrollees and thus yield rates favorable to HMOs.", "In addition, HHS expressed concern that \u201cif separate [RTM factor] estimates are required for each county the  burden could be very great.\u201d Separate estimates of RTM factors for each county are not needed. We estimated the RTM factor using statewide data, although we used HMO tenure levels at the county level in conjunction with the RTM factor to adjust county costs.", "HHS believes that implementing our refinement to the current method would require a significant amount of resources. Given the modest resources (two analysts) that we used in conducting our analysis, and that our proposed change would not entail collecting new data, we believe that the additional resources needed to implement our refinement would be small. Moreover, the likely benefits greatly outweigh such costs. As our report indicates, the payoff from this effort would probably be hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicare savings each year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommended Revision Is Fundamental to Fixing Excess Payment Problem", "paragraphs": ["HHS states that our payment method revision is an interim solution to the HMO overpayment problem. HHS also notes that HCFA is working to develop a new payment methodology incorporating health status adjusters that might be phased in starting in calendar year 2001. Together, these assertions could imply that our approach is unnecessary.", "Our revision, however, is not an interim solution. It is an important first step toward\u2014and most likely will be a component of\u2014a comprehensive solution. By addressing the effect of favorable selection in the county rate, our revision makes an essential adjustment to the rate on which the rest of an HMO\u2019s capitation payment is based. The revision could be implemented as early as calendar year 1998. This would allow the government, at the very least, 3 years to make partial reductions in excess HMO payments\u2014amounting to saving hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in each of those years. Moreover, our recommended correction of the county rate would complement improved health status adjusters to provide the foundation for a more efficient, accurate, and equitable redesign of Medicare\u2019s method of HMO payment."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["The following team members also made important contributions to this report: James Cosgrove, Assistant Director; Thomas Dowdal, Assistant Director; Craig Winslow, Senior Attorney; George M.
