States were attracted by the increased federal funding available under some of the options, but were concerned about their ability to contribute their share of funding. Limited staff resources and competing priorities were also concerns. Finally, broader Medicaid reform efforts, such as transitions to statewide managed care, and the potential interaction with existing HCBS options factored into states\u0092 considerations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CMS have initiatives under way to assist states with their HCBS efforts.

They may also have  difficulties with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), such as  preparing meals, housekeeping, using the telephone, and managing  money. Assistance for such needs takes many forms and takes place in  varied settings, including care provided in institutional settings, such as  nursing homes; services provided in community-based settings, such as  adult foster care; and in-home care. Home- and community-based  services (HCBS) cover a wide range of services and supports to help  individuals remain in their homes or live in a community setting, such as  personal care services to provide assistance with ADLs or IADLs,  assistive devices, respite care for care givers, and case management  services to coordinate services and supports that may be provided from  multiple sources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicaid Financing and Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["While a variety of sources are used to pay for LTSS, Medicaid is the  largest. States and the federal government share responsibility for  Medicaid costs. In general, state Medicaid spending for medical  assistance is matched by the federal government, at a rate that is based  in part on each state\u2019s per capita income according to a formula  established by law. The federal share of Medicaid expenditures, known  as the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), typically ranges  from 50 to 83 percent. Although Medicaid is jointly financed by the states  and the federal government, it is directly administered by the states, with  oversight from CMS, within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS).", "For the most part, individuals who qualify for and receive Medicaid  coverage of LTSS are age 65 or older, disabled, or blind. Such individuals  typically qualify for Medicaid coverage of LTSS on the basis of their  eligibility for the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, a  means-tested income assistance program that provides cash benefits to  individuals who meet certain disability criteria and have low levels of  income and assets. States may also require individuals to meet state- defined level-of-care criteria for Medicaid coverage of certain LTSS.

Under Medicaid, coverage of certain  institutional services is mandatory, while coverage of nearly all HCBS is  optional for states. Since the Medicaid program was first established in  1965, states have been required to cover nursing facility care for all  Medicaid beneficiaries age 21 and older. States may also offer other  types of institutional care under their Medicaid programs, including care  provided in intermediate-care facilities for individuals with intellectual  disabilities and care provided for individuals age 65 or older and certain  individuals under age 22 in institutions for mental diseases. Medicaid  initially provided limited coverage for care provided in community settings  or in the home, but numerous changes to federal Medicaid law since the  program\u2019s inception have expanded states\u2019 options for covering HCBS.  States have taken advantage of the new options, and since 1995,  Medicaid spending for HCBS has steadily increased by 1 to 3 percentage  points each year. In fiscal year 2009, total Medicaid expenditures for  LTSS were $127.1 billion. Of this amount, about $55.9 billion was for  HCBS, which was about 44 percent of all Medicaid LTSS spending that  year, up from 18 percent in 1995.", "States\u2019 ability to leverage federal Medicaid funding for the provision of  HCBS can help them achieve compliance with the Olmstead decision,  which outlined the scope and nature of states\u2019 obligations to provide  HCBS for individuals with disabilities; however, state spending on HCBS  as a percentage of total LTSS spending varies widely. States have  considerable flexibility in designing their Medicaid programs. Within broad  federal guidelines, each state establishes its own eligibility standards;  determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of covered services;  and sets provider payment rates. In 2009, state spending on HCBS as a  percentage of total LTSS spending ranged from 14.4 percent in  Mississippi to 83.2 percent in New Mexico. (See fig. 1.)", "States have covered HCBS through a wide and complex range of options  within Medicaid, including through state plan benefits and through  waivers. A state Medicaid plan defines how the state will operate its  Medicaid program, including which populations and services are covered.  States are required by federal Medicaid law to cover certain mandatory  benefits in their state Medicaid plan. For example, all states are required  to offer the Home Health benefit to all individuals entitled to nursing  facility coverage under the state\u2019s Medicaid plan. Services that may be  covered under this benefit include nursing, home health aides, medical  equipment, and therapeutic services. States may also elect to cover other  HCBS through optional benefits. For example, states have the option to  offer the Personal Care benefit, which covers assistance with ADLs and  IADLs, furnished either at home or in another location. According to a  recent study, 33 states and the District of Columbia offered the Personal  Care benefit in 2008. Changes a state wishes to make to its state  Medicaid plan, including adding an optional state plan benefit, must be  submitted to CMS for review and approval in the form of a proposed state  plan amendment. With certain exceptions, services provided through  state plan benefits (both mandatory and optional) must (1) be sufficient in  amount, duration, and scope to reasonably achieve their purposes; (2) be  comparable in availability among different groups of enrollees; (3) be  offered statewide; and (4) allow beneficiaries freedom of choice among  health care providers or managed care entities participating in Medicaid.", "States have also covered HCBS for Medicaid beneficiaries through  waivers. Waivers can allow states to provide services not otherwise  covered by Medicaid to designated populations who may or may not  otherwise be eligible for Medicaid services. If approved, a waiver may  allow a state to limit the availability of services geographically, target  services to specific populations or conditions, control the number of  individuals served, and cap overall expenditures\u2014actions that are  generally not otherwise allowed under the federal Medicaid law, but which  may enable states to control costs. States must submit their waiver  requests to CMS for approval. The 1915(c) waiver, authorized under  section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, is the primary means by which  states provide HCBS for Medicaid beneficiaries and accounts for the  large majority of state Medicaid HCBS expenditures. Under 1915(c)  waivers, states may cover a broad range of services to participants, as  long as these services are required to prevent institutionalization; thus to  be eligible, individuals must meet the state\u2019s level-of-care criteria for  institutional care. Included among the services that may be provided are  homemaker/home health aide, personal care, adult day health, and other  services as approved by the Secretary of HHS. States can have multiple  1915(c) waivers that target different populations, for example, one for  individuals with developmental disabilities and another for individuals with  physical disabilities.

For example, the revised 1915(i) state plan option  allows states to design benefit packages to meet the needs of particular  groups. In addition, three of the options have maintenance of effort or  eligibility requirements that require states to sustain or increase HCBS  expenditures or maintain existing eligibility standards, methodologies, or  procedures as a condition of receiving enhanced federal funding, which  should help to ensure that the options increase the availability of services.  These options also include evaluation components or data reporting  requirements that may help discern the extent to which the options have  increased the availability of HCBS for beneficiaries.

Community First Choice provides states  with a 6 percentage point increase in their FMAP for home- and  community-based attendant and other services provided to beneficiaries.

States must also cover voluntary training for individuals on how  to select, manage, and dismiss their personal attendants. Community  First Choice also allows states the flexibility of covering transition costs,  such as rent and utility deposits, and other expenditures that allow for  greater independence, such as nonmedical transportation services.", "Beyond personal care services, states  PPACA included several requirements for Community First Choice.  Structured as a state plan benefit, Community First Choice does not allow  states to set ceilings on the number of people who can receive services  and requires services to be offered statewide. Further, unlike other HCBS  options that states may use to cover personal care services, such as  1915(c) waivers and the 1915(i) state plan option, which allow states  significant flexibility to restrict the type of services available, Community  First Choice requires states to provide a specified set of HCBS. CMS  described Community First Choice as a \u201crobust\u201d service package. Also,  states offering Community First Choice must adhere to maintenance of  effort requirements. Specifically, for the first full fiscal year the option is  implemented, participating states must maintain or exceed the preceding  year\u2019s level of expenditures for personal care services. Additionally, data  reporting requirements included in the law may shed some light on the  extent to which states are covering additional individuals as a result of the  option. States that offer Community First Choice must report the number  of individuals who received services under the option the preceding fiscal  year and whether they had been previously served under the state plan or  waivers, such as the personal care benefit, 1915(c) waivers, and 1915(i)  state plan benefit. PPACA also requires the Secretary of HHS to conduct  an evaluation of Community First Choice to determine (1) the  effectiveness of the provision of services in allowing individuals to lead  independent lives, (2) the impact of the services on individuals\u2019 physical  and emotional health, and (3) the cost of services provided under the  option compared with the cost of institutional care.", "Balancing Incentive Program incentivizes certain states to rebalance their  LTSS systems toward home- and community-based care. The Balancing  Incentive Program offers a targeted increase in FMAP to states in which  less than 50 percent of LTSS expenditures are for HCBS and that  undertake certain structural reforms to their Medicaid programs to  increase access to HCBS. Under the program, states that spent under  25 percent of the LTSS expenditures on HCBS in fiscal year 2009 qualify  for a 5 percentage point increase in their FMAP for state HCBS  expenditures, and states that spent between 25 and 50 percent are   Participating states are  eligible for a 2 percentage point increase.required to make three structural changes to their LTSS programs to help  increase access to HCBS. They must establish (1) a \u201cno wrong door/  single-entry point system\u201d to enable consumers to access all long-term  services and supports; (2) conflict-free case management services in  which the persons responsible for assessing the need for services and  developing plans of care are not related to or financially responsible for  the individual, or are not a provider of services for the individual; and (3) a  standardized assessment instrument to determine eligibility for HCBS.  States receiving a 5 percentage point increase in FMAP must achieve a  rebalancing benchmark of 25 percent of total Medicaid LTSS  expenditures for HCBS by the program\u2019s end, September 30, 2015; and  similarly, states receiving a 2 percentage point increase in FMAP must  achieve a rebalancing benchmark of 50 percent by then. PPACA set a  limit of $3 billion in enhanced FMAP payments for the Balancing Incentive  Program; funds from enhanced FMAP must be used to provide new or  expanded offerings of HCBS. States participating in the Balancing  Incentive Program must meet maintenance of eligibility requirements that  prohibit the state from applying methodologies or procedures for  determining eligibility for HCBS that are more restrictive than the eligibility  methodologies or procedures in effect on December 31, 2010. In addition,  states must collect data on services, quality, and outcomes and inform  CMS on a quarterly basis how they are collecting these data. Outcome  measures to be collected include measures of beneficiary and family  caregiver experience with providers and satisfaction with services; and  measures for achieving desired outcomes appropriate to a specific  beneficiary, including employment, participation in community life, health  stability, and prevention of loss in function.", "PPACA revisions to 1915(i) state plan option provide increased flexibility  to offer new services to targeted populations. While several features of  the 1915(i) state plan option remain the same\u2014including its availability to  individuals not needing an institutional level of care and its lack of an  enhanced matching rate\u2014PPACA made several changes to the option  that provide states with increased flexibility in designing their benefit  packages. First, PPACA expanded the range of services previously  available under the 1915(i) benefit. Formerly, states that offered the  1915(i) could cover only those services explicitly identified in the statute,  which among other services included homemaker/health aide, case  management, personal care, and respite care. PPACA revised the option  to allow states to offer services not specifically identified in the law if  approved by CMS, as they are able to do under 1915(c) waivers. Second,  as a result of the changes in PPACA, states are able to offer HCBS to  specific, targeted populations. States may offer 1915(i) service packages  that differ in type, amount, duration, or scope to specific population  groups, either through one service package or through multiple 1915(i)  service packages. For example, a state could have one 1915(i) benefit  package specifically for individuals with chronic mental illness and  another for children with autism. Third, PPACA expanded income  eligibility for the option by allowing states to offer the benefit to individuals  with incomes up to 300 percent of the SSI benefit rate if they are also  eligible for HCBS under certain waivers, which may require the individual  to meet the state\u2019s institutional level of care criteria. The law also  allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals with income up  to 150 percent of the federal poverty level who are eligible to receive  HCBS under the 1915(i) state plan option. Although PPACA provided new  flexibility to states under the 1915(i) option, the law also eliminated the  ability states had previously under 1915(i) to limit the number of  individuals who could receive services and to offer services in selected  geographic areas. States that offer 1915(i) are required to report the  number of individuals projected to be served under the option.", "PPACA extension of Money Follows the Person included additional  funding and some new flexibility. PPACA extended the Money Follows  the Person demonstration program, which was scheduled to expire   in 2011, for 5 years through fiscal year 2016. PPACA appropriated   $450 million for the program annually for each of fiscal years 2012  through 2016, for a total of $2.25 billion. Most features of the  demonstration program were unchanged by PPACA, including the  program\u2019s enhanced FMAP of up to 90 percent for certain services for   12 months for each Medicaid beneficiary transitioned. One change  PPACA did make was to relax one of the eligibility requirements for  Money Follows the Person. Under the original program, an individual had  to reside for not less than 6 months but no more than 2 years in an  inpatient facility, such as a nursing facility, to be eligible to receive  services. PPACA shortened the minimum number of days from 6 months  to 90 consecutive days. Some of the initial Money Follows the Person  grantees reported that the 6-month institutional residency requirement  was a barrier to recruitment because many candidates interested in  transitioning had not been institutionalized long enough to qualify and  individuals who do meet the requirement often have complex medical or  mental health needs that make it more difficult to serve them in the  community. Some states have transition programs that have less  stringent institutional residency requirements. The reduction in the  institutional residency requirement in Money Follows the Person may  potentially increase the number of individuals who can be transitioned  through the program. PPACA made no changes to a maintenance of  effort requirement included in the original demonstration. Under the  program, a state\u2019s expenditures for HCBS in each year of the  demonstration must not be less than such expenditures for fiscal year  2005, or for the fiscal year preceding the first year of the demonstration,  whichever is greater.", "PPACA also extended the national evaluation of Money Follows the  Person, which was designed to assess whether the demonstration had  met its goals to increase the number of institutionalized Medicaid  beneficiaries who can be transitioned to the community and to rebalance  states\u2019 LTSS systems. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed up to  $1.1 million of the funds appropriated for Money Follows the Person each  fiscal year to be used for the evaluation through 2011; PPACA extended  the program\u2019s evaluation and the funding for it through 2016.

States, in general, continue to experience fiscal  challenges, and the state officials we talked with noted that while they are  attracted by the enhanced federal matching funds that come with  Community First Choice and the Balancing Incentive Program especially,  there were limits as to how much the state can contribute. Officials from 8  of the 10 states we selected reported that state budget considerations  were either a general concern when evaluating any potential new HCBS  option or a specific concern regarding Community First Choice or the  Balancing Incentive Program. A state official in Mississippi noted that her  first consideration of a new Medicaid option is how much the federal  government is providing in funding and for how long. She said that she  needs to determine what the cost will be to the state now, and if  applicable, what the cost to the state would be once the enhanced federal  matching rate ends. Regarding the Balancing Incentive Program, Nevada  officials similarly reported that while the state is eligible for the 2 percent  enhanced federal match, it does not have the money to build the  infrastructure, quality assurance system, and financial tracking system  called for by the program.", "Although the enhanced federal matching rate in Community First Choice  was attractive to several states, they also noted potential financial risk  caused by the inability to limit the program\u2019s enrollment or utilization.  Officials in half of the states we interviewed noted concerns about a  potential inability to control expenditures in Community First Choice given  the requirement that the option be offered statewide and the prohibition  on state enrollment and utilization caps. Mississippi officials reported that  their main problem with pursuing the option is the inability to limit potential  state expenditures. Officials from the National Association of State  Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services reported that the fact that  there is no way for states to cap Community First Choice deters states  from taking up the option. States wonder how to keep such a program  within their budgets if they cannot limit either enrollment or utilization. In  contrast, more than half of the state officials we interviewed found the  1915(i) state plan option attractive because of the ability to limit the  provision of services to specific populations, thus providing the state with  the opportunity to limit state financial exposure.", "In considering the options that would provide the most federal funding  possible, officials from a few states told us that when they initially looked  at Community First Choice it was to replace existing state options that do  not qualify for enhanced federal matching rates. Oregon officials noted  that if they chose to use Community First Choice, which provides a 6  percent enhanced federal matching rate, it would be as a replacement for  one of the state\u2019s existing 1915(c) waivers. Expenditures under 1915(c)  waivers qualify for the standard federal matching rate. However, the state  officials did not think that the Community First Choice option would allow  them to cover all the services in their 1915(c) waiver, which would then  require the state to cover these services with state-only funds or drop  them altogether. Officials from Nevada similarly reported that they initially  considered using Community First Choice as a replacement for the  state\u2019s existing self-directed personal care state plan option. While the  state has not ruled out taking up Community First Choice, the officials  thought that the administrative requirements included in Community First  Choice, specifically the requirements for backup systems and the  establishment of a Development and Implementation Council to engage  stakeholders, as well as the additional reporting requirements, meant  that Community First Choice would not be a cost-effective replacement  for its existing self-directed personal care option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Staff Resources and Competing Priorities Pose Barriers to States\u2019 Pursuing New Options", "paragraphs": ["According to state officials, staffing shortages in a number of states have  made it difficult for states to review all the new HCBS options in depth or  put together the teams needed to assemble applications and implement  the options.

They said their current staff of 190 runs a $4 billion Medicaid program,  which already included a personal care option, a Money Follows the  Person program, and a managed care program for LTSS. The officials  said that if they decided to pursue, for instance, the Community First  Choice option, they would have to use these same staff to implement and  oversee the program, including writing the state plan amendment,  obtaining public input, and shepherding the amendment through the CMS  approval process. According to the New Mexico officials, the current staff  already has too much work. Officials in Maine told us that the state  recently offered retirement incentives to staff as a cost-saving measure.  Under the retirement incentive policy, positions that are open because of  the incentive cannot be filled for 2 years. The state is also under a hiring  freeze.

Four of the 10 states we contacted  reported being in the midst of or planning for broad Medicaid reforms.  This situation is consistent with national trends. One national survey of  states found that 11 were planning to implement a managed care system   New Jersey,  for long-term services and supports in either 2012 or 2013.for example, was in the midst of planning for the transition of its Medicaid  program, including LTSS, to managed care. Under the proposal  submitted to CMS, managed care organizations would take over  responsibility for care, including HCBS and nursing home care, for  individuals who are enrolled in one of several of the state\u2019s HCBS  waivers, who require a nursing home-level of care, or who reside in a  nursing home. The managed care organizations would be required to  develop and implement an annual person-centered plan of care and  individual service agreement for each individual requiring LTSS and  would have authority to place an individual in the most cost-effective  setting, whether a home- or community-based setting or a nursing  home. The managed care organization, however, would also be  expected to emphasize services that are provided in members\u2019 homes  and communities in order to prevent or delay institutionalization whenever  possible. At the time we spoke with New Jersey officials, the state was  awaiting CMS\u2019s decision on the proposal. Given the planned transition of  LTSS to managed care, the New Jersey officials did not think applying for  the 1915(i) option at this time made sense, and their decision on whether  to apply for Community First Choice would depend on how their managed  care system looked if approved by CMS. Similarly, Florida was also  moving to statewide Medicaid managed care. Officials in the state told us  that they had not explored the Balancing Incentive Program or  Community First Choice because the state Medicaid agency\u2019s primary  focus has been on the transition to statewide managed care and the time  and resources they have devoted to the transition have prevented them  from exploring the new HCBS options.", "States also factored in how easily the new HCBS options would fit in with  their existing HCBS programs, according to state officials. States that  decided to take up some of the new HCBS options reported doing so  because they complemented existing HCBS options. Four of the five  states we interviewed that received the Money Follows the Person grant  following the initial post-PPACA solicitation told us the state had an  existing transition program to move individuals from institutions into the  community. Each of these states told us that Money Follows the Person would be a supplement to their existing programs and would provide the  state with additional federal funds. Officials from Nevada, for example,  told us that while the state had an existing state-funded community  transition program, they thought the Money Follows the Person program  would give the state the opportunity to target more difficult populations  that could still benefit from community placement. The state plans to use  the Money Follows the Person rebalancing fund to integrate the state\u2019s  various HCBS case management systems and expand outreach.  Similarly, New Jersey state officials told us they planned to apply for the  Balancing Incentive Program because it fit in well with the state\u2019s existing  efforts to rebalance LTSS funding toward HCBS. The state officials told  us that, in part, the state\u2019s move to a managed care model reflects an  effort to increase the availability of HCBS in the state. Because the  managed care organizations assume financial risk, the state officials  believed the organizations would have an incentive to increase HCBS  placements, which are generally less costly than institutional placements.", "State officials said one reason states were interested in taking up the  1915(i) state plan option is that it offers the opportunity to provide  services to people who could not necessarily be served under other  HCBS options. Officials in both Oregon and Montana said they were  looking at the 1915(i) state plan option to provide a set of services for  adults with serious mental illness or children with serious emotional  disorders who cannot be targeted under a 1915(c) waiver either because  of its cost neutrality requirement or because the individuals do not meet  an institutional level of care.", "While the selected states were more likely to find the new HCBS options  attractive if they complemented existing options or offered the opportunity  to serve new populations, state officials also noted the complexity of  layering new HCBS options on top of their state\u2019s existing HCBS system.  Nevada officials told us that each waiver and each program the state  operates is its own silo, with each requiring its own reporting structure,  provider enrollment system, and quality assurance system. As such, the  Nevada officials told us that they were already reporting to CMS on four  1915(c) waivers, the personal care state plan option, and a 1915(i) state  plan option. Each of those, according to the Nevada officials, came with  its own set of requirements. Mississippi officials said that, when looking at  how the four PPACA HCBS options relate to each other, as well as to  existing HCBS options, it becomes hard not only for state staff, but also  for providers and beneficiaries, to work out the differences in all the  different programs. They said they would like CMS to send out guidance  about how states could use these different options together, instead of  issuing guidance on each option separately.", "CMS officials told us they have recently undertaken a number of  initiatives to help states coordinate and align the different Medicaid HCBS  options. While the CMS officials noted a number of efforts to align the  options, they also noted a natural trade-off between giving states  maximum flexibility and simplifying the number of different HCBS options  available to states. In February 2011, CMS established Medicaid State  Technical Assistance Teams (MSTAT), which consist of CMS staff with  knowledge of Medicaid financing, eligibility, coverage, waivers, and state- specific issues. The teams work with individual states to assist in any  area a state has identified or to help states identify specific program areas  that may yield efficiencies. According to CMS, as of April 2012, 27 states  have used MSTATs, and a majority of those have included at least some  discussion of the various HCBS options. In addition to the MSTATs, CMS  officials told us they offer technical assistance to states in several areas.  For example, there is a specific technical assistance provider that can  help states build quality measurement into their systems that can work  across the different options. CMS staff also has presented information  during all-state conference calls and at an annual HCBS conference to  help states learn about the different options and how they can work  together. CMS recently formed a work group consisting of representatives  from the National Association of Medicaid Directors, the National  Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities, and the National  Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services, as  well as officials from 10 states, including 14 HCBS waiver administrators,  to focus in part on developing quality in a systems approach as opposed  to within individual 1915(c) waivers. In addition, in April 2012, HHS  announced the establishment of a new agency\u2014the Administration for  Community Living\u2014which will combine the efforts of several HHS  agencies for the purpose of enhancing and strengthening HHS\u2019s efforts to  support seniors and people with disabilities and ensuring consistency and  coordination in community living policy across the federal government."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In the 13 years since the Olmstead decision, states have continued to  make progress rebalancing their LTSS systems toward more HCBS,  increasing opportunities for individuals who need LTSS to live more  independent lives in the community.
