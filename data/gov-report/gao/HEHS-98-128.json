People suffering from terminal or chronic illnesses or from disabilities are considered especially vulnerable to suicide because their need or desire for palliative\u2014or comfort\u2014care may not be adequately met in a health system that focuses on curative care. Palliative care encompasses a range of approaches to manage the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual suffering that may accompany health conditions that are not responsive to curative treatments. Its goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families by dealing with issues such as depression and pain and symptom management.", "Concerned about the rates of suicide among persons whose health problems are not responsive to curative treatment, the Congress authorized funding to support the research of palliative care issues by passing the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which became law on April 30, 1997. Section 12 of the act amended section 781 of the Public Health Service Act by adding topics related to palliative care and suicide prevention to the list of topics that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can support under the Health Professional Education Research Program. Under section 781, HHS can provide funds to public and nonprofit entities for research on a variety of health profession issues. The types of topics authorized by the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act include those for educating and training health care providers in palliative care, advancing the biomedical knowledge of pain management, improving access to hospice programs, and assessing the quality of palliative care in different health care systems.", "The act requires GAO to report by April 30, 1998, on the extent to which these section 781 projects have furthered the knowledge and practice of palliative care, particularly with regard to the curricula offered and used in medical schools. Our preliminary work showed that no fiscal year 1998 funding for section 781 projects would be awarded by our reporting date. For this reason, in consultation with authorizing committee staff, we focused our effort on determining (1) the extent to which the physician education and training process currently teaches and tests student competency in palliative care issues, (2) HHS\u2019 plans for funding palliative care projects under section 781, and (3) other federal and private palliative care research and education initiatives.", "Our analysis of current educational efforts in palliative care is based on information obtained from a survey we conducted of all U.S. medical schools, surveys conducted by others on U.S. residency programs, and discussions with persons involved in the medical education and training process. Our discussion of HHS\u2019 plans for funding future palliative care projects under section 781 is based on information provided by HHS officials and HHS budgetary documents. Our information on other palliative care initiatives was obtained from various HHS entities, private foundations, nonprofit organizations, and professional associations. We conducted our work from November 1997 through March 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. See appendix I for a discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Palliative care is an important and emerging issue for health care providers, educators, and the general public. As medical advances increase life expectancy, more and more people suffer from chronic and progressively disabling diseases that require treatment for depression and assistance with pain and symptom management. Some recent studies have pointed to significant problems within the health care system that preclude the achievement of the best possible quality of life for patients and their families. Areas identified for improvement include education and training for health care providers, improved pain and symptom management, and access to appropriate and quality health care services.", "The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 contains a provision designed to focus federal funding on research, training, and demonstration projects that would address these specific problem areas. The act authorizes funding in a number of palliative care topics (see table 1) and directs the Secretary of HHS to emphasize palliative medicine among its research and funding priorities under section 781. Section 781 is within title VII of the Public Health Service Act, which authorizes numerous programs for health professions education and training. Section 781 was first funded in 1993 to conduct health professions education research in four broad topic areas related to (1) educational indebtedness, (2) effect of programs for minority and disadvantaged individuals, (3) extent of investigations and disciplinary actions by state licensing authorities, and (4) primary care. The Bureau of Health Professions within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is the HHS agency responsible for administering grants funded under section 781 of title VII."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Palliative Care in Medical Education Varies Considerably", "paragraphs": ["The extent of palliative care instruction varies considerably across and within the three major phases of the physician education and training process. The first phase is undergraduate medical education\u2014or medical school\u2014where students typically receive 2 years of classroom, or didactic, instruction followed by 2 years of clinical training. The United States has 144 accredited medical schools. The second phase is graduate medical education\u2014or residency training\u2014where residents receive 3 to 8 years of clinical training in a medical specialty. The United States has over 7,700 accredited residency programs. The third phase is continuing medical education, which provides physicians who are already practicing medicine with the education and training necessary to maintain or learn new skills. Continuing medical education courses are provided primarily by medical schools and state medical societies, but such courses are also provided by medical associations and consultants. Throughout these three phases, a variety of formal accreditation and certification processes are used to test student competency and to judge the quality of instruction and training."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extent of Palliative Care Education at Medical Schools Is Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Our review at medical schools showed mixed amounts of attention given to palliative care issues. Accrediting organizations have generally steered away from standards requiring instruction in topics as specific as pain management, preferring to leave such matters to the discretion of the faculty at each school. To determine the extent to which the schools addressed these topics, we surveyed all U.S. medical schools on seven palliative care topics.", "For each of the seven palliative care topics we asked about, at least half of the 125 U.S. medical schools that responded to our survey said they had some degree of required instruction. (See fig. 1.) Instruction in palliative care for chronic illness was required by the fewest number of schools (56 percent). For the remaining topics, the percentage of schools requiring the topic was higher; for example, over three-quarters required instruction in the topic of pain management for the terminally or chronically ill, and 94 percent required instruction in depression identification and treatment. Our survey responses showed that some schools have added these topics fairly recently. For example, 24 percent of schools reported adding pain management as a required subject within the last 3 years. (For a more detailed summary of our medical school survey results, see app. II.)", "Many schools reported a need to change palliative care instruction, particularly in the area of clinical training. Overall, 30 percent of schools reported a need to change their classroom curriculum in palliative care, and close to 50 percent reported wanting to provide students with more hands-on training experience in diagnosing and treating patients with pain due to chronic or terminal illness.", "Evaluation processes vary in the extent to which they measure students\u2019 knowledge of palliative care issues. (See fig. 2.) The percentage of medical schools that reported testing competency in the topics we surveyed ranged from 36 percent for interdisciplinary health care for end of life to 72 percent for identifying and treating depression.", "Many medical schools also rely heavily on national examinations\u2014the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination or the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners\u2019 exam\u2014to evaluate student knowledge. A study is currently under way to examine the degree to which the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination tests student knowledge in end-of-life care issues and to develop a method to evaluate student performance on these test questions in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Palliative Care Education in Residency Programs Varied", "paragraphs": ["Our review also indicated that attention to palliative care issues in residency programs varied as well. Accrediting bodies at the graduate level generally require some specific areas of instruction, although, as in medical schools, the primary responsibility for curriculum and training content is assumed by the program director and faculty. Required topics of instruction, such as domestic violence, vary by specialty, and few specialties have requirements including specific palliative care topics.Because of the large number of accredited residency programs in the United States, we did not administer a survey similar to the one we developed for medical schools. We relied on existing surveys done by professional associations that asked residency programs to report whether the subjects of end-of-life care and suicide were included in their training programs.", "The American Medical Association\u2019s (AMA) 1996 survey showed that nearly half of the nation\u2019s 7,787 residency programs include instruction in end-of-life care and over a third teach issues related to suicide. While historical data on the subject of suicide prevention are not available, AMA\u2019s data show greater numbers of residency programs now offer instruction in end-of-life care than in the past. In 1996, nearly 50 percent of residency programs taught end-of-life care, compared with 38 percent in 1994.", "To some extent, the percentage of residency programs that taught palliative care subjects corresponded to the degree to which these skills might be needed in the specialty area covered by the program. For example, 93 percent of family practice residency programs in the subspecialty of geriatrics reported teaching end-of-life care, while only 10 percent of pathology residency programs in the subspecialty of pediatric pathology reported teaching the subject. However, the percentage of programs that reported teaching end-of-life care was surprising for some specialties for which the need for physicians skilled in end-of-life care seems more evident. For example, nearly half of internal medicine residency programs in the subspecialty of oncology reported not teaching end-of-life care, although physicians treating patients with cancer often deal with terminal patients. (See app. III for a detailed summary of AMA\u2019s 1996 residency program survey results.)", "The knowledge and skill of resident physicians is evaluated by each residency program\u2019s internal evaluations and national examinations. These examinations include the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination as well as examinations some physicians take to become certified in a medical specialty.

Many states and medical associations require physicians to continue their medical education to maintain their medical license or membership benefits, but they generally do not require courses on specific topics such as palliative care. Because of the number and variety of continuing medical education providers, information on the existence of continuing medical education courses dedicated to palliative care issues was not readily available. However, we queried the AMA\u2019s database of over 2,000 accredited continuing medical education activities and found that few specifically addressed palliative care. In addition, an official with the American Osteopathic Association said there are few continuing medical education courses related to palliative care for doctors of osteopathy. An example of a course that specifically addresses palliative care issues is a self-study program developed by the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, which covers a variety of palliative care topics.

All seven projects will be conducted by one medical education research center. HRSA plans to provide the funds for the seven projects in May 1998. Because budgets are not maintained separately for each project, HRSA and medical education research center officials were not able to specify the amount of funding dedicated for the palliative care project. The project will assess current medical school courses on death and dying to determine if they meet recommended methods for teaching end-of-life care.", "The remaining $302,000 will be used to support projects focused on increasing the knowledge about the needs and resources of the nation\u2019s health professions. Information obtained through these projects will be used to assess the effectiveness of current workforce programs. HRSA officials said they consider this research as higher in priority. In addition, the officials said that due to the importance of health workforce research, future funding of palliative care projects in medical education is uncertain. HRSA did not include palliative care research for medical education in its fiscal year 1999 budget justification.", "HRSA officials do not plan to fund any of the other types of palliative care topics authorized under the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. They said these other initiatives, such as demonstration projects to reduce restrictions on access to hospice programs, are not related to the traditional focus of title VII to support health professions education and training. Projects of these types are generally administered by HHS agencies other than HRSA. For example, the act authorizes research funding under section 781 for advancing the biomedical knowledge of pain management, which has been primarily the domain of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The act also authorizes research under section 781 for using specific outcome measures to assess the quality of care for patients with disabilities or terminal or chronic illness; measuring outcomes and quality of care is an area of expertise for HHS\u2019s Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal and Private Palliative Care Initiatives Outside Section 781 Are More Substantial", "paragraphs": ["Several HHS agencies fund projects related to palliative care under their own program authority.

The Health Care Financing Administration, which is responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid, has supported these types of demonstration projects. For example, states can obtain waivers to use Medicaid funds for home health care services, community living arrangements, and attendant care services, which are not normally covered by Medicaid but that are considered necessary to care for and improve the quality of life for medically fragile populations.", "Other federal projects do not have an explicit objective related to palliative care and suicide prevention but provide opportunity for benefit in this area. For example, AHCPR has many research initiatives that could address improving palliative care for patient populations most prone to suicide. AHCPR and the American Association of Health Plans will provide $7 million over 3 years to assess the quality of care for patients with chronic diseases under varying features of managed care organizations. In addition, AHCPR has initiatives to develop and improve quality of care measures for health care providers and health service delivery, which could include outcomes for palliative care in the future. AHCPR\u2019s Medical Treatment Effectiveness Program\u2014which has traditionally focused on identifying and promoting the most effective treatments to prevent, diagnose, or treat diseases such as cancer, AIDS, or cardiovascular disease\u2014could also incorporate palliative care for these and other terminal or chronic illnesses in future research projects.", "Private foundations, nonprofit organizations, and professional associations have recognized palliative care as an emerging and important area of medicine and research.
