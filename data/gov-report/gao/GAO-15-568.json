The brigades have conducted hundreds of security cooperation activities, such as exercises with partner nations, throughout Africa. As part of AFRICOM's planning processes, the Offices of Security Cooperation\u2014located in U.S. embassies in Africa\u2014work with U.S. Army Africa (USARAF) to identify and develop security cooperation activities based on the needs of the host nation and AFRICOM's objectives. The brigades are tasked to conduct many of these activities, but they sometimes lack timely and complete information about the activities, such as activity objectives, which can compromise their effectiveness. While personnel from USARAF and the Offices of Security Cooperation coordinate informally, they do not always have a shared understanding of the activity objectives or involve the brigades in planning. Furthermore, USARAF does not have a formal mechanism that includes both the Offices of Security Cooperation and the brigades to shape activities and address information gaps. As a result, the brigades' ability to conduct activities may be challenged, and the resources invested may not have the anticipated effect.", "The brigades have been trained and equipped for their core missions, which has generally prepared them to meet requirements in Africa, but opportunities exist to enhance their mission-specific preparation. The brigades' core training is estimated to cover 90 to 95 percent of the skills needed to support activities in Africa. The brigades have developed regionally-focused, mission-specific training programs to cover the remaining skills. Some Army officials identified concerns about how this training is being supported, but the Army may not have the information it needs to address these concerns, because it has not completed an Army-directed assessment of training for regionally aligned forces. In addition, the brigades have experienced some equipment gaps, particularly in communications systems, because the Army has not fully identified mission-specific equipment requirements or established, or applied, a mechanism to ensure that brigades have the necessary equipment. Furthermore, the Army and the Department of State have not agreed on a process for providing official passports to brigade personnel before their employment period. As a result, the brigades have faced challenges in obtaining passports that have limited their ability to deploy the appropriate personnel to Africa. Without action on these issues, the brigades' ability to fully support the mission in Africa may be affected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop a coordination mechanism to improve planning for activities, assess mission-specific training for aligned forces, identify and provide mission-specific equipment for the brigades, and that DOD and the Department of State coordinate on providing passports to the brigades.

The brigades may be aware before deploying that they do not have  complete information, but they are often unable to fully communicate and  collaborate with USARAF and the applicable Office of Security  Cooperation to get the information they need in the right time frame  because they may not have approval from USARAF to contact the Offices  of Security Cooperation directly or may not know whom to speak with at  USARAF. In other instances, the brigades may not know that there is an  information gap or miscommunication until they arrive in country. In  addition, officials from each brigade cited concerns regarding the  completeness of the information they receive before an activity, which  they said can affect their ability to effectively prepare for and conduct  security cooperation activities. Brigade officials identified the following  issues they have experienced:", "Objectives unclear or inaccurate: Brigade officials cited instances  where activity objectives were not clearly articulated to them or where  they prepared to conduct one type of activity when the Office of  Security Cooperation and the host nation had expected them to  conduct a different activity. For example, one team deployed for an  activity with the understanding that they would be conducting artillery  training with the host nation, but when the team arrived in country it  discovered that it was supposed to conduct a site survey for future  training activities. This misunderstanding was not clear to the brigade,  the Office of Security Cooperation, or USARAF until the team arrived  in country. As a result, brigade officials had to work with the country  team to quickly revise their approach to the execution of the activity  and then return two months later to conduct the initially planned  activity. In an after-action report documenting this activity, brigade  personnel noted that earlier and more direct communication with  security cooperation personnel at the embassy are necessary to  confirm the purpose and intent of activities before execution. In the  case of another activity, brigade personnel deployed to conduct a  survey of training sites, plans, and logistics for future activities.  Brigade personnel noted that in the lead up to the activity it was  difficult to understand the purpose of their survey which made it  difficult to properly plan and prepare for the activity. The personnel  that conducted the activity stated that once the brigade is tasked with  an activity, it would be helpful for USARAF and the brigade personnel  executing the activity to discuss the activity in advance.", "Personnel skill requirements not clearly defined: Brigade officials  cited instances where the activity information they received did not  clearly identify personnel skill requirements and that, as a result, the  brigades did not deploy the right personnel to fully conduct the  activity. For example, brigade officials who deployed to conduct  vehicle maintenance training said that they did not find out until two  weeks prior to deploying what type of vehicles they would be training  host nation personnel to maintain. As a result, they did not have  enough time to train their personnel specifically for maintaining those  types of vehicles before they deployed. Instead, they had to send  general mechanics, who, because they did not have expertise on the  specific vehicles themselves, were not fully prepared to train host  country personnel to maintain them.", "Key information about host nation security forces\u2019 capabilities  missing or incorrect: Brigade officials said that they often did not  have sufficient information about the host nation security forces\u2019  capabilities to effectively target their training efforts, which forced  them to refine or develop new programs of instruction mid-event. For  example, brigade personnel deployed to provide field artillery training  to a host nation with the understanding that personnel attending the  training from the host nation would have at least a basic level of  proficiency that would enable brigade trainers to focus the activity on  refining and enhancing the host nation\u2019s fire support skills. When  brigade personnel arrived in the host nation they learned that none of  the artillery personnel present had conducted live fire training with  their howitzers and other large caliber mortars in over a year. As a  result, brigade staff spent time developing follow-on artillery training to  bring the host nation\u2019s live fire artillery skills to a basic proficiency  level, instead of working with the available artillery personnel to refine  and advance their abilities.", "Logistics and support incorrect or uncoordinated: Brigade  officials noted instances where information about an activity\u2014such as  translation services, equipment logistics and communications plans\u2014 was not fully coordinated before deploying. For example, brigade  officials deployed to a host nation to provide training on preparing  intelligence information and when they arrived in country they  discovered that they were required to pay for their interpreters and  drivers directly with cash, which was unexpected. Brigade personnel  were unable to use the local ATMs to obtain the cash, so an USARAF  official present had to cover the costs. Had the USARAF official not  been present, the brigade personnel may have had difficulty  completing the activity. In another example, brigade personnel  deployed to conduct vehicle maintenance training. However, when the  team arrived, the host nation asked to change the starting date twice  which the brigade personnel were not able to support. The brigade  personnel sent to conduct this activity noted in their after action report  that USARAF, the embassy, and host nation need to better coordinate  key activity logistics, such as the starting date.", "USARAF and Office of Security Cooperation officials noted that they rely  on each other to develop and coordinate activities, but officials cited  challenges that limit their ability to do so. USARAF officials stated that the  Offices of Security Cooperation, which may be staffed by personnel from  different services (e.g., the Navy or Air Force), may not always know what  questions or information they should be communicating to the host nation  to effectively shape Army security cooperation activities. In addition,  according to USARAF and Office of Security Cooperation officials, the  increasing number of activities being conducted in Africa, coupled with  manning shortages, challenges the ability of the Offices of Security  Cooperation to fully coordinate individual activities with the host nation,  AFRICOM, USARAF, the other service components, and DOD executing  units, including the brigades. Furthermore, Office of Security Cooperation  personnel stated they may have limited insight into the development and  validation of security cooperation activities proposed by USARAF, which  makes it challenging to coordinate and refine activities. For instance, one  Office of Security Cooperation chief noted that he had proposed several  activities based on his assessment of the host nation\u2019s security forces,  but he received a list of approved activities from USARAF that was  significantly different and was unaware of how those activities had been  developed and why certain capabilities were being targeted. Another  Office of Security Cooperation chief said that he sometimes receives  activity proposals from AFRICOM and its components that, particularly for  emergent activities, do not include specifics on the activity. This lack of  information challenges his ability to coordinate those activities with the  host nation. In those instances, he said that he will ask for greater details  on the activity or put such activities on hold until he can obtain sufficient  information from the component.", "According to the Army\u2019s Field Manual for Army Support to Security  Cooperation, security cooperation personnel should have a clear and  timely understanding of their objectives and operational environment to  effectively plan and conduct their activities. Furthermore, according to  GAO leading practices for interagency coordination, when coordination  mechanisms are not formalized or fully utilized, the result can be a  patchwork of activities that waste scarce funds and limit the effectiveness  of missions. Defining coordination mechanisms can help agencies  clarify key details about strategy implementation, such as the purpose of  an activity.", "Brigades sometimes lack complete and timely information, which they  need to effectively conduct activities, because USARAF, which is  responsible for formally validating security cooperation activities, has not  established a formal mechanism to consistently share information with  country stakeholders such as the Office of Security Cooperation and the  brigades in order to address information gaps and shape the activity in  advance. Conferences like AFRICOM\u2019s Theater Synchronization  Conference can provide an opportunity to discuss and synchronize  activities on an annual basis, but the significant number of emergent  activities and frequent changes to planned activities limits their  effectiveness for refining the details of activities leading up to execution.  Further, while USARAF\u2019s fiscal year 2015 Operation Order identifies the  need to coordinate activity concepts with the Offices of Security  Cooperation, it does not specify a clear mechanism for doing so and  USARAF, the Offices of Security Cooperation, and the brigades lack a  collective venue for coordination, which they would need in order to  respond to dynamic activity requirements and to ensure a shared   For instance, officials said that  understanding of critical information.USARAF planners and the Offices of Security Cooperation informally  contact one another on an individual basis to discuss proposed activities,  but they do not consistently and formally meet to discuss upcoming  activities. Furthermore, the brigades are rarely involved in these informal  conversations and often do not have the authority to contact the Offices of  Security Cooperation directly until shortly before they deploy. Given the  challenges faced by the Offices of Security Cooperation, Office of  Security Cooperation officials said that the best method for refining  activity concepts and ensuring that they are completed in a timely manner  is to hold a meeting where key stakeholders can discuss activity details in  advance. Such a meeting could also help to refine the task orders that  USARAF issues to the brigades to ensure that they capture all critical  information and could provide an additional venue to further improve  synchronization of activities within AFRICOM.

It also included situational  exercises with cultural role players and simulated key leader  engagements. The brigade used a number of external resources to  develop this training, including the 162nd Infantry Training Brigade, the  Army Training and Doctrine Command Culture Center, the Asymmetric  Warfare Group, and the African Studies Department from nearby  Kansas State University, which provided African cultural expertise and  role players. The 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division created a similar  program that it referred to as Dragon University. The 4th Brigade, 1st  Armored Division also developed a program at its homestation referred to  as Highlander University, but this program did not incorporate external  training organizations\u2014such as Army Training and Doctrine Command\u2014  to the same extent.

One brigade  commander noted when a brigade manages its own mission-specific  training rather than using a standardized curriculum it can maintain  scheduling flexibility, and young leaders reap benefits as they learn to  plan and develop training programs based on analyzing missions.", "However, Army stakeholders from a range of organizations have  identified some concerns about how mission-specific training for  regionally aligned forces is being conducted, supported, and funded, and  in some cases they identified areas for improvement. For example, the  Army held a Regionally Aligned Forces Table Top Exercise in December  2014 that included participants from across the Army to discuss  challenges related to the implementation of the regionally aligned forces  concept. One of the findings from this exercise was that the current unit  approach to conducting mission-specific training is ad hoc, unfunded (i.e.,  no dedicated funding) and likely insufficient to meet all training  requirements. The table top exercise also found that there is limited or  poorly advertised institutional support for security cooperation and culture   Findings from the  and language training for regionally aligned units.table top exercise recommended that the Army identify capabilities to  support regionally aligned forces training and facilitate unit training at  homestation, including related funding. In addition, officials from Army  Training and Doctrine Command said the brigades may not be aware of  all of the training resources that exist in the Army and the extent to which  the units take advantage of those resources is largely unit driven. For  example, one Army Forces Command official said that the 85th Civil  Affairs Brigade has expertise and training capabilities that the allocated  brigades could leverage in support of their training programs, but it is not  clear to what extent the allocated brigades are aware of this potential  support. These officials noted that the Army does not have an entity to  coordinate all of the organizations that can support training for regionally  aligned forces consistently through different brigade rotations and may  need a central organization with expertise to serve that function.", "In addition to providing training to regionally aligned forces, the 3rd Battalion, 353rd  Regiment has also been tasked with other missions, such as training individuals and  teams of advisors deploying to Afghanistan. from 2nd Brigade and 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division. According to  documentation provided by 162nd Brigade officials, these training teams  were funded by the 162nd and incorporated other enablers, such as  contractors with regional expertise and the Army Training and Doctrine  Command Culture Center. Officials from 3rd Battalion said that the  battalion expects to be able to fund its own instructor and travel costs  related to the trainings, but future allocated brigades will likely have to  fund the costs of additional training enablers to augment these courses,  such as contractors with regional cultural expertise. According to battalion  officials, if brigades have to pay for the additional enablers, they might be  less likely to use them, and the region-specific training might not be as  extensive.", "In an effort to determine whether its mission-specific training approach for  the regionally aligned forces was sufficient, the Army issued guidance in  2013 that established a requirement for Army Forces Command, with  support from other Army training organizations, to conduct an  assessment of the training and preparation of regionally aligned force  units by January 2014, with follow-up assessments every six months.  We have previously reported that training assessments provide  opportunities to enhance the coordination, effectiveness, and efficiency of  training. However, the Army may not have all of the information that it  needs to make this determination or address stakeholder concerns  because, as of March 2015, Army Forces Command had not completed  this assessment. When we asked why the assessment had not been  completed, officials from Army Forces Command said that the mission the  brigades are conducting is not new and does not require a special  assessment, as was initially thought when the requirement was  established. In addition, these officials noted that every unit is currently  assessed through brigade-level after-action reviews and the  documentation of lessons learned. While an individual unit after-action  review provides valuable insights on unit experiences, it may not provide  the breadth of information necessary to address some of the concerns  that were cited at the Army\u2019s table top exercise or by other stakeholders.", "Given that three brigades have completed mission-specific training for  AFRICOM-directed activities, and other brigades have been conducting  training for missions in other geographic combatant commands, the Army  should now be positioned to conduct an overall assessment of its  approach to training aligned forces.

The Army has also commissioned the RAND Corporation to  conduct a study on the estimated operational and institutional support  costs of regionally aligned forces, including training costs.

In some cases, equipment obtained by the 1st Infantry  Division to support requirements in Africa was purchased by the Army  and thus it was transitioned to 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division (e.g.,  high frequency radios), but other equipment was not transferred because  it was purchased by 1st Infantry Division and added to its property book,  or the transfer has been delayed. For example, the 1st Infantry Division  had purchased several Secure Internet Protocol Router/Non-Secure  Internet Protocol Router Access Points with its own funds in order to  support division and brigade missions in Africa. Rather than transition this  equipment to the follow-on brigade, the division is currently utilizing it for  its mission in Iraq. As a result, the 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division  submitted an Operational Needs Statement for these same items, but  brigade officials said their request was rejected and, as of April 2015, they  are still operating without these items.

Further, while Army Forces Command guidance directs allocated forces  to utilize the operational needs statement process to address gaps in  mission-essential equipment, the challenges experienced by the brigades  in obtaining equipment through this process demonstrate the limitations of  relying fully on this approach. For example, Army Headquarters officials  said that one of the challenges of obtaining non-standard equipment  through Operational Needs Statements is that the process does not  include clearly associated sustainment or training plans, whereas formal  requirements documents, such as mission-essential equipment lists are  developed with these considerations in mind.", "To address the gaps in mission-essential equipment that the brigades  have experienced, brigade and division officials have suggested that the  Army establish a consistent mechanism to ensure that each successive  brigade receives all mission-specific equipment at the outset of its  mission, such as a mission-essential equipment set that is centrally- funded, maintained and rotated among brigades. The 4th Brigade, 1st  Infantry Division developed a recommended list of equipment for such a  set, which includes communications equipment as well as other  equipment not included in the brigade\u2019s standard equipment sets that the  brigade needed during its mission.

The brigades typically used one of two application types\u2014 routine or expedited. Army officials who used these processes said that  normal processing time for routine passport requests was approximately  6-10 weeks, while the processing time for expedited passport requests  averaged about 2-4 weeks. Each of the brigades initially attempted to  process passport applications for a significant number of their personnel  before assuming the mission, but unit officials said that the sheer number  of applications being submitted by the brigades caused Department of  State officials to question whether the passports were actually required.", "Officials from the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs said  the military was previously submitting a high volume of requests for  official passports for entire units through a Department of State waiver  process that allowed units blanket authority to apply for passports without  identifying a specific travel destination. Officials said that the high volume  of passport requests also created a backlog in passport processing, and  while the military does not pay a fee for official passports, there are costs  associated with processing applications and issuing passports, which  officials estimate to amount to approximately $110 per passport. These  costs get passed on to the general public. In addition, officials said that  thousands of passports obtained by DOD were being returned unused.  For instance, between October 23, 2014 and November 5, 2014, the  Bureau\u2019s Special Issuance Agency reviewed 1,689 no-fee passports\u2014 1,426 of them official passports\u2014that were returned for proper disposition  and found that approximately 55 percent of these passports had never  been used. Of the 920 passports that had never been used, the agency  estimated that 482 were from DOD. As a result of these issues, the  Department of State determined that it needed to be more stringent in  reviewing passport applications, to ensure that the applicants had a  validated requirement for official passports. Subsequently, the  Department of State signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DOD  in 2012 that invalidated existing unit blanket-waiver letters and required  specific destination information to process individual official passport  applications for military personnel except in specific circumstances. In  addition, Department of State officials stated that on a case-by-case  basis, the Special Issuance Agency may request travel orders to validate  entitlement to an official passport; Army officials said that the Department  of State is requesting travel orders routinely in the case of the allocated  brigades.", "However, brigades do not always receive deployment orders\u2014required to  generate travel orders\u2014for activities in time to apply for passports.

They also said that the brigades are often informally  notified in advance of activities for which they are to prepare. However,  the activity may not be finalized and personnel may not have the official  deployment orders necessary to apply for passports until weeks or even  days before deployment. Officials from the 1st Infantry Division and 1st  Armored Division said that they employed different tactics to work around  the Department of State\u2019s constraints with varying degrees of success.  For example, 1st Infantry Division officials said that they submitted a  memorandum signed by a 1st Infantry Division general officer stating that  any applications accompanying it were in support of validated  deployments, but this was rejected by the Department of State, which  division officials said continued to require official orders showing  personnel deploying into a country that required official passports for  entry. 1st Armored Division officials, on the other hand, said that they had  success working with Department of State officials to find a solution that  involved attaching the general Army Forces Command deployment order  for the 4th brigade\u2019s overall mission to an AFRICOM administrative  message identifying the list of projected activities as of January 2015.  This method was successful, although the administrative message did not  include requirements for emergent activities. Brigades also had to utilize  workarounds, such as submitting passport applications for more  personnel than were actually needed for a specific event in order to try to  build a pool of personnel with official passports that could be used for  emergent requirements or to provide flexibility for planned events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Obtaining Passports Have Affected Missions", "paragraphs": ["The brigades\u2019 inability to obtain adequate numbers of official passports in  advance has resulted in some adverse effects for the brigades. For  example, many countries in Africa require visas to enter the country.  While the visa application process is controlled by the host country and  varies by country, personnel cannot apply for a visa until they have a  passport. Thus, a delay in obtaining a passport places further time  pressures on the already constrained visa process, causing some  activities to be delayed. Brigade officials said that several of their  activities were cancelled or delayed because some personnel could not  obtain an official passport or visa in advance of the planned activity. In  addition, brigade officials said that when the soldier best suited for an  activity\u2014and the commander\u2019s first choice\u2014did not have a passport, they  have been forced to deploy personnel that only meet the basic skill and  capability requirements of the activity simply because they had a  passport. In one instance, officials said their unit was unable to deploy its  lead maintenance technician as requested because he did not have the  official passport and visa necessary to support an emergent requirement.  The Army\u2019s Field Manual for Army Support to Security Cooperation states  that soldiers supporting security cooperation efforts need a variety of  skills including technical proficiency and soft skills, noting that not every  soldier is suited to be an advisor; thus, limiting a commander\u2019s choice of  personnel could hinder mission-effectiveness.", "Our work on results-oriented government states that to facilitate  collaboration, agencies\u2014which may need to find common ground while  still satisfying their respective operating needs\u2014need to address  compatibility of standards, policies, and procedures that will be used in a  collaborative effort.Department of State, officials from the two organizations have met on a  number of occasions to discuss the passport challenges experienced by  the brigades, but have not agreed upon a consistent method through  which personnel from these brigades can apply for official passports  before they have deployment orders. While the 2012 Memorandum of  Understanding invalidated existing blanket waivers, it does still allow for  organizational commanders to submit new requests for waiver letters  under certain circumstances; it states that military commanders can apply  for waivers to the requirement to list a specific travel destination on the  application based on the organization\u2019s mission and historical travel  pattern, including examples of missions that would have failed for lack of  a waiver. However, Department of State officials stated that there is no  official process to request a waiver from the requirement for DOD  personnel to submit travel orders when requested. Department of State  officials told us that if the Army could provide an accurate analysis on  historical data of the number of personnel with associated ranks and skill  requirements that have deployed to Africa for each allocated brigade,  then a waiver in accordance with the Memorandum could potentially be  provided. Brigade and division officials told us that, while it may not  address every emergent requirement, it would be beneficial for each  brigade allocated to AFRICOM to be authorized a certain number of  official passports based on their historical mission set, so that they could  build a pool of personnel with passports that are likely to deploy.", "According to officials from the Army and the  Army officials said that the brigades are intended to be a flexible sourcing  pool that can quickly respond to USARAF\u2019s unpredictable security  cooperation requirements, but that challenges obtaining passports limit  their responsiveness. Without a consistent, agreed-upon approach that  allows for the brigades to obtain a sufficient number of official passports  at the outset of their missions, future brigades allocated to AFRICOM will  likely continue to face challenges in this area, and the flexibility of the  brigades to respond to emergent requirements may be limited."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Brigades Have Reported Facing Some Challenges to Core Mission Readiness, but Deployments to Africa Are Perceived to Have Benefits for Soldier Development", "paragraphs": ["The brigades allocated to AFRICOM have reported facing some  challenges in sustaining core mission readiness while deploying in  response to requirements in Africa, due in part to limitations on the  training that can be conducted in deployed environments.

The Army\u2019s regulation  on readiness reporting states that all Army units are required to report  their ability to accomplish core functions, provide designed capabilities,  and execute the standardized mission-essential tasks for decisive action  on a monthly basis. Additionally, Army guidance for regionally aligned  forces requires the brigades to maintain certain levels of decisive-action  readiness throughout their employment.", "All three of the brigades allocated to AFRICOM conducted decisive-action  training and completed a Combat Training Center rotation, and they  continued to train on their core skills while employed in Africa. However,  the two brigades that have completed their missions in Africa reported  facing some challenges in maintaining core-mission readiness while  employed in Africa, and they said that they might have required additional  time to train or augmentation from another unit if they had been called  upon to support a contingency. Officials from the current brigade said that  they were anticipating similar challenges. The brigades identified several  factors that resulted in readiness degradation while they were employed  in Africa, including", "Uncertain Security Cooperation Requirements and Timing: The  brigades each took steps to maintain the decisive-action readiness of  their homestation-based units and personnel during their periods of  availability, with a particular focus on training, but officials said that  factors such as uncertain security cooperation requirements, frequent  deployments of key leaders, and training events that kept personnel  and equipment deployed or in transit for long periods of time resulted  in some degradation of readiness. For example, with key leaders and  other personnel deploying frequently, the brigades\u2019 ability to conduct  collective training, particularly at the higher unit echelons, is limited.  Additionally, although each of the brigades developed plans to  conduct decisive-action training around planned security cooperation  activities, emergent activities and frequently shifting schedules for  planned events sometimes made it difficult for them to adhere to their  training plans. Brigade officials said that, in one such instance, the  shifting dates of a planned event caused a battalion to miss its range  time, which prevented it from completing all of its collective gunnery  exercises. The unit utilized simulators to fulfill some training  requirements, but officials said that live fire training on the range  would have been preferable.", "Battalion Task Force Deployments: A Battalion task force from  each of the three brigades was deployed for approximately six to nine  months to the Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa to fill a  requirement for security and crisis response capabilities. These  deployments presented personnel readiness challenges for the  brigades because they caused some units within the brigades to be  bifurcated (i.e., part of the unit was deployed and part remained at  homestation). This affected the reported personnel readiness ratings  of the brigades, because the bifurcated units would not be prepared to  deploy elsewhere as cohesive units without time to redeploy  personnel and reassemble these units. Division officials said that they  believe readiness degradation caused by unit bifurcation is more of an  administrative concern, as they do not view the bifurcated units as  less capable simply because they have personnel who are forward  deployed. Army readiness officials said that assessing the strategic  readiness implications of unit bifurcation is an ongoing challenge for  the Army, which is increasingly being asked to do small unit  deployments.", "Specific Effects for Armor Brigades: Unit officials said that the  requirement to maintain decisive-action readiness presented greater  challenges for the allocated armored brigades\u2014the 2nd Brigade, 1st  Infantry Division and the 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division\u2014than for  the allocated infantry brigade. An Army official said that this is  because, armored units are required to train frequently on their  equipment platforms (e.g., tanks and artillery) and conduct sequenced  gunnery exercises, which require significant time and resources. The  armored brigades were particularly affected by the task force  deployments. The two armored battalions from the brigades that  deployed for the mission could not fully conduct required gunnery  training because they did not have adequate range space and  equipment (e.g., mounted vehicles, crew-served weapons) in the  deployed environment.  In addition, brigade officials said that the  armored battalion currently deployed will not have enough time after  redeploying to reset and train before the brigade\u2019s next Combat  Training Center rotation in 2016 and thus will have to go through a  rotation with a different brigade a few months later.", "As a result of these challenges, brigade and Army Forces Command  officials said that the brigades may have needed some time to redeploy  personnel conducting security cooperation activities from Africa and to  conduct training. Furthermore, to replace the battalion deployed to the  Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa, the brigades may require  augmentation from an external unit if they are called upon to support a  contingency.", "According to Army Forces Command officials, the Army has made  changes to the types of units that it will use to fill both the allocated  brigade and security forces requirements in Africa. They further said that  these changes may lessen some of the negative effects on decisive- action readiness for future allocated brigades, although the extent of the  potential effect is unclear. The officials said that the Army will be  allocating infantry or Stryker brigades to AFRICOM in the future and that  they expect infantry brigades to be utilized for the mission more  frequently. The next brigade scheduled for this mission is an infantry  brigade. Brigade officials said that infantry brigades, in particular, are  better positioned than armored brigades to balance core-mission training  with requirements in Africa, and USARAF officials added that they are  also better suited to the environment in Africa. The current brigade\u2019s  mission is being curtailed to hasten this transition. Army Forces  Command officials also said that the Army will be filling  the requirements  for security forces in the Horn of Africa with Reserve Component  battalions in the future, although the allocated brigade in Africa is still  projected to deploy a company to the Horn of Africa to provide crisis  response capabilities. The next battalion scheduled for this mission is a  National Guard battalion. Brigade officials generally said they believe that  without the deployments of the battalion task forces, the brigades could  more easily maintain adequate levels of readiness.", "Furthermore, stakeholders at the December 2014 Army Regionally  Aligned Forces Table Top Exercise recommended that the Army consider  creating a multifunctional, battalion-sized force that could be allocated to  AFRICOM to directly satisfy AFRICOM\u2019s requirements for small-scale  security cooperation activities while preserving the allocated brigades for  larger-scale exercises. Army Headquarters officials said that this idea is  currently being studied but if implemented, it may also help to preserve  unit readiness, although the extent of the potential effect is unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deployments to Africa for Security Cooperation Activities Can Have Benefits for Training and Soldier Development", "paragraphs": ["Although the brigades have experienced some challenges maintaining  decisive-action readiness, their frequent deployments to Africa for  security cooperation activities can also have training benefits.

The experiences and  lessons learned of the brigades allocated to AFRICOM provide the Army  with an opportunity to refine its approach to planning for and employing  regionally aligned forces in Africa and elsewhere. By establishing a formal  mechanism for key stakeholders to review, discuss, and shape upcoming  activities, USARAF can better ensure that its planners, the Offices of  Security Cooperation, and the brigades have a shared understanding of  the objectives and details of the activity. In turn, such a mechanism would  enhance the brigades\u2019 ability to address potential information gaps in  advance and more effectively perform activities, resulting in a greater  return on investments made in the partner nation. Moreover, the use of  brigades to conduct activities beyond their typical mission sets has  revealed some gaps in the systems that the Army is using to train and  equip regionally aligned forces; accordingly, DOD must take steps to  ensure that the brigades are consistently and effectively prepared to  support security cooperation activities in Africa. An assessment of the  sufficiency and effectiveness of its approach for training regionally aligned  forces will position the Army to address stakeholder concerns about  training and identify opportunities to enhance the brigades\u2019 ability to fulfill  their mission in Africa. Further, by formalizing mission-specific equipment  requirements for the brigades and utilizing existing policy and procedures  to establish a timely and consistent mechanism for the provision of such  equipment, USARAF and the Army can ensure that the brigades will have  the capabilities to safely and effectively carry out distributed activities  throughout Africa, and limit potential inefficiencies that may result from  each successive brigade obtaining mission-specific equipment on an  individual basis. Finally, the flexibility of the brigades to respond to  Combatant Commander requirements has been cited as an important  benefit of regionally aligned forces; for this benefit to be fully realized,  coordinated actions by the Army and the Department of State are needed  to ensure that allocated brigades have sufficient numbers of official  passports in accordance with their mission set."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following four  actions to enhance the efforts of the allocated brigades in Africa:  1.

In its comments, DOD  stated that USARAF has implemented several changes to its business  practices since the end of GAO\u2019s audit to improve planning, support, and  information exchanges with regionally aligned forces for Africa, including  improving the utilization of existing brigade liaison officers by integrating  them into working groups, relocating liaison officers\u2019 workspace to  improve brigade situational awareness, increasing the number of liaison  officers embedded at USARAF, conducting multi-day planning and  synchronization meetings with brigades to be aligned to AFRICOM in  fiscal year 2016, and publishing a base operations order with a more  comprehensive projection of security cooperation requirements for fiscal  year 2016. While these actions are positive steps that may help to ensure  that the brigades are more aware of critical information, we continue to  believe that USARAF can further enhance its efforts by establishing a  consistent mechanism by which all of the key stakeholders, including  Offices of Security Cooperation, can consistently coordinate upcoming  activities and share information.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation, that the Army conduct  an assessment of its approach to providing mission-specific training to  regionally aligned forces, including brigades allocated to AFRICOM, and  determine whether any adjustments are needed. In its comments, DOD  said that updates to training guidance are based on lessons learned and  after-action reviews submitted by regionally aligned force elements  returning from missions. In addition, the Army is preparing an update to  existing regionally aligned forces guidance, to be issued in the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2015, that will require commands to assess  regionally aligned forces implementation and submit lessons learned and  suggested improvements to the Army, which the Army will review and  make adjustments as necessary to enhance regionally aligned forces  implementation. Guidance requiring commands to assess regionally  aligned forces implementation, if fully implemented, should provide the  Army valuable information about the sufficiency of its training approach  for regionally aligned forces and where adjustments may be needed and  thus would meet the intent of our recommendation.", "DOD concurred with our third recommendation, that the Army identify the  mission-specific equipment requirements for the brigades allocated to  AFRICOM and, to the extent practicable, establish a consistent  mechanism to ensure that the brigades allocated to AFRICOM are  equipped with all known mission-essential equipment at the outset of their  missions. In its comments, DOD said that the Army issued guidance for  USARAF to establish a prepositioned equipment set specifically designed  to support regionally aligned forces units operating in Africa, called the  Africa Activity Set. The concept for the Africa Activity Set is still under  development, but DOD stated that, once it is complete, this activity set will  consist of mission-specific, prepositioned equipment sets to be used by  regionally aligned force units conducting security cooperation,  humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and other missions across Africa.  Prepositioned equipment sets that can be used by the brigades for  security cooperation and other activities will be very beneficial, but without  knowing the details of how the Africa Activity Set will be implemented and  how brigades will be able to access this equipment, it is difficult to know  the degree to which it will fully address the brigades\u2019 gaps in mission- essential equipment. Specifically, as we noted in our report, the brigades  said that they need homestation access to this mission-essential  equipment. We therefore believe that USARAF, as it develops the  concept for the activity set, should consider how mission-essential  equipment can be made available to the brigades at the outset of their  missions, in accordance with our recommendation.", "DOD concurred with our fourth recommendation, that the Army conduct  an analysis of the brigades\u2019 personnel deployment trends for security  cooperation activities to identify the number of official passports typically  required for each allocated brigade to support its mission and, based on  this analysis, coordinate with the Department of State to develop, agree  upon, and execute a waiver process authorizing an allotment of official  passports to these brigades at the outset of their rotations. In its  comments, DOD stated that the Army is preparing an update to existing  regionally aligned forces guidance that will clarify existing passport  procurement policies to ensure that regionally aligned force units are  aware of processes and procedures to improve individual and unit-level  acquisition efforts. While clarifying guidance on passport policies may be  beneficial, we continue to believe that an analysis of the brigades\u2019  personnel deployment trends and development of a process authorizing  an allotment of official passports to the brigades at the outset of their  rotations are essential to ensure that allocated brigades have sufficient  numbers of official passports, in accordance with their mission sets.", "The Department of State also concurred with a parallel recommendation,  that the Bureau of Consular Affairs coordinate with the Army to mutually  develop, agree upon, and execute a waiver process authorizing an  allotment of official passports to brigades allocated to AFRICOM at the  outset of their rotations.

The Department of State  further stated that the Special Issuance Agency has provided comments  on a fragmentary order that details internal DOD coordination and  accountability for the passport application process, which it believes  establishes a mutually acceptable framework for identifying the positions  and individuals requiring passports within each brigade. While these  steps do not constitute a \u201cwaiver\u201d as the Special Issuance Agency has  historically used the term, the Department of State indicated that these  steps should allow the Special Issuance Agency to issue required  passports to the brigades earlier in the process than it has been and  should assist the agency with resource management in the production of  the passports.
