About two-thirds of government-wide IDIQ obligations were for services, with the remainder for products. Although the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) states a preference for multiple-award IDIQs, the majority of dollars government-wide, approximately 60 percent, were obligated through single-award IDIQs. About 70 percent of single-award IDIQ obligations and more than 85 percent of order obligations under multiple-award contracts were competed. Contracting officials at DOD cited flexibility as the main advantage for using IDIQ contracts, noting that it was easier and faster to place an order under an existing IDIQ contract than to award a separate contract when a specific need arose.", "Ten of the 18 single-award IDIQ contracts GAO reviewed at DOD were not competed, generally because only one contractor could meet the need. For the competed single-award contracts, contracting officials cited various reasons for choosing a single-award IDIQ approach, such as the need to build and maintain knowledge as orders were awarded over time. For about one-third of the multiple-award IDIQ orders GAO reviewed, DOD did not provide an opportunity for all contract holders to compete due to urgency or other reasons.", "Prices on IDIQ contracts and orders at DOD were established at different points, depending on how well-defined the requirements were at the time of contract award. For example, for a Navy contract to buy commercial radios used in fixed-wing aircraft, the pricing was established upfront in the contract since the radios were defined products that have been used for many years. In contrast, for an Air Force contract to buy research and development services for cybersecurity and malware detection, all pricing was established at the order level since specific research needs were not known when the contract was awarded."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations at this time.

These  contracts allow agencies to establish a group of prequalified  contractors to compete for future orders under streamlined ordering  procedures once agencies determine their specific needs. Contracting  officers must avoid situations in which contractors specialize in one or  a few areas of the work, creating the likelihood that orders would be  awarded noncompetitively.", "An order, which is placed when a concrete need arises, obligates funds  and authorizes work. Orders must be within the scope, period of  performance, and maximum value and or quantities agreed to in the  contract. The ordering processes for a multiple-award IDIQ contract and  single-award IDIQ contract differ somewhat. For orders under single  award IDIQ contracts, once a requirement is known, contracting officials  can place an order following the procedures outlined in the contract.  When multiple-award IDIQ contracts have been awarded, and a need  arises, the requirement must be generally competed, through \u201cfair  opportunity\u201d, among all of the IDIQ contract holders. The specific  procedures required to provide fair opportunity differ based on the dollar  value of the orders. Contracting officers must provide each contractor a  fair opportunity to be considered for each order unless exceptions apply.

Generally, the information that is  used by contracting officers to determine the reasonableness of price  depends on a series of circumstances, including whether the particular  product or service procured is for a commercial or noncommercial item,  and whether the requirement is being competed or awarded  noncompetitively. The data examined could be cost data, such as the  cost of materials, labor, and overhead, or pricing information, such as  invoices for the same or similar items sold to commercial customers.

Contracting officials noted it was easier and faster to place an  order under an IDIQ contract than to solicit and award a separate contract  each time a need arose. Price and technical approach can still be  evaluated at the time of placing an order, but the overall turnaround time,  they said, is significantly less than for a new contract. Contracting officials  also stated that IDIQ contracts were easier to administer. First, they noted  that it was more efficient to track funds and requirements for different  customers through orders, rather than making modifications to stand- alone contracts for the same purpose. Second, officials told us that the  close-out of orders from IDIQ contracts was much faster, as each order  can be closed-out individually when the last payment is made rather than  waiting until the entire contract was complete.", "According to DOD contracting officials, IDIQ contracts also provide more  funding flexibility as funds are obligated as needed through orders and  not at contract award\u2014as may be required for some other types of  contracts. Once the minimum guarantee is satisfied on an IDIQ contract,  there is no further government obligation to procure additional products  and services under an IDIQ contract. For example, on an Air Force IDIQ  contract for roofing services, contracting officials established a pricing  structure that allowed for repairs to different types of roofing. The Air  Force placed an order only when a specific need arose. These needs  may vary\u2014such as when repairs are needed due to wear and tear. This  contract allows work to be performed on an as needed basis, which may  help the Air Force begin or continue work in an uncertain funding  environment.", "In addition, DOD officials told us that the contracts they used served a  broader customer base, for example, multiple commands, other federal  agencies, and foreign military sales. By not needing to specify an exact  quantity or timing of delivery at the time of contract award, program  offices can accommodate unforeseen needs on an ongoing basis through  issuance of orders. For example, an Army contract for Aerial Target  Systems training and testing is intended for use by all military  departments as well as foreign military partners.

To establish  pricing for one of the orders, we found that contracting officials  compared the contractor\u2019s proposal with historical pricing, as well as  verified labor rate information provided by the contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prices for DOD IDIQ Contracts with a Mix of Well-Defined and Less- Defined Products and Services Established at Both IDIQ Contract Award and Order Levels", "paragraphs": ["Eighteen DOD IDIQ contracts, which include both multiple- and single- award, in our selected sample had some price elements established at  the time of contract award and some price elements established at the  time of order award. This arrangement occurred in situations where some  elements of the requirement were well defined and pricing could be  established upfront at the contract level, while other requirements were  less defined and the prices were established when the order was placed.  For instance, in DOD\u2019s multiple-award IDIQ contracts, some pricing  elements may be negotiated upfront at contract award, such as not-to- exceed labor rates; however, since further competition is expected at the  order level contractors may offer labor rates below the not-to-exceed  rates. Therefore, actual labor rates were determined when an order was  placed, for instance:", "The Air Force established a multiple-award IDIQ vehicle for roofing  repairs with a ceiling of $325 million. According to officials, each IDIQ  contract has a not-to-exceed price for 11 different roofing scenarios.  When a need arises, the contracting officer solicits offers from the  multiple-award IDIQ contract holders. According to contracting  officials, these contractors submit proposals and base their pricing on  defined requirements such as the type of roof, extent of repair, and  location. The proposal with the lowest price that is technically  acceptable\u2014which cannot exceed a contractor\u2019s not-to-exceed  pricing\u2014is awarded the order.", "A Navy noncompeted single-award IDIQ contract was awarded for the  deactivation and disposal of Tomahawk missiles with a value of up to  $15 million per year. Pricing for the deactivation of the missiles was  established upfront in the IDIQ contract; however, some elements of  the contract, such as unscheduled maintenance and testing, were not  defined at contract award and therefore no price was established. We  found that in one of the orders we reviewed, the contractor was to  provide software for missile testing. In order to establish pricing on  this order, contracting officials conducted a cost analysis of the  proposed offer. They asked the Defense Contract Management  Agency to review the labor pricing that was submitted and pricing for  similar labor categories the government paid on a different contract.", "The Army awarded a noncompeted single-award IDIQ contract with a  value of up to $42 million that, according to a contracting official, is for  a broad range of efficiency management services, such as  determining ways to improve the function and efficiency of logistical  processes. Not-to-exceed values for labor rates and the fee were  determined for the IDIQ contract, but actual prices are determined at  the order level. To establish the not-to-exceed rates in the IDIQ  contract, contracting officials used certified cost and pricing data and  support from the Defense Contract Management Agency to determine  reasonable rates. For the 3 orders we reviewed under this IDIQ, a  technical evaluation was conducted to ensure that the labor mix was  acceptable, and contracting officials compared proposed labor rates  with those not-to-exceed rates agreed to in the IDIQ contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

Data that were adjusted for  inflation were adjusted to fiscal year 2015 dollars using the Fiscal Year  Gross Domestic Product Price Index. To assess the reliability of the  FPDS-NG data we used, we electronically tested for missing data,  outliers, and inconsistent coding, and we compared data on selected IDIQ  contracts to contract documentation we obtained.

Only one  offer was received on each of the 23 multiple-award orders selected,  either because DOD only solicited one contractor or because only one  contractor submitted an offer. We selected orders where only one offer  was received so as to understand reasons why competition did not take  place.
