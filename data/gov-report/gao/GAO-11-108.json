However, GAO has reported that gaps in national security staff knowledge and skills pose a barrier to the interagency collaboration needed to address these threats. Training and other professional development activities could help bridge those gaps. GAO was asked to identify: (1) training and other professional development activities intended to improve the ability of key national security agencies' personnel to collaborate across organizational lines and (2) how these activities were intended to improve participants' collaboration abilities. To address these objectives, GAO asked nine key agencies involved in national security issues to submit information on professional development activities that were explicitly intended to build staff knowledge or skills for improving interagency collaboration. In addition, GAO gathered and analyzed other information such as target audience, participation levels, and participating agencies. GAO also interviewed responsible human capital and training officials. GAO will explore how interagency participation and other factors may influence the success of these activities in a subsequent review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 225 professional development activities intended to improve participants' ability to collaborate across agency lines. These ranged from ten- month joint professional military education programs and year-long rotations to 30-minute online training courses. Because these activities varied widely across dimensions such as length and learning mode, the activities were grouped to allow for appropriate analysis and comparisons of their characteristics. Overall, we found that DOD, State, and DHS provided most of the professional development activities that met our criteria. We found some variation within the different types of activities, mostly related to provider, mode of delivery, or participation levels. DHS, DOD, and State provided the majority of training activities, which primarily consisted of short-term, online, or classroom courses. DOD provided most of the exercise programs and all of the JPME programs. DOD and State provided the majority of interagency rotational programs and all of the leadership development programs that met our criteria. Although agencies could not provide participation data in every instance, the data obtained indicated that overall, interagency participation was lower in activities that required a longer time commitment, such as rotations and full-time joint professional military education. Analysis of the activities GAO identified showed that they are intended to provide opportunities to (1) build common foundational knowledge of the national security arena; (2) develop specific skills, such as how to plan, lead, and execute interagency efforts; and (3) establish networks among personnel from national security agencies that could lead to improved interagency collaboration. According to human capital and training officials at several agencies, the level of interagency participation may affect how a given professional development activity can improve its participants' ability to collaborate. GAO does not have any recommendations in this report.

As we have reported, because no single federal  agency has the ability to address these threats alone, agencies must work  together in a whole-of-government approach to protect our nation and its  interests. Our previous work has shown that there are a number of  barriers to agencies\u2019 collaboration in addressing these threats. One barrier  stems from gaps in the knowledge and skills national security  professionals need to work together across agency lines. Our work has  also shown that participation in interagency training and other  professional development activities may help bridge such gaps by  enhancing mutual trust and understanding among personnel from different  organizations. The 2010 National Security Strategy also underscores the  importance of professional development for improving interagency  collaboration, calling for adapting the education and training of national  security personnel to meet modern challenges.", "To help Congress better understand what actions agencies are taking to  bridge these gaps in personnel knowledge and skills, you asked us to  identify: (1) training and other professional development activities  intended to improve the abilities of personnel from key agencies involved  in national security issues to collaborate across organizational lines and  (2) how these activities were intended to improve participants\u2019  collaboration abilities.

We asked agency officials to submit information  on relevant professional development activities they hosted, as well as  activities their personnel attended at other agencies or training  institutions. By comparing these responses, we were able to identify and  include some relevant activities that host agencies did not submit. For  example, although officials at three agencies said their personnel  participated in the National Exercise Program, the two agencies chiefly  responsible for organizing the program did not initially include the  program in their responses. We followed up with human capital,  education, training, and program officials multiple times to reconcile such  differences, which may have occurred because agencies have different  working definitions of \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201ccollaboration,\u201d and  different ways of understanding how these concepts might intersect.", "Agencies submitted a number of activities that they said were important to  improving interagency collaboration in the national security arena that we  excluded from our analysis because they were not explicitly intended to  improve their participants\u2019 collaboration abilities and therefore did not fall  within the scope of this report. For example, several agencies submitted  information on collaborative work groups convened to address a  particular national security concern, such as the Treasury-led Committee  on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which brings together personnel from  multiple federal agencies to identify and address potential national  security risks posed by certain foreign investments. Several agencies also  submitted interagency assignments such as details, attach\u00e9s, and advisors  intended to support the agencies\u2019 missions, but the agencies did not  manage these positions as professional development opportunities, and as  such they lacked an explicitly developmental element intended to improve  participants\u2019 collaboration abilities beyond the specific assignment.", "More than 200 of the more than 350 activities that agencies submitted met  our criteria and we therefore included them in our inventory.

We determined these data to be reliable for the purposes of  identifying and describing developmental activities. We further assessed  the reliability of the participation data by interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials and determined these data to be sufficiently reliable to  report approximate participation levels for 2009.

Over the past decade, however, events  such as 9/11 and the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have  underscored the need for a broader and more integrated national security  effort. One of the first structural changes Congress made to address this  need was to integrate 22 separate agencies with domestic national security  responsibilities to create DHS. Today, greater emphasis is being placed on  identifying whole-of-government approaches to developing national  security policies and carrying out operations. Such an approach  emphasizes the contributions of agencies not traditionally associated with  national security. For example, Commerce plays a role in monitoring  exports of technology to make sure that sensitive items with military uses  do not fall into the hands of our enemies.", "In light of the challenges that the U.S. government continues to experience  in its efforts to coordinate the actions of the agencies involved\u2014whether it  be preventing a terrorist attack or overseeing reconstruction and  stabilization efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014there is an ongoing policy  debate on how to enhance and sustain interagency collaborative efforts.  Among the range of proposals for reform, there is a growing consensus  that the government\u2019s professional development efforts could contribute  to more effective interagency collaboration, which is seen as key to U.S.  national security. Specifically, a number of reports\u2014such as the Project  on National Security Reform\u2019s Forging a New Shield and the 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review, written by experts working in the national  security field\u2014recommended establishing a cadre of national security  specialists from all relevant departments and agencies, and placing them  in a long-term career development program designed to provide them with  a better understanding of the processes and cultures of other agencies.  Proponents contend that such a program would help the U.S. government  prepare personnel with national security responsibilities to plan, execute,  and lead national security missions. More recently, in September 2010,  Congressmen Ike Skelton and Geoff Davis introduced the Interagency  National Security Professional Education, Administration, and  Development Systems Act of 2010 which seeks to create a system to  educate, train, and develop interagency national security professionals  across the government.", "Agencies have historically defined their own professional development  activities for their national security personnel. In 2007, however, the Bush  Administration launched the National Security Professional Development  (NSPD) initiative to integrate professional development activities for  national security personnel as part of a larger effort to enhance  interagency collaboration. Executive Order 13434, May 17, 2007, entitled  National Security Professional Development, required the heads of all  agencies with national security responsibilities to identify or enhance  current professional development activities for their national security  personnel. In addition, the order established an Executive Steering  Committee composed of 15 agency Secretaries or Directors (or their  designees) to facilitate implementation of the National Strategy for  Professional Development. To coordinate NSPD-related activities among  agencies, the Executive Steering Committee established the NSPD  Integration Office, which created an online repository of information on  available training and other professional development activities for  national security professionals.", "Recently, two studies have been launched to reexamine NSPD and to take  a more comprehensive look at the skills, education, training, and  professional experiences that interagency national security professionals  need at various career stages. While awaiting the results of these studies,  the NSPD executive staff is reviewing issues related to the scope and  definition of national security professionals and revising the NSPD  strategy and implementation plan. Several agencies reported putting  implementation of their NSPD-related training and professional  development activities on hold pending the results of these reviews, or  other direction from the administration.

For example, the Ambassadorial Seminar offered by State\u2019s FSI only  prepares ambassadors-designate for their unique positions of leadership at  the head of an embassy, which requires extensive collaboration with  personnel from multiple agencies and other organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Training Provided as Part of Agencies\u2019 NSPD Programs", "paragraphs": ["Six of the eight agencies represented on the Executive Steering  Committee\u2014DOD, DHS, State, Justice, Commerce, and DOE\u2014reported  making NSPD-related training available to their personnel with national  security responsibilities.", "DOD and DHS reported developing some training specifically for their  NSPD programs, which consisted primarily of online courses on key  national security policies and procedures. Some agencies, however,  directed their national security personnel to take existing training, such as  EMI\u2019s various online courses on national emergency response topics.  Other agencies augmented existing training with NSPD-specific materials.  Several of the existing courses that agencies used or modified under the  auspices of NSPD were included in previous sections of this report.  Officials from Commerce and DOE reported that in addition to taking  advantage of existing courses, they also sent their personnel to attend in- person orientation sessions or seminars, where they had the opportunity  to network with personnel from other agencies.", "According to officials at most of these agencies, although they have  continued to work on planning and implementation efforts, much of the  actual training activity has slowed or stopped altogether since fiscal year  2008. As mentioned previously, many of these agencies have put  implementation of their NSPD-related training and professional  development activities on hold pending the results of executive-level  review of this governmentwide initiative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Professional Development Activities Provide Opportunities to Build Foundational Knowledge, Skills, and Networks That Are Intended to Improve Interagency Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis, the relevant professional development activities  were intended to improve the ability of national security personnel to  collaborate across agency lines by focusing on three general approaches:  providing foundational knowledge, developing skills, and providing  networking opportunities. We found that the activities included one or  more of these approaches to improving their participants\u2019 abilities to  collaborate:    Building common foundational knowledge of the national security  arena. Some of the activities establish a common foundation of shared  knowledge for understanding partner agencies\u2019 roles, responsibilities,  authorities or capabilities, or specific national security subject matters.  According to agency officials, such training can help reinforce a  common vocabulary or framework for understanding complex policy  issues. This is important for allowing personnel who may normally  approach national security issues from sometimes disparate  diplomatic, defense, commercial, or law enforcement perspectives to  employ a whole-of-government approach to national security. For  example, DHS offers an introductory online course on the National  Incident Management System, which is available to personnel across  federal, state, and local government and provides an overview of the  roles and responsibilities of various agencies and how they are  supposed to work together in different emergency situations such as  responding to terrorist attacks and other national security-related  incidents.", "Developing skills for interagency collaboration on national security.", "Some of the activities agencies identified build specific skills needed  for interagency collaboration, such as how to plan, lead, and execute  interagency efforts. For example, the Whole-of-Government Planning  for Reconstruction and Stabilization course, offered by NDU in  cooperation with State, teaches skills to coordinate, facilitate, or  participate in the planning process for reconstruction and stabilization  operations. These skills include the ability to work effectively with  federal agency and other partners involved in whole-of-government  planning.", "Establishing networks across national security agency lines. Some of  the activities were explicitly designed to facilitate networks among  personnel from two or more national security agencies. For example,  NDU\u2019s Capstone course for Generals, Flag Officers, and members of  the civilian Senior Executive Service brings together participants from  the four military services and a range of federal agencies to deepen  their understanding of the whole-of-government-approach to national  security, among other things. One of Capstone\u2019s learning objectives is  that participants establish a peer network for future cooperation and  the program is designed to maximize peer-to-peer interaction.", "The way these approaches manifest themselves in the activities we  reviewed varied. For example, activities that required the least time  commitment, such as EMI\u2019s online courses and NSPD online orientations,  primarily provided basic foundational knowledge of a specific partner  agency or national security topic. Conversely, more time-intensive  activities, such as JPME and some of the leadership development  programs and classroom courses that lasted several months or brought  participants together on a recurring basis tended to incorporate two or  more approaches to improving participants\u2019 abilities to collaborate across  agency lines. For example, a 10-month program at NDU\u2019s College of  International Security Affairs included coursework on foundational  knowledge of national security issues and specific skills related to  interagency planning and management, along with interagency networking  events.", "According to human capital and training officials we interviewed at  several agencies, the level of interagency participation may affect how a  given professional development activity can improve its participants\u2019  abilities to collaborate. Agency officials noted that interagency  collaboration in the development and design of activities can lead to a  more accurate portrayal of different agencies\u2019 policies and processes.  Moreover, agency officials said a mix of interagency participants can  provide a realistic perspective of their respective agencies\u2019 cultures,  capabilities, and constraints. Greater interagency participation can also  lead to the development of professional networks, and improve working  relationships. Several military officials we interviewed emphasized that in  order to work effectively side by side, civilian and military personnel  should train together to learn how operate before they are out in the field.  Several agency officials agreed, noting that even when a professional  development activity is designed to build foundational knowledge, skills,  or networks, lack of interagency participation can limit the extent to  which this occurs. For example, as a DHS official pointed out, if only one  agency participates in an exercise, there is clearly no opportunity to  establish a network that could facilitate future interagency collaboration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Training, interagency rotations, exercises, and other professional  development activities can help to improve participants\u2019 abilities to  collaborate in an increasingly complex national security arena. However,  with national security responsibilities and associated personnel located  throughout the U.S. government, it could be challenging for agency  officials to identify the relevant training and professional development  opportunities available to the national security community. Our review is a  first step in describing the broad spectrum of professional development  activities that are intended to build foundational knowledge, skills, and  networks among federal national security professionals. According to  agency officials who develop and oversee these professional development  activities, interagency participation can be key to the activities\u2019 success,  enhancing the knowledge and skills participants acquire and the  professional networks they establish. Although agencies could not provide  participation data in every instance, the data we were able to obtain  indicated that overall, interagency participation was lower in activities  that required a longer time commitment, such as rotations and full-time  joint professional military education. This raises questions about barriers  to participation and other factors that may influence the success of such  professional development activities, which we will explore in a subsequent  review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft report for review and comment to the Secretaries of  State, Defense, DHS, the Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, and Energy,  the Administrator of USAID, and the Attorney General.

We then selected key agencies  involved in national security issues\u2014the Department of Defense (DOD),  the Department of State (State), the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the  Department of Treasury (Treasury), the Department of Justice (Justice),  the Department of Energy (Energy), the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA), and the Department of Commerce (Commerce)\u2014based on a  review of our prior work and other literature and interviews with subject- matter experts. We excluded the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence and its member agencies because it overlapped with similar  work we have underway.", "In order to identify and obtain key information on national security  collaboration-related professional development activities, we undertook  extensive data collection efforts involving both formal data collection  instruments and intensive interactions with the agencies noted above.  There were two main phases to this effort. In each, several steps were  taken to ensure the reliability of the information obtained, including its  consistency, completeness, and accuracy.", "In the first phase, we developed a data collection instrument (DCI) to  obtain a broad list of activities potentially applicable to our review as well  as a number of key general characteristics of the activities including, for  example, overall goals, how the program prepares participants to  collaborate across department lines, agencies involved, and general  information about participation levels.", "We validated the DCI by conducting pretests of the instrument with points  of contact (POCs) in four agencies. These pretests included in-depth  probing on the clarity of instrument, the criteria for including activities in  the instrument, respondent burden, and usability of the instrument  spreadsheet. The GAO engagement team staff worked with their technical  advisors to revise the DCI as appropriate to address issues that arose over  these topics during the pretesting process.", "A key element of this first phase of data collection was defining the  criteria to guide agency POCs in determining the appropriate professional  development activities for submission. These criteria were included in the  instrument itself, with instructions to the POCs to include all programs  open to their staff that met all of the following four criteria:  (1) The activity explicitly prepares federal civilian and/or military  personnel to collaborate with personnel of other federal departments. In  particular, the activity: (a) can involve personnel of other entities\u2014such as  contractors or NGOs\u2014or can include only personnel from the POC\u2019s  department; (b) may be provided by the POC\u2019s department or it may be  provided by another organization; and (c) must prepare personnel for  interagency collaboration. POCs were not to include activities that  focused solely on intraagency collaboration (e.g., collaboration among  DHS component agencies or among other services within DOD). This  criterion excludes programs that bring personnel of multiple agencies  together for specific assignments but did not have preparation for future  interagency collaboration as an explicit purpose.  (2) The activity targets agency personnel involved in developing or  implementing national security policy, strategy, missions, or operations,  but not support functions such as administration, financial management,  or procurement.  (3) The activity relates to the agency\u2019s national security activities. In  particular, an activity can and should be included despite having a broader  focus than interagency national security collaboration as long as it  includes a component on this topic; for example, a leadership  development program may have a module on interagency collaboration or  provide an interagency rotation to a national security mission.  (4) The activity is ongoing and sustained, not a one-time event.", "We identified POCs in each of the selected agencies who were to  determine which activities met our criteria and complete the DCI for each.  We identified the POCs during our initial conference with agency  personnel and then in subsequent meetings or conversations, in which we  requested the names of individuals who could work with us to identify the  appropriate offices, bureaus, or functional areas that should receive our  questionnaire, disseminate our questionnaire to the appropriate contacts  throughout the agency, and consolidate their responses. We sent DCIs to  POCs and asked them to provide the requested information for all  activities that met our criteria. In addition to completing the DCIs, POCs  also provided other relevant information including course manuals and  evaluations.", "We then compiled all of the DCIs received from the nine agencies into one  master file. A key element of this effort was to eliminate from the master  list duplicate activities reported by POCs in multiple offices or agencies. In  general, we relied on submissions from the agency we determined to be  the \u201clead agency\u201d for administering the activity. In some cases, however,  an activity was identified by an agency that participated in, but did not  provide, the activity. For example, although officials at three agencies said  their personnel participated in the National Exercise Program, the two  agencies chiefly responsible for organizing the program did not initially  include the program in their responses. To reconcile such differences,  which may have occurred because agencies have different working  definitions of \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201ccollaboration,\u201d and different ways of  understanding how these concepts might intersect, we followed up with  our POCs. In some cases, the titles of activities were similar but not  identical and to determine whether they were the same we contacted the  relevant POCs for clarification. This process resulted in more than 350  total activities.", "The final step in phase 1 of our work was to review the entire list of  activities identified to verify that they conformed to our four criteria. To  make this assessment and to ensure its reliability, two analysts separately  analyzed the list, identifying those activities that conformed and did not  conform to our criteria. In cases where the analysts differed they had a  third analyst review the information and then met to reconcile these  differences. In cases where the data provided were ambiguous we  contacted our agency POCs to obtain additional information in the form of  additional interviews and/or documentation. This process reduced the  number of activities in our review to 225.", "In the second phase, we collected more detailed information on the  activities that met our criteria for inclusion, as follows:  (1) The number of participants in each activity in fiscal year 2009, both  from the agency that hosted the activity and from outside the agency;  (2) The levels or ranks of staff targeted for participation in the activity, if  any. Agencies described target populations in terms of General Schedule  (GS) levels, Foreign Service (FS) levels, and/or Officer grade (O) levels. At  the executive level, target populations were described as Senior Executive  Service (SES), Senior Foreign Service (SFS) , Senior-Level and Scientific  or Professional (SL/ST), or Generals/Flag Officers (O-7\u2013O-10). In some  cases, the equivalent levels from other federal pay schedules or personnel  systems were noted; and  (3) The methods of evaluation the agency might use to evaluate the  effectiveness or impact of the activity.", "A second DCI was developed for this purpose. For each POC, we  customized this data collection instrument with information about  activities they had reported to us in phase 1. Like the first phase of data  collection, this second phase involved close interaction with the POCs,  and in some instances POCs provided information to us in forms other  than the data collection instrument (e.g., published program materials, or  e-mails containing the information we requested). Data collected during  this phase were compiled and combined with data from the first phase to  yield an overall set of data on activities that met our criteria for inclusion.  We analyzed data for these activities, such as typical duration, eligibility  criteria, participation rates, and participating agencies, to identify groups  of activities, patterns, themes and other information. We determined these  data to be reliable for the purposes of identifying and describing such  activities.", "Upon reviewing the data the agencies provided, we found that activities  varied widely across dimensions such as length and learning mode, and  decided to group the activities in a way that would allow us to analyze  their characteristics and make appropriate comparisons. To develop these  categories of training and professional development activities, we  reviewed activity data, conducted a limited literature search of GAO  reports and agency guidance, and met with human resource professionals.  These five general groups included training courses and programs, training  exercises, interagency rotational programs, Joint Professional Military  Education, and leadership development programs.", "After the data had been compiled, we conducted a series of follow-up  interviews with POCs to gauge the completeness and accuracy of the  participation data we had received. POCs were asked about the sources of  counts of participants, how these counts had been stored, whether they  had been checked for accuracy, and other topics relevant to verifying the  reliability of these data. All of the participation data used in the present  report were judged reliable for the purpose of establishing approximate  levels of participation in the national security collaboration activities.", "As part of the data collection instrument used in phase I, we asked agency  officials to describe how each activity they submitted was intended to  improve the ability of national security personnel to collaborate across  agency lines. We reviewed the answers they provided as well as other  materials such as course descriptions and catalogues of exercises and  JPME programs to identify common themes. Based on our analysis, we  determined that these activities generally employed one or more of the  following approaches: building foundational knowledge of the national  security arena such as other agencies\u2019 roles, responsibilities, authorities or  capabilities; developing skills for interagency collaboration, such as how  to plan, lead, and execute interagency efforts; or establishing networks  among national security professionals.
