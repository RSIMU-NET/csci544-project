NGA\u2019s AOA body of work also identified  physical requirements for the new NGA West campus, for example, that  the new facility must have at least 800,000 gross square feet and a 500- foot security buffer, and it must allow for a possible expansion in the  future.", "However, although the NGA AOA body of work demonstrated a thorough  comparison of the alternatives throughout the site evaluation process, it  did not provide evidence that net present value was used to compare or  differentiate among the alternatives, nor did it provide a rationale for why  net present value could not be used. NGA officials acknowledged that  they did not compare the alternatives using net present value. They  stated that they had normalized some of the costs but that it was not  necessary to normalize all costs, because the estimates were all done  during the same time period. According to our best practice, if net present  value is not used to compare the alternatives, then the AOA team should  document the reason why and explain and describe the other methods  applied. Additionally, comparing items that have been discounted or  normalized with net present value allows for time series comparisons,  since alternatives may have different life cycles or different costs and  benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Site Selection Process Only Partially Met the Characteristic for a Credible AOA Because It Lacked Important Information on Cost Risks and Sensitivities", "paragraphs": ["NGA\u2019s AOA process for selecting the site for the new NGA West campus  partially met the credible characteristic for an agency\u2019s AOA process.  Although NGA\u2019s AOA process had strengths, it also had limitations, such  as lacking important information related to cost risks and sensitivity  analyses for both cost and benefits identified.", "NGA\u2019s AOA body of work described the alternatives in sufficient detail to  allow for robust analysis. Specifically, it provided descriptions of each of  the alternatives at varying levels of detail. For example, the first site  location study provided descriptions of the top 6 potential sites, including  information on size, the sites\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, and any  acquisition or development issues. The NGA AOA body of work also  provided evidence that site master planning was conducted to provide  additional details on the physical and environmental attributes of each  site, as well as constraints and benefits. For example, the NGA West  Prospective Sites Master Plan described the Mehlville site as having  landscape features such as mature trees, waterways, areas of steep  topography, options for public transportation, bike-friendly streets, and  existing utility infrastructure.", "However, NGA did not fully include key information on either the risk or  the uncertainty related to cost estimates or the sensitivity to the costs and  benefits identified as part of its AOA process. For example, the NGA body  of work did not include a confidence interval or range for the cost  estimates for each viable alternative in order to document the level of risk  associated with the estimate. NGA\u2019s AOA body of work documented the  estimated alternatives\u2019 initial costs and included contingency costs across  all four alternatives. Corps of Engineers officials told us that they had  developed a 30 percent design and 5 percent construction contingency  cost factor across the four alternatives to account for cost risks in those  areas. However, the NGA AOA body of work did not provide evidence of  a confidence interval or range for the costs provided. NGA acknowledged  that while its AOA body of work did not identify the risk associated with  specific cost elements for each alternative, it did provide a \u201clevel of  confidence,\u201d because the methodology behind the cost components in the  estimate implied a high level of confidence. Although we agree that NGA  did provide a contingency factor for the site development costs and  provided cost estimates for all four viable alternatives, NGA did not  develop a confidence interval or risk range for those estimates. NGA\u2019s  cost estimates were used as a determining factor in the final decision  among the four alternatives. However, without understanding the cost risk  and the uncertainty of those costs as outlined in the best practice, a  decision maker might be unable to make an informed decision.", "Additionally, the NGA AOA body of work did not demonstrate that NGA  had conducted a sensitivity analysis for the cost and benefit and  effectiveness estimates for each alternative in order to examine how  changes in key assumptions would affect the cost and benefit estimates.  The NGA AOA body of work documented that some sensitivity analysis or  level of risk was analyzed as part of the schedule analysis, and NGA  officials stated that the project considered how different values and  variables affect each other during the criteria and evaluation analysis.  However, the NGA AOA body of work did not document the sensitivity of  cost and benefit estimates to changes in key assumptions for each  alternative, and a sensitivity analysis was not applied to the initial cost  estimates or benefit assumptions that were used to make the final site  selection.", "NGA officials stated that this best practice has limited application to its  AOA process, because the lack of variables between sites constrained  their ability to develop full life-cycle cost estimates and complete a  sensitivity analysis. NGA officials stated that their sensitivity analysis was  limited to those considerations that were measurable and sensitive to  change\u2014predominantly schedule risk associated with land acquisition  activities. Further, NGA officials explained that because all the site  alternatives were located within the St. Louis metropolitan area, any  variations in conditions would have equal effect. Although we agree that  NGA did conduct a sensitivity analysis for schedule risks, NGA neither  documented how the schedule sensitivity affected its cost or benefit  estimates nor performed a sensitivity analysis for the various assumptions  used to develop the cost or benefit for each alternative. According to the  DOD instruction on economic analysis, a sensitivity analysis is a \u201cwhat-if\u201d  exercise that should be performed to test the conclusions and  assumptions of changes in cost and benefit variables and should always  be performed when the results of the economic analysis do not clearly  favor any one alternative. According to our best practice, not  conducting a sensitivity analysis to identify the uncertainties associated  with different assumptions increases the chances that an AOA team will  recommend an alternative without understanding the full effects of costs,  which could lead to cost and schedule overruns.", "Although NGA\u2019s AOA process did not reflect all of the characteristics of a  high-quality process, we are not making recommendations in this report,  in part because NGA plans to conduct additional cost analysis and in part  because we made an applicable recommendation to DOD in 2016.  Specifically, although NGA\u2019s AOA process is complete, NGA and Corps  of Engineers officials said that they are developing full life-cycle cost  estimates for the construction and design of the new NGA West campus  and that these estimates will include many elements from our best  practices. Further, we continue to believe that our September 2016  recommendation that DOD develop guidance requiring the use of AOA  best practices for certain military construction decisions could help ensure  that future AOA processes conducted by DOD agencies like NGA are  reliable and that agencies identify a preferred alternative that best meets  mission needs. While DOD did not concur with our recommendation, as  we reported in 2016, our best practices are based on longstanding,  fundamental tenets of sound decision making and economic analysis.  Additionally, our best practices align with many DOD and military policies,  directives, and other guidance pertaining to military construction. Further,  during this review NGA officials stated that DOD did not have a set of  best practices for conducting an AOA to help NGA make decisions  regarding its military construction project, and that our AOA best practices  would have been helpful had they been published prior to the start of  NGA\u2019s site selection process in 2012. Accordingly, we continue to believe  our prior recommendation is relevant and that unless DOD has guidance  directing that certain military construction AOA processes be conducted in  accordance with identified best practices, it may not be providing  Congress with complete information to inform its oversight of DOD\u2019s  future military construction decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report of this report to NGA for review and  comment. NGA\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II.", "In comments on our report, NGA stated that it valued our assessment of  its AOA process, which we judged to have substantially met the  characteristics of a well-documented, comprehensive, and unbiased  process, and would use our findings to continue to refine and improve its  corporate decision making and processes.", "NGA raised a concern about our assessment that its AOA process used  to select the site for its new NGA West project partially met the best  practices that demonstrate a credible process. NGA\u2019s specific concern  was that we concluded that the AOA process did not fully include  information on risks and sensitivities to cost estimates. In its letter, NGA  stated that its analysis demonstrated that cost was a factor but not the  most important factor. Moreover, NGA stated that cost elements and  details ranged from well-defined costs, such as real estate costs, to  estimates based on analogy such as an information technology trunk line.  NGA additionally stated that, due to the conceptual nature of the design  of the facility at that time, more detailed cost analysis was judged to  provide no discrimination among alternatives and were thus purposely  excluded from the initial cost estimates that were used in the AOA  process. While NGA may have concluded that the project\u2019s cost was not  the most important factor, the agency estimates that construction of the  campus will cost about $945 million and NGA used the cost estimate as a  determining factor to select from the four final alternatives.  Moreover, our  assessment of the credibility characteristic is based only in part on NGA\u2019s  initial cost estimates and did not penalize NGA for excluding additional  cost estimates. Rather, we assessed that NGA\u2019s AOA body of work did  not provide evidence of documenting the sensitivity of the cost-benefit or  effectiveness estimates to changes in key assumptions for alternatives,  nor was a sensitivity or risk analysis applied to the initial cost estimates  used to make the final site selection.", "NGA also stated in its letter that our AOA best practices are not  applicable in all circumstances, and pointed out that DOD did not concur  with a recommendation in a prior report to develop AOA guidance  requiring departmental components to use AOA practices, including the  best practices we identified, for certain future military construction  projects. Our prior report suggested that such guidance might only apply  to certain military construction projects as determined by DOD. In  addition, while DOD\u2019s existing relevant guidance does not require use of  our AOA best practices, the guidance does not prohibit it either. Further,  as discussed in our report, NGA officials told us the AOA best practices  are helpful to such processes, and lacking such DOD guidance NGA had  to draw on expertise, practices, and procedures from a variety of sources  to conduct its AOA for the new NGA West site.", "Finally, in its letter NGA proposed that two documents\u2014the  environmental impact statement and record of decision\u2014fulfill the best  practice to document the AOA process in a single document. Specifically,  NGA stated that within the context of the environmental impact statement  process, the record of decision is the authoritative capstone document of  the process, and that together the two documents include discussions of  the decision-making and factors considered by the director in selecting  the agency-preferred alternative. These two documents were prepared to  fulfill requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in  order to determine the environmental impacts of the project, as discussed  earlier in our report. While we recognize that the record of decision and  the environmental impact statement are significant documents that  include summaries of aspects of NGA\u2019s AOA process, as NGA indicated  these are two documents within an expansive AOA body of work. Further,  many of the elements of NGA\u2019s AOA process are diffused throughout  these and several other reports and documents\u2014that were specifically  identified by NGA as the key documentation of its AOA process\u2014rather  than clearly delineated in a single document as prescribed by the best  practice (see appendix I).", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
