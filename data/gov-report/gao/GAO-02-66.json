Aliens apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for such benefits as naturalization, work authorization, and adjustment of status. Immigration benefit fraud involves attempts by aliens to obtain such benefits through illegal means (e.g., using fraudulent documents). INS officials believe that the problem is pervasive and serious; they also believe that some aliens are using the benefit application process to enable them to carry out illegal activities, such as crimes of violence, narcotics trafficking, and terrorism. In its fiscal year 2000 Threat Assessment, INS predicted that immigration benefit fraud would intensify as smugglers and criminal enterprises searched for other methods to bring illegal aliens into the United States. Recently, proposals have been offered that would separate INS functions into enforcement and service components. Regardless of how INS is restructured, addressing the issues discussed in this report would require that enforcement and service delivery priorities be recognized.", "At your request, we reviewed available information on the nature and extent of immigration benefit fraud and assessed INS\u2019s efforts to address it. Specifically, this report addresses the following questions: (1) What does INS know about the nature and extent of immigration benefit fraud? (2) How do INS\u2019s policies, procedures, and information systems support its immigration benefit fraud investigations? (3) How does INS address its dual responsibility of timely application processing and the detection and deterrence of fraudulent applications? and (4) What performance measures does INS have in place to gauge the results of its benefit fraud enforcement activities?", "To address the objectives of our review, we reviewed relevant reports, laws, and regulations. In addition, we interviewed INS officials at headquarters, three regional offices, five district offices, and four service centers. We chose these locations because they represent a wide cross section of the country and because they handled approximately 85 percent of all applications received by INS in fiscal year 2000. Specifically, to address the first three questions, we interviewed INS officials in headquarters, regions, district offices, and service centers and we obtained and reviewed pertinent reports and documents. To address the fourth question, we obtained and reviewed Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requirements and INS performance reports and we obtained and analyzed INS prosecution and investigation data for fiscal years 1998 through 2000. See appendix I for a more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology.", "We performed our work from November 2000 through August 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Some ineligible applicants attempt to obtain immigration benefits through fraudulent means.", "Immigration fraud falls into two broad categories\u2014benefit application fraud and document fraud. Benefit application fraud involves the willful misrepresentation of a material fact to gain an immigration benefit in the absence of lawful entitlement. Benefit application fraud includes immigration benefit fraud schemes such as marriage fraud, in which an ineligible alien makes a false claim to a bona fide marriage with an eligible petitioner in order to obtain immigration benefits, and occupational preference fraud, in which businesses in the United States claim falsely that aliens are needed for employment because of their education, technical knowledge, or experience and that such people are not available in the U.S. workforce. Benefit application fraud also includes nonimmigrant visa fraud. Document fraud encompasses the counterfeiting, sale, or use of documents, such as birth certificates, passports, or visas, to circumvent U.S. immigration laws and may be a part of some benefit application fraud cases. According to INS, both are often part of larger alien smuggling efforts.", "INS processes alien applications and petitions for benefits (e.g., naturalization, employment authorization, adjustment of status) through a network of field offices. INS\u2019s four service centers, located in California, Nebraska, Texas, and Vermont, process 35 types of applications, including petitions for permanent and temporary workers, petitions for admission of spouses, and applications for employment-based adjustment of status to permanent residence. The service centers were established to handle the applications and petitions for benefits submitted for processing by mail. About 68 percent of all immigration applications and petitions are filed at the four service centers. INS\u2019s 33 district offices process 42 types of applications. Most of these applications require interviews with the applicant or verification of an applicant\u2019s identity. District offices process naturalization applications and petitions for alien relatives and family- based adjustment of status applications, among other types of applications.", "Detecting and preventing immigration benefit fraud in applications involves different INS units\u20143 regional offices, 4 service centers, 33 district offices, and INS\u2019s Forensic Document Laboratory. In fiscal year 2000, INS expended about $2.8 billion on enforcement activities. About $26 million, or 1 percent of enforcement program funds, were expended for fraud detection and prevention activities, including benefit application fraud. Funding has remained basically the same from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2000. For fiscal year 2001, INS received an additional $7.5 million for investigative and analyst positions for antifraud investigations associated with fraudulent business-related visa applications and with marriage fraud.", "Both the service center operations units and district office investigative units may open possible benefit fraud cases on the basis of information that they receive from adjudication officers; from other INS components, including Investigations, Inspections, and Intelligence; from INS regional offices, the public, including informants; and from other federal and local law enforcement agencies. The adjudication staff in each of the units may also detect fraud because of their responsibility for ensuring quality in the application adjudication process.", "INS\u2019s operations units attempt to detect benefit fraud through database checks for misrepresentations of information (e.g., nonexistent addresses) on applications and other analysis. These units also try to identify trends and patterns that may indicate fraud, such as increases in the number of requests for certain types of cards, for example, applications for replacement of alien registration cards (green cards). However, once immigration benefit fraud is suspected, the matter is generally referred to district offices for investigation. The service center may continue to provide support for field investigations and prosecutions.", "In fiscal year 2000, INS\u2019s district investigative units opened approximately 4,000 cases involving fraud, almost half of which involved marriage fraud.For this same period, the units completed about 3,700 fraud cases.Adverse actions, such as a conviction or removal, were taken in almost half of those cases. Of the 483 defendants prosecuted for fraud, 259 were convicted. Comparable data are not kept on the number of cases or on analyses done at the service centers.", "Federal statutes provide for a range of criminal charges against persons and entities for violations of immigration laws. INS officials indicated that fraud cases are time consuming, resource intensive, complex, and difficult to prove. U.S. attorneys accept fraud cases under established prosecutorial priorities and resource availability. The priority placed on the prosecution of such cases varies among the 94 U.S. attorney offices around the country. Statutes also provide penalties and other sanctions for civil document fraud.

Of the five priority areas outlined in the strategy, benefit fraud ranks fourth nationally. The priorities are to (1) identify and remove criminal aliens; (2) deter, dismantle, and diminish smuggling of aliens; (3) respond to community reports and complaints about illegal aliens; (4) minimize immigration benefit fraud and document abuse; and (5) block and remove employers\u2019 access to unauthorized workers. The strategy allows district offices some flexibility in prioritizing their resources, and some offices may make fraud a higher priority. Nationally, however, it remains fourth.", "According to INS, the investigation of immigration fraud has long been an enforcement mandate of INS\u2019s Investigations Division.

For fiscal years 1998 through 2000, about 11 percent of investigative workyears was directed for fraud investigations. According to INS officials, these workyears underestimate the time spent on benefit fraud investigations. This is because immigration benefit fraud may be uncovered during the course of another type of investigation and the time spent is recorded in the other investigation category. For example, antifraud activities that are conducted under the auspices of the Anti-Smuggling, Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, and Organized Crime units are not included in the amount of funds expended in antifraud efforts. However, INS does not have data to show the nature and extent of its efforts to investigate immigration benefit fraud in connection with its other activities.", "Additionally, few resources are devoted to the service center operations units that have responsibility for gathering information to help detect and deter fraud. The service centers received about 4 million applications in fiscal year 2000, and the four operations units that perform analysis for fraud detection had about 40 positions.", "INS\u2019s forensic document laboratory provides document analysis for field investigations and is a significant resource for fraud investigations.

INS reported that one of the more prolific schemes seen in recent years is the abuse of various nonimmigrant visa (e.g., tourist visa) provisions that can lead to permanent residency and ultimately to naturalization.", "In May 1999, the Acting Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for the Immigration Services Division testified that immigration benefit fraud had increased in both scope and complexity in recent years and that exploitation of the benefit petition process by criminals and criminal organizations had generated serious concerns. He stated that criminal aliens and terrorists manipulate the benefit application process to facilitate expansion of their illegal activities, such as crimes of violence, narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and entitlement fraud.", "In 1998 and 1999, INS referred petitions to the Department of State consular post in Chennai, India, because of suspected applicant fraud. State found that about 45 percent of claims made on the 3,247 petitions referred through March 31, 1999, were of questionable validity, and 21 percent of the work experience claims made to INS were confirmed to be fraudulent.", "In recent reports on INS programs, we reported vulnerabilities in both the H-1B and Religious Worker Visa Programs. These vulnerabilities include abuse by employers in the H-1B program who falsely requested and certified the need for foreign workers and abuse by some religious organizations that existed solely as a means to carry out immigration fraud in the Religious Worker Program.", "INS\u2019s California Service Center found, through a series of investigations and analyses, widespread L-1A visa fraud by foreign companies, particularly in the Los Angeles area, and also identified this fraud as a growing problem. In one phase of the study, the service center reviewed a targeted group of 5,000 petitions that were identified as fitting a particular set of criteria. About 90 percent of these targeted petitions were identified as fraudulent. INS pointed out that these results do not represent an analysis of the percentage of fraud in the L- 1 petition filings because the results were not obtained through a random sampling of cases. An official in the operations branch stated that follow-up analysis of about 1,500 petitions found only one petition that was not fraudulent.", "According to the September 30, 1999, PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 final draft report on immigration benefits reengineering of selected INS field staff\u2019s perception of the nature and extent of fraud, INS\u2019s officers believed that immigration benefit fraud in INS programs was significant. The report also recognized that INS lacked a servicewide fraud detection and deterrence strategy.", "INS officials working on benefit fraud issues in the offices we visited indicated that fraud is a major problem. For example, fraud unit officials in the Los Angeles District Office said that immigration benefit fraud is rampant across the country. A Miami fraud unit official stated that fraud is out of control. A Nebraska Service Center official told us that fraud is probably involved in about 20 to 30 percent of all applications filed.", "The size and complexity of INS criminal cases and the number of aliens involved also gives insight into the extent of benefit fraud. According to an INS executive associate commissioner, in addition to the wide range of INS programs affected, the sheer volume of fraudulent applications relating to a single benefit scheme can be enormous and the structure of the criminal conspiracy can be complex. For example, in one case, an immigration consulting business filed 22,000 applications for aliens to qualify under the extended legalization program. Nearly 5,500 of the aliens\u2019 claims were fraudulent and 4,400 were suspected of being fraudulent. As a result of the investigation, 54 individuals perpetrating this fraud were successfully prosecuted. The government estimated that these individuals were paid over $9 million in fees for filing the fraudulent applications.", "INS is only now attempting to quantify the scope and extent of the immigration benefit fraud problem. In March 2000, INS began an assessment effort to determine the extent of fraud in the H-1B Nonimmigrant Worker program. This pilot project is INS\u2019s first attempt to identify the type and amount of fraud in one major program.

To address benefit fraud, INS relies on the district office investigative units and the service center operations units. However, the interior enforcement strategy, which seeks a cohesive approach to the problem, recognizes the importance of the service centers in benefit fraud detection and deterrence but has not integrated their operations units into the strategy. The strategy does not provide direction on how these units should systematically work together, and as a result, cooperation and communication are informal and minimal. Therefore, INS cannot be assured that its approach is indeed cohesive and that units are working together effectively to identify and investigate large-scale cases. Further, INS has not established guidance for opening immigration benefit fraud investigations or for prioritizing investigative leads. INS also lacks an agencywide case management capability that would allow for the monitoring of its efforts and that would help the agency avoid duplicate investigations. INS has a case tracking system for another investigative activity, which it expects to adopt for agencywide use once security and staff support issues are resolved. Last, existing system limitations do not allow for a great deal of information sharing among units and may hamper efforts to identify fraud schemes and trends.", "In our prior reports, we reported that INS lacked an enterprise architecture to efficiently and effectively manage its information technology efforts, as well as defined and disciplined processes to select, control, and evaluate its information technology investments.Accordingly, we have recommended that INS develop and implement an enterprise architecture and disciplined information technology investment management processes.

Through the strategy, INS seeks to deter illegal migration; prevent immigration-related crimes, including immigration benefit fraud; and remove individuals, especially criminals, who are unlawfully present in the United States, to preserve the integrity of the legal immigration system. The interior enforcement strategy, however, does not address how the district offices and service centers, which are under different organization leaderships, are to coordinate their immigration benefit fraud investigation efforts. Moreover, INS does not have an enterprise architecture that would provide this missing information on how these units are to coordinate, as well as what information is to be shared, when it is to be shared, with whom it is to be shared, etc. Agents within district offices and suboffices work under the purview of the district directors, who report to their respective regional director and then to the executive associate commissioner for field operations.

According to a service center official, the four service center operations units are unique and do not fit in either Enforcement or ISD as those units are currently organized. He believes that the operations units are the bridges between the two programs and that both programs depend on those units to identify immigration benefit fraud.

A Miami District Office official acknowledged that his office had few dealings with the Texas Service Center, where as an investigator in the Dallas District Office indicated that he regularly investigated leads for the service center because he had a relationship with staff there. In general, there is no established protocol for linking work done by the operations units so that they can assist one another with investigations or for analysts in the service centers to relay information about uncovered patterns and schemes to district offices for use in investigations. More important, the lack of common procedures means there is no assurance that the most significant, high-priority fraud cases are being investigated. This can contribute to inconsistent program implementation and an ineffective use of resources for benefit fraud detection. Whether or not the district office investigates a case developed by a service center can depend on the relationship between the two units and on available resources.", "The offices have engaged in some successful collaborative efforts. For example, the San Diego District Office investigative unit initiated an investigation on the basis of information provided by the California Service Center. This case involved an individual suspected of filing fraudulent family-unity documents for 31 applicants. The U.S. attorney subsequently prosecuted the case. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to 12 months and 1 day in prison and was subsequently removed from the country. Relationships between the units and staff availability are the factors to which service center officials attribute the success or, in other instances, the lack of success in getting cases from the service center investigated by agents in the local district office. As a result, although the operations units work with Enforcement on some cases, they do not routinely share information or collaborate with Enforcement to investigate immigration benefit fraud. The strategy is silent on the need for district offices\u2019 investigative units and the service center operations units to coordinate their immigration benefit fraud investigations. Further, the strategy does not provide direction or guidance on how the operations units are to coordinate and work with Enforcement.", "In its technical comments, INS identified two fraud-related proposals that have not been implemented.

At the California Service Center, the officers stated that they are overwhelmed with cases. One intelligence officer at the service center stated that he is handling approximately 250 cases. According to an official at another service center, the unit does not have anything in writing about their roles and responsibilities. Rather, he stated that because they are so understaffed, their priorities change frequently and that they use their own judgment in responding to what appears to be the most pressing demand, which may or may not be the most compelling issue to investigate. According to a Miami District Office official, during the month of January 2001 its investigative unit received 205 leads, of which 84 were facilitator cases (e.g., cases involving individuals or entities who prepare fraudulent benefit applications or who arrange marriages for a fee for the purpose of fraudulently enabling an alien to remain in the United States) and 121 were single-issue cases, which usually involve one applicant. The district office was able to investigate only four of the facilitator cases and none of the single-issue cases. A Los Angeles District Office fraud unit investigative official told us that it receives approximately 200 leads per month, but because of resource limitations, very few of the leads are investigated. Chicago officials informed us that they had a backlog of approximately 300 marriage fraud cases. They used their own discretion in deciding which immigration benefit fraud leads to investigate and, as a result, may have selected lower-priority cases.", "The INS headquarters\u2019 Investigations Division directs only a few cases at the national level. District offices generally decide which benefit fraud cases to open and pursue with the Office of the U.S. Attorney in their jurisdiction. Investigators in the district offices and in the service centers told us that they use their own judgment, with a supervisor\u2019s concurrence, in deciding which cases to work. During fiscal year 2000, 55 percent of district office benefit fraud investigative resources were directed toward single-issue cases. The remaining resources were directed to larger-scale cases\u2014about 30 percent to facilitator cases and 15 percent to organizations.", "Service center officials indicated that it is often not possible to get the district offices to take their cases. For example, the California Service Center has not been able to get a district office to undertake an investigation of a suspected preparer of about 500 possibly fraudulent family-unity applications, seemingly the type of large-scale cases that should be investigated. The service center presented the case to a district office investigative unit that turned it down, saying that the unit did not have the time and the case was not a priority for them. A suboffice of the same district office was subsequently approached by the service center staff to undertake this investigation, but the suboffice also declined, citing limited resources. At the time of our review, however, the suboffice was reconsidering opening an investigation, and in September 2001 the suboffice assigned a special agent to handle the case.

After a month, it is uploaded to a central system and is available to adjudication officers in all centers, but it can be accessed only through a complicated, time-consuming process.

At the time this happened, the California Service Center was pilot testing a system (see discussion below) that might have identified the individual as a terrorist, which could have prevented him from getting legal status. After this incident, INS planned to expand the California pilot project to the other service centers in an effort to prevent aliens from getting illegal benefits. The official said that although the linkage of information systems will not stop applicants from filing multiple applications at different service centers, it should prevent them from receiving immigration benefits that they are seeking illegally.", "Management officials on both the benefit and enforcement sides of INS acknowledged various system problems, including limited data availability and independent systems. According to the deputy executive associate commissioner for ISD, INS is committed to system changes. According to another INS official, for over a year ISD\u2019s efforts to move toward electronic filing and the modernization of Computer Linked Application Information Management Systems 3 and 4 have been on hold.  The deputy executive associate commissioner said that this is because our August 2000 report stated that INS should not make any technology investments until it develops an enterprise architecture plan. In addition, ISD decided more than a year ago to develop a strategic business plan, followed by an information technology plan to support the business plan. The business plan is complete and under review by the commissioner. The final draft of the information technology plan was completed in November 2001 and is currently under review by ISD. The official added that the enterprise architecture plan is not scheduled to be completed this fiscal year but that any proposed investments must be reviewed to ensure compliance within the parameters established. ISD is to commence work on both the business plan and the plan to relate information technology in the second quarter of fiscal year 2002.

One such major effort to provide data to help adjudicators make more accurate decisions was recently demonstrated by the California Service Center. In October 1996, the California Service Center submitted a formal request to the U.S. Customs Service (Customs) to pilot test a TECS/Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS) interface project. Customs subsequently approved the California Service Center\u2019s request, and the pilot began in April 1997. The initial goal of the project was to use information available through TECS/IBIS (and not available in INS systems) about people who may have been trying to illegally obtain immigration benefits. The service center\u2019s daily receipts of applications and petitions for immigration benefits were checked against the TECS/IBIS system, which contained historical databases for INS and other agencies, to determine whether the applicant was already in the system and, if so, their current immigration status. The results were summarized monthly for the period April 1997 through August 2000. For this 41-month period, about 2.9 million records were checked against TECS/IBIS and 43,656 individuals were identified as potentially attempting to defraud the INS benefits adjudicative process.", "Although less than 2 percent of the records were shown by the test to contain potential adverse information, some of the applicants did have criminal backgrounds. Some applicants were currently under investigation by other agencies, were aggravated felons (aliens who had committed a crime for which they could be removed), had previously been deported, were considered serious violators of U.S. laws, or had previously been denied asylum in the United States.", "The individuals who were identified as having submitted potential adverse information were seeking immigration benefits from 34 different INS programs. The highest number of individuals who were identified with potential adverse information had applied for replacement of alien registration cards. California Service Center officials told us that aggravated felons and individuals with misdemeanor convictions and warrants are among those making requests for replacement of alien registration cards. At the time of our fieldwork, the California Service Center had reviewed data on 13,559 aliens who had been identified as potentially trying to obtain immigration benefits through fraudulent means. Our review of the data showed that of the 7,599 cases that had been adjudicated, 5,997 cases were approved (the immigration benefits requested were granted), 593 cases were denied, 913 cases were referred to other INS offices for resolution, and 96 cases were handled in several other ways, such as revocation of approved benefits. Adjudication of the remaining 5,960 cases was still pending.", "INS officials, including the deputy executive associate commissioner for ISD, considered the project a success. An INS official told us that the TECS/IBIS pilot proved to be an unobtrusive and efficient means of identifying individuals who were attempting to defraud INS\u2019s benefits adjudication process. The project positively identified hundreds of individuals who had been officially removed from the United States, including individuals classified as aggravated felons, who   were attempting to fraudulently obtain newly issued INS immigrant   were subject to removal owing to prior criminal records and had escaped earlier detection by INS enforcement personnel.", "Although INS had determined that the results of the project were significant and had planned to implement the project in district offices and service centers nationwide, the timeframe for implementation had not been finalized before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. After September 11, an INS official told us that the attorney general is requiring TECS/IBIS checks to be done on all applications and petitions that are submitted to the service centers and the district offices for all 34 INS benefit programs within the next 6 months. This requirement is much more extensive than INS\u2019s initial plan to conduct TECS/IBIS checks on four of the programs at the service centers. The INS official told us that the software is already in place at the service centers to use TECS/IBIS to check the records of the principal applicants but that the system will not provide any help in checking records of dependents, such as the spouse and children of principal applicants. These checks will need to be completed manually and at significant cost.

The agency has been criticized by Congress, the media, and immigration advocacy groups for its inability to provide applicants with timely benefits owing to the backlog of applications. As new legislation calls for the processing of additional applications, some in shorter timeframes, INS will continue to struggle with this issue. These pressures to adjudicate cases quickly are significant because INS must also ensure that the quality of adjudication is reasonably considered to prevent those who are ineligible from receiving benefits. Unless INS can devote additional resources to processing applications, its efforts to expedite application processing will mean that the quality of adjudication will most likely be sacrificed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Application Backlog Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["A large application backlog and an increased number of applications contribute to long delays in processing applications for immigration benefits. The added pressure from applicants whose lives are disrupted by those delays has prompted lawsuits against INS. Pressure to expedite the process can lead to less thorough application review and errors and make it less likely that benefit fraud will be detected. INS\u2019s total application backlog (i.e., pending applications) increased from about 1 million in fiscal year 1994 to almost 4 million in fiscal years 1998 through 2000. In fiscal year 2000, INS received over 6 million applications, nearly 50 percent more applications than in fiscal year 1994. INS\u2019s efforts to meet production goals for processing naturalization applications helped reduce the backlog in that area, but backlogs for other application types then increased. INS has established monthly goals and accountability for field offices for some types of applications.", "An INS official pointed out that although INS backlogs have increased since 1994, it has completed more applications than it received during fiscal year 2000\u20146,058,447 applications were received and 6,487,470 applications were completed. He added that data for fiscal year 2001 are not yet available, but INS anticipates that the data will show significant increases in receipts owing to the passage of the Legal Immigration and Family Equity Act. In addition, INS increased its completions over fiscal year 2000, despite the fact that it did not receive funding for the related casework until six weeks prior to the end of the fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes Added New Requirements for INS Application Processing", "paragraphs": ["Another time pressure affecting the emphasis on application processing rather than benefit fraud detection is INS\u2019s new program requirements.

The latter number is to revert to 65,000 in 2004. In December 2000, Congress enacted legislation that allows businesses to pay a premium processing fee of $1,000 to get their filings completed in 15 days rather than 60 days. In addition, Congress enacted the Legal Immigration and Family Equity Act in December 2000. The act allows, among other things, aliens who otherwise qualify, but are not here legally, to adjust their status to permanent residency without having to return to their home country. Such aliens have to pay a $1,000 penalty to continue processing. Before the act became effective, aliens in this country seeking to adjust their status to permanent resident had to be here legally.

Further, adjudication officers are to ensure that documentary evidence and reports of investigation used by district office and service centers to substantiate denials are sufficient and adequate to meet requirements for presentation in court.", "In our report on the H-1B program and during our audit work for this report, adjudication officers and investigators raised concerns about their ability to meet time and production pressures while ensuring quality and detecting fraudulent applications. According to some INS officials and INS reports, significant emphasis is placed on meeting production goals at the expense of ensuring the quality of the benefit application process. Staff in various offices stated that the pressure to reduce the backlog and the increasing workload reduce the time available to identify possible immigration benefit fraud. For example, at one service center, officials told us that adjudication officers are so overloaded and pressured to process applications that they are given required overtime to adjudicate cases at home. However, when they are at home processing applications, they do not have access to databases that might help them detect fraud. One district office adjudication official stated that management demands quick adjudication to meet the office\u2019s goals. The official further stated that management has not emphasized that adjudication officers are to pursue fraud. Officials in two other district offices said that with high production goals and backlogs, the current system does not allow time to look for fraud. For example, according to an official, adjudication officers in his district office have approximately a 15-minute timeframe for adjudicating an application. This puts a great deal of pressure on adjudication officers to approve cases and keep application processing moving along. Additionally, he stated that production timeframes could suffer if a case is referred to the investigative unit.", "Further, our report on the H-1B program raised concerns that INS\u2019s supervisory review and appraisal process emphasized the quantity over the quality of reviews and that more balance was needed between the two. Because the existing supervisory review and performance appraisal systems for INS staff reviewing petitions are based largely on the number of requests processed rather than on the quality of the review, staff are rewarded for the timely handling of petitions rather than for careful scrutiny of their merits. As a result, there is no assurance that INS reviews are adequate for detecting noncompliance or abuse.", "Also, some officials believe that adjudication officers are discouraged from taking the time to discuss questionable cases with investigators. For example, an official in the Vermont Service Center told us that adjudication supervisors have complained that the operations unit slows the application process by taking adjudication officers\u2019 time away from reviewing applications. The official added that as a result of a production concern that the unit would not make its numeric goals, some adjudication officers have had to sneak over to the operations unit to discuss fraud- related issues.", "Further, service center officials told us that when deciding on staff positions for the facilities, they weigh the risk of not completing adjudicative work with the need to support intelligence operations. As a result, they may choose not to put staff in the operations units.", "A 1999 PricewaterhouseCoopers immigration benefits reengineering study contracted by INS found, among other things, that applications were not consistently adjudicated because, for example, the procedures used to process applications varied by office and standard quality control procedures were lacking.", "The study recommended implementing new, consolidated processes and forms, quality controls, and a comprehensive fraud prevention program. The latter would involve the creation of a fraud task force to periodically estimate the types and frequency of fraud, conduct training, and develop a management system for all applications. The deputy executive associate commissioner for ISD told us that INS is evaluating these recommendations. He stated that INS is at the beginning of its efforts to improve integrity in application processing. Further, he stated that although not much is currently being done to address fraud, in fiscal year 2001 INS received 54 additional positions for fraud\u201444 for the district offices and 10 for the service centers.

The assistant commissioner for planning indicated that INS is going to start a deliberative process to look at all of its GPRA measures, examine best practices of other agencies, talk to practitioners, and review INS resources for combating immigration benefit fraud, because it does not know how much fraud has existed or the extent of its success in reducing fraud.

INS\u2019s management of its benefit fraud enforcement activities has been fragmented and unfocused owing to several problems.", "First, although INS\u2019s interior enforcement strategy articulates the agency\u2019s overall approach for addressing benefit fraud and sets broad priorities, it does not specifically state how the investigative units at the districts and service centers are to coordinate their activities. Communicating how these units are to work together is particularly important because they report to different organizational entities.", "Second, INS has not provided working-level guidance for its investigation units in the districts and service centers. Without such guidance, INS cannot be assured that its limited investigative resources are focused on the highest priority cases. The lack of clear guidance was evident in fiscal years 1998 through 2001, when about 55 percent of investigation staff years were spent on single-issue cases. This is not consistent with the enforcement strategy for benefit fraud.", "Third, INS lacks an agencywide case tracking and management capability to maintain important data on prior, current, and future targets of benefit fraud investigations. Without such a capability, INS cannot be assured that its resources are being used effectively, duplicate investigations are avoided, and cases are coordinated. Although INS\u2019s Criminal Investigative Reporting System may be useful for tracking and managing all INS investigations, it has not yet been adopted for use in all benefit fraud cases.", "Fourth, INS needs to ensure that adjudicators have access to the data that they need to do their jobs. With record numbers of illegal immigrants in this country, an increasing volume of benefit applications, and more sophisticated and extensive fraud schemes, INS must improve its technology systems to make accurate immigration benefit decisions in a timely manner. Without timely access to information across units, INS cannot be assured that aliens are not improperly receiving benefits through fraud.", "These interunit coordination and information-sharing problems are indicative of INS\u2019s need to develop an enterprise architecture. In response to our recommendations, INS has recognized that it does not have an enterprise architecture and has taken some limited steps to develop one. The issues discussed in this report should be addressed within the context of an enterprise architecture development and implementation effort.", "Although the dual responsibility of providing timely immigration benefits to those who are eligible and denying benefits to those who are ineligible has been a difficult challenge, INS must do a better job of balancing these requirements.

A number of proposals have been offered to restructure INS to deal with this challenge. Dividing the enforcement and service functions into two distinct bureaus is one proposal. If INS were restructured along these lines, organizational crosswalks would need to be devised to assure that the two primary functions were still being effectively coordinated and balanced, that is, that the enforcement concerns were considered in performing service functions and vice versa. Our intention is that these primary functions be coordinated and balanced, regardless of how the agency is structured.
