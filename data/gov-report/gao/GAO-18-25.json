In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse.

Most\u2014about 81 percent\u2014of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors.", "Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin\u2014which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents\u2014is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The misuse of prescription drugs is widespread and contributes to  overdoses and deaths. Federal data show that in 2015, 3.8 million  Americans reported misusing prescription drugs within a 1-month period  and that prescription drug misuse was the second most common type of  illicit drug use, after marijuana use. The misuse of prescription drugs has  also contributed to the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic and the overdoses  associated with it, as 91 people in the United States die each day, on  average, from an opioid overdose, including overdoses involving  prescription opioids and heroin. Furthermore, the number of deaths  resulting from prescription opioids has more than quadrupled since 1999.", "About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015  received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this type  of diversion of prescription drugs from their intended users and the  resulting potential for abuse is by providing secure and convenient  disposal mechanisms for unused, unneeded, or expired prescription  medications. Under the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of  2010 (\u201cDisposal Act\u201d), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) may  authorize eligible retail pharmacies and other entities\u2014which are certain  entities already authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances\u2014 to also collect unused prescription drugs from the public. In September  2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Disposal  Act, providing pharmacies and other eligible entities the option to register  with DEA to become authorized collectors of unused controlled  prescription drugs using collection receptacles, which are bins used to  collect drugs meant for disposal. The regulation establishes  requirements participating entities must meet, such as installing the  disposal bin securely to a permanent structure and making the bin  inaccessible to the public when an employee is not present.", "You requested that we review DEA\u2019s requirements for authorized  collectors of prescription drugs and participation rates. In this report, we  describe  1.  participation rates of eligible pharmacies and other entities as DEA- authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, and  2.  factors that affect voluntary participation as authorized collectors of  unused prescription drugs.", "To describe the rates of eligible pharmacies and other entities that  participate as DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs  using disposal bins, we analyzed DEA data as of April 20, 2017, the most  current data available at the time of our analysis. We determined the  number and percentage of eligible entities participating as authorized  collectors nationwide, by state, and by type of entity. We also determined the number of eligible and participating authorized collectors in rural and  urban areas, using DEA\u2019s data and Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes.  Finally, we analyzed DEA\u2019s data and data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s  American Community Survey 5-year population estimates for 2011  through 2015 to estimate the number of individuals and the percentage of  the U.S. population living within varying distances of a DEA authorized  collector\u2019s disposal bin. For all data used in these analyses, we  interviewed knowledgeable officials and reviewed related documentation  and, based on these steps, determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. Our review is limited to DEA-authorized  collectors that use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs from  the public. Other methods of drug disposal by eligible entities and all  methods of disposal by law enforcement agencies, which do not require  DEA authorization to dispose of controlled substances, are outside the  scope of our work.", "To describe the factors that affect voluntary participation as authorized  collectors of prescription drugs, we interviewed DEA officials. In addition,  we conducted interviews with 11 stakeholder organizations\u20148 selected  because they represent different types of authorized collectors, such as  pharmacies and reverse distributors, and 3 selected because they  represent long-term care facilities. Our findings cannot be generalized  beyond the stakeholder organizations we interviewed.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2016 to October  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The DEA, within the Department of Justice, is responsible for ensuring  the availability of controlled substances for legitimate uses while  preventing their diversion through its administration and enforcement of  the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. Under  the Controlled Substances Act, all persons or entities that manufacture,  distribute, or dispense controlled substances are required to register with  DEA, unless specifically exempted. DEA regulates these entities to limit  diversion and prevent abuse. For example, DEA regulates  pharmaceutical companies that manufacture controlled substances,  health care providers who prescribe them to patients, and pharmacies  that dispense them.", "In October 2010, the Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances  Act to allow the public to deliver unused controlled substances to an entity  authorized by DEA to dispose of the substances. DEA was given  responsibility for promulgating the implementing regulations, and the  Disposal Act stipulated that the regulations should prevent diversion of  controlled substances while also taking into consideration public health  and safety, ease and cost of implementation, and participation by various  communities. In addition to disposal bins, DEA\u2019s regulations describe two  other options for the public to transfer controlled substances for the  purpose of disposal: mail-back programs and take-back events. Law  enforcement agencies may use all three methods of drug disposal without  the need for authorization by DEA. The Disposal Act stipulates that the  regulations cannot require an entity to participate in or establish any of  the disposal options."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Requirements for Authorized Collectors of Unused Prescription Drugs", "paragraphs": ["To participate as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs,  eligible entities\u2014retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with an on-site  pharmacy, narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, distributors,  and drug manufacturers that are already authorized by DEA to handle  controlled substances\u2014must modify their DEA registration. According to  DEA officials, such modification is free and simple to do. Eligible retail  pharmacies or hospitals/clinics that become authorized collectors are able  to install and maintain disposal bins in long-term care facilities in addition  to their own location. DEA\u2019s website contains a public search feature to  identify authorized collectors located near a specific zip code or  address.", "Authorized collectors must install, manage, and maintain the disposal  bins following DEA regulations. For example, under DEA\u2019s regulations for  maintaining the disposal bins,  the disposal bin must be securely fastened to a permanent structure,  securely locked, substantially constructed with a permanent outer  container and removable inner liner, and have a small opening that  allows contents to be added but not removed;  the bin must also prominently display a sign indicating which types of  substances are acceptable; users must dispose the unused prescriptions into the collection  receptacle themselves without handing them to staff at the  pharmacy;  the disposal bin must typically be located in an area where an  employee is present and near where controlled substances are  stored, and the bin must be made inaccessible to the public when an  employee is not present;  the inner liner of the disposal bin must meet certain requirements,  including being waterproof, tamper-evident, tear-resistant, opaque,  and having the size and identification number clearly labeled; and  the installation and removal of inner liners must be performed under  the supervision of at least two employees of the authorized collector.", "DEA regulations also require that all controlled substances collected in  the disposal bin\u2019s inner liners must be destroyed in compliance with  applicable federal, state, and local laws and rendered non-retrievable.  According to DEA regulations, non-retrievable means that the physical  and chemical conditions of the controlled substance must be permanently  altered, thereby rendering the controlled substance unavailable and  unusable for all practical purposes. Authorized collectors are permitted to  destroy the inner liner on their premises if they have the capacity to do so.  If not, the inner liners can be transported to a separate location to be  destroyed. Typically, in this case, an authorized collector contracts with a  reverse distributor to periodically remove, transport, and destroy the inner  liners. DEA regulations require that two reverse distributor employees  transport the inner liners directly to the disposal location without any  unnecessary stops or stops of an extended duration. Authorized  collectors must document certain information, including inner liner  identification numbers and the dates that each liner is installed, removed,  and transferred for destruction. The authorized collectors must maintain  these records for 2 years.

Most of the authorized collectors\u2014 about 81 percent\u2014were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics.  (See table 1). Narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, and  distributors made up approximately 1 percent of the authorized collectors.", "We also found that participation rates varied by state, though in most  states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to  become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. In 44 states,  less than 5 percent of the eligible entities had registered. (See figure 2  and appendix I for more information on the participation rates of  authorized collectors in each state). As of April 2017, Connecticut,  Missouri, and Maine had the lowest participation rates, with 0.11, 0.22,  and 0.70 percent, respectively. In contrast, North Dakota had the  highest participation rate, with 32.0 percent of its pharmacies and other  eligible entities registered to be authorized collectors. The state with next  highest participation rate was Alaska, with 8.96 percent. In North Dakota,  the state\u2019s Board of Pharmacy provides funding for authorized collectors  to purchase and maintain the disposal bins. According to a board official,  the board decided to fund these activities to increase participation rates  and plans to continue its funding indefinitely using revenue generated  from prescription drug licensing fees it collects.", "In addition, our analysis shows that about 82 percent of all authorized  collectors were located in urban areas as of April 2017. However, when  comparing the entities registered to be authorized collectors with the total  number of eligible entities, we found that a larger percentage of the  eligible entities in rural areas became authorized collectors compared  with those in urban areas (see table 2).", "The data we obtained on the number of eligible and participating  authorized collectors and their locations are the only available DEA data  on the use of disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs.  According to DEA officials, the agency does not collect any other  information on the use of disposal bins, such as the extent to which the  bins are used, or the amount and types of prescription drugs deposited  into the bins. For example, to minimize the risk of diversion, DEA  regulations do not allow authorized collectors to open and inspect the  inner liners of the disposal bins, so information on their contents cannot  be collected. According to DEA officials, the agency is not responsible  for collecting information on the amount and types of prescription drugs  destroyed through the disposal bins. DEA officials told us that the agency  views its responsibility solely as giving pharmacies and other eligible  entities the opportunity to become authorized collectors.", "Though we do not have information on the extent to which individuals use  DEA\u2019s prescription drug disposal bins, we were able to estimate that as of  April 2017, about half of the country\u2019s population lived less than 5 miles  away from a pharmacy or other DEA-authorized entity offering a  prescription disposal bin. In 21 states, at least 50 percent of the state\u2019s  population lived within 5 miles of a prescription disposal bin. (See   figure 3).", "While close to half of the nation\u2019s population lived less than 5 miles from a  disposal bin as of April 2017, the availability of nearby disposal bins  varied significantly for people depending on whether they lived in an  urban or a rural area. Specifically, about 52 percent of the population in  urban areas lived less than 5 miles away from a disposal bin, compared  to about 13 percent of the population in rural areas. Furthermore, about  44 percent of the population in rural areas lived even further away\u2014more  than 30 miles away from a disposal bin. An exception to this is North  Dakota, where about 86 percent of its urban population and about 64  percent of its rural population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Cited Cost and Other Factors as Affecting Decision to Become DEA-Authorized Collectors of Unused Prescription Drugs", "paragraphs": ["According to officials from the 11 stakeholder organizations we  interviewed\u2014which represent authorized collectors and long-term care  facilities\u2014several factors may explain why relatively few pharmacies and  other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of  unused prescription drugs. These factors include the associated costs of  participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in  other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs.", "Costs: Stakeholders said that the costs associated with purchasing,  installing, and managing the disposal bins is a factor that explains the  relatively low rate of participation. One stakeholder told us that many  eligible entities may decide that the benefit of participating does not  outweigh the costs associated with doing so. Specifically, stakeholders  told us that the major costs associated with participating include  the one-time cost of purchasing and installing a disposal bin;  the ongoing costs to train personnel to manage the bins; and  the cost of contracting with a reverse distributor to periodically dispose  of the bin\u2019s inner liner and contents.", "Stakeholders gave varying examples of the specific costs associated with  these investments. For example, one stakeholder estimated the yearly  costs of maintaining a disposal bin ranged from $500 to $600 per  location; another stakeholder said that the cost is thousands of dollars per  location per year, but did not provide a specific estimate. These  stakeholders added that costs can increase if the disposal bins fill more  quickly and need to be emptied more often than expected.", "For their part, officials from the reverse distributor stakeholders we  interviewed cited incinerating hazardous waste, the availability of  incinerators, and the cost of personnel as factors that increase the cost of  their services for authorized collectors. One reverse distributor  stakeholder told us that there are not many incinerators available,  requiring them to travel long distances to incinerate collected waste. The  other reverse distributor stakeholder added that DEA\u2019s requirement that a  second employee be present during the transportation and disposal  increases the cost of their services.", "While some stakeholders speculated that costs are a reason for low  participation, a few stakeholders told us that the benefits are worth the  costs. In fact, two stakeholders we spoke with told us that the benefit to  the communities was so important that they decided to provide funding to  retail pharmacies, alleviating an individual pharmacy\u2019s concern about the  cost of installing and maintaining the disposal bins. We found that as of  April 2017, over a quarter of the 2,233 authorized collectors using  disposal bins received external funding to pay for the costs associated  with installing and maintaining the disposal bins. In addition, stakeholders  told us that some localities have enacted laws known as extended  producer responsibility ordinances, which require that pharmaceutical  manufacturers pay for certain costs associated with drug disposal. When  asked about the costs associated with operating disposal bins, DEA  officials told us that addressing cost issues with eligible participants falls  outside of their responsibilities.", "Uncertainty: Stakeholders also told us that uncertainty regarding how to  comply with aspects of DEA\u2019s regulations for prescription drug disposal  bins affected their decisions to participate. One stakeholder added that  many eligible entities decide not to participate because uncertainties over  participation requirements could result in inadvertent non-compliance with  DEA\u2019s regulations.", "As an example of their uncertainty over some of the requirements  governing the disposal bins, officials from both of the reverse distributor  stakeholders we interviewed cited DEA\u2019s non-retrievable standard for  destruction of the inner liners of the bins. DEA requires that the method of  destruction be sufficient to render all controlled substances non- retrievable, meaning that the physical and chemical conditions of the  controlled substances must be permanently altered and unusable in order  to prevent diversion for illicit purposes. Both reverse distributor  stakeholders told us that they are uncertain about whether certain  disposal methods meet this standard, and they said that the agency has  not provided further guidance on how reverse distributors can meet this  requirement. DEA officials told us that the agency responds to questions  about whether a specific method of destruction meets the non-retrievable  standard by telling the registrant to test the remnants after destruction, to  see if any components of the controlled substance are still present. In its  summary of the regulations implementing the Disposal Act, DEA stated  that in order to allow for the development of various methods of  destruction, the agency did not require a specific method of destruction as  long as the desired result is achieved. However, DEA officials stated  that to their knowledge, incineration is the only method known to meet the  non-retrievable standard to date, but the officials hoped other methods  will be developed in the future.", "When asked about the guidance they provide to authorized collectors of  unused prescription drugs or those eligible to become authorized  collectors, DEA officials told us that they post frequently-asked questions  on their website, routinely answer questions from participants and others,  and give training presentations at conferences that include information on  the disposal bins. In our prior work, we found problems with DEA\u2019s  communication and guidance to stakeholders. In 2015, we recommended  that DEA identify and implement cost-effective means for communicating  regularly with pharmacies and other entities authorized to handle  controlled substances. DEA agreed with the recommendation, and  officials told us that, starting in August 2017, these entities can subscribe  to DEA\u2019s website to receive notifications when it is updated with new  guidance.", "Stakeholders also noted that some DEA requirements related to disposal  bins may conflict with other state and federal requirements governing the  transportation and disposal of hazardous waste, which includes some  controlled substances. For example, the two reverse distributor  stakeholders told us that some incinerator permits issued by states  require that hazardous waste be examined before incineration; however,  DEA requirements do not allow the contents of the liners to be examined,  even at the time of incineration. To address the incinerator permit  requirements, one reverse distributor told us that they use the  Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s hazardous waste household  exemption, which treats the liners as household waste and thereby allows  incinerator facilities to destroy the liners without examining the contents or  violating their state permit. In addition, some stakeholders raised  concerns that DEA\u2019s regulations may conflict with other federal  regulations. For instance, one stakeholder noted that they recently  learned that transporting the disposal bin\u2019s inner liners could violate  Department of Transportation regulations. DEA officials told us that they  were aware of this, explaining that the conflict was between DEA\u2019s  requirement that controlled substances be transported in liners and the  Department of Transportation\u2019s requirement that this type of waste be  transported in sturdy containers. According to DEA officials, this conflict  has been resolved by the Department of Transportation allowing reverse  distributors to place the liners inside sturdy containers kept on trucks.", "Participation in or Availability of Similar Efforts: Stakeholders said  that some pharmacies and other eligible entities were already  participating in other, similar efforts that allow for the safe disposal of  controlled substances, and therefore they did not want to invest additional  resources into participating as authorized collectors using disposal bins.  For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has an  established process that long-term care facilities use to dispose of their  unused controlled substances. As a result, all of the long-term care  stakeholders told us that long-term care facilities may choose not to  partner with pharmacies interested in placing disposal bins within their  facilities because it adds significant cost and effort without any additional  benefit. Furthermore, pharmacy stakeholders noted that because of the  availability of other prescription drug collection efforts in their  communities, they did not think that maintaining a disposal bin at their  locations was needed. For example, two of the stakeholders explained  that local law enforcement precincts already had a similar type of disposal  bin in place to collect unused prescription drugs. DEA officials told us  that they were aware of other options for the public and entities such as  long-term care facilities that are not registered as authorized collectors to  dispose of controlled substances. The officials also indicated that the  availability of disposal options at law enforcement agencies contributes to  the low participation rates among pharmacies as authorized collectors of  unused prescription drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Justice for  comment.
