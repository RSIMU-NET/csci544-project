In 2010, OPM issued a strategic plan for federal veterinarians to help improve recruiting initiatives and emergency response plans.", "GAO was asked to review workforce planning for federal veterinarians. This report examines (1) department-wide efforts USDA and HHS have made for their routine veterinarian workforces, (2) the extent to which USDA has identified the veterinarians needed for emergency response to an animal disease outbreak, and (3) the steps OPM and other federal agencies have taken to achieve the goals of the government-wide strategic plan for the veterinarian workforce.

GAO has identified top leadership involvement as a key principle for workforce planning. For example, USDA provided guidance to its component agencies to assess and develop strategies for its workforce. In accordance with this guidance, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)\u2014the agency that inspects slaughter plants\u2014developed a workforce plan that included recruitment incentives and other strategies for veterinarians. HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also included veterinarians in its workforce plans, but HHS did not provide guidance or direction to FDA or other component agencies to do so. GAO recommended in 2009 that USDA and HHS conduct department-wide assessments of their veterinarian workforces. The efforts of USDA and its component agencies met the intent of the recommendation. GAO believes that the recommendation to HHS is still valid. Direction and guidance from HHS could help integrate its component agencies' workforce planning efforts for veterinarians into a department-wide assessment.", "USDA participated in a government-wide study to estimate the veterinarians needed to respond to animal disease outbreaks, but because of limitations in the study, the estimates are not reliable for purposes of effective emergency response planning. For example, the estimates were based on a USDA model that had not been verified or validated. Moreover, USDA has not developed a detailed plan to augment or train its workforce to respond to an economically devastating or highly contagious outbreak. Without reliable estimates of the veterinarians needed or how it will augment and train its workforce, USDA cannot ensure it will have enough veterinarians to adequately respond.", "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and other federal agencies have taken steps toward achieving the goals outlined in OPM's government-wide strategic plan for the veterinarian workforce, primarily through an interagency group OPM created. However, in each of the three goals, the interagency group did not follow through on next steps and made limited progress. For example, to improve recruiting, OPM granted government-wide direct-hire authority in 2009 to enable agencies to hire qualified veterinarians without regard to certain federal hiring requirements. However, OPM did not follow through on plans to review agencies' use of the authority. As a result, OPM cannot determine the overall impact on recruitment or whether the authority should continue or be modified. Monitoring and evaluating progress toward human capital goals is among the key principles GAO has identified for effective strategic workforce planning. According to OPM officials, the group did not consistently monitor progress toward goals in part because it did not have sufficient leadership support from participating agencies. OPM and group members, including USDA and HHS, recognize a need for a higher level of leadership but have not identified officials to serve in this capacity. Obtaining leadership support\u2014including from USDA and HHS, the major federal employers of civilian veterinarians\u2014and monitoring and evaluating progress could help emphasize the importance of completing work under these goals and better position OPM to ensure progress or take appropriate actions if progress is limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USDA assess and address veterinarian workforce needs for emergency response to an animal disease outbreak, and that OPM review agencies' use of direct-hire authority for veterinarians and monitor and evaluate progress and obtain leadership support for achieving government-wide veterinary workforce goals.

Under the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) National Response  Framework for disasters and emergencies, USDA also has a lead role in  the emergency response to an animal disease outbreak, whether the  disease is naturally or intentionally introduced into the United States.  Veterinarians at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  conduct and support research related to animal and human health and  disease, including animal diseases that could spread to humans. Also,  HHS veterinarians oversee the welfare of animals used in research; and  ensure that animal drugs, animal feed, and food from medically treated  animals is safe.

We concluded in  2009 that the federal government did not have a comprehensive  understanding of the sufficiency of its veterinarian workforce.we found that USDA and HHS had not assessed the sufficiency of their  veterinarian workforces department-wide, even though their component  agencies had identified concerns about these workforces. Agencies\u2019  concerns included challenges in recruiting veterinarians with specialized  qualifications, noncompetitive salaries, and a potential shortage resulting  from the number of veterinarians who would be eligible to retire. We  recommended, among other things, that USDA and HHS conduct  department-wide assessments of their veterinarian workforces based on  workforce assessments by their component agencies, and that the Office  of Personnel Management (OPM) determine, based on USDA\u2019s and  HHS\u2019s department-wide assessments, whether a government-wide effort  was needed to address insufficiencies in the current and future  veterinarian workforce.", "The status of our recommendations is discussed later in this report. plans.

In 2015, we retained the high-risk designation because  current budget and long-term fiscal pressures, coupled with a potential  wave of employee retirements that could produce gaps in leadership and  institutional knowledge, threaten the government\u2019s capacity to effectively  address a wide range of national issues. OPM, individual agencies, and  Congress have all taken important steps over the last few years that will  better position the government to close current and emerging critical skills  gaps that are undermining agencies\u2019 abilities to meet their vital  missions. However, the area remains high risk because more work is  needed to implement specific corrective strategies for addressing critical  skills gaps and evaluating the results of those strategies. In particular, in  our 2015 update, we found that OPM and agencies had partially met the  leadership criterion for removal from the High Risk List but need to  sustain senior leadership\u2019s focus\u2014for example, on defining and  implementing corrective actions to narrow skills gaps through talent  management and other strategies.", "Strategic workforce planning addresses two critical needs: (1) aligning an  organization\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals and (2) developing long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic  goals. We have recognized the following five key principles for strategic  workforce planning to address these needs:  involve top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing the strategic workforce  plan; determine the critical skills and competencies that will be needed to  achieve current and future programmatic results; develop strategies to address gaps in number, deployment, and  alignment of human capital approaches for enabling and sustaining  the contributions of all critical skills and competencies; build the capability needed to address administrative, educational,  and other requirements important to support workforce planning  strategies; and monitor and evaluate progress toward human capital goals and how  human capital results have helped achieve program goals.", "In addition, OPM provides information and guidance on a wide range of  strategies that departments and agencies can use to achieve and  maintain a workforce sufficient to accomplish their missions. OPM can  also authorize departments to use additional strategies to address  workforce shortage situations if standard strategies prove insufficient. For  example, OPM can approve agencies\u2019 use of direct-hire authority when a  critical hiring need or severe shortage of candidates exists. Direct-hire  authority enables an agency to hire any qualified applicant without regard  to certain federal hiring requirements, such as competitive rating and  ranking and veterans\u2019 preference.", "Since we issued our report on the federal veterinarian workforce in 2009,  other organizations issued reports on the veterinarian workforce across  employment sectors, including the federal government.

According to an official from USDA\u2019s Office of  Human Resources Management, in December 2012, the Secretary of  Agriculture directed component agencies to create human capital and  workforce plans that would include veterinarians. USDA\u2019s guidance  specified workforce planning steps for component agencies to assess  their workforces and develop workforce planning strategies, including for  occupations considered critical to agencies\u2019 missions, such as  veterinarians. For example, the guidance called for agencies to analyze  the workforce needed to meet future workloads, identify any gaps in the  workforce to meet future needs, and develop human capital goals.  Human resources officials said that 2014 was the first year they began  reviewing component agencies\u2019 workforce plans and that they will  conduct more formal reviews of the plans in 2015 to examine, for  example, whether agencies conduct workforce planning on a periodic  basis and whether their plans consider changes in mission and  technology.", "As described below, USDA component agencies that consider  veterinarians to be critical to their missions\u2014FSIS and APHIS\u2014have  assessed and developed varying strategies for their veterinarian  workforces needed to meet routine needs.", "FSIS. Veterinarians are one of four mission-critical occupations at  FSIS. The agency tracks short-term needs for veterinarians and  vacancies at slaughter plants on an ongoing basis, and retirement  eligibility is calculated over a 6-year time frame. For example,  according to the agency\u2019s Director of Field Operations, FSIS tracks  the vacancy rate of veterinarians, which he estimated was about 10  percent in 2014. In addition, the agency\u2019s recruitment plan for fiscal  year 2014 projected that about 43 percent of FSIS veterinarians would  be eligible to retire by fiscal year 2018. FSIS has developed multiple  workforce planning strategies to address needs identified through its  assessments. As a short-term strategy, the agency employs a group  of relief veterinarians\u2014mostly full-time employees\u2014who travel to  various plants to fill in when the veterinarian assigned to a plant is  absent for personal or other reasons, such as a position vacancy.  Other longer-term strategies include (1) recruitment incentives for  difficult-to-staff duty locations, (2) use of direct-hire authority, and (3)  agency attendance at veterinary conferences and career fairs to  attract students. The agency\u2019s recruitment plan also includes efforts to  target veterinary students, such as visits to colleges of veterinary  medicine.", "APHIS. Veterinarians are one of nine mission-critical occupations at  APHIS. The agency tracks attrition among its veterinarians on a  monthly basis and calculates retirement eligibility for a 5-year period.  For example, Veterinary Services\u2014the agency\u2019s operational unit with  the largest number of veterinarians\u2014prepared a workforce plan for  2011 to 2015 suggesting that 45 percent of its veterinarians would be  eligible to retire by fiscal year 2016. In addition, the plan stated that an  expected national shortage of veterinary medical officers may impact  the unit\u2019s ability to effectively meet mission requirements and respond  to animal health emergencies, and that the unit would need to  enhance recruitment and retention efforts to maintain current levels of  mission-critical occupations. In fiscal year 2014, the unit prepared a  staffing plan with a target level of 550 to 575 veterinarians and began  hiring veterinarians with the expectation that it would meet the target  level in fiscal year 2015. Another operational unit within APHIS  conducted a study and issued a draft report in April 2014 on its  veterinarian workload and staffing levels, helping the agency to  assess workforce needs. APHIS\u2019 workforce planning strategies  targeting veterinarians include an internship program and use of  direct-hire authority granted by OPM. In addition, agency officials said  they are planning to initiate a cadre of veterinarians similar to the  FSIS group that can fill in temporarily when vacancies or other needs  occur, but the officials did not provide a time frame for commencing  this initiative.", "Veterinarians are not considered to be a mission-critical occupation at  ARS. Instead, the agency\u2019s draft human capital management plan  grouped veterinary medical officers together with other scientific  occupations at the agency. According to the plan, occupations within this  group may be targeted for priority human capital activity in the future. The  approach used by ARS is consistent with our key principles for effective  strategic workforce planning, in which the scope of agencies\u2019 efforts to  identify the skills and competencies needed for their future workforces  varies considerably, depending on the needs and interests of a particular  agency.

Key principles for  strategic workforce planning include involving top leadership to help  provide stability as the workforce plan is being developed and  implemented and ensure that planning strategies are thoroughly  implemented and sustained over time. Top leadership involvement can  also help integrate workforce planning efforts with other key management  planning efforts, such as succession planning, to ensure that such  initiatives work together to achieve the agency\u2019s goals.", "HHS has not conducted a department-wide assessment of its veterinarian  workforce even though HHS officials agreed to do so in response to a  question from a Senate subcommittee shortly after our 2009 report.

According to the plan, the center\u2019s workforce  increased by about 30 percent since 2006, primarily due to a hiring surge  initiative that targeted selected science and medical positions, including  veterinarians. The increase supported the expansion of the center\u2019s  regulatory responsibilities. The plan stated that the center would conduct  annual workforce planning to determine the workforce composition  needed to meet future requirements.

For example, APHIS officials said that they could rely on veterinary  technicians and other personnel to a greater extent than contemplated in  the TMAC study. APHIS officials also said that the agency had not made  a greater effort to plan the number of veterinarians needed for an  emergency response because the agency considers other aspects of  planning for an outbreak, such as determining the supplies needed and  ensuring the right incident command is in place, to be a higher priority.  Such aspects are part of response planning, as discussed in the National  Response Framework, but are to be integrated with the personnel needed  to respond to incidents.

Under an agreement with the Department of  Defense (DOD) signed in June 2006, APHIS can request  veterinarians\u2014in particular, from the Army Veterinary Corps\u2014for an  emergency response to an animal disease outbreak. However,  according to an APHIS emergency response official, DOD  veterinarians would provide at most a support role and would not be  available in numbers great enough to meet the potential need. For  example, the Army Veterinary Corps\u2019 mission to support the national  military strategy could limit the number of Army Veterinary Corps  veterinarians available to assist APHIS in an emergency response. In  addition, as of March 2015, the agency had not finalized similar  agreements with other federal agencies, such as HHS, although HHS  officials said the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps  veterinarians would be ready to participate under the National  Response Framework without an agreement. According to APHIS  officials, veterinarians at other agencies\u2014including other USDA  agencies\u2014may not be available or have the training needed to  participate in an emergency response.

In May 2014, APHIS entered into a multilateral  arrangement with Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the  United Kingdom that established a framework for one country to  request veterinarians from another country to participate in an  emergency response to an animal disease outbreak. According to an  APHIS emergency response official, the veterinarians requested  under this framework would not provide an initial rapid response but  would instead provide a support role, although the agreement did not  provide this level of detail.", "USDA and DHS officials said that, in addition to augmenting the APHIS  veterinarian workforce for an emergency response, APHIS needs to  ensure that responders are trained appropriately. According to the APHIS  training and exercise plan for emergency preparedness and response,  training provides the critical knowledge, skills, and abilities to respond to  emerging or other animal diseases. NAHERC veterinarians may choose  to take online training related to specific types of animal diseases and  various aspects of emergency response, such as on personal protective  equipment and vaccination. However, according to APHIS officials, the  agency has limited funds to pay for NAHERC veterinarians to participate  in exercises that could help them build skills and practice techniques  before an actual incident occurs. In addition, APHIS\u2019 training and exercise  plan does not provide details on how the agency will ensure that  veterinarians from NAHERC, other agencies, and other countries have  adequate training and exercise opportunities for participation in an  emergency response to an animal disease outbreak. For example, the  plan does not indicate how APHIS will train NAHERC veterinarians\u2014most  of whom, according to APHIS officials, are private practitioners who deal  primarily with small animals\u2014to overcome a skills gap the agency has  identified related to handling large farm animals in the field. APHIS  officials said that they expect to obtain funding for training when an  emergency occurs. However, without planning for the training needed for  its veterinarian workforce and those that could augment its workforce, it  will be difficult for APHIS to provide reasonable assurance that it has the  workforce that is sufficiently equipped to handle an emergency response."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OPM and Federal Agencies Have Taken Limited Steps to Achieve Government- Wide Goals for Veterinarians", "paragraphs": ["OPM and other federal agencies have taken steps toward achieving the  three goals outlined in OPM\u2019s strategic government-wide workforce plan  for the federal veterinary workforce, primarily through their participation in  TMAC. However, in each of the three goals, TMAC did not follow through  on next steps and made limited progress in achieving its goals in part  because the group did not consistently monitor and evaluate its progress  toward achieving the goals.", "TMAC\u2019s efforts in each of its three goals were as follows:", "Obtain a comprehensive understanding of the federal veterinary  workforce. TMAC\u2019s primary effort toward this goal was a  government-wide survey of federal veterinarians administered in June  2012. The survey\u2014the first of its kind for federal veterinarians,  according to the TMAC report on the survey\u2014was an effort to collect  standardized data on the veterinarians employed at 13 federal  agencies, including information on their education and certifications,  their emergency response skills, and the challenges agencies face in  recruiting and retaining them. The survey was intended to serve as a  starting point for identifying workforce issues and opportunities to  collaborate across agency lines. However, several factors limit the  reliability and relevance of the survey results. In particular, officials  who conducted the survey said they no longer retained any  documentation about their methodology; therefore, we could not  evaluate the reliability of its results. Also, according to the survey  report, 69 percent of federal veterinarians did not respond to the  survey, and TMAC did not assess the potential for nonresponse bias,  thereby reducing TMAC\u2019s ability to draw reliable conclusions about  the workforce as a whole. In addition, the survey did not address the  unique workforce planning needs of individual agencies, such as  component agencies within USDA and HHS. For example, the survey  identified recruitment and retention challenges for departments as a  whole and did not identify particular challenges or strategies to  address the challenges confronting component agencies, such as  FSIS, which has faced a shortage in veterinarian positions at  slaughter plants. Finally, as of February 2015, TMAC had not followed  through on next steps identified in the survey report, such as obtaining  data from senior agency leaders to validate the results of the  assessment. Without following through on such steps, OPM and  federal agencies will not know whether there are issues to be  resolved, where they exist, and how government-wide approaches  can be developed to resolve them.", "Improve recruiting and retention results for the federal veterinary  workforce. OPM\u2019s strategic plan identified several recruitment and  retention challenges, such as a limited number of veterinary school  graduates and competition for graduates from the private sector. To  address this challenge, TMAC considered marketing efforts, such as  using social media, to attract veterinary students and others to  consider careers in the federal government and discussed strategies  for improving recruitment and retention. TMAC did not follow through  on these discussions, however, by identifying the agencies using  these strategies or evaluating their success. Another initiative to boost  federal recruiting efforts, government-wide direct-hire authority for  veterinarians, has not been sufficiently monitored or evaluated to  determine its effectiveness. In its February 2009 memo approving the  authority, OPM cited various factors as justification for the authority,  including a severe shortage of candidates despite agencies\u2019 use of  other recruitment initiatives, such as recruiting at veterinary colleges.  The memo also stated that OPM would monitor use of the direct-hire  authority, as well as the continued need for it, and that OPM would  modify or terminate the authority as appropriate. Without a review of  the use of the authority, OPM cannot determine the overall impact on  recruitment or whether the authority should continue or be modified if  shortages are limited to some agencies, as TMAC reported. For  example, an APHIS official told us that the agency uses direct-hire  authority to facilitate the hiring process, not because the agency faces  a shortage of applicants, suggesting that OPM could modify the  direct-hire authority by limiting it to agencies that face shortages.  Otherwise, standard federal hiring requirements can be circumvented  without just cause.", "Enhance efforts to identify the veterinary workforce needed  during emergency events. TMAC\u2019s primary effort toward this goal  was the study to determine the veterinarian workforce needed to  respond to an animal disease outbreak. As we discussed above, the  study\u2019s estimates of the number of veterinarians needed are not  reliable for purposes of effective emergency response planning  because of several limitations, such as being based on a model that  had not been verified or validated. In addition, according to the TMAC  report on the study, an emergency response will require veterinarians  with varying skills, experience, and specialty training, but TMAC did  not follow through to identify the response needed by each veterinary  specialty, which the report had identified as an important next step. As  another step toward this goal, TMAC\u2019s government-wide survey of  federal veterinarians included questions on federal veterinarians\u2019  capability and willingness to respond to an emergency and their  related experience and training. The report on the survey included a  list of training needs; in a related effort, DHS initiated a project to  create an online training framework for animal agriculture emergency  responders, which is mainly aimed for the use of state officials.", "A key reason that OPM and federal agencies have taken limited steps to  achieve these goals is that they did not consistently monitor and evaluate  progress toward achieving the goals. One of our key principles for  effective strategic workforce planning is monitoring and evaluating  progress toward human capital goals.progress toward human capital goals provides information for effective  oversight by identifying performance shortfalls and appropriate corrective  actions. According to OPM officials, the group did not consistently monitor  progress toward goals in part because the group\u2019s membership did not  have sufficient leadership support from participating agencies. Monitoring  and evaluating the group\u2019s efforts could better position OPM to ensure  progress is being made or assist it in determining appropriate actions to  take if progress is limited.", "Currently, the OPM system for classification of federal employees allows for  identification of veterinarians in the veterinary medical science series (i.e., veterinarians in  the 0701 occupational series), but not of veterinarians who fill other types of positions,  such as managerial or interdisciplinary positions that are open to but not required to be  filled by veterinarians. As a result, OPM and federal agencies cannot easily identify all  federal veterinarians. require agencies to retroactively identify the veterinarians they employ  outside of the veterinary medical science series.", "In a September 2014 TMAC meeting we observed, TMAC members  recognized a need for a higher level of leadership and agreed on a plan  to form an executive steering committee. The committee would include a  senior executive with veterinary subject-matter expertise from a  participating agency\u2019s program office, as well as a human capital officer.  As of March 2015, TMAC members had not yet identified agency officials  to serve in this leadership capacity. OPM officials said that, given that  USDA, and to a lesser extent HHS, employ most civilian veterinarians,  the leadership support for TMAC should come from these departments.  Leadership involvement is among the key principles we have identified for  effective strategic workforce planning, and we have also found that  leadership involvement facilitates collaboration within interagency   Without leadership support from USDA and HHS, TMAC will  groups.likely continue to have difficulty ensuring progress toward group goals,  such as developing a way to identify all federal veterinarians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USDA has taken steps to provide department-wide guidance and  evaluation of its agencies\u2019 veterinarian workforce planning; APHIS and  FSIS in particular considered veterinarians as part of their workforce  planning efforts for routine activities. However, HHS has not made similar  efforts or conducted a department-wide assessment. In 2009, we  recommended that HHS conduct department-wide assessments of their  veterinarian workforces based on workforce assessments by their  component agencies. Among the HHS component agencies, only FDA  developed a strategic workforce plan that considered veterinarians.  Department-wide guidance and evaluation and collaboration among all of  the department\u2019s affected agencies, including individual centers,  institutes, and offices within CDC and NIH that conduct workforce  planning for veterinarians, could better position HHS to integrate its  component agencies\u2019 workforce planning efforts, including efforts to  identify and address any gaps in its veterinarian workforce. Accordingly,  we continue to believe that our previous recommendation remains valid.", "APHIS\u2014the lead agency at USDA for an emergency response to an  animal disease outbreak\u2014has made a limited effort to estimate the  number of veterinarians needed to respond to a large-scale outbreak. As  a result, APHIS does not know whether the number of veterinarians  currently available to respond is sufficient. Consequently, it does not  know if it needs to place a higher priority on increasing the number of  veterinarians available to assist in an emergency response\u2014for example,  by resuming the processing of applications for veterinarians who can  volunteer to serve as temporary federal employees. In addition, APHIS  has not fully assessed the sources it can rely on in an emergency or how  to train this supplemental veterinarian workforce to be effective in an  animal disease outbreak. Without these assessments, APHIS may be  limited in its ability to mount an effective emergency response to an  animal disease outbreak, with potentially serious consequences for the  nation\u2019s agriculture sector.", "OPM and other federal agencies that participate in TMAC have taken  steps toward OPM\u2019s government-wide goals for veterinarians\u2014a  relatively small but important population of the federal workforce that is  spread among multiple agencies. However, without consistent monitoring  and evaluation of the group\u2019s efforts, TMAC\u2019s efforts to follow OPM\u2019s  2010 government-wide strategic workforce plan for veterinarians have  fallen short of OPM\u2019s goals. For example, the veterinarian workforce  assessment spearheaded by TMAC in 2012 was not detailed or rigorous  enough to answer basic questions about the specific challenges agencies  face, and TMAC did not follow through on next steps it identified, such as  obtaining data from senior agency leaders to validate the results of the  assessment. Similarly, in the absence of consistent monitoring and  evaluation, OPM and other federal agencies may not be appropriately  targeting their efforts, such as with government-wide direct-hire authority  for veterinarians that OPM granted in 2009. In particular, since granting  the authority, OPM has not evaluated how agencies are using it, and  whether its continuation is warranted.

In  particular, USDA agreed that APHIS could do more to improve its  estimates of veterinarian workforce needs for an emergency response to  an animal disease outbreak, but believes that it has made efforts to  assess its needs. For example, USDA stated that APHIS follows National  Response Framework principles in planning for animal disease  emergencies and described efforts APHIS has made to assess its  veterinarian workforce needs for an emergency response. According to  USDA, these efforts include using insights from real-world outbreaks to  improve planning models for an emergency response and developing  response strategies that can alter veterinarian workforce needs during a  disease outbreak, such as use of vaccines or quarantine.", "We recognize that the efforts described by USDA are an important part of  response planning under the National Response Framework. However,  USDA did not provide documentation to demonstrate that it had assessed  its veterinarian workforce needs for an emergency response. Moreover,  as stated in our report, APHIS officials told us that the agency had not  developed estimates of the number of veterinarians needed for an  emergency response, other than one modeling effort for a TMAC study.  APHIS officials explained that the agency considered other aspects of  planning for an outbreak, such as ensuring the right incident command is  in place, to be a higher priority. As a result, we believe that our work fairly  and accurately describes what is known about the extent of the APHIS  efforts and what needs to be done. Reliable estimates of the veterinarians  needed for an emergency, combined with other aspects of planning for an  outbreak, will help APHIS to be prepared to have a sufficient number of  veterinarians to respond to the most serious animal disease outbreaks.", "OPM agreed with our recommendation about initiating efforts to monitor  and evaluate TMAC\u2019s progress toward government-wide goals for the  federal veterinary workforce and working with TMAC members to obtain  leadership support, particularly from USDA and HHS.

OPM further  stated that it periodically reviews direct-hire authority for veterinarians, as  specified under the regulation on termination, modification, and extension  of direct-hire authority. Under the regulation, OPM is to review agency  use of the authority on a periodic basis to ensure proper administration  and to determine if continued use of the authority is supportable. To  demonstrate that it has conducted such reviews, OPM provided us a list  of the number of times the authority was used by various departments  and agencies in recent years. However, OPM did not provide information  showing whether or how it had determined that continued use of the  authority is supportable. Moreover, an OPM official responsible for direct- hire authority told us in August 2014 that he was not aware of any  systematic review to determine whether direct-hire authority was still  needed for veterinarians. In our view, a determination that continued use  of the authority is supportable requires an evaluation that includes an  examination not only of the number of times the authority was used, but  also of other factors, such as whether there is a severe shortage of  candidates or a critical hiring need for veterinarians.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretaries of Agriculture; Health and Human Services;  and Homeland Security; the Director of the Office of Personnel  Management; and other interested parties.
