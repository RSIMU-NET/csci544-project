Based on the limited and nongeneralizeable information that GAO obtained from the three mortgage servicers and the credit union, a small percentage of the total loan portfolios were identified as eligible for SCRA protections. Two large servicers had loan-level data on delinquency rates. For those identified as SCRA-eligible, rates ranged from 16 to 20 percent and from 4 to 8 percent for their other military borrowers. Delinquencies at the credit union were under 1 percent. Some servicemembers appeared to have benefitted from the SCRA interest rate cap of 6 percent, but many eligible borrowers had apparently not taken advantage of this protection. For example, at one institution 82 percent of those who could benefit from the interest rate caps still had mortgage rates above 6 percent. The data also were insufficient to assess the impact of SCRA protections after servicemembers left active duty, although one institution's limited data indicated that military borrowers had a higher risk of delinquency in the first year after leaving active duty. But those with SCRA protections also were more likely to cure delinquencies during this period than the institution's other military borrowers. Given the many limitations to the data, these results should only be considered illustrative. Most of these institutions indicated that they made recent changes to better identify SCRA-eligible borrowers and improve the accuracy of the data.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has partnerships with many federal agencies and nonprofit organizations to help provide financial education to servicemembers, but limited information on the effectiveness of these partnerships exists. DOD and its partners have focused on promoting general financial fitness rather than providing information about SCRA protections. But some partners provide SCRA outreach and support to servicemembers. For example, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has an Office of Servicemember Affairs that provides SCRA outreach to servicemembers and mortgage servicers responsible for complying with the act. Although stakeholders GAO interviewed generally offered favorable views of these partnerships, some said obtaining additional information about educational resources and partnership performance could improve programs. However, DOD has not undertaken any formal evaluations of the effectiveness of these partnerships. This finding is consistent with GAO's July 2012 review of SCRA education efforts, which found that DOD had not assessed the effectiveness of its educational methods and therefore could not ensure it reached servicemembers in the most effective manner. GAO recommended in July 2012 that DOD assess the effectiveness of its efforts to educate servicemembers on SCRA to determine better ways for making servicemembers (including reservists) aware of SCRA rights and benefits. In response to that recommendation, as of December 2013, DOD was reviewing the results of its recent surveys on the overall financial well-being of military families and planned to use these results to adjust training and education for SCRA, as appropriate. GAO's current finding that many servicemembers did not appear to be taking advantage of the SCRA interest rate cap appears to reaffirm that DOD's SCRA education efforts could be improved and that an assessment of the effectiveness of these efforts is still warranted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections to  active duty military personnel in the event that their military service  prevents them from meeting financial obligations.

We conducted a quantitative analysis of the loan-level data,  which included information on loan status, total fees, and the financial  outcomes of borrowers (such as whether the borrowers cured mortgage  defaults). Our analysis is not based on a representative sample of all  servicemembers eligible for SCRA mortgage protections and is not  generalizable. Also, the conclusions we could draw about the effects of  SCRA were limited because the data did not always comprehensively  identify SCRA-eligible and other military borrowers and reflected a limited  time frame. To the extent individual loan-level data were available, we  conducted quantitative analyses on the changes in financial well-being of  the servicemembers at each institution. Where appropriate, we also relied  on a summary (not loan-level) analysis that the fourth institution (a large  single-family mortgage servicer) provided of its servicemember loan  portfolio. Through interviews with financial institution officials and data  testing, we determined the mortgage data were sufficiently reliable for the  limited purpose of identifying relative changes in the financial well-being  of servicemembers identified as having received SCRA mortgage  protections for the servicers in our analysis. But, the relative delinquency  and cure rates we derived should be interpreted with caution because of  issues with identification of servicemembers and SCRA-eligible borrowers  in the data (see app. I for more information). Based on interviews with  financial institution officials, we determined our institution-specific  analyses were sufficiently reliable for the same limited purpose.

For example, to receive the interest-rate  benefit, servicemembers must identify themselves as active duty military  and provide a copy of their military orders to their financial institution.  However, the responsibility of extending SCRA foreclosure protections to  eligible servicemembers often falls to mortgage servicers. The burden is  on the financial institution to ensure that borrowers are not active duty  military before conducting foreclosure proceedings. Eligible  servicemembers are protected even if they do not tell their financial  institution about their active duty status. One of the primary tools  mortgage servicers use to comply with SCRA is a website operated by  DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) that allows mortgage  servicers and others to query DMDC\u2019s database to determine the active  duty status of a servicemember.", "Under SCRA, the Secretaries of each military service and the Secretary  of Homeland Security have the primary responsibility for ensuring that  servicemembers receive information on their SCRA rights and  protections.

Federal banking  regulators do not generally require financial institutions to report  information on SCRA-eligible loans or on the number and size of loans  that they service for servicemembers. SCRA compliance requires that financial institutions check whether a borrower is an active duty  servicemember and therefore eligible for protection under SCRA before  initiating a foreclosure proceeding. However, institutions are not required  to conduct these checks on loans in the rest of their portfolio, and two told  us that they do not routinely check a borrower\u2019s military status unless the  borrower is delinquent on the mortgage. Consequently, the number of  SCRA-eligible loans that these two institutions reported to us only  includes delinquent borrowers and those who reported their SCRA  eligibility to the financial institution. Two other institutions were able to  more comprehensively report the number of SCRA-eligible loans in their  portfolio because they routinely check their portfolio against the DMDC  database. Additionally, only one of the financial institutions we contacted  was able to produce historical data on the total number of known SCRA- eligible loans in its portfolio.", "Although exact information on the total number of servicemembers  eligible for the mortgage protections under SCRA is not known, DOD data  provide some context for approximating the population of  servicemembers who are homeowners with mortgage payments and who  therefore might be eligible for SCRA protections. According to DOD  data, in 2012 there were approximately 1.4 million active duty  servicemembers and an additional 848,000 National Guard and Reserve  members, of which approximately 104,000 were deployed. While DOD  does not maintain data on the number of servicemembers who are  homeowners, DOD\u2019s 2012 SOF survey indicated that approximately 30  percent of active duty military made mortgage payments. For reservists,  DOD\u2019s most recent survey of homeownership in June 2009 indicated that  53 percent of reservists made mortgage payments. According to DOD  officials, industry trade group representatives, SCRA experts, and military  service organizations, the servicemembers most likely to be eligible for  SCRA mortgage protections are members of the Reserve components  because they were more likely to have had mortgages before entering  active duty service.", "Although comprehensive data on the number of servicemembers eligible  for SCRA are not available, four financial institutions provided us with  some data on the servicemembers they have identified in their portfolios  in 2012. According to these data, a small percentage of the financial  institutions\u2019 total loan portfolios were identified as being eligible for SCRA  protections. Table 1 details the number of loans held by each of the  institutions from which we obtained data, including the estimated number  of loans belonging to servicemembers and the number of loans the  institutions identified as SCRA-eligible. Collectively, we estimate that the  financial institutions from which we received useable data service  approximately 27-29 percent of the mortgages held by servicemembers.  This estimate is based on information from DOD\u2019s SOF results on the  estimated percentage of active duty servicemembers and reservists who  make mortgage payments and the reported and estimated number of  military borrowers that each of these institutions reported in their  portfolios.", "Representatives with three of the financial institutions told us they have  made changes to their data systems over the past 2 years to help better  identify whether mortgage holders were active duty military and eligible  for SCRA protections. They attributed these changes, in part, to DOD\u2019s  April 2012 upgrade of the DMDC database to allow financial institutions to  check on the active duty status of up to 250,000 borrowers at once, as  opposed to checking one individual at a time. Since then, some of the  institutions had made changes to their systems to use the DMDC  database to routinely check the military status of borrowers, thereby  improving their available data on SCRA-eligible borrowers. Of the  financial institutions we contacted, representatives with two told us that  they now regularly check their entire loan portfolio against the DMDC  database. Representatives with the other institutions said that they only  check the military status of delinquent borrowers. To illustrate the extent  to which these changes could improve the accuracy of the data on SCRA- eligible borrowers, representatives of one financial institution told us they  used to rely on postal codes to help identify borrowers on or near military  bases to determine whether they were likely servicemembers. This  institution has since switched to a data system that allows a check of its  entire portfolio against the DMDC database so that the institution can  more accurately identify which borrowers are also servicemembers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SCRA-Protected Borrowers Generally Had Higher Rates of Mortgage Delinquency, with Protections Appearing to Benefit Some Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of data from three financial institutions suggests that SCRA- protected borrowers were substantially more likely to experience  delinquency at any time than their non-SCRA-protected military  counterparts, with one exception. The institutions provided us data with  substantial inherent limitations that prevented us from fully analyzing the  repayment practices of their military borrowers. However, the limited data  allowed us to conduct some analyses of borrowers\u2019 delinquency rates and  the rates at which delinquent borrowers became current on their  mortgages. At two servicers, we found that SCRA-protected borrowers  had delinquency rates from 16 to 20 percent. In contrast, non-SCRA- protected military borrowers had delinquency rates that ranged from 4 to  8 percent. These rates also varied across time within an institution.  However, delinquency rates for the large credit union we analyzed were  significantly smaller, and its SCRA-protected borrowers were less likely to  be delinquent. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2012, 0.01 percent of  SCRA-protected borrowers at this institution were delinquent on their  loans, while 0.56 percent of the remaining borrowers in its loan portfolio  were delinquent. The variation in delinquency rates among these financial  institutions indicates that factors in addition to SCRA protection likely  influence an institution\u2019s delinquency rates, including differences among  each institution\u2019s lending standards and policies or borrower  characteristics, such as income and marital status.", "Although it should be interpreted with caution because the results were  not consistent at all three institutions for which we could conduct the  analysis, our data analysis also suggests that borrowers protected by  SCRA may have a better chance of curing their mortgage delinquency\u2014 making payments sufficient to restore their loan to current status\u2014than  those without the protections. The summary loan data we obtained from  one institution show that its SCRA-protected military borrowers who were  90 or more days delinquent were almost twice as likely to cure their  delinquency within a year than civilian borrowers and almost five times as  likely as other military borrowers who were not SCRA-protected. Our  analysis of loan-level data from another institution also suggested that its  SCRA-protected borrowers had a higher likelihood of curing their  mortgage delinquency than military borrowers not SCRA-protected,  although their chances of curing the delinquency declined after leaving  active duty.suggested that cure rates for active duty SCRA-protected  servicemembers were substantially lower than their noneligible active  duty counterparts. Again, these differences in cure rates among the three  institutions could reflect differences in institution policies or borrower  characteristics.", "However, our analysis of data provided by a third institution  Our data analysis also indicates that at least some servicemembers have  benefitted from the SCRA interest rate cap. As discussed earlier,  servicemembers must provide written notice to their servicer of their  active duty status to avail themselves of this provision. Analysis of one  institution\u2019s data showed that approximately 32 percent of identified  SCRA-eligible borrowers had a loan with an interest rate above 6 percent  at origination. According to data provided by this institution\u2014which  included the initial interest rate and a current interest rate for 9  consecutive months in 2013\u2014some SCRA-eligible borrowers saw their  interest rates reduced to 6 percent or less, but almost 82 percent of the  loans for those eligible for such a reduction retained rates above 6  percent. However, SCRA-eligible borrowers with interest rates higher  than 6 percent had a larger average drop in interest rates from origination  through the first 9 months of 2013 than non-SCRA-eligible military  borrowers or SCRA-protected borrowers with initial rates below 6 percent.  We cannot determine how many rate reductions resulted from the  application of SCRA protections; other potential reasons for rate  decreases include refinancing or a rate reset on adjustable-rate loans.  Several financial institutions told us that more servicemembers could  benefit from the rate cap protection if they provided proof of their active  duty status to their mortgage servicer. For example, representatives from  one financial institution told us that they receive military documentation  (orders, commanding officer letters, etc.) on 31 percent of their SCRA- eligible borrowers\u2014as a result, up to 69 percent may not be receiving the  full financial benefit that SCRA affords."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Data Are Insufficient to Assess Different Protection Periods, but Mortgage Delinquencies Appeared to Increase after Active Duty", "paragraphs": ["The data financial institutions we contacted were able to provide were  generally not sufficient to assess the impact of the various protection  periods in effect since the enactment of SCRA: 90 days, 9 months, and 1  year. Because most of the institutions we interviewed reported that they  made enhancements to their data systems in 2012 to better identify  SCRA-eligible borrowers, they were unable to provide data for both  SCRA-eligible borrowers and a comparison group of other military  borrowers before the end of 2011, when the protection periods were  shorter. Furthermore, none of our data that included SCRA-eligible  borrowers and a comparison group of non-SCRA-eligible borrowers  covered more than a 1-year span. As a result, the data were insufficient  to evaluate the effectiveness of SCRA in enhancing the longer-term  financial well-being of the servicemember leaving active duty or over the  life of the mortgage. Finally, our measures of financial well-being\u2014 likelihood of becoming delinquent, curing a delinquency, and obtaining a  reduction in the mortgage interest rate\u2014are not comprehensive  measures of financial well-being, but were the best measures available to  us in the data.", "Our analysis of one servicer\u2019s data suggests that all military borrowers\u2014 SCRA-protected or not\u2014had a higher likelihood of becoming delinquent  in the first year after they left active duty than when in the military. For  example, in the loan-level data from an institution that used the DMDC  database to check the military status of its entire loan portfolio, all of its  military borrowers had a higher likelihood of becoming delinquent in the  first year after they left active duty than when in service, with that risk  declining somewhat over the course of the year for non-SCRA-protected  military borrowers. Although not generalizeable, these findings are  consistent with concerns, described below, that servicemembers may  face financial vulnerability after separating from service. Those who were  SCRA-protected had a smaller increase in delinquency rates in the first  year after leaving active duty than other military borrowers, but this may  be due to SCRA-protected borrowers having their loans become  delinquent at higher rates before leaving active duty and not to a  protective effect of SCRA.", "Although we were generally unable to obtain data to analyze the impact  of the varying protection periods, data from one institution provided some  indication of a positive effect of SCRA protection for servicemembers  receiving up to a year of protection. Analyzable data from one institution  on the mortgage status of all its military borrowers for a 9-month period in  2013, including those who had left active duty service within the last year,  indicated that SCRA-protected borrowers who were within the 1-year  protection period after leaving active duty service had a higher chance of  curing their delinquencies than did the institution\u2019s other military  borrowers who had left active duty service. We found this effect despite  this being the same institution where we found that SCRA-eligible  borrowers were less likely to cure their mortgage delinquencies when still  on active duty (compared with non-SCRA-eligible borrowers).", "Overall, the findings from our data analysis on delinquencies and cure  rates were consistent with our interviews and past work showing that the  first year after servicemembers leave active duty can be a time of  financial vulnerability. We previously reported that while the overall  unemployment rate for military veterans was comparable to that of non- veterans, the unemployment rate for veterans more recently separated  from the military was higher than for civilians and other veterans.", "Additionally, representatives from the National Guard and Army Reserve  said that Guard and Reserve members may return to jobs in the civilian  sector that could be lower paying or less stable than their previous  military work.

For example, three mortgage  servicers we included in this review noted that they had reduced the  interest rate charged on servicemembers\u2019 mortgages to 4 percent\u2014below  the 6 percent required in SCRA.

One of the  financial institutions told us that they have made SCRA foreclosure  protections available to all active duty servicemembers for the loans that   As a result, any servicemember  they own and service (thus, about 16 percent of their mortgage portfolio  receives SCRA protection). However, officials at this institution said that  they were bound by investor guidelines for the loans they service for other  investors, such as Fannie Mae, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, and private investors. The officials said that many of the  large investors have not revised their rules to extend SCRA protections;  as a result, the institution has been unable to extend SCRA protections to  all noneligible borrowers whose loans are owned by these entities.", "None of the financial institutions we interviewed advocated for a change  in the length of time that servicemembers received SCRA protection.  Officials at one institution told us that they considered a 1-year period a  reasonable amount of time for servicemembers to gain financial stability  after leaving active duty and that they implemented the 1-year protection  period before it became law. One attorney we interviewed who has a  significant SCRA-related practice supported the extension of the SCRA  foreclosure protection to 1 year because the revised timeframe matches  the mortgage interest-rate protection period, which has remained at 1  year since 2008, when mortgages were added to the SCRA provision that  limits interest rates to 6-percent. In contrast, a representative of one of the military support organizations we interviewed noted that, based on his  interactions with servicemembers, the effect of extending the foreclosure  protection from 9 months to 1 year has been negligible, although he also  said that the extension was a positive development."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD and Various Partners Provide Financial Education, but Limited Information on Effectiveness of Efforts Exists", "paragraphs": ["DOD has entered into partnerships with many federal agencies and  nonprofit organizations to help provide financial education to  servicemembers, but limited information on the effectiveness of these  efforts exists.

Similarly, nonprofit partners including the  National Military Family Association, the Association of Military Banks of  America, and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions provide  information on SCRA protections to their members. But DOD officials also  noted that partners are not required by DOD to provide SCRA education,  and that such education may represent a rather small component of the  partnership efforts.", "DOD established its financial education partnerships by signing  memorandums of understanding (MOU) with the federal agencies and  nonprofit organizations engaged in its Financial Readiness Campaign.

Staff from another organization said that DOD should regularly review all  of these partners to ensure they were fulfilling their responsibilities. DOD  officials told us they would likely discuss these suggestions at upcoming  meetings with their financial education partners.", "The program manager of the Personal Financial Readiness Program also  noted that to manage the partnerships, she regularly communicates with  the partners to stay informed of their activities. In addition, she said that  the Office of Family Policy, Children and Youth has been encouraging  individual installation commanders to enter into agreements with local  nonprofit organizations. The local partners would provide education  assistance more tailored to servicemembers\u2019 situations than the more  global information the DOD partners provided.", "As we noted in our 2012 report, DOD has surveyed servicemembers on  whether they had received training on SCRA protections, but had not  assessed the effectiveness of its educational methods. To assess  servicemembers\u2019 awareness of SCRA protections, in 2008 DOD asked in  its SOF surveys if active duty servicemembers and members of the  Reserve components had received SCRA training. Forty-seven percent of  members of the Reserve components\u2014including those activated in  2008\u2014reported that they had received SCRA training and 35 percent of  regular active duty servicemembers reported that they had received  training. Without an assessment of the effectiveness of its educational  methods (for example, by using focus groups of servicemembers or  results of testing to reinforce retention of SCRA information), we noted  that DOD might not be able to ensure it reached servicemembers in the  most effective manner. We recommended that DOD assess the  effectiveness of its efforts to educate servicemembers on SCRA and  determine better ways for making servicemembers aware of their SCRA  rights and benefits, including improving the ways in which reservists  obtain such information.", "In response to our recommendation, as of December 2013, DOD was  reviewing the results of its recent surveys on the overall financial well- being of military families. The surveys have been administered to three  groups: servicemembers, military financial counselors, and military legal  assistance attorneys. While the surveys are not focused solely on SCRA,  they take into account all financial products, including mortgages and  student loans, covered by SCRA. DOD officials explained that they would  use the results, including any recommendations from legal assistance  attorneys, to adjust training and education on SCRA benefits, should such  issues be identified. Our findings for this report\u2014that many  servicemembers appeared not to have taken advantage of their ability to  reduce their mortgage interest rates as entitled\u2014appear to reaffirm that  DOD\u2019s SCRA education efforts could be improved and that an  assessment of the effectiveness of these efforts is still warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Defense, the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial  Protection for comment.

We obtained and analyzed loan- level data, institution-specific summary data, or both, from four financial  institutions (three large single-family mortgage servicers and a large  credit union). A fifth institution (a large single-family servicer) we  contacted was unable to provide us with data for inclusion in our review.  We did not identify financial institutions to protect the privacy of individual  borrower data. Table 2 provides a summary of the data we obtained.", "We conducted a quantitative analysis of the data, which included  information on (1) loan history, including loan status and total fees; (2)  loan details such as the loan-to-value ratio and principal balance; and (3)  financial outcomes of borrowers, such as initial and updated credit scores  and whether the borrowers filed for bankruptcy or cured mortgage  defaults. After controlling for loan and demographic characteristics and  other factors to the extent that such data were available, we developed  logistic regression models to estimate the probability of different  populations becoming delinquent on their mortgage and curing their  mortgage delinquency (by bringing their payments current). The  estimates from these models may contain some degree of bias because  we could not control for economic or military operations changes, such as  changes in housing prices or force deployment that might affect a  servicemember\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage.", "Our analysis is not based on a representative sample of all  servicemembers eligible to receive SCRA mortgage protections and  therefore is not generalizable to the larger population. Moreover, we  identified a number of limitations in the data of the four financial  institutions. For example, the various servicer datasets identify SCRA  status imperfectly and capture activity over different time periods with  different periodicities. We also cannot rule out missing observations or  other inaccuracies. Other issues include conflicting data on SCRA  eligibility, data reliability issues related to the DOD database used to  identify servicemembers (which is operated by the Defense Manpower  Data Center, or DMDC), data quality differences across time within a  given servicer\u2019s portfolio, and data artifacts that may skew the  delinquency statistics for at least one institution. Lastly, as servicer  systems vary across institutions, none of the servicers from which we  requested data provided us with every data field we requested for our  loan-level analysis. Due to the differences in the data provided by each  institution, we conducted a separate quantitative analysis of the data from  each institution that provided loan-level data. To the extent that data were  available, we also calculated summary statistics for each institution on the  changes in financial well-being of the servicemembers, which allowed for  some basis of comparison across institutions in levels of delinquency and  cure rates. To conduct as reliable analyses as the data allowed, we also  corrected apparent data errors, addressed inconsistencies, and  corroborated results with past work where possible. Through these  actions, and interviews with knowledgeable financial institution officials,  we determined that the mortgage data and our data analysis were  sufficiently reliable for the limited purposes of this report. However,  because some servicer practices related to SCRA have made it difficult to  distinguish SCRA-protected servicemembers from other military  personnel, the relative delinquency and cure rates we derived from these  data represent approximations, are not definitive, and should be  interpreted with caution.", "Furthermore, we analyzed data from DOD\u2019s Status of Forces (SOF)  surveys from 2007 to 2012, which are administered to a sample of active  duty servicemembers and reservists on a regular basis and cover topics  such as readiness and financial well-being. We determined the survey  data we used were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also  analyzed DOD data on the size of the active duty military population and  DOD survey data to estimate the percentage of servicemembers who  make payments on a mortgage and may be eligible for SCRA protections,  and the percentage of military borrowers that our sample of borrowers  from selected financial institutions covers.", "Lastly, we also interviewed two lawyers with knowledge of SCRA, five  selected financial institutions, DOD officials (including those responsible  for individual military services, the Status of Forces Surveys, and a  database of active duty status of servicemembers), and representatives  of military associations and selected financial institutions to obtain  available information or reports on the impact of SCRA protections on the  long-term financial well-being of servicemembers and their families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on DOD Partnerships", "paragraphs": ["To examine the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s partnerships, we analyzed  documentation on DOD\u2019s partnerships with public and private entities that  provide financial education and counseling to servicemembers.
