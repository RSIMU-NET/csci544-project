While insurers suffered losses of over $20 billion in Florida from the 2004 hurricanes, steps such as implementing stronger building codes and stricter underwriting standards may have limited market disruptions as compared with the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. For example, in 2004, only 1 Florida insurance company failed in contrast to the 11 that failed after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. However, a more severe catastrophic event or series of events could severely disrupt insurance markets and impose recovery costs on governments, businesses, and individuals. Some insurers and reinsurers benefit from catastrophe bonds because the bonds diversify their funding base for catastrophic risk. However, these bonds currently occupy a small niche in the global catastrophe reinsurance market and many insurers view the costs associated with issuing them as significantly exceeding traditional reinsurance. In addition, industry participants do not consider catastrophe bonds for terrorism risk feasible at this time. Authorizing insurers to establish tax-deductible reserves for potential catastrophic events has been advanced as a means to enhance industry capacity, but according to some industry analysts such reserves would lower federal tax receipts and not necessarily bring about a meaningful increase in capacity because insurers may substitute the reserves for other types of capacity. The six European countries GAO studied use a variety of approaches to address catastrophe risk. Some governments require insurers to provide natural catastrophe insurance and provide financial assistance to insurers in the wake of catastrophic events, while others generally rely on the private market. However, the majority of these governments have established national terrorism insurance programs. Although their approaches vary, insurers in all six countries were allowed to establish tax-deductible reserves for potential catastrophic events as of 2004."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Natural catastrophes and terrorist attacks can place enormous financial  demands on households, businesses, and the insurance industry, in  addition to causing significant loss of life. For example, the four hurricanes  that primarily affected Florida in 2004 caused over $20 billion in insured  losses in the state due to property destruction, and Congress appropriated  approximately $16 billion to assist victims of the hurricanes and repair  public infrastructure such as roads and military bases. Moreover, natural  catastrophes and terrorist attacks pose unique challenges to property- casualty insurers. Forecasting the timing and severity of such events is  difficult and the large losses associated with catastrophes can threaten  insurer solvency. Insurers frequently respond to catastrophic events by  cutting back coverage significantly or substantially increasing premiums  for policyholders. After Hurricane Andrew crossed southern Florida in  1992, many insurance and reinsurance companies (insurers that offer  insurance to other insurance companies) raised premiums or stopped  offering catastrophic coverage in the state. Similar reactions took place in  the California insurance market after the Northridge earthquake of 1994  and worldwide insurance markets after the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks (September 11 attacks). To the extent that insurers are unable or  unwilling to insure against catastrophic events, a subsequent lack of  affordable coverage in the marketplace could impede economic recovery  and development.", "In response to such insurance market disruptions, governments and the  private sector have taken steps to enhance the \u201ccapacity\u201d of the insurance  industry to address catastrophic risk.  Although there are several  definitions of industry capacity, we define the term to mean the ability of  property-casualty insurers to pay customer claims in the event of a  catastrophic event and their willingness to make catastrophic coverage  available to their customers, particularly subsequent to catastrophes.  Several states\u2014including Florida and California\u2014have established  authorities to compensate insurers for certain natural catastrophe-related  losses and help ensure that catastrophe coverage is available. Additionally,  with the passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), the federal  government required primary insurance companies to make terrorism  coverage available to their commercial customers and provides substantial  compensation to the companies in the event of a foreign terrorist attack in  the United States. Insurance companies have made significant changes in  their approaches to providing coverage for natural catastrophes\u2014as  discussed in this report\u2014and some insurance and reinsurance companies  and capital market participants have developed catastrophe bonds, which  are a type of security that may be purchased by institutional investors and  cover certain insurer natural catastrophic risks. Proposals have also been  made that Congress and regulatory agencies take additional steps to  increase the capacity of the insurance industry to address catastrophe risk.  For example, a proposal has been made to change U.S. tax laws and  accounting standards to allow insurers to set aside funds on a tax- deductible basis to establish reserves for potential future natural  catastrophes or terrorist attacks.", "Because of your continuing concerns about the costs and consequences of  natural catastrophes and interest in minimizing the federal government\u2019s  potential financial exposure, you asked us to provide information on a  range of issues that would assist the committee in its oversight of the  insurance industry.

We also updated our previous work  on catastrophe bonds. In the six European countries we studied, we  obtained documents and interviewed officials representing insurance  supervisory authorities, insurance companies, insurance and business  associations, accounting firms, national catastrophe insurance programs,  and international and regional organizations.

For example, they charge  premiums for the coverage provided and establish underwriting standards  such as (1) refusing coverage to customers who may represent  unacceptable levels of risk or (2) limiting coverage offered in particular  areas. Establishing underwriting standards also allows insurers to  minimize the adverse consequences of \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d which is \u201cthe  incentive created by insurance that induces those insured to undertake  greater risk than if they were uninsured, because the negative  consequences are passed to the insurer.\u201d", "To manage potential financial exposures and also enhance their capacity,  insurance companies may also purchase reinsurance. Reinsurers  generally cover specific portions of the risk the primary insurer carries. For  example, a reinsurance contract could cover 50 percent of all claims  associated with a single event up to $100 million from a hurricane over a  specified time period in a specified geographic area. This type of contract,  which specifies payments based on the insurer\u2019s actual incurred claims, is  called indemnity coverage. In turn, reinsurers act to limit their risks and  moral hazard on the part of primary insurers by charging premiums,  establishing underwriting standards, and maintaining close business  relationships with insurers that generally have been maintained over a long  period.", "In contrast to other types of insurance risks, catastrophic risk poses unique  challenges for primary insurers and reinsurers. To establish their exposures  and price insurance and reinsurance premiums, insurance companies need  to be able to predict with some reliability the frequency and severity of  insured losses. For example, the incidence of most property insurance  claims, such as automobile insurance claims, is fairly predictable, and  losses generally do not occur to large numbers of policyholders at the same  time. However, catastrophes are infrequent events that may affect many  households, businesses, and public infrastructure across large areas and  thereby result in substantial losses that can impair insurer capital levels.  Given the higher levels of capital that reinsurers must hold to address  major catastrophic events (for example, hurricanes or earthquakes with  expected annual occurrences of no more than 1 percent), reinsurers  generally charge higher premiums and restrict coverage for such events.  Further, as previously noted, in the wake of catastrophic events reinsurers  and insurers may sharply increase premiums and significantly restrict  coverage.", "The reinsurance market disruptions associated with the Andrew and  Northridge catastrophes provided an impetus for insurance companies and  others to find different ways of raising capital to help cover catastrophic  risk. The mid-1990s saw the development of catastrophe bonds, a capital  market alternative to reinsurance (in the sense that other parties assume  some of the insurer\u2019s risks). Catastrophe bonds generally (1) are sold to  qualified institutional investors such as pension or mutual funds; (2)  provide coverage for relatively severe types of events such as hurricanes  with an annual expected occurrence of 1 percent; and (3) pay relatively  high rates of interest and have less than investment-grade ratings (because  in some cases, investors may risk all of their principal if a specified  catastrophe occurs). Catastrophe bonds also potentially expose investors  to moral hazard because, absent the business relationships that typically  characterize primary insurers and reinsurers, investors may lack  information on insurer underwriting standards or the claims payment  process. That is, an insurer that has issued a catastrophe bond may have  incentives to lower its underwriting standards and offer coverage to riskier  insureds because investors have less ability to monitor the insurers\u2019 risk- taking than would a reinsurer with whom the insurer has done business for  years. To minimize moral hazard, most catastrophe bonds are triggered by  objective measures (also referred to as \u201cnonindemnity\u201d based coverage)  such as wind speed during a hurricane or ground movement during an  earthquake rather than insurer loss experience (indemnity-based).  However, nonindemnity based coverage exposes insurers to \u201cbasis risk,\u201d  which is the risk that the proceeds from the catastrophe bond will not be  related to the insurer\u2019s loss experience. For example, if a hurricane with a  specified wind speed occurs, the insurer would automatically receive the  proceeds of the catastrophe bond, which may be either higher or lower  than its actual losses. See appendix III for additional information on the  structure of catastrophe bonds.", "Because insurance markets have been severely disrupted by catastrophic  events, state and federal governments also have taken a variety of steps to  enhance the capacity of insurers to address catastrophic risk. For example,  Florida established FHCF to address hurricane risk, and California  established CEA to address earthquake risk. Although these programs  cover different risks and use different strategies as described in this report,  they share a similar goal in ensuring that insurers can withstand  catastrophic events and continue to make coverage available. Similarly,  Congress enacted TRIA in 2002 to ensure the continued availability of  terrorism insurance subsequent to the September 11 attacks. TRIA was  designed as a temporary program that would remain in place until the end  of 2005, when it was expected that insurers and reinsurers would have had  time to establish a market for terrorism insurance. However, Congress is  currently considering extending the 2005 deadline due to concerns about  whether insurers will offer terrorism insurance after the act\u2019s expiration.  See appendix II for more information about TRIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Enhancements to Insurer Capacity, Industry May Not Be Able to Address a Major Natural Catastrophe", "paragraphs": ["Despite steps taken in recent years to strengthen insurer capacity for  catastrophic risk, the industry has not yet been tested by a major  catastrophic event or series of events. Overall, insurers increased their  equity capital\u2014financial resources available to cover catastrophic and  other types of claims that exceed premium and investment income\u2014from  1990 through 2003, but this measure of capacity has limitations, and  therefore, the extent to which capacity has increased is not clear. For  example, insurers\u2019 exposures in risk-prone coastal and other areas have  also increased over time, which could partially offset the increase in equity  capital. However, state governments and insurers have taken other steps to  enhance industry capacity for catastrophic risk such as establishing state  authorities, implementing stronger building codes, and reportedly  implementing stronger underwriting standards. Several of these changes  appear to have facilitated the industry\u2019s ability to withstand the 2004  hurricanes better than the impacts of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, but a  more severe catastrophe or catastrophes could have significant financial  consequences for insurers and their customers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Equity Capital Can Measure Insurance Industry Capacity, but the Data Are Subject to Several Limitations", "paragraphs": ["The insurance industry\u2019s equity capital levels commonly are used to assess  capacity to cover catastrophic risk. As shown in figure 1, the Insurance  Services Office, Inc. (ISO) found that from 1990 through 2003 industry  equity capital increased from $194.8 billion to $347 billion on an inflation- adjusted basis. After steadily increasing for 18 years, insurers\u2019 equity  capital actually declined from 1999 to 2002 before rebounding in 2003.  Capital levels declined for a variety of reasons including a series of natural  catastrophes in the late 1990s, declining stock prices that particularly  affected the investments of large European reinsurers, and the losses  associated with the September 11 attacks. Insurer capital increased in 2003  for several reasons that include lower losses associated with natural  catastrophes. According to information from ISO, the industry\u2019s capital  level did not decline in 2004 even though insurers experienced significant  losses associated with the 2004 hurricane season.", "Although insurers\u2019 equity capital has generally increased over time, it is  difficult to determine whether the growth in insurer equity capital has  resulted in a material increase in the industry\u2019s relative capacity to pay  claims. Insurers may also face significant financial exposure in areas prone  to natural catastrophes such as the southeastern United States, which  could partially offset the increase in insurer capital over the years.  However, individual insurers do not make publicly available specific  information about the extent to which they write policies in risk-prone  areas, the terms offered on these policies, or the level of reinsurance that  they purchase to help cover these risks, which complicates assessments of  insurer capacity.", "We have also identified other limitations to using equity capital as a  measure of insurance industry capacity. First, in any given catastrophe,  only a portion of the industry\u2019s capital (and its other resources, such as  catastrophe reinsurance) is available to pay disaster claims because the  insurance industry as a whole does not pay catastrophe claims. Instead,  individual insurance companies pay claims on the basis of the damage that  particular catastrophes inflict on the properties they insure. An insurer  writing policies only in one state would not have to pay any claims if a  catastrophe occurred in another state. Second, only a portion of equity  capital would be available to cover catastrophe claims because the capital  may also be needed to pay claims from all of the other types of risk that  insurers have assumed should the experience of those risks prove  unfavorable.", "To better understand insurers\u2019 capacity to address natural catastrophe  risks, we contacted two rating agencies that monitor the insurance  industry. According to one rating agency official, most insurance  companies the agency rated in 2003 were financially secure. The rating  agency determines the financial strength of insurance companies and their  ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders by analyzing  companies\u2019 balance sheets, operating performance, and business profiles.  According to officials from one rating agency, when establishing an  insurance company\u2019s rating, the agency considers an insurer secure if the  company would have enough capital after a catastrophic event to maintain  the same rating. In other words, to maintain a secure rating, insurers must  demonstrate that they are able to absorb losses from a hurricane with a 1  percent chance of occurring annually or an earthquake with a .4 percent  chance of occurring annually. Officials from one rating agency told us that  of the 1,058 ratings it issued in 2003, 904 companies obtained secure  ratings, meaning that they would be able to meet ongoing obligations to  policyholders and withstand adverse economic conditions, such as major  catastrophes, over a long period of time. Conversely, 164 insurance  companies obtained vulnerable ratings, meaning that they might have only  a current ability to pay claims or not be able to meet the current obligations  of policyholders at all. Although this rating agency\u2019s analysis concludes that  nearly 90 percent of insurers would remain financially secure under major  catastrophe scenarios, other information suggests that such events could  result in significant insurance market disruptions and the inability of  insurers to meet their financial obligations to policyholders.

According to officials from FHCF, Florida insurance regulators,  and insurance companies that offer coverage in the state, FHCF enhances  industry capacity by (1) offering reinsurance at lower rates than private  reinsurers for catastrophic risk, thereby increasing the number of primary  companies willing to write policies in the state; (2) ensuring that primary  companies will be compensated up to specified levels when a catastrophic  hurricane occurs; and (3) continuing to offer reinsurance at relatively  stable rates in the immediate aftermath of hurricanes. Residential property  insurers are required by state law to participate in the FHCF program.  Coverage from FHCF is triggered when participating companies\u2019 losses  meet their share of an aggregate industry retention level of $4.5 billion, and  coverage is capped at $15 billion. FHCF is financed from three sources:  actuarially-based premiums charged to participating insurers, investment  earnings, and emergency assessments on Florida insurance companies if  needed. FHCF may also issue bonds to meet its obligations. In 2002,  Florida also established Citizens Property Insurance Corporation  (Citizens), a state-run, tax-exempt primary insurer that offers coverage for  a premium to homeowners who cannot obtain property insurance from  private companies. Citizens writes full residential coverage in all 67  Florida counties and wind-only coverage in the coastal areas of 29  counties.

Insurers that sell residential  property insurance in California must offer their policyholders separate  earthquake insurance. Companies can offer a private earthquake policy or  a CEA policy, but most choose the CEA policy. Only insurance companies  that participate in CEA can sell CEA policies. The funds to pay claims come  from premiums, contributions from and assessments on member insurance  companies, borrowed funds, reinsurance, and the return on invested funds.

In March  2002, Florida instituted a statewide building code that implemented similar  requirements and replaced a complex system of 400 local codes. The  Florida Building Code was based on a national model code, which was  amended where necessary to address Florida\u2019s specific needs for added  hurricane protection requirements. The code also created a High Velocity  Hurricane Zone to continue use of the South Florida Building Code\u2019s design  and construction measures for the highly vulnerable Miami-Dade and  Broward counties. Local jurisdictions may amend the code to make it more  stringent when justified and are responsible for administering and  enforcing it.

To  generate the loss estimates, the computer programs use large databases  that catalog the past incidence and severity of natural catastrophes as well  as proprietary insurance company data on policies written in particular  states or areas. Using the estimates provided by these computer programs,  insurers can attempt to manage their exposures in particularly high-risk  areas. For example, an insurer could estimate the impact to the company of  a hurricane with specified wind speeds striking Miami, given the number of  policies that the insurer has written in the city as well as the value of  insured property. Based on these types of estimates, companies can  manage their risk and control their exposures (for example, by limiting the  number and volume of policies written in a particular area or purchasing  reinsurance if available on favorable terms) so that their losses are not  expected to exceed a particular threshold, such as a specified percentage  of their existing equity capital (a commonly used measure is from 10 to 20  percent of capital). According to industry officials we contacted, insurance  and reinsurance companies generally use the computer programs to have  greater confidence that they would have sufficient capital remaining to  meet their obligations to customers and remain in business even in the  aftermath of a major event.

The reinsurance company officials said  that each of the four hurricanes generally did not result in losses that  exceeded the primary companies\u2019 retention levels. Additionally,  reinsurers\u2019 exposures may have been limited because primary companies  only purchased reinsurance for one or two storms and may not have  purchased reinsurance coverage for a third or fourth storm.

Neither the 2004 hurricane season, as  discussed previously, nor Hurricane Andrew or the Northridge earthquake  qualified as an event with losses representing a 1 percent expected annual  occurrence, yet many insurers experienced significant losses and some  restricted coverage as a result of these catastrophes. It follows that a  more severe hurricane (or series of hurricanes) or earthquake with  estimated losses of $50 billion or more would have even more severe  consequences. For example, FHCF\u2019s total available financial resources of  $15 billion are intended to cover losses from a hurricane with an estimated  occurrence of about 2 percent annually (approximately a 1-in-50 year  event). If a more severe hurricane or series of hurricanes struck Florida,  FHCF would likely impose assessments on the insurance industry to cover  the costs of bonds issued to meet its obligations and its financial resources  would be exhausted. Insurers, in turn, might impose higher premiums on  policyholders to cover the cost of these assessments.

For example, a major  hurricane striking densely populated regions of Florida alone could cause  more than an estimated $50 billion in insured losses.", "As discussed in our previous reports, some insurance and reinsurance  companies view catastrophe bonds as an important means of diversifying  their overall strategy for transferring catastrophe risks, which traditionally  involves purchasing reinsurance or retrocessional coverage. By raising  funds from investors through the issuance of catastrophe bonds, insurers  can expand the pool of capital available to cover the transfer of  catastrophic risk. In addition, most of the catastrophe bonds issued provide  coverage for catastrophic risk with high financial severity and low  probability (such as events with an expected occurrence of no more than 1  percent annually). Consequently, none of the bonds issued to date that  include coverage of U.S. wind risk were triggered by the 2004 hurricane  season. According to various financial market representatives, because of  the larger amount of capital that traditional reinsurers need to hold for high  severity and lower-probability events, reinsurers limit their coverage and  charge increasingly higher premiums for these risks. Representatives from  one insurance company said that the company cannot obtain the amount of  reinsurance it needs for the highest risks at reasonable prices and has  obtained some of its reinsurance coverage in this risk category from  catastrophe bonds as a result.

That is, financial market participants told us that  insurers can be exposed to the credit risk of reinsurers not being able to  honor their reinsurance contracts if a natural catastrophe were to occur.  Catastrophe bonds, on the other hand, create little or no credit risk for  insurers because the funds are immediately deposited into a trust account  upon bond issuance to investors.

Insurer and state authority officials also said that they were  not attracted to catastrophe bonds because they generally covered events  with the lowest frequency and the highest severity. Rather, the officials said  that they would prefer to obtain coverage for less severe events expected  to take place more frequently. In addition, a recent study concluded that  the fact that most catastrophe bonds are issued on a nonindemnity basis  has limited the growth of the market because such bonds expose insurers  to basis risk (the risk that the provisions that trigger the catastrophe bond  will not be highly correlated with the insurer\u2019s loss experience).", "Representatives from some institutional investors said that the risks  associated with catastrophe bonds were too high or not worth the costs  associated with assessing the risks.

In contrast to natural  catastrophes, where a substantial amount of historical data on the  frequency and severity of events exists, terrorism risk poses challenges  because it is extremely difficult to reliably model the frequency and  severity of terrorist acts. Although several modeling firms are developing  terrorism models that are being used by insurance companies to assist in  their pricing of terrorism exposure, most experts we contacted said these  models were too new and untested to be used in conjunction with a bond  covering risks in the United States.

Supporters also argue that  they would lower the costs associated with providing catastrophic  coverage and encourage insurers to charge lower premiums, which would  increase catastrophic coverage among policyholders. Moreover, as  mentioned in our discussion of catastrophe bonds, the risk exists that  reinsurers might not be able to honor their reinsurance contracts if a  natural catastrophe were to occur. Allowing insurers to establish tax- deductible reserves could help ensure that funds are available to pay claims  if a catastrophe were to take place. Finally, information from NAIC states  that under current accounting rules, insurers are not required to fully  disclose the financial risks that they face from natural catastrophes and  that these risks are not accounted for on insurers\u2019 balance sheets.

The proposal  would specify that either insurers\u2019 losses reach a certain level or that  industry catastrophe losses exceed $10 billion for insurers to make a  drawdown on the reserve.", "However, there are potential tradeoffs associated with allowing insurers to  establish tax-deductible reserves for potential catastrophes. In particular,  permitting tax-deductible reserves would result in lower federal tax  receipts according to industry analysts we contacted.

In addition, Treasury  staff said that there would be no guarantee that insurance companies  would actually increase the capital available to cover catastrophic risks.  Rather, the officials said that insurers might use the reserves to shield a  portion of their existing capital (or retained earnings) from the corporate  income tax. Furthermore, reinsurance association officials said that  insurance companies could inappropriately use tax-deductible reserves to  manage their financial statements. That is, insurers could increase the  reserves during good economic times and decrease them in bad economic  times. In addition, Treasury staff expressed skepticism about the reliability  of models used to predict the frequency and severity of catastrophes.  Without reliable models, Treasury staff said that it would be difficult to  determine the appropriate size of the catastrophe reserves. We note that  insurers have developed sophisticated models to predict the frequency and  severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and that these models  are currently considered more reliable than terrorism models.", "Finally, reinsurance association officials and an insurance industry analyst  who supports tax-deductible reserves said that some insurers might reduce  the amount of reinsurance coverage that they purchased if they were  allowed to establish reserves. Because reserving would also convey tax  advantages, some insurers might feel that they could limit the expense of  purchasing reinsurance. To the extent that insurers reduced their  reinsurance coverage in favor of tax-deductible reserves, the industry\u2019s  overall capacity would not necessarily increase. We also note that  reinsurance is a global business and that reinsurers in other countries,  particularly European countries and Bermuda, provide a significant  amount of reinsurance for U.S. insurers. Since many European insurers in  the countries we studied are already permitted to establish tax-deductible  reserves (as described in the next section) and Bermuda reinsurers are not  subject to an income tax, any potential enhancement of insurer capacity  associated with granting U.S. insurers the authority to establish such  reserves may be limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "European Countries Use a Mix of Approaches to Insure Natural Catastrophes, and Most Countries Studied Have National Terrorism Insurance Programs", "paragraphs": ["European countries also face significant risks associated with natural  catastrophes and terrorist attacks, and have developed a range of  approaches to enhance insurers\u2019 capacity to address catastrophic risks.

French law  requires standard property insurance policies to include coverage for  natural catastrophes. According to information from the French  government, between 95 and 98 percent of the population has taken out  this comprehensive insurance and thus benefits from CatNat coverage. To  cover natural catastrophe risk, insurers collect a government-determined  12 percent premium surcharge from policyholders. Insurers may then  choose to forgo reinsurance for natural catastrophes or purchase  reinsurance from the private market or the Caisse Centrale de R\u00e9assurance  (CCR), a state-backed company authorized by law to reinsure natural  catastrophe risk. CCR offers unlimited reinsurance coverage that is  guaranteed by the French government in the event that CCR exhausts its  resources. However, a CCR official noted that insurance companies must  transfer half of their natural catastrophe risk to CCR in order to be covered  under the state guarantee. According to one insurance broker and a French  Treasury official, most insurers in France reinsure their natural catastrophe  risk through CCR to obtain the state guarantee coverage.", "Under the French program, the government must declare that an event  qualifies as a natural disaster. According to information from the French  government and a CCR official, the program is set up so that insurers  manage policyholders\u2019 claims because they have the best claims-paying  experience and expertise. Coverage from CCR takes effect after insureds  pay a certain deductible. Since the program was started in 1982, France  has declared 110,000 natural disasters and paid \u20ac6.4 billion (about $8.6  billion) in compensation, over half of which was for floods.

Originally established to provide indemnity to victims from the Spanish  Civil War, the Consorcio now provides coverage for catastrophic risks not  specifically covered under private-sector insurance policies or when an  insurance company cannot fulfill its obligations. According to a  Consorcio official, natural catastrophe coverage is mandatory and  automatically included in standard policies, and although Spanish law does  not require the purchase of standard property insurance policies, most  people do have insurance because banks require it as a condition of  mortgages. As a result, most property is covered for natural catastrophes.  The Consorcio uses data from private insurers and its own claims data to  calculate the standard surcharge rate for different types of properties (such  as housing, offices, industrial sites, and public works). As in France,  insurers collect this surcharge from all policyholders\u2019 property insurance  premiums. Unlike in France, where insurers may use the surcharge  collected to purchase reinsurance coverage from CCR or private reinsurers  (or to cover the costs associated with retaining natural catastrophe risk),  Spanish insurers must transfer the surcharge to the Consorcio on a  monthly basis and in return receive a 5 percent collection commission that  is tax deductible. The Consorcio\u2019s catastrophe coverage protects the same  property or persons to at least the same level as risks covered under the  primary insurance policy from the private insurer.

Even though private insurers have been allowed to provide natural  catastrophe coverage since 1990 few, if any, do so. Because their risks  would not be as geographically diversified as the Consorcio\u2019s (since it  provides coverage to policyholders across the country), private insurers  would not be able to charge rates competitive with the Consorcio. In  addition, a Consorcio official said that even if insurers provided  policyholders with natural catastrophe coverage, the insurers would still  have to pay the Consorcio surcharge. Unlike France, no official  government declaration of a disaster is required for this coverage to take  effect. Coverage from the Consorcio is automatic whenever any of the  specified catastrophes occurs. The Spanish system also differs from the  French system in that, according to a Consorcio official, the Consorcio  compensates policyholders directly for their losses.

The natural catastrophe coverage became a requirement in law in  1992. In addition, Switzerland now has regulations controlling building in  areas such as avalanche zones and flood plains.

Extremus provides voluntary coverage for  commercial and industrial properties and business interruption losses in  Germany with an insured value above \u20ac25 million (about $34 million). The  premium rate for coverage from Extremus is a standard rate based on the  value of the property insured, with no differentiation according to risk or  location of the property. Unlike the French and Spanish programs, the  guarantee from the German government is capped at \u20ac8 billion (about $10.7  billion) and would take effect after insurers and reinsurers had absorbed  \u20ac2.0 billion (about $2.7 billion) in losses (see fig. 8). The total capacity of  the program therefore is \u20ac10 billion (about $13 billion). According to an  Extremus official, the state guarantee was limited to 3 years, and the  government will have to decide whether to continue the guarantee after  2005.", "Demand for terrorism coverage from Extremus has been much lower than  expected, according to Extremus officials. In the first year of business,  Extremus had a goal of collecting \u20ac300 million (about $403 million) in  premiums, which was increased to \u20ac500 million (about $671 million) in the  following years, but collected only \u20ac105 million in premiums (about $141  million). In addition, many of the contracts were from smaller businesses.  As a result, Extremus renegotiated its reinsurance contracts and the level  of the state guarantee was reduced in March 2004. Extremus originally  planned to phase out the state guarantee by building up sufficient reserves  to handle potential claims. However, premium income has been too low to  build a substantial reserve. Extremus continues to struggle to meet its  goals, as five large clients did not renew their policies in 2004.  Representatives from an organization representing German businesses told  us that several factors may have contributed to low demand, including  the perception of many insureds that they were at a low risk of a  terrorism attack and that Extremus coverage would not be cost- effective;   gaps in Extremus coverage (for example, Extremus only covers  properties within Germany and excludes liability coverage); and   competition from other international insurers and reinsurers that could  offer coverage similar to Extremus.", "An official from Extremus told us that the company is considering making  changes to its underwriting based on these concerns\u2014such as covering  business interruption risks for subsidiaries of German companies located  in other European Union countries if an attack occurred in one of these  countries.", "In the United Kingdom, the Pool Reinsurance Company, Limited (Pool Re)  provides terrorism coverage, which is similar to the French and Spanish  programs in that the state provides an unlimited guarantee but also similar  to the German system in that participation by insureds is voluntary. Pool Re  was established in 1993 by the insurance market with support from the  British government in response to restrictions on the availability of  reinsurance following several terrorism incidents in London related to the  situation in Northern Ireland at that time. Pool Re is a mutual insurance  company that operates to provide reinsurance coverage for only  commercial property damage and business interruption as a result of a  terrorist act. While terrorism coverage is optional in the United Kingdom  and membership in Pool Re is voluntary, Pool Re members are required to  provide terrorism coverage to policyholders if requested, and members  must reinsure all of their terrorism coverage with Pool Re. Similarly,  insureds cannot select which properties in the United Kingdom are insured  for terrorism. If they choose to purchase terrorism insurance, they must  insure either all of their properties or none of them. According to one Pool  Re official, this policy prevents adverse selection from occurring (that is,  the risk that Pool Re\u2019s portfolio would include only the riskiest properties  and not be diversified). Pool Re\u2019s rates are determined by geographic zone  in the United Kingdom. For example, rates are higher for properties located  in London than for properties in other parts of the country. Business  interruption coverage is offered at a standard rate throughout the country.  Members are free to set their own terrorism premiums for their underlying  policies. Prior to the September 11 attacks, Pool Re coverage was limited to  acts of terrorism resulting in fire and explosion, according to a Pool Re  official. However, after the September 11 attacks, reinsurers began  excluding damage caused by perils other than fire and explosion. As a  result, Pool Re agreed, in consultation with the U.K. Treasury, members,  and insurance industry participants, to expand its coverage to include  other conventional perils beyond fire and explosion and also the risk of  nuclear, biological, and chemical attacks.", "In the event of an attack, the British government issues a certificate  determining the event to be an act of terrorism. Coverage from Pool Re  takes effect after members pay individual retention levels, which are  calculated as proportions of an industrywide figure based on the degree of  members\u2019 participation in Pool Re. For 2004, the industrywide retention  level is \u00a3100 million (about $194 million). If the resources of Pool Re are  exhausted, the British government provides an unlimited guarantee. Pool  Re pays the government a premium for this guarantee and would have to  repay the Treasury any amount received from the guarantee. This  guarantee has never been triggered. Since 1993, Pool Re has paid a total of  \u00a3612 million (about $1.2 billion) and currently has about \u00a31.5 billion in  reserves (about $2.9 billion). The largest event for which Pool Re paid  claims occurred in 1993, and resulted in payments totaling \u00a3262 million  (about $509 million)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Italy and Switzerland Have Not Implemented National Terrorism Insurance Programs", "paragraphs": ["Italy and Switzerland do not have national terrorism programs, and the  availability of terrorism insurance is limited.

These tax-deductible reserves are often called catastrophe or  equalization reserves. However, each country differs in the way it allows  reserves to be set-up and used (see fig. 9).", "Following are brief descriptions of each European country\u2019s approach for  establishing and maintaining catastrophe and equalization reserves:   According to an insurance industry official, French accounting  standards and tax law allow insurance companies to establish both  catastrophe and equalization reserves. A French insurance industry  participant told us that these reserves can be used for natural events  such as storms and hail, but also for nuclear, pollution, aviation, and  terrorism risks. The industry officials also said that under French  accounting standards and tax law, the maximum limit on the tax- deductible amount that can be put into these reserves is 75 percent of  the income for each year, provided that the total amount of the reserve  does not exceed 300 percent of annual income. The funds reserved each  year are released after 10 years if not used. However, neither the  regulator nor the French accounting standards provides guidance on  when money can be withdrawn from the reserves.", "German commercial law requires insurance companies to establish  catastrophe and equalization reserves for catastrophic risk, according to  German accounting firm officials. These officials said that catastrophe  reserves cover losses from nuclear, pharmaceutical liability, and  terrorism risks but cannot be used for natural catastrophes. Instead,  insurance companies can use equalization reserves to manage losses  from natural catastrophes. To prevent abuse of the reserves, the  accounting firm officials said that German accounting standards contain  specific guidance for calculating the additions, withdrawals, and limits  on both catastrophe and equalization reserves for different lines of  businesses. The officials also said that under German tax law, these  reserves are tax deductible.", "According to an Italian government official, the insurance supervisory  authority in Italy requires insurance companies to establish catastrophe  reserves for nuclear risk and natural catastrophes such as earthquakes  and volcanic eruptions, but reserves are not permitted for terrorism  risk. The official also said that equalization reserves are required for hail  and other climate risks. Under Italian accounting standards and tax law,  the government official said that catastrophe and equalization reserves  are built through tax-deductible contributions. In addition, the official  noted that although there are specific limits on the total amount  companies can hold in reserve for each type of risk, currently there are  no regulations for determining the amounts of additions and  withdrawals for these reserves.", "According to Spanish government and insurance industry officials,  Spanish insurance regulators allow the state-owned insurer, the  Consorcio, and private insurance companies to establish catastrophe  reserves for catastrophic events and equalization reserves for other  liability risks such as automobile. However, as previously discussed, the  Consorcio effectively handles all natural catastrophe and terrorism  risks, and therefore, insurance industry officials told us that private  insurers do not need catastrophe reserves. According to Spanish tax law  and accounting standards, catastrophe reserves are tax deductible and  are accrued in the liability accounts on the balance sheet. Spanish  accounting firm officials said that the funds in the Consorcio\u2019s  catastrophe reserve are tax deductible to a certain limit. Once the  reserved funds exceed this limit, they are taxed. The accounting firm  officials also said that there is no regulation controlling the amount of  funds the Consorcio has to maintain in its reserve and no formula for  contributions to and withdrawals from the reserve. However, a  Consorcio official told us that the Consorcio\u2019s general practice is to  maintain an amount in reserve equal to three times the highest amount  of claims it had ever paid in a year.", "According to a Swiss accounting firm official, under Swiss tax and  accounting standards, insurance companies are allowed to establish tax- deductible catastrophe reserves provided the Federal Office of Private  Insurance (the Swiss insurance supervisory body) approves a  justification of the reserve. The official said that currently, there are no  explicit regulations on how the contributions, withdrawals, or total  amount of reserves should be calculated. Instead, the Swiss supervisory  body provides guidance on a case-by-case basis on how to increase and  withdraw reserves. According to government officials, the insurance  supervisory authority is currently developing new solvency standards,  which include more explicit rules to ensure consistency and  standardization in calculating contributions and balances of the  reserves. Although Swiss tax and accounting standards generally allow  catastrophe reserves and Swiss insurance companies could establish  these reserves on the individual company level, insurance industry  officials said that not many companies that are organized into insurance  groups have them on a consolidated level (for example, the reserves are  not included in the combined financial statements of an insurance  group, which may have individual affiliates or subsidiaries in many  different countries). According to the accounting firm official, these  reserves would be eliminated on the consolidated level if Swiss GAAP  FER or another internationally accepted accounting framework that  prohibits such reserves is used.", "In the United Kingdom, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the  regulatory body for the financial services industry, requires insurance  companies to establish equalization reserves for property and other  types of insurance, according to a British accounting firm official. This  official said that under U.K. accounting standards and tax law, these  reserves are tax deductible and are accrued in the liability accounts of  the balance sheet. The Interim Prudential Sourcebook for Insurers,  published by FSA, contains detailed accounting rules for the calculation  of the reserve, including the contributions, withdrawals, and maximum  balances of the equalization reserves. However, the accounting firm  official said that U.K. accounting standards do not permit a separate  catastrophe reserve.", "In March 2004, as part of an effort to achieve global convergence of  accounting standards, the International Accounting Standards Board  (IASB) issued International Financial Reporting Standard 4 Insurance  Contracts (IFRS 4), which includes guidance that effectively prohibits the  use of catastrophe and equalization reserves. Under the new international  accounting standards, loss reserves can only be accrued if the event has  occurred and the related losses are estimable. IFRS 4 presents several  arguments in favor of prohibiting the use of reserves for future catastrophic  events. For example, provisions for such reserves do not necessarily  qualify as liabilities because the losses have not occurred yet and treating  them as if they had could diminish the relevance and reliability of an  insurer\u2019s financial statements. As previously mentioned, some analysts  argue that reserves would ensure funds were available to pay claims in the  event of a catastrophe. However, IASB argues that the general purpose of  financial reporting is not to enhance solvency, but to provide information  that is useful to a wide range of users for economic decisions.", "In November 2004, the European Union (EU) endorsed IFRS 4, and  specified that only companies listed on their respective national stock  exchanges, as well as companies with listed debt, be required to prepare  their consolidated financial statements (for example, the combined  financial statements of an insurance group, which may have individual  affiliates or subsidiaries in many different countries) in accordance with  IFRS 4. However, the EU gives member states the option of permitting or  requiring these individual affiliates or subsidiaries to follow IFRS 4  requirements in preparing their individual financial statements. EU  countries also have the option of allowing unlisted companies to follow  these standards. For example, according to government and Consorcio  officials, Spanish insurance regulators have decided to exercise this option  and prohibit the Consorcio\u2014an unlisted company\u2014from following IFRS 4.  According to the EU regulation, the designated insurance companies are  required to follow IFRS 4, starting with financial statements prepared on or  after January 1, 2005.", "European officials we contacted in some cases expressed differing views  on the elimination of catastrophe and equalization reserves under IFRS 4. A  European Commission official indicated that European insurance  companies should be able to cope with the elimination of catastrophe and  equalization reserves because individual companies could still establish  and maintain the reserves for tax purposes, but the reserves would be  eliminated in the financial statements on a consolidated level. In the  consolidation for financial reporting, the reserves would be moved from  liabilities to equity. Representatives from a large German accounting firm  said that German insurance companies would most likely prepare two sets  of financial statements. One would exclude reserves and comply with the  international accounting standards, and the other would include the  reserves and be submitted to the taxation authorities, similar to U.S.  practices. However, insurance industry participants in some of the  European countries that we reviewed expressed the following concerns  about the provision eliminating reserves:   Insurance industry officials in France stated that reserving is essential  as a precaution for coverage of natural catastrophe risks. In addition,  representatives from a large German accounting firm said that reserves  provide transparency in financial reporting and help users of financial  statements to better understand insurers\u2019 risk management practices.", "One insurance industry representative expressed concern that having  two sets of financial statements would result in complexities and  ambiguities in financial reporting and national tax regulations and  policies.", "Other officials said they are concerned that the local taxation  authorities might follow IFRS 4 and change their policies to discontinue  the use of tax-deductible reserves. Insurers might have to respond by  purchasing reinsurance in order to obtain coverage for catastrophic  risks, which the reserves would have provided.", "As of the time of this review we were not aware of any changes in these  countries\u2019 regulations or tax laws regarding the use of catastrophe reserves  for tax purposes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["The insurance industry may not be able to withstand major catastrophic  events without federal government intervention. Although the industry has  improved its ability to respond to the losses associated with natural  catastrophes\u2014at least those on the scale of the 2004 hurricane season\u2014 without widespread market disruptions, industry capacity has not yet been  tested by a major catastrophe (such as an event with an expected annual  occurrence of no more than 1 percent to .4 percent). Such a catastrophe or  series of catastrophes could result in significant disruptions to insurance  markets. In addition, it is not clear how state governments and insurers  would react to such a scenario, restore stability to insurance markets, and  ensure the continued availability of critical insurance coverage, or whether  they would have the capacity to do so. Moreover, because of the federal  government\u2019s size and financial resources, it could be called upon to  provide financial assistance to insurers and policyholders in addition to  traditional obligations, such as repairing public facilities and providing  temporary assistance to affected individuals.", "It is also not yet clear the extent to which the catastrophe bond market or  authorizing insurers to establish tax-deductible reserves has the potential  to materially enhance industry capacity and thereby mitigate financial risks  to the federal government and others. Although several insurers use  catastrophe bonds to address the most severe types of catastrophic risk,  the bonds are not yet widely accepted in the insurance industry due to cost  and other factors. In addition, some industry participants question the  viability of the catastrophe bond market because no catastrophe bond has  ever been triggered, even by the 2004 hurricane season. Further, industry  participants do not consider catastrophe bonds feasible for terrorism risks  at this time. Although supporters believe that authorizing tax-deductible  reserves could enhance industry capacity, such a policy change would also  reduce federal tax revenue and may not materially enhance capacity since  the reserves may substitute for reinsurance.", "In response to the financial and market risks associated with natural  catastrophes and terrorism attacks, major European countries have, with  important exceptions, generally adopted policies that rely on national  government intervention to enhance industry capacity to a greater extent  than is the case in the United States. France, Spain, and to some extent  Switzerland (but not Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy) have  adopted national programs to address a range of natural catastrophe risk,  whereas the United States government does not have a comparable  program (although it does have a flood insurance program as discussed in  app. II). Further, all six countries we studied use their tax codes to  encourage insurers to establish reserves for potential catastrophic events.  A key similarity between Europe and the United States is that four of the  six countries we reviewed have adopted national programs to address  terrorism risk similar in many respects to TRIA. One important difference  is that TRIA was designed as a temporary program that was expected to be  discontinued when a private market for terrorism insurance could be  established, whereas the European programs are generally not expected to  be discontinued.", "European approaches to addressing natural catastrophe and terrorism  risks illustrate benefits and drawbacks that may be useful for consideration  by policymakers. The mandatory national programs for natural catastrophe  risk in Spain and France, for example, help ensure that coverage is widely  available for such risks, particularly in the wake of catastrophic events.  However, such programs also involve significant government intervention  in insurance markets, such as setting premium rates, which may not be  actuarially based. Consequently, the capability of governments and insurers  to control risk-taking by policyholders and minimize potential government  liabilities may be limited, although some governments have tried to  minimize this liability by implementing loss prevention programs.  Concerning terrorism insurance, the mandatory national programs in  France and Spain ensure that most policyholders have such coverage,  although these programs also involve government intervention in setting  premium rates and in monitoring risk-taking as is the case for natural  catastrophe risk. In contrast, the purely voluntary national terrorism  program in Germany and the private sector approaches in Switzerland and  Italy have not yet been successful in ensuring that policyholders have  terrorism coverage. Many policyholders choose not to purchase terrorism  coverage because they view their risks as acceptably low or the premiums  for terrorism coverage as too high (see app. II for a similar discussion  regarding TRIA)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of the Treasury and  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

TRIA caps the  federal government\u2019s and the industry\u2019s exposure to terrorist attacks at  $100 billion annually. TRIA also requires that all insurers selling  commercial lines of property-casualty insurance make available coverage  for certain terrorist events and defines make available to mean that the  coverage must be offered for insured losses arising from certified terrorist  events and not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and limitations  applicable to coverage for other insured losses.

In 2005, primary insurers\u2019 financial  exposure is limited to 15 percent of their direct earned premiums (DEP),  and they are responsible for 10 percent of losses above that amount while  the federal government is responsible for the remaining 90 percent.  Determining individual insurer\u2019s financial exposures depends upon varying  scenarios of the potential costs associated with terrorist attacks (for  example, to what extent the cost of the attack would exceed 15 percent of  an insurer\u2019s DEP and the insurer\u2019s 10 percent share of any losses beyond  that amount).", "Since TRIA\u2019s make available provisions do not apply to reinsurers, these  companies have discretion in deciding how much terrorism coverage to  offer to primary companies.

The Federal Emergency Management Administration  (FEMA), which administers the program, estimates that one-half to two- thirds of structures in special flood hazard areas do not have flood  insurance coverage because the uninsured owners either are unaware that  homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage or do not perceive the  flood risk to which they are exposed as serious. Flood insurance is required  for some of these properties, but the level of noncompliance with this  requirement is unknown.

However, a more recent study estimates that nearly 50 percent of  commercial property owners purchased terrorism insurance mid-2004.

The  catastrophe bond offering defines a catastrophe that would trigger a loss of  investor principal and, if triggered, a formula to specify the compensation  level from the investor to the SPRV. The SPRV holds the funds from the  catastrophe bond offering in a trust in the form of Treasury securities and  other highly rated assets. The SPRV then deposits the payments from the  investors as well as the premium income from the company into a trust  account. The premium paid by the insurance or reinsurance company and  the investment income on the trust account provide the funding for the  interest payments to investors and the costs of running the SPRV. If no  event occurs that triggers the bond\u2019s provisions and it matures, the SPRV  pays investors the principal and interest that they are owed.  typically are offered only to qualified institutional investors under  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 144A;  produce relatively high returns, either equaling or exceeding the returns  on some comparable fixed-rate investments such as high-yield  corporate debt;  typically do not receive investment-grade ratings because bondholders  face potentially large losses on the securities; and typically cover event  risks that are considered the lowest probability and highest severity.", "Most catastrophe bonds are issued through SPRVs located offshore\u2014in  jurisdictions such as Bermuda\u2014rather than in the United States. Unlike the  United States, several of these jurisdictions exempt SPRVs from income or  other taxes, which provides financial incentives for insurers to issue  catastrophe bonds offshore. The National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC) and some insurance industry groups have argued  that insurers should be encouraged to issue catastrophe bonds onshore to  lessen transaction costs and afford regulators greater scrutiny of SPRV  activities. Some insurance industry groups have advocated that Congress  change U.S. tax laws so that SPRVs would not be subject to income tax but  instead receive \u201cpass-through\u201d treatment similar to that afforded mortgage- backed securities. In other words, the SPRV would not be taxed on the  investment income from the trust account, and the tax would be passed on  to the investor. Eliminating taxation at the SPRV level with pass-through  treatment might facilitate expanded use of catastrophe bonds, but such  legislative actions might also create pressure from other industries for  similar tax treatment. In addition, to the extent that domestic SPRVs gained  business at the expense of taxable entities, the federal government could  lose tax revenue.", "Our previous reports also stated that NAIC\u2019s current statutory accounting  requirements might affect insurers\u2019 use of nonindemnity-based financial  instruments such as many catastrophe bonds. Under statutory accounting,  an insurance company that buys traditional indemnity-based reinsurance  or issues an indemnity-based catastrophe bond can reflect the transfer of  risk (effected by the purchase of reinsurance) on the financial statements  that it files with state regulators. As a result of the risk transfer, the  insurance company can improve its stated financial condition and may be  willing to write additional insurance policies. However, statutory  accounting rules currently do not allow insurance companies to obtain a  similar credit for using nonindemnity-based financial instruments that  hedge insurance risk\u2014which can include nonindemnity-based catastrophe  bonds\u2014and may therefore limit the appeal of these types of catastrophe  bonds to potential issuers. Statutory accounting standards treat indemnity-  and nonindemnity-based products differently because instruments that are  nonindemnity-based have not been viewed as providing a true risk transfer.  Although NAIC\u2019s Securitization Working Group has approved a proposal  that would allow reinsurance-like accounting treatment for such  instruments, NAIC\u2019s Statutory Accounting Committee must give final  approval. The committee met in June 2004, but has not yet made a decision  on this issue.", "Finally, we reported in 2003 that the Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB) had issued guidance under GAAP that had the potential to limit the  appeal of catastrophe bonds. Specifically, under the provisions of FASB  Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46),  variable interest entities, which include most catastrophe bond structures,  were subject to consolidation on issuers\u2019 financial statements. This  provision had the potential to raise the costs associated with issuing  catastrophe bonds and make them less attractive to issuers. Our September  2003 report stated that the impact of FIN 46 on the use of catastrophe  bonds was unclear because insurers and financial market participants were  not certain whether it would require insurers or investors to consolidate  catastrophe bond assets and liabilities on their financial statements. In  December 2003, FASB issued FIN 46R, revised guidance that eliminated  some of the requirements for consolidation. One large issuer of  catastrophe bonds we contacted consolidated some of its SPRVs in its  financial statements under the criteria set in FIN 46R. However, another  large issuer decided not to consolidate any of its SPRVs after evaluation of  the criteria set in FIN 46R."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Patrick S.
