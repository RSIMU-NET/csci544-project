To meet the needs of veterans with limited English proficiency (LEP), VA issued an LEP Directive that provides guidance for medical centers in assessing language needs and, if needed, developing language access services designed to ensure effective communication between English-speaking providers and those with LEP. In addition, VA is also challenged to deliver health care services in ways that are culturally appropriate--that is, respectful of and responsive to the cultural values of a diverse veteran population. In light of these challenges, GAO was asked to discuss the (1) actions VA has taken to implement its LEP Directive and the status of veterans' utilization of language access services, and (2) efforts VA has made to provide culturally appropriate health care services. GAO reviewed VA's policies and the LEP Directive, interviewed VA officials and reviewed efforts by 6 VA medical centers and 10 other VA facilities to implement VA's LEP Directive and to provide culturally appropriate health care services. GAO also reviewed documents from 17 other VA medical centers related to implementation of the LEP Directive."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VA reported that as of June 2007, all of its medical centers had taken action to implement the guidance in VA's LEP Directive. Specifically, medical center officials told VA that they had assessed the language needs of their veteran service populations, and, if necessary, developed language assistance policies and offered language access services, including providing translated materials and interpretation services. The VA medical centers GAO reviewed provided translated materials to meet the various language needs of their veteran service populations and offered interpretation services as well. For example, VA medical centers maintained a list of bilingual medical center staff who can provide interpretation services during a clinical encounter between a provider and a veteran with LEP. In addition, five of the six VA medical centers GAO reviewed can access telephone interpretation services that are provided through a contract to help ensure that medical staff can communicate with veterans and their families with LEP. According to officials at medical centers GAO reviewed, utilization of language access services is low. However, VA officials told GAO that they expect the demand for language access services to grow as the increasingly diverse military servicemember population transitions to veteran status. VA medical centers are addressing the need for culturally appropriate health care services through staff training and tailoring health care services. Medical centers provide training for medical center staff to facilitate the delivery of culturally appropriate health care services including an annual mandatory training on the health care needs of veterans in various age groups. VA medical centers and other VA facilities GAO reviewed have implemented a variety of measures to meet the needs of their culturally diverse veteran populations. For example, three VA facilities GAO reviewed offer spiritual services, such as the use of medicine men and traditional healing rituals, in order to meet the needs of Native American veterans. Also, VA has minority veterans program coordinators at each medical center to identify barriers to health care for minorities and advise medical center officials in developing services to make health care more accessible and culturally appropriate for minority veteran populations. VA medical centers GAO reviewed have also initiated outreach efforts to promote the availability of culturally appropriate care. In commenting on a draft of this report, VA stated that it agreed with the information presented as it pertained to VA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The veteran population served by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  will become more diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, sex, and age. VA data  show that racial and ethnic minorities account for about 20 percent of the  veteran population and that about 7 percent of veterans are women. We  reported in 2005 that racial and ethnic minorities accounted for about   33 percent of servicemembers in the military; about 16 percent of  servicemembers were women. Based on the higher diversity among  servicemembers in the military compared to veterans, VA officials  anticipate that the veteran population eligible to receive health care  services from VA will become more diverse as current members of the  military are discharged or released from active duty and transition to  veteran status. In addition to racial and ethnic diversity, VA has seen an  increase in the number of younger Operation Enduring Freedom and  Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans using VA health care services and  officials expect this number to continue to grow.", "As its veteran population becomes more diverse, VA faces challenges in  bridging language and cultural barriers as it seeks to provide quality health  care services to its veteran population. For example, a study  commissioned by the California Endowment and the Robert Wood  Johnson Foundation found that to help meet the needs of a diverse patient  population, health care institutions, such as VA medical facilities, should  provide language access services. Language access services are designed  to ensure effective communication between English speakers and those  with limited English proficiency (LEP). This may include providing  translated versions of informational brochures or consent forms and  making staff available who can interpret providers\u2019 instructions for  patients or their family members with LEP. Several studies have found that  the implementation of language access services in health care settings can  increase access to care, quality of care, and health outcomes.", "Research suggests that providing culturally appropriate health care  services is an integral part of quality health care, and that cultural factors  can have a significant influence on the delivery of health care services and  can compromise access for culturally diverse populations. At the federal  level, HHS has published a set of standards for medical facilities that state  that health care services should be delivered in ways that are culturally  appropriate\u2014that is, respectful of and responsive to the cultural values of  a diverse population. This can mean, for example, recognizing the role of  the extended family in medical decisions for a particular ethnic group and  including these individuals in discussions of a patient\u2019s medical care and  treatment. According to HHS\u2019s standards, providing culturally appropriate  services to culturally diverse patients has the potential to improve access  to care, quality of care, and ultimately, health outcomes. Prior to the  enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2008, there was no specific statutory requirement for VA to provide  culturally appropriate care. However, several provisions in the 2008 NDAA  require the consideration of the gender-, ethnic group-, or age-specific  needs of veterans, including a direction to provide age-appropriate nursing  home care.", "To meet the needs of persons with LEP, the President issued an executive  order in August 2000 that required all federal agencies to develop and  implement a system by which persons with LEP can have meaningful  access to the services provided by the agency. The order also instructs  federal agencies to work to ensure that recipients of federal financial  assistance provide meaningful access to their LEP applicants and  beneficiaries. According to the order, each agency must develop a plan  that outlines the steps the agency will take to ensure that persons with  LEP have meaningful access to the programs and services it provides. In  response to this order, in January 2002, VA issued a directive of its own\u2014 referred to in this report as the LEP Directive \u2014to assist VA programs,  including its medical centers, in providing appropriate language access  services for veterans with LEP. The LEP directive provides guidance to  medical centers and other facilities within VA to help them comply with  EO 13166; medical centers and other facilities that do not adopt all of the  specific practices outlined in the directive are not necessarily out of  compliance with the executive order as long as medical center officials  take reasonable steps to assess and meet the language needs of the  veteran service population. Additionally, because the diversity of the  veteran service population varies across VA medical centers, some  medical centers may not have a need to take all the actions identified in  VA\u2019s LEP Directive.", "In light of the increasing diversity of the veteran population in terms of  race, ethnicity, sex, and age, you asked for information about the steps VA  has taken to provide language access services for veterans and its efforts  to deliver health care services in ways that are culturally appropriate for  veterans\u2019 diverse cultural values. This report discusses the (1) actions VA  has taken to implement its LEP Directive and the status of veterans\u2019  utilization of available language access services, and (2) efforts VA has  made to provide culturally appropriate health care services. We did not  assess VA\u2019s compliance with EO 13166 and instead describe actions taken  under VA\u2019s LEP Directive in response to EO 13166.", "To describe the actions VA has taken to implement its LEP Directive as  well as veterans\u2019 utilization of available language access services and the  efforts VA has made to provide culturally appropriate health care services,  we reviewed an executive order, federal guidance, and VA policy and  procedures. We also selected five Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISN) to review. We selected these five VISNs based on the number of  racial and ethnic minority veterans living in each VISN and geographic  variation. Within these five VISNs we selected a judgmental sample of 16  VA facilities, including six VA medical centers, five community-based  outpatient clinics (CBOC), and five Vet Centers, to include in our review.  From our sample of VA facilities, we conducted site visits to medical  centers and associated CBOCs, and Vet Centers, located in Chicago,  Illinois; Durham, North Carolina; and Los Angeles, California. For the  remainder of VA facilities in our sample, we conducted in-depth telephone  interviews with medical center, CBOC, and Vet Center officials in Bath,  New York; Prescott, Arizona; and Richmond, Virginia. We conducted in- depth interviews with VA officials and staff from each of the 16 VA  facilities to learn about actions taken at their facility to provide language  access services for veterans with LEP, the utilization of these services, and  the efforts the facility has made to provide culturally appropriate health  care services. At the six VA medical centers we reviewed in depth, we  examined documents related to efforts by the centers to assess the  language needs of their service population and, if necessary, provide  language access services. In addition, we interviewed officials in each of  the five VISNs we selected for review. The information we collected from  the six medical centers and five VISNs we reviewed is not generalizable to  all VISNs and VA medical centers.", "Additionally, in order to obtain information on the steps VA has taken  through its medical centers to provide language access services under its  LEP Directive, we selected a random sample of 20 VA medical centers and  requested copies of language needs assessments conducted by medical  center officials and language assistance policies. We received  documentation from 17 of the 20 medical centers. We conducted follow-up  with the three medical centers that did not provide documentation but did  not receive the requested materials from them. We did not evaluate the  quality of the language needs assessments or language access policies  provided by the 17 medical centers or from the 6 medical centers we  visited or reviewed in depth. The information we collected from our  sample of 17 medical centers is not generalizable to all VA medical  centers. In addition to interviews we conducted with VA officials, we also  interviewed officials from the Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as  experts in the field of language access services and the provision of  culturally competent health care services. We conducted this  performance audit from February 2007 through March 2008, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access could include developing  language access services and guidance for implementing these services.  The EO required that each federal agency create a plan outlining steps it  will take consistent with DOJ guidance to ensure meaningful access to its  services by LEP individuals. The EO did not require DOJ to evaluate the  plans or to monitor the implementation of these plans.", "In 2002, in response to EO 13166, VA created and implemented VHA  Directive 2002-006. It provided a framework for VA medical centers to  assess and determine if there was a need to develop language assistance  policies and language access services. The medical centers retain  flexibility to determine exactly how they will comply with the EO, but they  must do so in accordance with the four factors as outlined by DOJ and  reiterated in the LEP Directive. In February 2007, VA issued VHA Directive  2007-009, which renewed VA\u2019s guidance on language assistance policies.  In its LEP Directive, VA outlined the steps that constitute an effective  language assistance program at its medical centers, including an  assessment of the language needs of the veteran population served and  identification of the non-English languages encountered by medical center  staff. If a VA medical center identifies a specific language need among its  veteran service population, VA\u2019s LEP Directive also indicated that the  medical center should develop and implement a language assistance policy  to ensure meaningful communication. According to the directive, the  policy should describe how the medical center plans to provide language  access services and ensure that all veterans receive meaningful access to  VA health care services, regardless of the veterans\u2019 level of English  proficiency. VA\u2019s LEP Directive also provided medical centers with  examples of ways to provide language access services\u2014including,  translating written materials, hiring bilingual staff, and contracting with  interpreter services.", "VA\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office is responsible for  overseeing the implementation of VA\u2019s LEP Directive. As such, this office  conducted surveys of VA medical centers to assess whether medical  center officials were following the steps outlined in the LEP Directive,  such as conducting an assessment of language needs, or otherwise taking  reasonable steps to provide language access services for veterans being  served.

The survey contained 10 \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions to gauge the  extent of medical centers\u2019 efforts to implement the LEP Directive. The  questions ranged from issues such as overall language assistance policies  to efforts to provide language access services. If a \u201cno\u201d response was  provided for any question, the medical center directors completing the  survey were instructed to indicate a tentative date by which they would  take action to address the item. VA required medical center directors and  VISN directors to ensure that the responses for individual medical centers  were completed. However, VA did not require that VISN or medical center  directors provide documentation to support their \u201cyes\u201d responses to the  survey.", "The results of the 2005 survey showed that 65 percent of VA medical  centers had assessed the language needs of their veteran service  population and that 60 percent of the centers had developed a language  assistance policy.

We found that all six medical centers in our  in-depth review translate written materials on their own. For example,  staff at one medical center we interviewed told us that they translated  educational materials on traumatic brain injuries into Spanish. However,  staff at the medical centers reported that they primarily rely on publicly  available translated documents rather than translating written materials on  their own because of the cost of independently translating documents. The  sources of these publicly available materials range from other federal  agencies to results of an Internet search. For example, according to VA  officials, patient educators at some medical centers use patient education  materials on a range of topics including heart disease and diabetes that  have been translated into Spanish by HHS\u2019s Food and Drug  Administration. VA medical center staff can also use materials translated  by staff at other medical centers. For example, staff at one medical facility  we reviewed reported that the VA medical center located in San Juan,  Puerto Rico, has shared patient education materials they have translated  into Spanish with other VA medical centers. Medical center staff we  interviewed also reported using professional groups within VA, such as  EEO managers or patient educators, to identify and share existing  translated materials. However, these groups are limited in their  membership and, as such, might not be aware of all translated materials  available at VA medical centers. Additionally, VA medical facilities  included in our review generally offer translated materials specific to the  services they provide, when needed. For example, one Vet Center we  reviewed translated a pamphlet on post-traumatic stress disorder into  Spanish for its largely Hispanic veteran service population.", "As part of language access services, VA medical centers we reviewed in  depth provide language interpretation services to help address the  language needs of veterans with LEP. Staff we interviewed at all six  medical centers we reviewed had the ability to provide interpretation  services to veterans with LEP and were doing so in several different ways.  For example, staff members at all six of these medical centers maintained  a list of bilingual medical center staff who volunteered to provide  interpretation services during a clinical encounter between a provider and  a veteran with LEP. Medical center staff primarily used people from this  list to provide needed interpretation services. In addition, staff at five of  the six VA medical centers had contract telephone interpretation services  available as a means to help effectively communicate with veterans and  their families with LEP. Moreover, two of the three medical centers we  visited advertised within the medical center, in languages other than  English, the availability of language interpretation services to veterans and  their families with LEP.

Vet Centers provide  language access services to veterans\u2019 family members with LEP to ensure  that they are able to participate in counseling sessions, such as marital and  family counseling. For example, at one Vet Center we visited, the entire  staff was bilingual to help accommodate the needs of its mostly Hispanic  veteran service population. In cases where bilingual staff were not  available, four of the five Vet Centers where we conducted interviews had  agreements with the local VA medical center to access its list of bilingual  staff available for interpretation services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Medical Center Officials Report Low Utilization of Language Access Services; However, Officials Expect the Demand for These Services to Grow", "paragraphs": ["Officials at the VA medical centers and facilities included in our in-depth  review reported that veterans seldom use VA\u2019s language access services.
