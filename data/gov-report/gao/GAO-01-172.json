After an initial rating for compensation has been determined, veterans who believe their condition has worsened may file a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to reevaluate their disability rating and potentially increase their monthly payments. In fiscal year 1999, these repeat claims outnumbered initial disability applications by nearly three to one, dominating VA\u2019s workload.", "VA\u2019s claims processing performance has caused concern for a number of years because of growing backlogs of pending initial and repeat claims, which have delayed disability decisions and veterans\u2019 receipt of compensation. To help reduce the volume of repeat claims, the Veterans\u2019 Claims Adjudication Commission, in its 1996 report, asked Congress to consider paying less severely disabled veterans compensation in a lump sum.According to the Commission, this change could have a number of benefits for VA as well as veterans. Specifically, the lump sum option could reduce the number of claims submitted and allow VA to process claims more quickly\u2014especially those of more seriously disabled veterans. Moreover, a lump sum option could be more useful to some veterans as they make the transition from military to civilian life.", "To learn how future veterans who become eligible for compensation might respond to a lump sum option, you asked us to survey veterans who are currently compensated. We are also providing information on (1) the advantages and disadvantages for veterans that veterans and military personnel believe would be associated with a one-time lump sum payment, (2) strategies veterans and military personnel have suggested for mitigating perceived disadvantages, and (3) other lump sum programs that may have relevance for VA disability compensation. For example, we reviewed the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) provisions for a lump sum severance payment to disabled military personnel.", "To conduct our work, we surveyed through a mail questionnaire a representative sample of compensated veterans and held focus groups with selected compensated veterans and active-duty military personnel. Our survey and focus groups captured views on a broadly defined hypothetical program that would give veterans the option of taking a one-time lump sum payment but would not allow them to reapply if the disability for which they were compensated worsened. We also discussed such a lump sum option with representatives from veteran service organizations; military service organizations; and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which administers VA disability compensation. In addition, we reviewed relevant studies on lump sum payments and obtained information about lump sums in other federal programs and six foreign countries. We did not assess the potential effects a lump sum option might have on either the disability claims workload or government cost. We performed our evaluation from August 1999 through November 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

More than half of initial applicants claim multiple disabilities, and veterans who believe their disabilities have worsened can reapply for higher ratings and more compensation. For veterans who claim more than one disability, VA rates each claim separately and then combines them into a single rating. About two-thirds of compensated veterans receive payments based on a rating of 30 percent or less. At the base compensation level, these payments range from $98 per month at 10-percent disability to $288 per month at 30-percent disability.Base compensation for veterans with a 100-percent disability rating is significantly higher\u2014$2,036 per month in 2000. Disability ratings are also used to determine eligibility for certain other VA benefits. For example, veterans with a 30-percent disability rating are entitled to an additional allowance for dependents, and those with higher ratings can become eligible for free VA nursing home care and grants to adapt housing for their needs. In addition, priority for care for VA health care is partly tied to disability ratings.", "VA has had long-standing difficulties in keeping up with its claims processing workload, resulting in increasing backlogs of pending claims.In fiscal year 1999, VA received approximately 468,000 compensation claims\u2014about 345,000 of which were repeat claims. More than 207,000 claims were still pending at the end of fiscal year 1999\u2014an increase of nearly 50 percent from the end of fiscal year 1996\u2014and the average processing time was 205 days. Of the 207,000 pending claims, about 69,000 were initial claims, and about 138,000 were repeat claims.", "In its 1996 report, the Veterans\u2019 Claims Adjudication Commission observed that 56 percent of veterans with pending repeat claims were rated as 30- percent or less disabled. Questioning whether VA should expend a significant share of its resources processing claims for veterans who are already compensated and have relatively minor disabilities, the Commission raised the possibility of offering lump sum payments to veterans with minimal disabilities. Other federal agencies have established this type of payment program. For example, under DOD\u2019s disability program, mandatory lump sum payments are given to separating military personnel with less than 20 years of service and a disability rating of less than 30 percent, and the Department of Labor allows injured civilian federal employees to request lump sum payments for bodily loss or impairment instead of the scheduled duration of weekly payments.", "Six countries\u2014Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, and Japan\u2014provide lump sum payments to at least some of their disabled veterans. Britain, Canada, Israel, and Japan make these payments to veterans with minor disabilities, while Germany supplements veterans\u2019 pensions with a lump sum payment for those whose ability to work has been severely restricted. For peacetime service, Australia pays lump sum compensation for noneconomic losses from permanent impairments; it also provides a lump sum payment for a reduced capacity to work, if the incapacity is likely to be stable and would otherwise entitle the veteran to only a relatively small weekly pension."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reactions to a Lump Sum Option Are Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Veterans\u2019 views captured through our survey and focus groups were based on the following features of both the lump sum and monthly payment options:", "Both types of payment\u2014monthly and lump sum\u2014would be tax-free.", "Under both types of payment, veterans would continue to be entitled to VA medical and other current benefits.", "Under the monthly payment system, veterans could reapply for increased payments for a worsening disability; under the lump sum system, veterans could not reapply for additional payments for a worsening disability for which a lump sum had been received.", "When the lump sum recipient dies, the surviving family would not have to repay any portion of the lump sum.", "Reactions to this hypothetical framework yielded no clear consensus among compensated veterans about whether a choice between monthly payments and a lump sum should be offered to newly compensated veterans. Among compensated veterans, 49 percent said they would definitely or probably support a lump sum option for newly compensated veterans, 43 percent said they would definitely or probably not support it, and 8 percent were unsure. Respondents whose views were \u201cdefinite\u201d were also about equally split\u2014about 24 percent definitely supported offering a choice, and about 28 percent definitely opposed it (see fig. 1).", "Veterans\u2019 responses indicate that experience could influence interest in taking a lump sum payment. Among all veterans, 32 percent reported they would have been interested in taking a lump sum payment when first compensated had such an option been available.Half as many\u201416 percent\u2014reported that, knowing what they know today, it would have been a good choice for them. This ratio was borne out among supporters of offering a lump sum choice\u201456 percent indicated they would have been interested in a lump sum payment, and 28 percent said it would have been a good choice for them.", "Age and severity of disability also seemed to influence the degree of interest in taking a lump sum payment. For example, among veterans aged 43 or younger, 46 percent reported they definitely or probably would have been interested in taking a lump sum payment, compared to 21 percent of veterans aged 61 or older.Similarly, among veterans whose current disability rating is 10 percent or less, 39 percent reported definite or probable interest in a lump sum, compared to 22 percent with disability ratings of 40 percent or more (see fig. 2). Younger, more recently rated, and less severely disabled veterans\u2014groups that expressed greater interest\u2014 could be a better gauge of newly compensated veterans\u2019 interest in taking a lump sum payment because they may be more similar to potential recipients than are other veterans. Thus, if future newly compensated veterans are offered a lump sum option, the actual percentage of those interested in it could exceed the 32 percent found among current veterans.", "Although our results indicate some receptivity to a lump sum option, interest and support would likely depend on the specific design of the payment program. For example, among military retirees with 20 years of service\u2014whose compensation is now a tax-free portion of their retirement pay\u2014interest in a lump sum payment increased from 29 percent to 66 percent after they learned in the survey that the lump sum might be offered in addition to their full retirement pay.", "Veterans and military personnel in our focus groups expressed considerable interest in knowing additional details about the proposed lump sum option\u2014particularly about the lump sum payment amount. Others asked for clarifications about the program, such as whether there could be circumstances under which lump sum recipients could reapply for additional compensation. In reacting to the option, some indicated that they had made assumptions about the amount. Others felt they could not give an informed opinion or make a decision without more information\u2014or the \u201cfine print,\u201d as one individual put it. Some were skeptical and suggested that the lump sum option was a way for the government to cut VA benefits and reduce its obligations to those whose disabilities may get worse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Veterans and Military Personnel Perceive Flexibility as a Key Advantage and Financial Risk as a Major Disadvantage", "paragraphs": ["Through our focus group sessions and discussions with veteran and military organizations, we found that veterans and military personnel perceive advantages and disadvantages of offering a lump sum option. However, information on the actual effects of lump sum payments on veterans\u2019 financial well-being is limited.

These advantages and disadvantages generally weigh the benefit of financial flexibility against the risk of financial loss.", "Veterans and military personnel who said the lump sum payment would put recipients at risk of being less well off or unable to pay for basic necessities such as food and housing provided several reasons to support their perception. Some reported that most lump sum recipients\u2014particularly younger veterans and those already in financial need\u2014would not have adequate money management skills. For example, some said that recipients may squander the one-time payment before reaching old age. They also said that more lump sum recipients would spend rather than invest the money, and those who did invest would be at risk of making poor investments. These veterans and military personnel also expressed concern that the lump sum amounts would be inadequate to protect recipients from financial setbacks that could result from a progressive disability and the inability to reapply for a higher disability rating. Some were similarly concerned that the initial rating could be inaccurate or unfairly low or that the average life span on which the lump sum was calculated would be insufficient to support recipients who outlived this average. Finally, veterans and military personnel said that choice creates risk because information may be incomplete or biased, individual judgment may be poor, or both. Some said a lump sum option would actually lead to more poor judgments because people would find a large sum of money so immediately attractive that they would not adequately consider the long- term financial consequences of taking it.", "On the other hand, others said that there would be benefits to a lump sum payment option. For example, some said lump sums could be used to make investments or large purchases, such as a house or an education; settle debts; or start a business. In addition, veterans and military personnel said that the benefit of providing a choice outweighed any risks. This high value placed on choice seems to underlie much of the option\u2019s support, since our survey indicated that, among veterans who supported the lump sum option, 28 percent thought in hindsight that a lump sum would have been the better choice for them. As one veteran said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the lump sum option is a good idea, but it\u2019s America and veterans should have a choice.\u201d Another supporter of choice argued that, while a lump sum payment invested in stocks could be substantially reduced if the market falls, monthly payments could be routinely squandered. It was also pointed out that while a veteran who opted for a lump sum could outlive the average age used to calculate the payment, a veteran who chose monthly payments could die relatively young and therefore receive less total compensation. Moreover, focus group participants also said that veterans who were fully informed about their options, would have to take responsibility for the consequences of their choice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Limited on the Financial Effects of Lump Sum Payments", "paragraphs": ["Little definitive information is available to validate perceptions about the potential financial effects on veterans taking a lump sum payment. Our review of the literature and inquiries about lump sum provisions for disabled veterans in several countries yielded very few studies on veterans receiving lump sum payments, and none addressing the long-term financial effects of such payments. We did find two qualitative accounts, provided to us by British and Australian officials, which told of financial difficulties among foreign disabled veterans who received lump sum compensation before World War II. In 1939, the British Ministry of Pensions stopped allowing veterans to convert their disability pensions into lump sum payments because it found that some recipients had sustained serious financial losses, particularly through business ventures. Allowing conversions of pensions to a lump sum has never been reinstated under the British War Pensions Scheme, but lump sums are paid for lower-rated disabilities. In Australia, a lump sum provision was discontinued when some impoverished World War I veterans returned for pension benefits after exhausting their lump sum payments. While Australia\u2019s act covering service during armed conflicts still does not provide for lump sum disability compensation, a separate act directs lump sum compensation for certain disabilities incurred during peacetime service, on essentially the same basis as for other government employees.", "Although not addressing long-term financial effects or disabled veterans, certain studies examine recipients\u2019 use of lump sum payments from other sources, indicating different ways recipients would typically manage a lump sum.In general, studies of retirement distributions suggest that many factors affect how individuals use lump sum payments. For example, one recent study of lump sum retirement distributions reported that recipients under age 25 spent almost half of their money on everyday expenses and consumer items, compared to older age groups who spent 22 percent or less.Another study reported that the recipient\u2019s age, education and income level, and the payment amount are influential factors, but together these factors explain less than 20 percent of the variation in saving behavior among lump sum recipients.However, findings from these studies depend on the definitions of savings, investment, and spending used, and may have less relevance for different populations and lump sum programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Strategies Veterans and Military Personnel Believe Could Lessen Risks", "paragraphs": ["Some veterans and active duty personnel we spoke with suggested certain strategies\u2014some of which have been used in other lump sum payment programs\u2014to minimize the potential risks associated with receiving a one- time payment. However, others had concerns about whether they would be effective, feasible, or fair.", "To help ensure that beneficiaries make a wise choice, some veterans and military personnel suggested that VA develop an information and education plan\u2014one that would fully inform beneficiaries of the benefits and risks of the two payment types and project for individual beneficiaries the likely effects of each. They further suggested that such information and education be provided well before the time the choice would be made to allow beneficiaries sufficient time to consider their options. To ensure unbiased information, it was also suggested that independent counseling on the payment choices be encouraged, as well as a second medical opinion on the disability. However, some expressed concern about VA\u2019s ability to develop an effective information and education strategy. This skepticism was based on their perceptions that the government\u2019s past efforts to inform and educate veterans about benefits were inadequate and a lump sum decision would involve complex assessments of future disability, individual financial situations, and investment risks.", "Veterans and military personnel also suggested strategies that they believe would limit the risk of forgone compensation or other benefits if a veteran\u2019s disability were to progress. For example, one strategy would be to delay veterans\u2019 choice of a lump sum until they are comfortable with the stability of their condition. Others said that the progression\u2014or stability\u2014of an individual\u2019s disability could not be predicted accurately enough to allow fully informed choice. According to VA and medical experts in disability evaluation, definitive medical knowledge is often insufficient to fully inform veterans of whether their disabling condition would progress or remain the same.The course of disability is highly individualized and can be complicated by multiple impairments. The limited historical data from our survey suggest that while some veterans get higher ratings over time for worsening disabilities, others get lower ratings for improved disabilities.For example, among veterans who received their first ratings before 1970, about 21 percent reported higher current ratings than initial ratings, and almost 17 percent had lower current ratings.", "Another strategy veterans and military personnel suggested would be to estimate veterans\u2019 lifetime disabilities and use these estimates in calculating their lump sum payments. The VA Inspector General has similarly proposed that VA revise its disability rating criteria to reflect expected lifetime impairment.While projecting the progression of an individual\u2019s disability over his or her lifetime would prove difficult, determining average progression factors using VA historical data may be possible. Another suggested strategy would be to allow reevaluations of lump sum recipients\u2019 disability ratings\u2014not for the purpose of providing additional payment but to determine their eligibility, and that of their dependents, for other VA benefits that are tied to disability ratings, such as medical care or survivor benefits.Some participants suggested, however, that disabled veterans should also be able to seek reevaluation for additional compensation payments if their disability progresses.", "Other strategies for reducing the financial risk associated with a lump sum payment were aimed at encouraging responsible financial management. For example, focus group respondents recommended financial counseling and education; investment options, such as in the federal government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan; or payment allocations, such as paying lump sums in allotments or initially putting the money into a trustee account. It was also suggested that returns on investments could be tax-free. However, concerns were also raised about these strategies, including perceptions that the government would not be able to successfully instruct people on how to manage their money and that these strategies would increase government bureaucracy.", "Some of the suggested strategies were aimed at protecting vulnerable populations from financial risk. Specifically, some suggested that a lump sum payment option not be offered to those who would be least able to manage the money well\u2014such as those who have been declared incompetent or have a history of significant psychological disabilities\u2014or that the lump sum payment be assigned to someone who could manage the money for the payee.One concern that was raised with this type of strategy was that there would not be enough time to declare a newly compensated veteran incompetent or in need of a representative before the veteran was offered a choice.", "A similar strategy suggested by veterans and military personnel was to limit the lump sum option to the least financially vulnerable\u2014that is, veterans who would not be likely to suffer great economic hardship if they were to lose the lump sum payment. These veterans would include those who would receive small monthly compensation payments, have stable or less severe disabilities, or have alternative income sources.However, respondents raised concerns that any safeguard restricting who would be offered the lump sum option could be viewed as unfair."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments, VA highlighted our points that veterans had mixed views about offering this hypothetical lump sum program and that further development of program details could affect veterans\u2019 views.
