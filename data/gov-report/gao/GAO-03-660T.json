INS had implemented or was in the process of implementing  some of these recommendations. We plan to follow up on DHS plans to  improve the various programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Components of the Interior Enforcement Strategy", "paragraphs": ["In January 1999, INS issued its Interior Enforcement Strategy. This  strategy focused resources on areas that would have the greatest impact  on reducing the size and annual growth of the illegal resident population.  Certain criteria were used to develop the priorities and activities of the  strategy. The criteria focused on potential risks to U.S. communities and  persons, costs, capacity to be effective, impact on communities, potential  impact on reducing the size of the problem, and potential value for  prevention and deterrence. The strategy established the following five  areas in priority order:  1.  Identify and remove criminal aliens and minimize recidivism. Under  this strategic priority, INS was to identify and remove criminal aliens  as they come out of the federal and state prison systems and those  convicted of aggravated felonies currently in probation and parole  status.  2.  Deter, dismantle, and diminish smuggling or trafficking of aliens. This  strategic priority called for INS to disrupt and dismantle the criminal  infrastructure that encourages and benefits from illegal migration. INS  efforts were to start in source and transit countries and continue inside  the United States, focusing on smugglers, counterfeit document  producers, transporters, and employers who exploit and benefit from  illegal migration.  3.  Respond to community reports and complaints about illegal  immigration. In addition to responding to local law enforcement issues  and needs, this strategic priority emphasizes working with local  communities to identify and address problems that arise from the  impact of illegal immigration, based on local threat assessments.  4.  Minimize immigration benefit fraud and other document abuse. Under  this strategic priority, INS was to aggressively investigate and  prosecute benefit fraud and document abuse to promote integrity of  the legal immigration system.  5.  Block and remove employers\u2019 access to undocumented workers. The  strategy emphasizes denying employers access to unauthorized  workers by checking their compliance with the employment  verification requirements in the Immigration Reform and Control Act  of 1986. Coupled with its efforts to control smuggling activity, this  effort could have a multiplier effect on access of employers to illegal  workers and on the overall number of illegal residents in the country.", "Figure 1 shows that INS had generally allocated its interior enforcement  resources consistent with these priorities and that the workyears devoted  to several of INS\u2019s interior enforcement efforts had either declined or  stayed about the same between fiscal years 1998 and 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Implementing the Interior Enforcement Programs", "paragraphs": ["Our work has shown that INS faced numerous daunting enforcement  issues, as will BICE as it assumes responsibility for the strategy. For  example, the potential pool of removable criminal aliens and fugitives  numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Many are incarcerated in hundreds  of federal, state, and local facilities, while others are fugitives at large  across the country. The number of individuals smuggled into the United  States has increased dramatically, and alien smuggling has become more  sophisticated, complex, organized, and flexible. Thousands of aliens  annually illegally seek immigration benefits, such as work authorization  and change of status, and some of these aliens use these benefits to enable  them to conduct criminal activities. Hundreds of thousands of aliens  unauthorized to work in the United States have used fraudulent  documents to circumvent the process designed to prevent employers from  hiring them. In many instances, employers are complicit in this activity.", "Given the nature, scope, and magnitude of these activities, BICE needs to  ensure that it is making the best use of its limited enforcement resources.  We found that fundamental management challenges exist in several of the  interior enforcement programs and that addressing them will require the  high-level attention and concerted efforts of BICE."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Need for Better Staff Levels and Allocations", "paragraphs": ["In several reports we noted that INS did not believe it had sufficient staff  to reach its program goals. Having data on how to effectively allocate staff  and placing sufficient staff in the right locations is important if BICE is to  achieve program goals. Staff shortages had contributed to INS\u2019s inability to  promptly remove the majority of criminal aliens after they have completed  their prison sentences. In 1997 INS did not place into removal proceedings  50 percent of potentially deportable criminal aliens who were released  from federal prisons and state prisons from 5 states. In 1999 we reported  that, although the removal of criminal aliens was an INS management  priority, INS faced the same staff shortage issues in 1997 as it had in 1995.  In particular, agent attrition \u2013 about one-third of the workforce - continued  to impede INS\u2019s ability to meet its program goals. INS had told us that  since 1997, the attrition rates of agents in this program has stabilized and  that, in fiscal year 2003, the agents from this program would be reclassified  as detention removal officers, which INS believed should further help  reduce attrition.", "Even if INS had additional staff working in these program areas, it lacked  good management information to determine how many staff it needed to  meet its program goals and how best to allocate staff given the limited  resources it did have. With respect to its program for removing  incarcerated criminal aliens, INS told us that beginning in fiscal year 2002,  the agency implemented our recommendation to use a workload analysis  model. This was to help identify the resources the agency needed for its  criminal alien program in order to achieve overall program goals and  support its funding and staffing requests. We have not reviewed this new  model to ascertain its usefulness.", "With respect to alien smuggling, INS lacked field intelligence staff to  collect and analyze information. Both 1998 and 1999 INS Annual  Performance Plan reports stated that the lack of intelligence personnel  hampered the collection, reporting, and analysis of intelligence  information. Although INS\u2019s Intelligence Program proposed that each  district office have an intelligence unit, as of January 2000, 21 of INS\u2019s 33  districts did not have anyone assigned full-time to intelligence-related  duties. Our ongoing work at land ports of entry shows this to be a  continuing problem.", "The worksite enforcement program received a relatively small portion of  INS\u2019s staffing and budget. In fiscal year 1998, INS completed a total of  6,500 worksite investigations, which equated to about 3 percent of the  estimated number of employers of unauthorized aliens. Given limited  enforcement resources, BICE needs to assure that it targets those  industries where employment of illegal aliens poses the greatest potential  risk to national security. The program now has several initiatives  underway that target sensitive industries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Better Information Technology", "paragraphs": ["INS had long-standing difficulty developing and fielding information  systems to support its program operations, and effectively using  information technology continued to remain a challenge. For example, in  2002 we reported that benefit fraud investigations had been hampered by a  lack of integrated information systems. The operations units at the four  INS service centers that investigate benefit fraud operate different  information systems that did not interface with each other or with the  units that investigate benefit fraud at INS district offices. As a result,  sharing information about benefit applicants is difficult. The INS staff who  adjudicate applications did not have routine access to INS\u2019s National  Automated Immigration Lookout System (NAILS). Not having access to or  not using NAILS essentially means that officers may be making decisions  without access to or using significant information and that benefits may be  granted to individuals not entitled to receive them. Thus, INS was not in  the best position to review numerous applications and detect patterns,  trends, and potential schemes for benefit fraud.", "Further, in 2002 we reported that another INS database, the Forensic  Automated Case and Evidence Tracking System (FACETS), did not  contain sufficient data for managers to know the exact size and status of  the laboratory\u2019s pending workload or how much time is spent on each  forensic case by priority category. As a result, managers were not in the  best position to make fact-based decisions about case priorities, staffing,  and budgetary resource needs.", "With respect to the criminal alien program, in 1999 we reported that INS  lacked a nationwide data system containing the universe of foreign-born  inmates for tracking the hearing status of each inmate. In response to our  recommendation, INS developed a nationwide automated tracking system  for the Bureau of Prisons and deployed the system to all federal  institutional hearing program sites. INS said that it was working with the  Florida Department of Corrections to integrate that state\u2019s system with  INS\u2019s automated tracking system. INS also said that it planned to begin  working with New York, New Jersey, and Texas to integrate their systems  and then work with California, Illinois, and Massachusetts. We have not  examined these new systems to determine whether they were completed  as planned or to ascertain their effectiveness.", "In 2000 we reported that INS lacked an agencywide automated case  tracking and management system that prevented antismuggling program  managers from being able to monitor their ongoing investigations,  determine if other antismuggling units were investigating the same target,  or know if previous investigations had been conducted on a particular  target. In response to our recommendation, INS deployed an automated  case tracking and management system for all of its criminal investigations,  including alien smuggling investigations. Again, we have not examined the  new system to ascertain its effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Better Guidance to Program Staff", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the various program components of the interior  enforcement strategy found that working-level guidance was sometimes  lacking or nonexistent. INS had not established guidance for opening  benefit fraud investigations or for prioritizing investigative leads. Without  such criteria, INS could not be ensured that the highest-priority cases were  investigated and resources were used optimally.", "INS\u2019s interior enforcement strategy did not define the criteria for opening  investigations of employers suspected of criminal activities. In response to  our recommendation, INS clarified the types of employer-related criminal  activities that should be the focus of INS investigations.", "INS\u2019s alien smuggling intelligence program had been impeded by a lack of  understanding among field staff about how to report intelligence  information. Staff were unclear about guidelines, procedures, and effective  techniques for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence  information. They said that training in this area was critically needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Need for Better Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["INS had not established outcome-based performance measures that would  have helped it assess the results of its interior enforcement strategy. For  example, in 2000 we reported that while INS had met its numeric goals for  the number of smuggling cases presented for prosecution in its  antismuggling program, it had not yet developed outcome-based measures  that would indicate progress toward the strategy\u2019s objective of identifying,  deterring, disrupting, and dismantling alien smuggling. This was also the  case for the INS intelligence program. INS had not developed outcome- based performance measures to gauge the success of the intelligence  program to optimize the collection, analysis, and dissemination of  intelligence information.", "In 2002 we reported that INS had not yet established outcome-based  performance measures that would help it assess the results of its benefit  fraud investigations. Additionally, INS had not established goals or  measurement criteria for the service center operations units that conduct  fraud investigation activities. INS\u2019s interior enforcement strategy did not  clearly describe the specific measures INS would use to gauge its  performance in worksite enforcement. For example, in 1999 we reported  that the strategy stated that INS would evaluate its performance on the  basis of such things as changes in the behavior or business practices of  persons and organizations, but did not explain how they expected the  behavior and practices to change. And although INS indicated that it  would gauge effectiveness in the worksite area by measuring change in the  wage scales of certain targeted industries, it left unclear a number of  questions related to how it would do this. For example, INS did not specify  how wage scales would be measured; what constituted a targeted industry;  and how it would relate any changes found to its enforcement efforts or  other immigration-related causes. The strategy stated that specific  performance measurements would be developed in the annual  performance plans required by the Government Performance and Results  Act.", "According to INS\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget submission, the events of  September 11th required INS to reexamine strategies and approaches to  ensure that INS efforts fully addressed threats to the United States by  organizations engaging in national security crime. As a result, with regard  to investigating employers who may be hiring undocumented workers, INS  planned to target investigations of industries and businesses where there  is a threat of harm to the public interest.

These units  operated through different chains of command with different reporting  structures. As a result, INS\u2019s antismuggling program lacked coordination,  resulting in multiple antismuggling units overlapping in their jurisdictions,  making inconsistent decisions about which cases to open, and functioning  autonomously and without a single chain of command.

As part of its investigation of the attacks  of September 11, the Justice Department detained aliens on immigration  charges while investigating their potential connection with terrorism.
