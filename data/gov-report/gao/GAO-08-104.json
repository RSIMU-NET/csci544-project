As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, GAO compared (1) the TRS premiums established by DOD to the reported costs of providing benefits under TRS in 2006 and (2) DOD's projected costs for TRS before implementation to DOD's reported costs for the program in 2005 and 2006. To do this work, GAO examined DOD analyses and interviewed DOD officials and external experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, the premium for both individual and family coverage under TRS--which DOD based on Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) premiums--exceeded the reported average cost per plan of providing TRICARE benefits through the program. TRS currently serves less than 1percent of the overall TRICARE population, and unlike most other TRICARE beneficiaries, TRS enrollees pay a premium to receive health care coverage. At the time of GAO's analysis, TRS consisted of three tiers, established by law, with reservists in each tier paying different portions of the total premium, based on the tier for which they qualified. Over 90 percent of reservists who purchased TRS coverage enrolled in tier 1. The premium for individual coverage under tier 1 was 72 percent higher than the average cost per plan of providing benefits through the program. Similarly, the premium for family coverage under tier 1 was 45 percent higher than the average cost per plan of providing benefits. DOD based TRS premiums on BCBS premiums because, at the time DOD was developing TRS, actual data on the costs of TRS did not exist; however, these data are now available. Had DOD been successful in establishing premiums that were equal to the cost of providing benefits in 2006, the portion of the premium paid by enrollees in tier 1--which is set by law to cover 28 percent of the full premium--would have been lower that year. Reasons that TRS premiums did not align with benefit costs included differences between the TRS and BCBS populations and differences in the way the two programs are designed, which DOD did not consider in its methodology. According to experts, the most successful methods for aligning premiums with actual program costs involve using program cost data when setting premiums. The regulation governing TRS premium adjustments allows DOD to use either BCBS premiums or other means as the basis for TRS premiums. However, DOD officials told GAO that they plan to continue, at least for the near future, to base TRS premiums on BCBS premiums because of limitations associated with using currently available data to predict future TRS costs. However, these limitations should decrease over time as DOD gains more experience with the program and enrollment increases. Nonetheless, due to the uncertainty associated with predicting future health care costs, premiums are unlikely to exactly match program costs, even when they are based on cost data from prior years. Other insurance programs have methods to address differences between premiums and program costs, which are not provided to DOD in the law governing TRS. DOD overestimated the total cost of providing benefits through TRS. While the department projected that its total costs would amount to about $70 million in fiscal year 2005 and about $442 million in fiscal year 2006, DOD's reported costs in those years were about $5 million and about $40 million, respectively. DOD's cost projections were too high largely because it overestimated the number of reservists who would purchase TRS and the associated cost per plan of providing TRS benefits. DOD officials told GAO that they chose not to use TRS cost and enrollment data when projecting future year program costs and enrollment levels because of uncertainty about whether they would provide an accurate indication of future experience."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Department of Defense  (DOD) has increasingly relied on reservists to support military operations,  such as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In recognition of this,  Congress has increased the health care benefits available to reservists and  their dependents, which generally include family members such as  spouses and dependent children. Specifically, the National Defense  Authorization Acts (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2005, 2006, and 2007 expanded  the number of reservists and their dependents who qualify for TRICARE,  the military health insurance program, and increased the period during  which they qualify. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2005 established the  program that DOD has named TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS), which  currently allows most members of the Selected Reserves to purchase  TRICARE coverage for periods after the TRICARE coverage associated  with active duty expires. After purchasing coverage, enrollees can obtain  health care through TRICARE-authorized providers or hospitals or  through DOD-operated military treatment facilities (MTF) if appointments  are available. TRS currently serves a small portion of the TRICARE  population\u2014as of June 2007, only about 34,000 of the 9.1 million TRICARE  beneficiaries were enrolled in TRS.", "Unlike most TRICARE beneficiaries who obtain health care benefits  without paying premiums, reservists who qualify for TRS must pay a  monthly premium to receive benefits through the program. By statute,  DOD is required to set premiums for TRS at a level that it determines to be  reasonable using an appropriate actuarial basis. DOD officials told us that  the department interpreted this to mean that TRS premiums should be set  equal to the expected average costs of providing the benefit per plan. TRS  enrollees are responsible for paying a portion of the total premium set by  DOD. In this report the term premium refers to the total premium\u2014that is,  the portion paid by enrollees, currently 28 percent, plus the portion  covered by DOD, currently 72 percent. DOD based the premiums for TRS  on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program\u2019s (FEHBP) Blue Cross  and Blue Shield (BCBS) Standard premiums, which the department  adjusted to account for differences in age, gender, and family size between  the BCBS population and the population of reservists and their family  members who qualify for TRS. To keep pace with rising health care costs,  DOD originally designed TRS so that the premiums are adjusted each year  based on annual adjustments in BCBS Standard premiums. DOD planned  to continue using this method to adjust premiums in the near future.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 required that we review DOD\u2019s costs of  implementing the TRS program. Specifically, as discussed with the  committees of jurisdiction, we compared (1) the annual TRS premiums  established by DOD to the reported costs of providing benefits under TRS  in 2006 and (2) DOD\u2019s projected costs for the TRS program before  implementation to DOD\u2019s reported costs for the program in 2005 and 2006.  The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 also required that we describe how  increases in TRS premiums compare with DOD\u2019s annual rate of medical  care price inflation. This information is included in appendix I.", "To compare the annual TRS premiums established by DOD to the reported  costs of providing benefits under TRS in 2006, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  reported TRS enrollment data and data on the cost of providing TRS  benefits through TRICARE-authorized civilian providers or hospitals, data  on the administrative costs associated with providing TRS benefits, and  data on the costs of providing TRS benefits through MTFs. Using DOD\u2019s  data, we calculated the average cost per TRS plan of providing individual  and family coverage as the sum of the reported costs divided by the  average number of TRS plans. We also reviewed legislation relevant to the  TRS program and literature on setting health insurance premiums and  interviewed experts from the fields of health economics and finance and  DOD officials in the TRICARE Management Activity and the Office of the  Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs, which are responsible for managing  the TRICARE program. We limited our analysis to calendar year 2006  because some 2007 data are still incomplete and because 2005 average  cost data in some months are based on a very small number of enrollees.  During the time period covered by our analysis, TRS included three tiers of  eligibility with enrollees in each tier paying different portions of the  premium based on the tier for which they qualified. We limited our  analysis to tier 1 because it included over 90 percent of TRS plans and  because tier 1 enrollee premium levels have applied to the entire TRS  program since October 2007. In addition, we were unable to report the  average cost per plan for tiers 2 and 3 separately, due to the low number of  enrollees in these tiers.", "To compare DOD\u2019s projected costs for the TRS program before  implementation with DOD\u2019s reported costs for the program in 2005 and  2006, we reviewed the analyses prepared by DOD before TRS\u2019s  implementation that projected (1) the number of individual and family  plans in each tier of the TRS program and (2) the costs per plan of  providing the TRS benefit. These projections were the two major factors  used by DOD to estimate TRS costs. We compared these data with  reported TRS enrollment and cost data from 2005 through 2007. In  reporting the results of our comparison we use cost data through 2006  only, because some cost data for 2007 were incomplete due to the delay  between when a claim is incurred and when it is paid.

To qualify for TRS, reservists  had to enter into an agreement with their respective reserve components  to continue to serve in the Selected Reserves in exchange for TRS  coverage. For each 90-day period of qualifying service in a contingency  operation, reservists could purchase 1 year of TRS coverage. Electing to  enroll in this TRS program was a onetime opportunity, and as originally  authorized, the program required reservists to sign the new service  agreement and register for TRS before leaving active duty service.  Reservists who qualified could also obtain coverage for their dependents  by paying the appropriate premium.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2006 expanded the number of reservists and  dependents who qualify to participate in the TRS program. Under the  expanded program, which became effective on October 1, 2006, almost all  reservists and dependents\u2014regardless of the reservists\u2019 prior active duty  service\u2014had the option of purchasing TRICARE coverage. Similar to the  TRS program as it was originally authorized, members of the Selected  Reserves and their dependents choosing to enroll in the expanded TRS  program had to pay a monthly premium to receive TRICARE coverage.  The portion of the premium paid by reservists in the Selected Reserves  and their dependents for TRS coverage varied based on certain qualifying  conditions that had to be met, such as whether the reservist also had  access to an employer-sponsored health plan. The NDAA for Fiscal Year  2006 established three levels\u2014which DOD calls tiers\u2014of qualification for  TRS, with enrollees paying different portions of the premium based on the  tier for which they qualified. Those who would have qualified under the  original TRS program, because they had qualifying service in support of a  contingency operation, paid the lowest premium. In another change to the  program, those reservists with qualifying service in support of a  contingency operation now had up to 90 days after leaving active duty to  sign the new service agreement required to qualify for this lowest premium  tier.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 significantly restructured the TRS program  by eliminating the three-tiered premium structure.

In addition, the act removed the requirement  that reservists sign service agreements to be qualified for TRS.

DOD  officials told us that the department interpreted this to mean that TRS  premiums should be set equal to the expected average costs per plan of  providing the benefit. Beginning in 2005, DOD based TRS premiums on the  premiums for the BCBS Standard plan offered through FEHBP because, at  the time DOD was developing TRS, actual data on the costs of delivering  TRS benefits for the TRS population did not exist. To set the premiums,  DOD compared characteristics of the beneficiary populations in each  group and subsequently adjusted the BCBS premiums for differences in  age, gender, and family size between the TRS and BCBS populations. The  population that qualifies for TRS is younger, has a higher percentage of  males, and has a larger number of dependents per sponsor than the BCBS  population. Taken together, DOD concluded that these factors caused  expected health care costs for the TRS population to be lower than  expected health care costs for the BCBS population. To account for these  differences, DOD set the TRS premium for individual coverage 32 percent  lower than the corresponding BCBS premium and set the TRS premium  for family coverage 8 percent lower than the corresponding BCBS  premium. According to DOD officials, the department based TRS  premiums on BCBS premiums, rather than another health insurance plan\u2019s  premiums, because BCBS offers coverage that is similar to the coverage  offered under TRICARE Standard. (For a comparison of cost-sharing  provisions under TRS and BCBS Standard, see table 2.) In addition, like  TRS, BCBS charges a separate premium for individual coverage and for  family coverage, and each of these premiums is uniform nationally and  updated annually. Furthermore, according to DOD officials, basing TRS  premiums on BCBS premiums allowed the department to account for the  effect of adverse selection on the department\u2019s costs, because adverse  selection is already accounted for in BCBS premiums.", "In order to compensate for rising health care costs, DOD originally  designed TRS premiums so that they would be adjusted each year based  on annual adjustments in the total BCBS Standard premiums. DOD  planned to continue using this method to adjust premiums in the  immediate future but allowed for the possibility that it might change the  methodology at some point in the future. Thus, if BCBS premiums  increased by 8.5 percent from 2005 to 2006, TRS premiums would be  increased by the same percentage. New premiums are effective at the start  of each calendar year. TRS premiums were increased by 8.5 percent for  2006 and scheduled to be increased by 1 percent for 2007, but a provision  in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 prevented this increase from being  implemented for 2007.", "According to DOD officials, another reason DOD decided to use BCBS as  the basis for annual TRS premium adjustments was because BCBS  premiums are updated annually, and the new premiums are made public  each October.

Basing TRS premiums on BCBS premiums is problematic because of  several dissimilarities between the two programs. Most important, the  average cost data now available suggest that TRS enrollees have incurred  significantly lower health care costs than BCBS enrollees, even after  adjusting for certain demographic characteristics. In addition, BCBS  premiums may be based on more than program costs, whereas TRS  premiums are intended to cover only costs. Basing TRS premiums on  BCBS premiums may have been reasonable at the time that TRS was first  implemented in 2005 due to the lack of available data on the cost of  providing benefits through TRS. However, cost data that reflect actual  experience under the program are now becoming available, and  limitations associated with them should decrease over time as DOD gains  more experience with the program and more reservists enroll in it. These  data will provide DOD with an improved basis for setting premiums in  future years, and allow the department to eventually eliminate its reliance  on BCBS premiums. Nonetheless, due to the uncertainty associated with  predicting future health care costs, premiums are unlikely to exactly  match program costs, even when they are based on cost data from prior  years. Other insurance programs have methods to address discrepancies  between premiums and program costs, which are not provided to DOD in  the law governing TRS.", "DOD has also had difficulty accurately estimating the likely cost of  providing TRS benefits in large part because it overestimated the number  of reservists who would likely purchase TRS coverage. Over time, the  availability of actual cost and enrollment data should help DOD improve  its projections for future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["With the goal of eventually eliminating reliance on BCBS premiums and to  better align premiums with the costs of providing TRS health care benefits,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant  Secretary for Health Affairs to stop basing TRS premium adjustments only  on BCBS premium adjustments and use the reported costs of providing  benefits through the TRS program when adjusting TRS premiums in future  years as limitations associated with the reported cost data decrease.", "We also recommend that DOD explore options for addressing instances in  which premiums have been either significantly higher or lower than  program costs in prior years, including seeking legislative authority as  necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from DOD.

As discussed with the  committees of jurisdiction, this appendix compares DOD\u2019s January 2006  TRS premium increase and DOD\u2019s proposed January 2007 TRS premium  increase with DOD\u2019s estimated annual rate of medical care price inflation  in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 as well as the medical component of the  Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers   (CPI-W).", "Premiums for TRS were first established when the program was  implemented in April 2005. To keep pace with rising health care costs,  DOD originally designed TRS premiums so that they are adjusted each  year based on annual adjustments in the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program\u2019s Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Standard plan  premiums. DOD planned to continue using this method to adjust  premiums in the immediate future, although program regulations allow  some flexibility in setting the premiums. Accordingly, in line with BCBS,  TRS premiums increased by 8.5 percent in January 2006. Based on  increases in BCBS, TRS premiums would have increased by 1 percent in  January 2007. However, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 froze 2007  premiums through September 30, 2007, at the rates for calendar year 2006.", "DOD calculated its average annual rate of medical care inflation to be  about 4.9 percent in fiscal year 2005 and about 4.7 percent in fiscal year  2006. DOD did not develop these estimates of inflation based on its own  spending. Instead, DOD based the estimates on inflation rates provided  annually by the Office of Management and Budget for the various  components of the TRICARE operating budget, such as military personnel,  private sector health care, and pharmacy. In contrast, the medical  component of the CPI-W increased at lower rates than DOD\u2019s rate of  medical care price inflation. The medical care component of the CPI-W  increased by about 4.1 percent in 2005 and about 4.2 percent in 2006. The  medical care component of the CPI-W is based on medical expenses, but it  is problematic to compare to DOD\u2019s estimated rate of medical care  inflation because it is based only on out-of-pocket medical expenditures  paid by consumers, including health insurance premiums, and excludes  the medical expenditures paid by public and private insurance programs.", "Comparing premium growth trends with DOD\u2019s annual rate of medical  care price inflation and the medical care component of the CPI-W is  problematic because of differences in each measurement. Unlike medical  care price inflation, premium growth may reflect factors such as changes  in the comprehensiveness of the policy, changes in the ratio of premiums  collected to benefits paid, changes in costs because of increased  utilization of health care services, contributions to or withdrawals from  plan reserves, and profits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To compare the annual TRS premiums established by DOD to the reported  average costs per plan of providing benefits under TRS in 2006, we  reviewed DOD\u2019s reported TRS enrollment data and data on the cost of  providing TRS benefits through TRICARE-authorized civilian providers or  hospitals, data on the administrative costs associated with providing TRS  benefits, and data on the costs of providing TRS benefits through military  treatment facilities (MTF). Using DOD\u2019s data, we calculated the average  cost per TRS plan of providing individual and family coverage as the sum  of the reported costs divided by the average number of TRS plans. We also  reviewed legislation relevant to the TRS program and literature on setting  health insurance premiums and interviewed several experts from the fields  of health economics and finance and DOD officials in the TRICARE  Management Activity and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health  Affairs. We limited our analysis to calendar year 2006 because some 2007  data are still incomplete and because 2005 average cost data in some  months are based on a very small number of enrollees. At the time covered  by our analysis, TRS included three tiers of eligibility with enrollees paying  different portions of the premium based on the tier for which they  qualified. We limited our analysis to tier 1 because it included over   90 percent of TRS plans and because tier 1 enrollee premium levels have  applied to the entire TRS program since October 2007. We are unable to  report the average cost per plan for tiers 2 and 3 separately, due to the low  number of enrollees in these tiers.", "To compare DOD\u2019s projected costs for the TRS program before  implementation to DOD\u2019s reported costs for the program in 2005 and 2006,  we reviewed the analyses prepared by DOD before TRS\u2019s implementation  that projected (1) the number of individual and family plans in each tier of  the TRS program and (2) the costs per plan of providing the TRS benefit.", "These projections were the two major factors used by DOD to estimate  TRS costs.
