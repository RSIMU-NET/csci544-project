U.S. law restricts the provision of funds to units of foreign security forces when the Department of State has credible evidence that the unit has committed gross violations of human rights. Agency guidance extends these restrictions to individuals of foreign security forces and requires posts to establish procedures to vet candidates for U.S. sponsored training for possible violations. However, we found no evidence that U.S. officials vetted an estimated 6,900 foreign security trainees--about 4,000 Indonesian, 1,200 Filipino, and 1,700 Thai police--trained by Justice with State law enforcement assistance between fiscal years 2001 through 2004. These candidates included a total of 32 Indonesian individuals trained over time from a notorious special-forces police unit previously prohibited under State policy from receiving U.S. training funds because of the unit's prior human rights abuses. We found better evidence of vetting in training programs managed by DOD. State issued new guidance in February 2005 intended to improve the human rights vetting process and establish a database of human rights abuse allegations. State has not produced a clear and coherent national security assistance strategy that meets objectives that Congress urged State to address in 2000 legislation. As a result, State and Congress may be deprived of the information needed to make future decisions about these programs. State's 2003 strategy met only two of nine objectives in the law. Among other shortfalls, the strategy did not identify how programs would be combined at the country level to achieve objectives or be coordinated with other U.S. government agencies. Several State and DOD planning documents, while not collectively providing a complete national security assistance strategy, address some of the legislation's objectives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The executive branch has considered Southeast Asia as the \u201csecond front\u201d  in the war on terrorism and has thus bolstered security assistance to  Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand to help deal with this threat.

Further, the  Security Assistance Act of 2002 required State to brief Congress on its  plans and progress in formulating and implementing the strategy, and to  provide a description on the actions taken to include such programs as  IMET, FMF, and EDA, as well as other assistance programs to foreign  security forces in the strategy.", "In response to the acts of 2000 and 2002, State prepared a 16-page  PowerPoint document entitled, \u201cNational Security Assistance Strategy  Briefing\u201d and used it to brief selected congressional committees in May  2003 (see app. III for the briefing).

The outline accompanying the briefing asserts that  State\u2019s bureau and mission performance plans discuss how military  assistance tools contribute to achieving U.S. foreign policy goals at the  regional and country level, respectively. However, the strategy does not  incorporate key activity and resource information from these  documents;  Although the strategy lists key countries, it does not address how the  various programs are to be combined within each country to achieve  objectives.

We then randomly selected and reviewed program files for those  officials. We reviewed the files for compliance with human rights vetting  requirements as set forth in legislation and State policy guidance. To  conduct the file review, we used a data collection instrument to  systematically capture whether key steps in the post\u2019s human rights vetting  process occurred, such as whether the political affairs office at each post  was involved.", "We were able to estimate that 87 percent of files for DOD trainees in the  Philippines had some documentation subject to a sampling error of plus or  minus 10 percent. The 95 percent confidence interval surrounding this  estimate ranges from 80 percent to 92 percent. However, due to small  sample sizes for the other agencies in the other countries, we were unable  to make other reliable estimates about the percentage of files for which  some vetting occurred. The small sample sizes occurred because, after we  had drawn our sample, U.S. officials told us that no files existed for several  large groups of trainees, including approximately 4,000 trainees under the  ICITAP program in Indonesia and 1,439 trainees from the Narcotics Affairs  Section in Thailand. In addition, after we had drawn our sample, we were  told about other groups of trainees that had not been vetted. As a result,  our estimates for the numbers of trainees for which no vetting occurred are  based on officials' estimates of the numbers of trainees that had taken the  training that should have been vetted, not the file review we conducted. To  assess the reliability of the estimates on trainees that had not received  training, we interviewed officials, and compared the estimates they  provided with other available information.

State commented that the Leahy provisions apply only to units, not  individuals, of foreign security forces, and said that applying human  rights restrictions at the individual level is a matter of policy. State also  asserted that it takes additional measures to avoid the provision of U.S.  assistance to individuals suspected of gross human rights violations,  whether inside or outside the security unit setting. However, our work  showed that State\u2019s policy is not being effectively implemented. We  found that an estimated 6,900 individuals received U.S. training  assistance without any evidence that they had first been vetted for  gross violations of human rights. Therefore, we recommended in the  report that State strengthen its management controls to meet its stated  policy goal of not providing U.S. assistance to suspected gross human  rights violators.  2. State said that U.S. embassies in the Philippines, Indonesia, and  Thailand reviewed their human rights vetting procedures and brought  them into compliance with Department guidance. We agree that  embassies in Manila and Jakarta wrote their human rights vetting  procedures during the course of our review to bring them into  compliance with State guidance. However, Embassy Bangkok does not  have written procedures and is not in compliance with State guidelines.  More importantly, State lacks a system for monitoring compliance with  its guidelines. As discussed in our report, we found that no  headquarters office within State is currently charged with the  responsibility of monitoring the posts\u2019 compliance with State\u2019s human  rights vetting procedures and recommended that such a monitoring  mechanism be established to verify that these procedures are being  carried out properly. Such a system would help eliminate the major  gaps in vetting we found at the three posts we visited.", "State further commented that the State-run International Law  Enforcement Academies and Philippines ATA programs have been fully  incorporated in human rights vetting procedures since 1999. However,  this comment is not relevant to our main finding that we found no  evidence that about 6,900 foreign security forces were vetted for human  rights concerns before receiving U.S. law enforcement training under  ICITAP.  3. State acknowledged the need for continued improvement, especially  concerning better oversight of the implementation of posts\u2019  procedures. It noted that some oversight is provided through the  periodic Inspector General inspections. State said that it purposely  allows the posts flexibility in deciding vetting guidelines. We contacted  the State Inspector General and found that their periodic post  inspections have not included assessments of State\u2019s human rights  vetting process at any of the three posts. We found that State had  conducted an inspection at only one post--Embassy Bangkok--between  fiscal years 2001 through 2004.  4. We disagree with State\u2019s comments that (1) central oversight of posts\u2019  compliance with vetting requirements in a single office is not needed,  and (2) its new database system will mitigate the need for  centralization in one bureau. As stated in our report, no office within  State is charged with the overall responsibility of monitoring posts\u2019  compliance with human rights vetting requirements, which has led to  lapses in the vetting process across all three posts. Currently, four  different bureaus within State share some responsibility for  implementing these requirements. This has resulted in confusion in the  field and gaps in implementing departmental vetting policies. State\u2019s  guidance issued to the posts between 1997 through 2005 did not assign  this role and responsibility to any one office. A central focal point  would help identify instances where a post was not complying with  required procedures or instances where confusion about requirements  existed. The new database, alone, will not solve the vetting problems  we identified or replace the need for designating an office with the  express responsibility of monitoring how posts implement their human  rights vetting requirements. 5. We disagree with State\u2019s statement that our decision to include a full  range of programs and activities supporting foreign military and police  forces within the scope of our review undermined our assessment of  State\u2019s compliance with the Security Assistance Act. As officials with  State\u2019s Bureau of Legal Affairs repeatedly stated, there is no statutory  definition of \u201csecurity assistance,\u201d or even a commonly agreed-upon  definition within the federal government. In the absence of a legal  definition, and for the purposes of our report, we defined security  assistance as U.S. government assistance to train and equip foreign  security forces (military and police). Although State officials indicated  that it traditionally considers security assistance to include FMF, IMET,  EDA, and PKO programs, the Security Assistance Act of 2002 states  that FMF, IMET and EDA as well as other similar training programs  to foreign security forces shall be included in State\u2019s briefing on the  strategy. It will be difficult for State to craft a comprehensive security  assistance strategy, as called for in our report, without including at least  the 12 related programs and activities described in our report. 6. We disagree that the absence of further requests for a briefing on the  national security assistance strategy somehow changed the intention of  the Security Assistance Act of 2000 to have an annual report to  Congress. The Security Assistance Act of 2000 urged State to provide an  annual strategy while the 2002 act mandated a status briefing on the  development of that strategy. We understand that State fulfilled its  requirement to brief the committees on the progress of the strategy, as  called for in the 2002 act, but we disagree that a lack of request for  additional briefings altered the intention of the 2000 act, which urged  State to provide an annual National Security Assistance Strategy to  Congress.  7. The briefing was a good first step, but a detailed written plan is needed  for wider distribution, and for providing documentation for tracking  progress in moving forward.  8. We agree with State\u2019s observation that our report does not include  information about the Global Affairs Dashboard pilot project, which  State said has the potential to become a useful tool for security  assistance strategic planning. Although we were not informed in the  course of our review of the Global Dashboard, which has yet to be  developed and deployed, we support all State efforts to develop better  strategic planning tools for U.S. security assistance programs. We have  revised the report to reflect this new information. 9. We have made changes in the body of the report to reflect State\u2019s  comment that the draft incorrectly referred to IMET and FMF as DOD  programs, when they are Foreign Operations Appropriations Act- funded programs.  10. The draft report already reflected the distinction between State policy  and the law. 11. We have updated the report to reflect State\u2019s comment.  12. We agree with State\u2019s comment that Embassy Manila had written  procedures for human rights vetting prior to 2004 and made changes in  the report to reflect this comment. However, we disagree with State\u2019s  comment that Embassy Manila provided us with all relevant documents  during our visit in March 2005, including an October 2000 cable  outlining post human rights vetting procedures. In fact, the post  provided us only with the procedures in effect since late 2004.  13. We have revised the graphic to reflect State\u2019s comment that no EDA  articles were transferred to Indonesia.  14. We have revised the graphic to correct the value for CTFP.  15. State commented that ATA allocations should be $7.8 million, rather  than $1.9 million, for the Philippines; $19.1 million, rather than $14.8  million, for Indonesia; and   $4.2 million, rather than zero, for Thailand.  In subsequent discussions with State officials, they said that these  figures represent \u201ceither obligations or expenditures,\u201d and not  allocations, as we requested. We could not verify the numbers that they  provided through agency comments and State was not able to provide  us with corrected values for the allocations. As a result, we made no  changes to the report and reported the available ATA country  allocations as presented in State\u2019s Congressional Budget Justifications. 16. We revised our report language to reflect State\u2019s comment. 17. State misinterpreted our generic description of the human rights  vetting process, which was not intended to imply that all State officials  share a common understanding of vetting policies and procedures.  During our fieldwork at the three posts, we found major gaps in the  implementation of State\u2019s vetting procedures.  18. We have changed the report to reflect State\u2019s comment that it is the  responsibility of the initiating office in Jakarta, not the political section,  to obtain clearances from all other sections.  19. State asserts that some of the 300 ATA in-country trainees in Thailand  who were not vetted were not members of the security forces and thus  should be excluded from the table. However, we carefully separated  out non-security forces from our review before assessing compliance  with human rights vetting procedures. Our numbers were based on our  file review in Embassy Bangkok and discussion with the ATA Program  Director. This analysis showed that of 708 ATA trainees between 2001  and 2004; 144 were security forces sent to the United States, 321 were  security forces trained in Thailand, but not vetted; and 243 were non- security forces trained in Thailand for whom vetting was not required. 20. We disagree with State\u2019s comment that the number of Indonesian  trainees from 2001 through 2004 is 705. We revised the incorrect figure  (210) in our report to reflect the number (297) provided by the post in  its \u201cDS/ATA Indonesia Summary Sheet.\u201d  21. We disagree with State\u2019s comment that we may be implying a  relationship between the ATA program and all security assistance  programs to the western hemisphere, based on our discussion of PART  ratings in our draft report. We did not intend to imply a relationship  between the two programs. As stated in our draft report, the 2004 PART  conducted two separate reviews. One review was for the ATA program,  which it rated as \u201ceffective.\u201d The other review was for all security  assistance programs to the Western Hemisphere, which were rated as  \u201cmoderately effective.\u201d 22. State contends that the National Security Assistance Strategy is a  multiyear plan because the Bureau Performance Plans are multiyear  documents. The Bureau Performance Plans are different documents  and serve a different purpose as indicated in our report. We  acknowledge in the report that the Bureau Performance Plans are  consistent with the National Security Strategy of the United States, and  to some extent address how combining resources and programs will  achieve regional goals as called for in the act. However, the Bureau  Performance Plans do not constitute a National Security Assistance  Strategy. 23. State said that it coordinated development of the National Security  Assistance Strategy with the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, and other appropriate agencies. We acknowledge that State\u2019s  annual roundtables and other communications are useful in developing  and \u201cfine-tuning\u201d security assistance goals and objectives. However, we  did not find anyone in those offices who participated in developing the  National Security Assistance Strategy \u2014the briefing slides, outline, and  oral presentation. One State official earlier had said that DOD officials  were involved only in presenting a briefing on EDA as part of State\u2019s  Strategy briefing and a separate briefing on DOD\u2019s security cooperation  efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Stephen M.
