In 1997, DOD decided that privatization was the preferred method for improving utility systems, and Congress approved legislative authority for privatizing DOD's utility systems with Public Law No. 105-85. DOD estimates that some utility privatization contracts will cost over $100 million. In a May 2005 report, GAO identified several management weaknesses in DOD's implementation of the program. The Fiscal Year 2006 National Defense Authorization Act required GAO to evaluate and report on changes to the utility privatization program since May 2005. Accordingly, this report updates the status of the program and discusses the effect of DOD's changes on the concerns noted last year. To conduct this review, GAO summarized program status and costs, assessed DOD's changes to program guidance and in other areas, and reviewed the services' implementation of the changes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's progress in implementing the utility privatization program has been slower than expected and the estimated completion date has slipped from the department's target of September 2005 to September 2011. DOD attributed the delays to the complexity of the program and to the services' decision to suspend and reassess the management of the program between October 2005 and March 2006. Since May 2005, the services privatized 14 utility systems under the legislative authority for the program, bringing the total number of awarded projects to 81. However, the services have awarded no projects since DOD issued new program guidance in November 2005. Meanwhile, the services' total estimated program implementation costs through fiscal year 2006 have increased to $285 million, and more funds will be required before the program is completed in 2011. Since GAO's May 2005 report, DOD has issued new guidance and required changes in procedures. If fully implemented, these changes should result in more reliable economic analyses, improved budgetary consideration of increased utility costs, enhanced oversight of privatization contracts, and reduced instances where contractors recover more than the fair market value paid for system conveyances. However, a number of concerns from the May 2005 report remain. For example, although DOD made changes to improve the reliability of project economic analyses by requiring independent reviews, GAO reviewed 10 economic analyses and found reliability issues that had not been identified during the independent reviews. DOD directed the services to adequately consider in their budgets the increased costs resulting from utility privatization. However, questions remain over the availability of the funds needed to complete the program because the services estimate that they will need $453 million more than is currently programmed to pay costs associated with remaining utility systems that might be privatized. Although DOD made many changes to improve contract administration and oversight, it may take some time to fully implement the changes as new privatization contracts are awarded. GAO's review of five projects awarded prior to DOD's changes found continuing questions about the adequacy of resources provided to perform oversight and the lack of required plans for overseeing contractor performance. It is too early in the program's implementation to know to what extent DOD's efforts will be successful in ensuring equitable periodic contract price adjustments and limiting long-term cost growth in the utility privatization program. However, GAO found indications that cost growth may become a challenge. DOD did not change its guidance to require that project economic analyses depict the actual expected costs of continued government ownership if the systems are not privatized. Therefore, DOD's reported $650 million in long-term cost reductions is unrealistic."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Department of Defense (DOD) installations have about 2,600 electric,  water, wastewater, and natural gas utility systems valued at about $50  billion. These systems consist of the equipment, fixtures, pipes, wires, and  other structures used in the distribution of electric power and natural gas,  the treatment and distribution of water, and the collection and treatment  of wastewater. According to DOD officials, many of these systems have  become unreliable and are in need of major improvements. To address this  issue, DOD decided in 1997 that utility privatization was the preferred  method for improving utility systems and services because privatization  would allow installations to benefit from private sector financing and  efficiencies. With private sector financing, installations could immediately  obtain major upgrades to their utility systems and pay for these  improvements over time. Thus, utility improvements could be achieved  without going through the traditional budget justification and funding  process. Under DOD\u2019s program, utility privatization normally involves two  transactions with the successful contractor\u2014the conveyance of the utility  system infrastructure and the acquisition of utility services for upgrades,  operations, and maintenance under a long-term contract of up to 50 years.  DOD estimates that some privatization contracts will cost more than $100  million over the contract time frames.", "To institute the program, at DOD\u2019s request, Congress approved legislative  authority in 1997 for privatizing utility systems at military installations.  The authority requires that the military services meet a number of  conditions to privatize a system including, in part, the following condition:  the services must demonstrate through an economic analysis that  privatization of a system would reduce the government\u2019s long-term costs  for utility services. DOD\u2019s program guidance permits the services to  exempt systems from privatization when long-term costs will not be  reduced or for unique security reasons.", "In May 2005, we issued a report that identified management weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s implementation of the utility privatization program. The report  noted a number of concerns, such as the reliability of the economic  analyses associated with privatization decisions and the adequacy of  contract oversight, and made several recommendations to DOD to  improve the guidance and procedures used to implement and oversee the  utility privatization program. Although DOD initially disagreed with the  report\u2019s findings and recommendations, after further review of the report,  the department subsequently reported to Congress that it generally agreed  with our findings and recommendations and decided to issue new  guidance on November 2, 2005, to address the key issues in our prior  report. Among other things, this guidance required the services to  complete remaining evaluations of utility system potential for privatization  in a timely and efficient manner, perform an independent review of the  economic analyses supporting proposed projects, consider and plan for  increased costs for utility services resulting from potential privatization  projects, and take steps designed to improve the administration and  oversight of awarded privatization projects. Even before DOD issued the  new guidance, the services had implemented several program  improvements including the requirement for independent reviews of  project economic analyses.", "In January 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2006 made several modifications to the legislative authority for the utility  privatization program, restricted the number of utility systems that DOD  could privatize during fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and required the  Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional defense  committees by April 1, 2006, addressing program issues and many of the  concerns noted in our May 2005 report. The act also directed us to  evaluate and report on the changes made by DOD to the program since  May 2005 and their effects. Accordingly, this report (1) updates the status  of the utility privatization program, and (2) discusses the effect of DOD\u2019s  changes on the program management and oversight concerns noted in our  May 2005 report.", "To address these objectives, we summarized program implementation  status and costs and compared the status to DOD\u2019s past and current goals  and milestones. To determine the effect of DOD\u2019s changes on the program  management and oversight concerns noted in our prior report, we  interviewed DOD and service officials and reviewed pertinent policies,  guidance, memorandums, and reports to document the changes made, and  we compared those changes with our previously identified concerns to  assess whether the issues had been fully addressed. Further, we reviewed  the reliability of the economic analyses supporting 10 privatization  projects that were awarded after our prior report and had been subjected  to the services\u2019 new independent review process. We also visited four  installations to assess contract administration and oversight issues and  reviewed contract price changes in six ongoing utility privatization  contracts. Although we generally relied on program status data provided  by the services, we confirmed the status data for five utility privatization  projects and did not otherwise test the reliability of the data.", "We conducted our review from March through July 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In defining a utility  system, the authority included systems for the generation and supply of  electric power; the treatment or supply of water; the collection or  treatment of wastewater; the generation or supply of steam, hot water, and  chilled water; the supply of natural gas; and the transmission of  telecommunications. Included in a utility system are the associated  equipment, fixtures, structures, and other improvements as well as  easements and rights-of-way. The authority stated that the Secretary of a  military department may convey a utility system to a municipal, private,  regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity and the  conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States  in the utility system or such lesser estate as the Secretary considers  appropriate to serve the interests of the United States.", "Among other things, the 1997 authority also included two requirements for  utility privatization. First, DOD was required to submit a report to  congressional defense committees and wait 21 days before allowing a  conveyance. For each conveyance, the report was to include an economic  analysis, based on acceptable life-cycle costing procedures, demonstrating  that (1) the long-term economic benefit of the conveyance to the United  States exceeds the long-term economic cost of the conveyance to the  United States, and (2) the conveyance will reduce the long-term costs of  the United States for utility services provided by the utility system  concerned. Second, the Secretary was required to receive as consideration  for a conveyance an amount equal to the fair market value, as determined  by the Secretary, of the right, title, or interest of the United States  conveyed. The consideration could take the form of a lump sum payment  or a reduction in charges for utility services.", "Before and after approval of the specific authority for privatizing utilities,  the services have used other authorities for utility privatization. For  example, the Army had privatized some systems after obtaining  congressional authority for each specific case. Also, the services have  privatized systems by modifications to natural gas services agreements  administered by the General Services Administration and by conveyances  of some systems on the basis of authorities related to base realignment  and closure and the military housing privatization program.", "DOD\u2019s Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations  and Environment provides overall policy and management oversight for  the utility privatization program. However, primary management and  implementation responsibility for the program is delegated to the  individual services, their major commands, and individual installations.

Under the  program, privatization normally involves two transactions with the  successful contractor\u2014the conveyance of the utility system infrastructure  and the acquisition of utility services for upgrades, operations, and  maintenance under a long-term contract of up to 50 years. Normally, the  conveyances do not include title to the land beneath the utility system  infrastructures.", "A year later, in December 1998, DOD issued another directive to establish  program management and oversight responsibilities and provide guidance  for performing economic analyses for proposed projects, exempting  systems from the program, and using competitive procedures to conduct  the program. The directive also stated that the objective was for DOD to  get out of the business of owning, managing, and operating utility systems  by privatizing them and that exemptions from privatization should be rare.", "The directive reset the privatization implementation goal to September 30,  2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Goals Reset and Program Guidance Revised", "paragraphs": ["In October 2002, DOD issued revised program guidance and again reset  implementation goals.

DOD officials stated that owning, operating, and maintaining  utility systems was not a core DOD function and the guidance stated that  privatization was the preferred method for improving utility systems and  services by allowing military installations to benefit from private sector  financing and efficiencies. The revised implementation goals directed the  military departments to reach a privatization or exemption decision on all  systems available for privatization by September 30, 2005. The October  2002 guidance also reemphasized that utility privatization was contingent  upon the services demonstrating through an economic analysis that  privatization will reduce the long-term costs to the government for utility  services. The guidance included details for conducting the economic  analyses, stating that the services\u2019 analyses should compare the long-term  estimated costs of proposed privatization contracts with the estimated  long-term costs of continued government ownership assuming that the  systems would be upgraded, operated, and maintained at accepted  industry standards, as would be required under privatization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Report Identified Weaknesses in Program Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In May 2005, we issued a report that identified management weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s implementation of the utility privatization program.

In March  2006, DOD reported to Congress that the independent review included  procedures to review the general inputs and assumptions, verify that the  inventory in the economic analysis is identical to the inventory in the  solicitation, and ensure that the government and the contractor treat the  renewal and replacement cost estimates in a consistent manner. Even  before DOD issued the guidance requiring independent reviews, Army and  Air Force officials stated that they had implemented such reviews to help  ensure reliability of their project analyses.

The analysis estimated that the Air Force would spend $7.1 million on  renewals and replacements during the first year of continued government  ownership. Under the first year of privatization, the analysis estimated that  the contractor would spend about $0.2 million on renewals and  replacements. When we asked about this difference, Air Force officials  stated that the contractor is not required to perform the same renewals  and replacements identified in the government estimate and that the  government found the contractor\u2019s proposal to be acceptable. Because the  analysis was not based on performing the same work, the cost estimates  were not consistently developed and resulted in favoring the privatization  option.

This occurs because DOD must deal with the contractor or pay  significant amounts to construct a new utility distribution system to  replace the one conveyed to the contractor, attempt to purchase the  system back from the contractor, or institute legal action to reacquire the  system through condemnation proceedings.

First, DOD stated in its  March 2006 report to Congress that a contractor also may have limited  options under privatization because the contractor typically cannot use  the installation\u2019s utility system to service other customers. DOD reported  that privatization creates a one-to-one relationship between the  installation and the contractor. In this relationship, DOD stated that both  parties must work together to execute fair and equitable contract changes,  both parties have significant vested interests in successful negotiations,  and both parties retain substantial negotiation leverage.", "Second, DOD noted that service contracts awarded as part of a  privatization transaction are contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition  Regulation and applicable statutes.

According to DOD, most utility privatization contracts include  provisions for periodic price adjustments. The price adjustment process  allows contract price changes based on changes in market prices,  generally to cover inflation, and changes to the service requirement from  system additions or modifications resulting from capital upgrades. Under  this process, the contractor is required to submit sufficient data to support  the accuracy and reliability of the basis for service charge adjustments. If  the contractor\u2019s data is determined to be fair and reasonable, the  contracting officer negotiates a service charge adjustment. Utility  privatization contracts normally provide for price adjustments after an  initial 2-year period and every 3 years thereafter. In addition to cost  increases from service charge adjustments, contract costs can also  increase as a result of contract modifications to pay for additional capital  improvement projects not included in the initial contract.", "According to the services, utility privatization contracts for 22 systems are  currently undergoing, or will be subject to, their first periodic price  adjustment before the end of calendar year 2007. Although it is too early  to know the extent of cost changes that might occur in these contracts,  our review of six contracts\u2014one that completed a periodic price  adjustment, one that was undergoing periodic price adjustment, and four  that had not yet undergone a periodic price adjustment\u2014found conditions  that indicate that cost growth in utility privatization contracts may become  a concern. Changes in contract costs could result in privatization costs  increasing above the levels estimated in the economic analyses. To  illustrate:    The Fort Rucker natural gas distribution system privatization contract was  issued on April 24, 2003. The contract provided for a price adjustment  after the initial 2 years of the contract and then every 3 years thereafter. In  February 2005, the contractor submitted a proposal for a price adjustment  and requested an increase in the price paid to the contractor for  operations and maintenance, associated overhead, and renewals and  replacements. According to a government memorandum that summarized  the results of the price adjustment process, the requested increases were  based on the contractor\u2019s actual labor hours and material costs and  additional overhead costs which resulted from a change in the way the  contractor calculated overhead costs. The change in overhead calculations  included costs that were not included in the original proposal submission  or in the contract. When queried, the contractor responded that the costs  were not originally submitted but should have been. After review, the  government team responsible for the price adjustment process determined  that the requested increases were allowable and reasonable and approved  the price increase. The change increased the government\u2019s annual utility  service charge costs from about $87,000 to about $124,000, an increase of  about $36,000, or 41 percent. In approving the increase, the government  team noted that although the estimated cost avoidance from privatization  would be reduced, the contract was still economical compared to the  estimated costs of government ownership.", "The Sunny Point electric distribution system privatization contract was  issued on September 30, 2003. In January 2006, the contractor submitted a  proposal for a price adjustment and requested an increase in the utility  service charge based on the contractor\u2019s actual labor hours and material  costs associated with operating and maintaining the system, including the  installation\u2019s emergency generators. According to installation officials, the  costs to operate and maintain the system were significantly higher than  originally anticipated by the contractor because of errors in the system\u2019s  inventory used to develop the solicitation, such as not including all of the  installation\u2019s emergency generators. When queried about the requested  price increase, the contractor responded that the initial contract bid would  have been higher if the true inventory of the system had been known.  Although the price adjustment process was not final at the time of our visit  in June 2006, installation officials stated that the government team  responsible for the process had determined that the requested increases  were allowable and reasonable and had approved the price increase. As a  result of the price adjustment, the government\u2019s annual utility service  costs are expected to increase from about $415,000 to $798,000 in the third  year of the contract, an increase of about $383,000, or 92 percent.", "The Fort Eustis electric distribution system privatization contract was  issued on June 24, 2004. While this contract is not scheduled for a periodic  price adjustment until December 2006, the contract costs have increased  by about $431,000, or 26 percent, since the contract was signed. The  increase is the result of two factors. First, the annual service charge was  increased by about $73,000 as the result of correcting errors to the  system\u2019s inventory described in the privatization solicitation. Second, the  contract\u2019s cost was increased by about $358,000 to pay for capital  improvement projects that were added to the original contract. Fort Eustis  officials stated that funding for the capital improvement projects added to  the contract did not have to compete for funding against other needed  installation improvement projects because project costs were added to the  privatization contract. The officials stated that it was unclear whether  these projects would have been approved for funding had the privatization  contract not been in place.", "The remaining three contracts we reviewed\u2014the water and wastewater  privatization contracts at Bolling Air Force Base and the electric  distribution system privatization contract at Dobbins Air Reserve Base\u2014 were not yet eligible for, or not subject to, a periodic price adjustment.

The concern was caused by the methodology DOD uses to determine  whether a proposed privatization contract would meet the statutory  requirement for reduced long-term costs. In our previous report, we noted  that DOD\u2019s guidance directs the services to compare the estimated long- term costs of the contract with the estimated long-term \u201cshould costs\u201d of  continued government ownership assuming that the service would  upgrade, operate, and maintain the system in accordance with accepted  industry standards as called for in the proposed contract. This estimating  method would be appropriate, if in the event the system is not privatized,  the service proceeded to upgrade, operate, and maintain the system as  called for in the estimate. However, this generally is not the case.  According to DOD and service officials, if a system is not privatized, then  the anticipated system improvements would probably be delayed because  of DOD\u2019s budget allocation decisions, which have limited funds for utility  improvements. Because of the time value of money, a future expense of a  given amount is equivalent to a smaller amount in today\u2019s dollars. Thus, if  reduced costs to the government are expected to be a key factor in utility  privatization decision making, then it would appear more appropriate for  the services to compare the cost of a proposed privatization contract with  the cost of continued government ownership on the basis of the actual  planned expenditures and timing of these expenditures.", "Since May 2005, DOD has not changed the guidance for performing the  economic analyses nor has DOD taken other steps, such as showing  current utility system costs in the economic analyses, to change the  perception that the utility privatization program results in reduced costs to  the government. DOD\u2019s November 2005 supplemental program guidance  directed the services to continue to prepare economic analyses based on  the \u201cshould costs,\u201d which is defined as an independent government  estimate of the costs required to bring the system up to and maintain it at  current industry standards. Further, DOD\u2019s March 2006 report to Congress  stated that the \u201cshould cost\u201d estimate is the government\u2019s best tool for  predicting the future requirement for individual systems and is the most  realistic methodology. Yet, the report also acknowledged that the  department had done an inadequate job of defining industry standards and  then subsequently programming, budgeting, and executing to that  requirement. Because DOD has not programmed funds to do the work  described in the \u201cshould cost\u201d estimate if the system is not privatized,  DOD\u2019s estimates of the reduced costs to the government that would result  from privatization are not based on realistic cost differences.", "Information that DOD reported to Congress in March 2006 illustrates our  concern. DOD\u2019s report stated that the department\u2019s total cost avoidance  from utility conveyances is expected to exceed $1 billion in today\u2019s dollars  and, as shown in table 6, the report included information showing that the  81 contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2688 will result in about $650 million  in reduced costs to the government in today\u2019s dollars compared to DOD\u2019s  \u201cshould cost\u201d estimate.", "DOD\u2019s reported cost avoidance amounts provide an unrealistic sense of  savings for several reasons:    First, as previously stated, the estimated costs under government  ownership are not based on the actual expected costs if the system is not  privatized but rather on a higher \u201cshould cost\u201d amount. As a result,  estimated costs under government ownership are overstated and,  therefore, DOD\u2019s estimated cost avoidance is overstated, at least in the  short term.", "Second, the government\u2019s costs for utility services increase with  privatization. Army officials estimated that average annual cost increase  for each privatized Army system was $1.3 million. Also, the services  estimate that they will need $453 million more than is currently  programmed for continuing government ownership to pay for the contract  and other costs associated with the remaining number of utility systems  that might be privatized through 2010 for the Air Force and the Navy and  Marine Corps, and through 2011 for the Army.", "Third, DOD\u2019s reported cost avoidance does not consider the program\u2019s  one-time implementation costs. Through fiscal year 2005, about $268  million was spent to implement the program.", "Fourth, the economic analyses used to estimate the cost avoidance  between the government-owned and privatization options for several of  the 81 projects included in DOD\u2019s report to Congress are unreliable. As  noted in our previous report, our review of seven project analyses  identified inaccuracies, unsupported cost estimates, and noncompliance  with guidance for performing the analyses. The cost estimates in the  analyses generally favored the privatization option by understating long- term privatization costs or overstating long-term government ownership  costs. When we made adjustments to address the issues in these analyses,  the estimated cost avoidance with privatization was reduced or eliminated.  Also, as discussed in another section of this report, although DOD has  taken steps to improve reliability, we found questionable items in 10  economic analyses supporting projects awarded after our May 2005 report.", "Fifth, cost growth in privatization contracts might reduce or eliminate the  amount of the estimated cost avoidance from privatization. We reviewed  the analysis supporting the Navy\u2019s one privatization project under 10  U.S.C. 2688, awarded in 1999, and compared actual contract costs to the  estimated contract costs included in the analysis. The analysis showed  that if contract costs continue to increase at the same rate experienced  since the contract was awarded, then the project\u2019s estimated cost  avoidance would be reduced from about $92.7 million to about $18 million.  This analysis also did not include consideration of privatization contract  oversight costs. Consideration of these costs would further reduce the  estimated cost avoidance to about $4 million. As discussed in another  section of this report, we found contract cost growth concerns in 3 of 6  additional utility privatization projects we reviewed, which will reduce the  estimated cost avoidance for those projects.", "In addition to providing an unrealistic sense of savings by providing only  the \u201cshould cost\u201d estimates, the economic analyses do not include other  information that would provide decision makers with a clearer picture of  the financial effect of privatization decisions. If the analyses included  information showing the amount that the government currently spends on  operating, maintaining, and upgrading the utility systems being evaluated  for privatization, decision makers could better consider the increase in  costs that will result from privatization as they assess the merits of  proposed projects. However, DOD\u2019s guidance does not require that the  services\u2019 economic analyses include current utility system cost  information.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 modified the  program\u2019s legislative authority by requiring that project economic analyses  incorporate margins of error in the estimates that minimize any  underestimation of the costs resulting from privatization of the utility  system or any overestimation of the costs resulting from continued  government ownership and management of the utility system. This step  could help improve the reliability of the cost differences between the  government-owned and privatization options. The modified authority  stated that incorporating margins of error in the estimates was to be based  upon guidance approved by the Secretary of Defense. However, as of June  2006, DOD had only issued general guidance in this area with no details on  how the services were to comply with the new requirement. Specifically,  on March 20, 2006, DOD issued guidance directing the services to include  in the economic analysis an explanation as to how margin of error  considerations were addressed in developing the independent government  cost estimate and carried forward in the price analysis report and cost  realism report. Although the guidance referenced Office of Management  and Budget Circular A-94, dated October 29, 1992; DOD Instruction 7041.3,  dated November 7, 1995; and Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum  and guidance dated October 9, 2002; none of these documents provide  details on how margins of error should be incorporated into the economic  analyses. At the time of our review in June 2006, Army and Navy officials  stated that they were evaluating how to include margins of error into  future economic analyses. Air Force officials stated that their economic  analyses already included margins of error calculations but that no formal  rules existed on how to use the results of the calculations.

To address this concern, we recommended that DOD place  greater scrutiny on the implementation of the fair market value  requirement in proposed contracts to minimize cases where contractors  recover more than the amounts they paid for system conveyances.  Subsequent to our report, in January 2006, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 was enacted.

However, a number of program concerns  remain because DOD\u2019s changes to address some issues noted in our  previous report have not been effectively implemented, some changes  were not sufficient to totally eliminate the concerns, and DOD did not  make changes to address some concerns. Specifically, implementation of  DOD\u2019s changes to improve the reliability of the economic analyses, such as  requiring independent reviews and noting the importance of  postconveyance reviews to compare actual contract costs with estimates  from the analyses, could be improved. The reliability of the analyses could  continue to be questionable until DOD requires independent reviewers to  report to decision makers on the thoroughness of the economic analyses  and any significant anomalies between the ownership options, estimated  costs, inventories, and assumptions and also issues guidance requiring the  services to perform the postconveyance reviews as noted in its March 2006  report to Congress. An additional concern is the services\u2019 estimated  shortfall in the funds needed to pay contract costs associated with the  remaining number of utility systems that might be privatized by the end of  their programs. Unless DOD addresses the potential funding shortfall in  view of all DOD and service funding and priority needs, questions will  remain over the availability of the additional funds needed to complete the  program. Also, although DOD\u2019s changes designed to improve utility  privatization contract administration and oversight are key steps in the  right direction, it may take some time to fully implement improvements as  new privatization contracts are awarded and oversight of older contracts  is assessed. Until DOD ensures that the contracts awarded prior to the  program changes have adequate resources and contractor performance  surveillance plans, the adequacy of contract oversight will remain a  concern. Further, because contractors own installation utility systems  after privatization, they may have an advantage when negotiating contract  changes and renewals. Unless DOD places additional emphasis on  monitoring contract cost growth as utility privatization contracts undergo  periodic price adjustments and other changes are negotiated, concern will  continue that containing utility privatization contract cost growth may  become a challenge.", "Because DOD did not change guidance to require that project economic  analyses show the actual costs of continued government ownership if the  system is not privatized, or take any other steps to change the perception  that the utility privatization program results in reduced costs to the  government, DOD continues to provide an unrealistic sense of savings to a  program that generally increases government utility costs in order to pay  contractors for enhanced utility services and capital improvements. Until  DOD requires that each economic analysis includes information on the  system\u2019s current costs and the actual expected costs if the system is not  privatized, decision makers will have incomplete information on the  financial effect of privatization decisions. In addition, unless the Secretary  of Defense issues detailed guidance explaining how the services should  incorporate margins of error in the economic analyses, as required by the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, there is little  assurance that the full benefit from this requirement will be achieved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment) to take the following  seven actions:  require independent reviewers to report to decision makers on the  thoroughness of each economic analysis and any significant anomalies in  the assumptions used and estimated costs for each ownership option;  issue guidance requiring the services to perform the postconveyance  reviews as noted in DOD\u2019s March 2006 report to Congress;    address the utility privatization program potential funding shortfall in view  of all DOD and service funding and priority needs;    ensure that utility privatization contracts awarded prior to the November  2005 supplemental guidance have adequate resources and contractor  performance surveillance plans;    place additional emphasis on monitoring contract cost growth as utility  privatization contracts undergo periodic price adjustments and other  changes are negotiated;  require, in addition to the \u201cshould cost\u201d estimate, that each project  economic analysis include the system\u2019s current annual costs and the actual  expected annual costs if the system is not privatized; and  issue detailed guidance explaining how the services should incorporate  margins of error in the economic analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In comments on a draft of this report, the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense (Installations and Environment) generally agreed with six of our  seven recommendations and outlined a plan of action to address each  recommendation. The Deputy Under Secretary noted that the utility  privatization systems evaluated in our report were approved prior to  DOD\u2019s November 2005 program guidance and that the guidance will be  fully implemented prior to awarding additional contracts. We recognize  that issues identified in this report pertain to contracts awarded before  supplemental program guidance was issued in November 2005.  Nevertheless, we believe the issues identified in this report highlight areas  that merit increased attention as the program continues\u2014and this is  reflected in the department\u2019s response to each recommendation.", "The Deputy Under Secretary indicated disagreement with our  recommendation to require, in addition to the \u201cshould cost\u201d estimate, that  each project economic analysis include the system\u2019s current annual costs  and the actual expected annual costs if the system is not privatized, and  also stated that full implementation of DOD\u2019s November 2005 guidance  will provide further reassurance that every conveyance will reduce the  long-term costs of the department compared to the costs of continued  ownership. However, as noted in our May 2005 report and again in this  report, we believe that in the short term it is clear that the utility  privatization program increases annual costs to the government where  contractors make system improvements and recoup their costs from the  department through their service contracts. DOD\u2019s sole use of \u201cshould  costs\u201d as a basis for comparing its long-term costs with those contained in  contractor proposals provides a less clear picture of savings to the  government since, as our reports have shown, the government\u2019s \u201cshould  costs\u201d do not provide a realistic portrayal of the planned government  expenditures. Accordingly, we believe our recommendation continues to  have merit.", "DOD\u2019s comments and our detailed response to specific statements in those  comments are presented in appendix II.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional  committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air  Force; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.

We discussed with DOD and service officials issues affecting  implementation of the program, such as the services\u2019 suspension of the  program between October 2005 and March 2006, and inquired about the  effects of implementation delays on program completion plans. Using data  from the services\u2019 quarterly program status reports to DOD, we  summarized the program implementation status by service and compared  the status to program status reported in our prior report. We confirmed  the quarterly reports\u2019 status data on five privatization projects at the four  installations we visited but did not otherwise test the reliability of the data.  We also reviewed and summarized the services\u2019 estimates of the additional  number of systems that might be privatized by the completion of their  programs and the funds needed to pay the costs associated with these  anticipated projects.", "To assess the effect of DOD\u2019s changes on the program management and  oversight concerns noted in our May 2005 report, we documented the  changes made by interviewing DOD and service officials and reviewing  pertinent policies, guidance, memorandums, and reports, discussed with  DOD and service officials the intended objective for each of the changes,  and compared the changes with the concerns identified in our prior report.  To assess the effect of DOD\u2019s changes on the reliability of the economic  analyses supporting privatization decisions, we reviewed the economic  analyses supporting 10 privatization projects that were awarded after our  May 2005 report and that had been subjected to the services\u2019 new  independent review processes. The analyses were judgmentally selected to  obtain examples from both the Army and the Air Force. For each analysis,  we evaluated the basis for the estimates and assumptions used and  assessed consistency and compliance with DOD guidance. We did not  otherwise attempt to independently determine estimates of long-term  costs for the projects. We shared the results of our analyses with service  officials and incorporated their comments as appropriate. To assess the  effect of DOD\u2019s changes on consideration of increased costs from utility  privatization, we summarized the services\u2019 estimates of the additional  funds that would be needed to pay costs associated with the remaining  number of utility systems that might be privatized and inquired about  DOD\u2019s plans for dealing with a potential program funding shortfall. To  assess the effect of DOD\u2019s changes on the administration and oversight of  utility privatization projects, we visited four installations with five utility  privatization projects awarded prior to our May 2005 report: Fort Eustis,  Virginia; the Army\u2019s Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, North Carolina;  Bolling Air Force Base, Maryland; and Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia.  These installations were judgmentally selected because they represented a  cross section of typical utility privatization projects, as corroborated with  service officials. At each installation, we discussed resources available for  contract oversight and plans for contractor performance monitoring. Also,  to assess the effect of DOD\u2019s changes on controlling cost growth in utility  privatization contracts, we reviewed cost changes in the five utility  privatization contracts at the installations we visited, discussed the  reasons for the changes with local officials, and compared the actual  contract costs with estimates from the projects\u2019 economic analyses. We  also reviewed cost changes in the Fort Rucker natural gas privatization  contract because, according to the services, it was the only contract  awarded under the legislative authority specifically provided for utility  privatization that had completed a periodic price adjustment. To assess  the effect of DOD\u2019s changes on cost avoidance estimates from  privatization, we reviewed the estimates DOD reported to Congress to  determine whether the estimates reflected the actual changes expected in  the government\u2019s utility costs.", "We conducted our review from March through July 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following is our detailed response to the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) comments provided on August 21, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Response to the Department of Defense\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["Our responses to DOD\u2019s comments are numbered below to correspond  with the department\u2019s various points.  1.  As noted in this report, we identified concerns with the independent  review performed on each of the 10 economic analyses we reviewed.  We did not attempt in this report to prove that the questionable items  we identified with each analysis would have changed the proposed  outcomes but noted that improvements are needed in the  thoroughness of the independent reviews that will be performed on  future projects. Until DOD requires independent reviewers to report to  decision makers on the thoroughness of the economic analyses and  any significant anomalies, we continue to believe the reliability of the  analyses could be questioned. As outlined in our May 2005 report and  this report, to ensure a valid comparison of costs we continue to  believe that the government\u2019s \u201cshould cost\u201d estimate should be closely  based on performing the same work that the contractor would  perform.  2.  Our report does not suggest that postconveyance reviews should be  conducted prematurely as indicated by DOD in its comments. The fact  is that the utility privatization contracts under 10 U.S.C. 2688 authority  began to be awarded in 1999, about 7 years ago, and postconveyance  reviews do not appear to have been performed on many ongoing utility  privatization contracts since that time. Although DOD noted in its  March 2006 report the importance of postconveyance reviews as an  additional measure to help ensure reliable economic analyses, it has  not issued guidance to require the services to perform such reviews.  3.  Our report clearly shows that Air Force officials, not GAO, stated that  without additional resources, funding for utility privatization contracts  must come from other base operating support funds, which would  result in diverting critical resources from remaining facilities and  infrastructure.", "Furthermore, DOD\u2019s comment that utility sustainment funds have been  used for other base support operations in the past only reinforces the  need to address the utility privatization program potential funding  shortfall. We have completed a number of reviews in which we have  identified examples where the shifting of operation and maintenance  funds from one account to other accounts to fund must-pay bills and  other priorities contributes to management problems and funding  shortfalls. For example, in February 2003, we reported that the  services withheld facilities sustainment funding to pay must-pay bills,  such as civilian pay, emergent needs, and other nonsustainment  programs, throughout the year and transferred other funds back into  facilities sustainment at fiscal year\u2019s end. Still, the amounts of funds  spent on facilities sustainment were not sufficient to reverse the trend  in deterioration. In June 2005, we reported that hundreds of millions of  dollars originally designated for facilities sustainment and base  operations support had been redesignated by the services to pay for  the Global War on Terrorism. While installations received additional  funds at the end of the fiscal year to help offset shortfalls endured  during the year, the timing made it difficult for the installations to  maintain facilities and provide base support services efficiently and  effectively. Similarly, unless the potential funding shortfall in the utility  privatization program is addressed, funding will likely have to be  redesignated to fund the utility privatization program rather than be  used for its intended purpose.  4.  Our report raises concerns about the adequacy of the services\u2019  oversight of several privatization contracts that were awarded prior to  DOD\u2019s November 2005 supplemental guidance. Given that the Office of  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and  Environment) has overall policy and management oversight  responsibilities for the utility privatization program, we continue to  believe that this office is the appropriate level for providing direction  and assurance that utility privatization contracts awarded prior to the  supplemental guidance have adequate resources and contractor  performance surveillance plans, as we recommend.  5.  Our report highlights the importance of monitoring cost growth  because contractors have ownership of the utility systems after  privatization and, therefore, may have an advantage when negotiating  contract changes and renewals. In addition, controlling the potential  growth in the cost of ongoing utilities privatization contracts is  important to the services in their planning for the adequate funding of  the program. We did not review the effect of contract cost growth on  the government estimate because the government estimate is not a  relevant factor in controlling costs once a system has been privatized.  Although a comparison of actual costs of a privatization project with  the estimates included in the project\u2019s economic analysis is a useful  tool to help improve the reliability of analyses of future privatization  projects, it is unlikely that such comparisons would assist in  controlling cost growth.", "Furthermore, DOD\u2019s comment refers to a \u201csavings delta.\u201d As noted in  our May 2005 report and again in this report, in the short term it is  clear that the utility privatization program increases annual costs to  the department where contractors make system improvements and  recoup their costs through the service contracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Barry W.
