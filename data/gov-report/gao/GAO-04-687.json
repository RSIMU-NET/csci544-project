While in military status and later as veterans, many  patients tend to be highly mobile and may have health records residing at  multiple medical facilities within and outside of the United States. Having  readily accessible medical data on these individuals is important to  providing high-quality health care to them and to adjudicating any  disability claims that they may have. This goal of having electronic medical  records that display all available clinical information in each department\u2019s  health information system is a positive and necessary step. However, as  we have previously reported, the lack of progress the departments have  made in accomplishing this two-way exchange of health care data raises  doubts as to when and to what extent a true electronic medical record will  be achieved.", "As requested, our objective was to assess VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s recent progress  toward achieving an electronic two-way exchange of health care data. In  conducting our work, we analyzed key documentation supporting VA\u2019s  and DOD\u2019s strategy for developing and implementing the two-way  electronic exchange of health data. In addition, we reviewed  documentation to identify the costs incurred by VA and DOD in developing  technology to support the sharing of health data, including costs for the  Government Computer-Based Patient Record/Federal Health Information  Exchange (GCPR/FHIE) initiatives, DOD\u2019s Composite Health Care System  II, and VA\u2019s HealtheVet VistA. We did not audit the reported costs, and  thus, cannot attest to their accuracy or completeness. We supplemented  our analyses with interviews of VA and DOD officials responsible for key  decisions and actions on the initiatives. Our work was performed at VA  and DOD offices located in the Washington, D.C., area in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards, from December 2003  to May of this year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998 VA and DOD have been trying to achieve the capability to share  patient health care data electronically. The original effort\u2014the  government computer-based patient record (GCPR) project\u2014included the  Indian Health Service (IHS) and was envisioned as an electronic interface  that would allow physicians and other authorized users at VA, DOD, and  IHS health facilities to access data from any of the other agencies\u2019 health  information systems. The interface was expected to compile requested  patient information in a virtual record that could be displayed on a user\u2019s  computer screen.", "Our prior reviews of the GCPR project determined that the lack of a lead  entity, clear mission, and detailed planning to achieve that mission made it  difficult to monitor progress, identify project risks, and develop  appropriate contingency plans. Accordingly, reporting on this project in  April 2001 and again in June 2002, we made several recommendations to  help strengthen the management and oversight of GCPR. Specifically, in  2001 we recommended that the participating agencies (1) designate a lead  entity with final decision-making authority and establish a clear line of  authority for the GCPR project, and (2) create comprehensive and  coordinated plans that included an agreed-upon mission and clear goals,  objectives, and performance measures, to ensure that the agencies could  share comprehensive, meaningful, accurate, and secure patient health care  data. In 2002, we recommended that the participating agencies revise the  original goals and objectives of the project to align with their current  strategy, commit the executive support necessary to adequately manage  the project, and ensure that it followed sound project management  principles. VA and DOD took specific measures in response to our  recommendations for enhancing overall management and accountability  of the project.", "By July 2002, VA and DOD had revised their strategy and had made some  progress toward electronically sharing patient health data. The two  departments had renamed the project the Federal Health Information  Exchange (FHIE) program and, consistent with our prior  recommendation, had finalized a memorandum of agreement designating  VA as the lead entity for implementing the program. This agreement also  established FHIE as a joint effort that would allow the exchange of health  care information in two phases. The first phase, completed in mid-July  2002, enabled the one-way transfer of data from DOD\u2019s existing health  information system to a separate database that VA clinicians could access.  A second phase, finalized this past March, completed VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s  efforts to add to the base of patient health information available to VA  clinicians via this one-way sharing capability. The departments reported  total GCPR/FHIE costs of about $85 million through fiscal year 2003.", "The revised strategy also envisioned the pursuit of a longer term, two-way  exchange of health information between DOD and VA. Known as  HealthePeople (Federal), this initiative is premised upon the departments\u2019  development of a common health information architecture comprising  standardized data, communications, security, and high-performance health  information systems. The joint effort is expected to result in the secured  sharing of health data required by VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s health care providers  between systems that each department is currently developing\u2014DOD\u2019s  Composite Health Care System (CHCS) II and VA\u2019s HealtheVet VistA.", "DOD began developing CHCS II in 1997 and has completed the  development of its associated clinical data repository\u2014a key component  for the planned electronic interface. The department expects to complete  deployment of all of its major system capabilities by September 2008. It  reported expenditures of about $464 million for the system through fiscal  year 2003. VA began work on HealtheVet VistA and its associated health  data repository in 2001, and expects to complete all six initiatives  comprising this system in 2012. VA reported spending about $120 million  on HealtheVet VistA through fiscal year 2003.", "Under the HealthePeople (Federal) initiative, VA and DOD envision that,  upon entering military service, a health record for the service member will  be created and stored in DOD\u2019s CHCS II clinical data repository. The  record will be updated as the service member receives medical care. When  the individual separates from active duty and, if eligible, seeks medical  care at a VA facility, VA will then create a medical record for the  individual, which will be stored in its health data repository. Upon viewing  the medical record, the VA clinician would be alerted and provided access  to the individual\u2019s clinical information residing in DOD\u2019s repository. In the  same manner, when a veteran seeks medical care at a military treatment  facility, the attending DOD clinician would be alerted and provided with  access to the health information in VA\u2019s repository. According to the  departments, this planned approach would make virtual medical records  displaying all available patient health information from the two  repositories accessible to both departments\u2019 clinicians. VA officials have  stated that they anticipate being able to exchange some degree of health  information through an interface of their health data repository with  DOD\u2019s clinical data repository by the end of calendar year 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Two-Way Exchange Could Benefit from Improved Planning and Project Management", "paragraphs": ["While VA and DOD are making progress in agreeing to and adopting  standards for clinical data, they continue to face significant challenges in  providing a virtual medical record based on the two-way exchange of data  as part of their HealthePeople (Federal) initiative.

Developing, maintaining, and using an architecture is a best practice in  engineering information systems and other technological solutions. An  architecture would articulate, for example, the system requirements and  design specifications, database descriptions, and software descriptions  that define the manner in which the departments will electronically store,  update, and transmit their data.", "VA and DOD lack an explicit architecture that provides details on what  specific technologies they will use to achieve the exchange capability, or  just what they will be able to exchange by the end of 2005\u2014their projected  date for having this capability operational.

The act mandated that VA and DOD develop a real-time  interface, data exchange, and capability to check prescription drug data  for outpatients by October 1, 2004. In late February, VA hired a contractor  to develop the planned prototype but the departments had not yet fully  determined the approach or requirements for it. DOD officials stated that  the contractor was expected to more fully define the technical  requirements for the prototype. In late April, the departments reported  approval of the contractor\u2019s requirements and technical design for the  prototype.", "While the pharmacy prototype may help define a technical solution for the  two-way exchange of health information between the two departments\u2019  existing systems, there is no assurance that this same solution can be used  to interface the new systems under development. Because the  departments\u2019 new health information systems\u2014major components of  HealthePeople (Federal)\u2014are scheduled for completion over the next 4 to  9 years, the prototype may only test the ability to exchange data in VA\u2019s  and DOD\u2019s existing health systems.

However, this oversight by the executive  councils is at a very high level, occurs either bimonthly or quarterly, and  encompasses all of the joint coordination and sharing efforts for health  services and resources.
