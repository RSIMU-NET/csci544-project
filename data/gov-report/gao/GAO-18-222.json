These project delivery provisions included new categorical exclusions to streamline the review process, and a provision allowing DOT to assign federal NEPA approval authority to states.", "Congress included provisions in statute for GAO to assess the use of these provisions and whether they have accelerated project delivery. This report examines: (1) which project delivery provisions were used by state DOTs and selected transit agencies and the reported effects, and (2) the extent to which DOT has assigned NEPA authority to states and the reported effects, among other objectives.

Project sponsors prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) when a project will have a significant environmental impact, or an environmental assessment to determine if a project will have a significant impact. Projects that fit within a category of activities pre-determined to have no significant impact (such as repaving a road) can receive a categorical exclusion, and an EIS or environment assessment is generally not needed. GAO found:", "State DOTs and selected transit agencies reported using provisions enacted in law to speed up the delivery of highway and transit projects, and while state DOTs reported that a number of provisions they used sped up delivery of highway projects, the effects on transit projects were less clear. For example, according to GAO's survey responses, 10 of 17 provisions that mainly created new \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d were used by 30 or more state DOTs and generally sped up projects. The provision state DOTs and transit agencies most often reported using was one that authorizes parkland or a historic site to be used for a transportation project if that project has a minimal impact on the environment. A majority of the 11 transit agencies GAO reviewed were not clear whether provisions they used sped up project delivery because these agencies did not track how long it took projects to complete the NEPA process, among other reasons.", "DOT assigned NEPA authority to six states: Alaska, California, Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Utah. Under agreements with FHWA, state DOTs calculate time savings by comparing NEPA completion times before (the baseline) and after assuming the authority. Only California and Texas have reported results; California reported that it reduced EIS review time 10 years from a 16-year baseline. However, these reported time savings are questionable because the comparisons do not consider other factors, such as funding, that can affect timelines. In establishing baselines, both states have also faced challenges, such as how many and which projects to include. California reported to its legislature that its baseline may not be meaningful because of the relatively small sample of five projects, but nevertheless presents these data on its web site as evidence of \u201csignificant\u201d time savings.", "FHWA does not review the states' timeliness measures and time savings estimates, but has broad authority to offer guidance and technical assistance, which can include helping states develop sound evaluation methodologies and baselines. FHWA officials stated that they provide general technical assistance, but that no state has requested help developing evaluation methodologies. Offering and providing such assistance could help ensure that states considering applying for NEPA assignment base their decisions on reliable information, and that FHWA and Congress have reliable information to assess whether NEPA assignment results in more efficient environmental reviews."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FHWA should offer and provide guidance or technical assistance to NEPA assignment states on developing evaluation methodologies, including baseline time frames and timeliness measures.

The  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration  (FHWA) through its division offices in each state and the Federal Transit  Administration (FTA) through its 10 regional offices are the federal  agencies responsible for NEPA compliance on highway and transit  projects, respectively. Project sponsors\u2014typically a state department of  transportation (state DOT) or a local transit agency\u2014receive FHWA and  FTA grant funds, oversee the construction of highway and transit projects,  develop the documents on which FHWA and FTA base their evaluations  of environmental effects, and collaborate with federal and state  stakeholders. In short, project sponsors generally prepare the documents  necessary for NEPA compliance, while the federal agencies must  ultimately approve the documents. In this report we refer to these  activities collectively as \u201cenvironmental review\u201d or \u201cNEPA review.\u201d", "We have previously reported that environmental review is one of a  number of factors affecting the time frame for completing transportation  projects (delivery).

To determine states\u2019 use and reported  effects of the provisions on highway projects, we surveyed state DOTs  within all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We had a  100 percent response rate. Based on the survey results, we conducted  follow-up interviews with officials from 10 state DOTs to discuss their  perceived effects of the provisions in greater detail. We selected these  state DOTs to include geographically diverse states and states that  reported varying levels of use of the provisions and effects. To determine  use and the perceived effects of the provisions applicable to selected  transit projects, we selected 11 transit agencies and interviewed officials  at those agencies. We selected these agencies based primarily on the  number of times they issued a notice of intent to prepare an  environmental impact statement (EIS) in the Federal Register from 2005  through 2016 to identify those transit agencies that may have experience  preparing EISs or some another NEPA review and experience using  transit project delivery provisions.

However, we did not include one of these states  because that state did not assume NEPA authority until November 2017.  For the states we included, we interviewed state DOT officials and  reviewed relevant documentation including memorandums of  understanding and analyses the state DOTs conducted on NEPA  assignment authority, such as methodologies for calculating NEPA  assignment time savings. In addition, we interviewed FHWA officials  about procedures to oversee the performance of NEPA assignment  states and interviewed FHWA division officials from those states.

Completing major highway and transit  projects involves complex processes that depend on a wide range of  stakeholders conducting many tasks. Project sponsors\u2014the state DOTs  and local transit agencies\u2014are the entities that develop the  environmental review documents to be approved by the federal agencies.  Examples of highway projects that may undergo environmental review  are bridge construction or roadway repaving, and examples of transit  projects include extension of light rail lines or construction of passenger  ferry facilities. Project sponsors that do not use federal funds for a project  generally do not need to meet NEPA requirements, but may still need to  satisfy state or local environmental review requirements.", "As we have previously reported, highway projects typically include four  phases, and transit projects also follow similar processes.  1.  Planning: Project sponsors assess the need for a project in relation to  other potential transportation needs.  2.  Preliminary design and environmental review: Project sponsors  identify potential transportation solutions based on identified needs,  the potential environmental and social effects of those solutions, a  project\u2019s cost, and construction location. They then analyze the effect,  if any, of the project and potential alternatives on the environment.  Based on the analysis as well as public input the preferred alternative  is selected.  3.  Final design and right-of-way acquisition: Project sponsors finalize  design plans and, if necessary, acquire private real property for the  project right-of-way and relocate any affected residents and  businesses.  4.  Construction: Project sponsors award construction contracts, oversee  construction, and accept the completed project.", "In the preliminary design and environmental review phase, many activities  are to be carried out by the project sponsor pursuant to NEPA and other  federal laws. NEPA\u2019s two principal purposes are to ensure (1) that an  agency carefully considers detailed information concerning significant  environmental impacts and (2) that environmental information is available  to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and actions are  taken. For highway and transit projects, the project sponsor is  responsible for preparing documentation showing the extent of the  project\u2019s environmental impacts, in accordance with NEPA, and  determining which of the three following documentation types is needed:", "An environmental impact statement (EIS), the most comprehensive of  the three documentation types, is required for projects that have a  significant effect on the environment. In broad terms, the lead federal  agency, FHWA or FTA, starts the EIS process by publishing a notice  of intent in the Federal Register. The lead agency then must engage  in an open process\u2014inviting the participation of affected government  agencies, Indian tribes, the proponent of the action, and other  interested persons\u2014for determining the scope of issues to be  addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to a  proposed action. The lead agency then is to coordinate as appropriate  with resource agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or  the Fish and Wildlife Service, solicit comments from the public on a  draft EIS, incorporate comment responses as appropriate into a final  EIS, and issue a record of decision.", "Project sponsors are to prepare environmental assessments when,  among other things, it is not clear whether a project is expected to  have significant environmental impacts. An environmental  assessment is intended to be a concise document that, among other  things, briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for  determining whether to prepare an EIS. If the agency determines that  there are no significant impacts from the proposed action, then the  agency prepares a Finding of No Significant Impact that presents the  reasons why the agency made that determination. If the agency  determines the project may cause significant environmental impacts, it  conducts an EIS.", "Categorical exclusions refer to projects that would not individually or  cumulatively have a significant effect on the environment. These  projects generally require no or limited environmental review or  documentation under NEPA. Examples of highway projects that are  generally processed as categorical exclusions include resurfacing  roads, constructing bicycle lanes, installing noise barriers, and  landscaping.", "While FHWA and FTA are the federal agencies responsible for ensuring  NEPA compliance on highway and transit projects, if certain requirements  are met, FHWA or FTA may assign a state and that state may assume  federal NEPA authority. States assume this authority subject to the same  procedural and substantive requirements as would apply to FHWA or  FTA. Specifically, the NEPA Assignment Authority provision provides  authority for FHWA to assign federal NEPA authority to states for  approving an EIS, environmental assessment, or categorical exclusion.  States must apply to FHWA or FTA, which reviews the state\u2019s suitability  to assume the authority based on meeting certain regulatory  requirements and the state\u2019s capability to assume the responsibility.  States must enter into a written memorandum of understanding (MOU)  and must, among other things, expressly consent to the jurisdiction of  federal courts by waiving sovereign immunity for any responsibility  assumed for NEPA. The MOU is for a term of not more than 5 years and  is renewable. MOUs are unique to each state; however they all contain  certain sections such as assignments of authority, acceptance of  jurisdiction, and performance measures. For the first 4 years, FHWA is to  conduct an annual audit to ensure compliance with the MOU, including  compliance with all federal laws. After the fourth year, FHWA is to  continue to monitor state compliance with the MOU, using a more limited  review.", "In prior reports, we identified a number of factors that can affect the  length of time required to complete transportation projects. For highway  projects, we found that the large number of stakeholders and steps  (which include environmental reviews) in the project delivery process,  availability of funding, changing priorities, and public opposition can lead  to longer project time frames. For transit projects, we found that local  factors specific to each project determine the project development time  frame, including the extent of community support and extent of local  planning prior to approval of funding.

For instance, these provisions are primarily comprised of new categorical  exclusions. Additionally, the Minor Impacts to Protected Public Land  provision authorizes a historic site, parkland, or refuge to be used for a  transportation project if that project is determined to have a de minimis  impact on the environment.", "The Administrative and Coordination Changes category\u2019s provisions are  more process oriented. These provisions, for example: (1) establish time  frames for parts of the NEPA review process, (2) encourage the use of  planning documents and programmatic plans as well as a coordination  plan for public and federal agency participation in the environmental  review process, and (3) seek to avoid duplication in NEPA review  documents.", "The NEPA Assignment category\u2019s provisions authorize FHWA or FTA, as  discussed above, to assign their NEPA authority to states.

The second  provision\u2014the Categorical Exclusion Determination Authority provision\u2014 allows FHWA or FTA to assign limited NEPA authority to states to review  categorical exclusions. This authority can apply to categorical  exclusions with air-quality reviews, as well as all other categorical  exclusions.", "The Advance Planning category\u2019s provisions are not part of the agency\u2019s  environmental review process and are not applicable to transit projects.  These provisions allow for certain activities in the highway project  development cycle, such as land acquisition, to occur prior to NEPA  approval. The three provisions in this category include the following:", "The Advance Design-Build Contracting provision permits a state to  release requests for proposals and award design-build contracts prior  to completing the NEPA process; however, a contractor may not  proceed with final design or construction during the NEPA process.", "The Advance Acquisition of Real Property provision authorizes states  to acquire real property interests, such as land, for a project before  completion of the NEPA process.", "The 2-phase Contracts provision authorizes the awarding of contracts  on a competitive basis for preconstruction services and preliminary  project design before the completion of the NEPA process.", "Most of the project delivery provisions are optional, which we define to  mean that the relevant entities (a federal agency or state or local  transportation agency), can choose to use the provision if circumstances  allow. For example, a state highway project within an existing operational  right-of-way may have the option to use the categorical exclusion for  projects within an existing operational right-of-way. Specifically, 22 of the  34 highway project delivery provisions and 17 of the 29 transit project  delivery provisions are optional. By contrast, 12 provisions are  requirements for both highway and transit projects, which we define to  mean that federal agencies, or state or local transportation agencies that  are subject to a provision must adhere to the requirements and  obligations in the provision, if all the conditions for its use have been  satisfied. Required provisions are primarily contained in the  Administrative and Coordination Changes category. For example, for  highway projects, the Programmatic Agreements for Efficient  Environmental Review provision, enacted in 2012, requires FHWA to  seek opportunities with states to enter into agreements that establish  streamlined processes for handling routine projects, such as highway  repair. Prior to 2012, FHWA actively encouraged programmatic  agreements between state DOTs and FHWA division offices, but seeking  opportunities to enter such agreements were not required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State DOTs Reported That a Number of Provisions They Used Sped Up Highway Project Delivery, While for Most Selected Transit Agencies Effects Were Unclear", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "More Than Half of Optional Provisions Were Reported to Be Used by a Majority of State DOTs on Highway Projects", "paragraphs": ["According to survey responses, 10 of the 17 optional provisions included  in the survey\u2014which primarily fall under the Accelerated NEPA Review  category\u2014were each used by 30 or more state DOTs (see fig. 1).

Also, for  3 of these 7 provisions, 10 or more states reported that they plan to use  the provision in the future.

However, our discussions with selected states  and optional comments provided in the survey provided some additional  insight into states\u2019 use of the provisions. Officials at some state DOTs  reported that they had not used certain categorical exclusions because  other categorical exclusions could also apply to those projects.  Specifically, officials in 4 state DOTs told us that they did not use 4  categorical exclusion provisions for this reason. For example, officials at  the Colorado DOT said that the Categorical Exclusion for Geotechnical  and Archeological Investigations provision has not been used in Colorado  because other categorical exclusions were more applicable. Similarly,  officials at the Oklahoma DOT said that they had not used the Categorical  Exclusion for Projects within the Existing Operational Right-of-Way  provision because most of those projects already qualify for a categorical  exclusion under other criteria.

FHWA officials said that without the Minor  Impacts to Protected Public Land provision, a state DOT would need to  complete an environmental assessment to show that performing even a  small project, such as adding a small bus stop on the periphery of a park,  would not have significant effects on the environment. The Minor  Impacts to Protected Public Land provision now allows a state DOT to  complete transportation projects that have a minimal environmental effect  on historic sites and parklands more quickly because the state DOT can  bypass the environmental assessment process. In our survey and  discussions with state DOTs, some officials noted how much time the  provision can help them save. Officials at the Virginia DOT estimated  that a 9-month to 1-year review could be cut to 2 to 4 months. An official  at the Colorado DOT said that reviews that used to take 6 months now  take 30 days.

They said  the provision allows the state DOT to use a categorical exclusion,  which takes 6 to 8 months for some projects, in place of an  environmental assessment, which can take 12 to 18 months and  involves additional review steps such as providing evidence and  analysis as to why a project does not require an EIS.", "Use of Federal Highway or Transit Funds to Support Agencies  Participating in the Environmental Review Process provision: Arizona  DOT officials said that the state DOT funds positions in the Army  Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Service that help lessen  the time it takes for those agencies to provide comments on Arizona  DOT project\u2019s NEPA reviews. The officials estimated these positions  reduce review time by about one month compared to when these  agencies did not have Arizona DOT-funded positions.", "For the remaining six optional provisions, 41 to 58 percent of users  reported that the provisions had no effect on project delivery. Based on  discussions with selected state DOTs and comments included with survey  responses, officials at some state DOTs reported that the provisions did  not have any effect because the states had already developed similar  processes, either through programmatic agreements with their FHWA  division office or at their own initiative. As a result, the state DOTs did not  realize any new time savings after the provisions were enacted in law. For  example, for each of three provisions that allow for certain documentation  to be eliminated for categorical exclusions, officials at seven state DOTs  reported that they had already developed similar processes through  programmatic agreements with their FHWA division office. Further, five  state DOTs reported that the Early Coordination Activities in  Environmental Review Process provision had no effect because they  already had a similar coordination process in place.

For  example, officials at the Mississippi DOT reported that a programmatic  agreement with the FHWA division office can allow it to save 6 to 8  months when processing categorical exclusions for projects with minimal  right-of-way acquisition. They explained that they no longer had to wait for  the FHWA division office to process the categorical exclusion. As  previously discussed, prior to 2012, FHWA actively encouraged, but did  not require, programmatic agreements between state DOTs and FHWA  division offices. In interviews and optional comments from the survey,  officials reported that programmatic agreements, both those entered into  before and after the enactment of the provision, had sped up project  delivery. We did not determine the number of state DOTs that attributed  the speed up in project delivery to the 2012 provision, as opposed to  those who attributed it to the earlier programmatic agreements with their  FHWA division offices. All of the required provisions reportedly sped up  project delivery for at least 4 state DOTs.", "For 5 of the 12 provisions, between 10 and 18 states responded that the  provisions sped up project delivery.

For 5 of  the 12 required provisions, more than one third of state DOTs (over 17  states) reported that it was too soon to judge the provisions\u2019 effects. Four  of these 5 provisions were enacted in the FAST Act in 2015.  Consequently, state DOTs that used the provision had a short window of time to assess any potential effect on project delivery\u2014particularly given  that highway projects often take a number of years to complete. Also,  while our survey did not ask state DOTs when they had most recently  initiated an EIS, several state DOTs voluntarily noted that they had not  done so since the FAST Act. Certain provisions apply only to projects  undergoing an EIS; states that have not done an EIS since such  provisions were enacted would not have had the opportunity to use the  provision. One such provision is the 45-Day Limit to Identify Resource  Agencies provision, for which 19 state DOTs reported that it was too early  to judge the effects.", "For 5 of the 12 provisions, a relatively few state DOTs, between one and  eight, reported that the provision had slowed down project delivery. Eight  states reported that the Coordination Plan for Public and Agency  Participation provision slowed down project delivery, the most for any  provision. According to the Minnesota DOT, this provision slowed down  project delivery because it formalized and required a specific coordination  process in addition to those that had already been voluntarily occurring  with relevant federal and state resource agencies. Formalizing this  process resulted in resource agencies taking longer to provide responses  to the Minnesota DOT. Other states similarly said that this provision\u2019s  additional formal processes slowed down project delivery.", "We defined required provisions to mean that federal agencies or state or  local transportation agencies that are subject to the provision must  adhere to requirements and obligations in the provision, if all the  conditions for its use have been satisfied.

We found that 48 transit agencies (out of  several hundreds of transit agencies) filed notices of intent from fiscal  year 2005 through 2016 but that of the 48 transit agencies, 34 had  filed a notice of intent only once during that time. In general, the vast  majority of transit agencies have little recent experience preparing EIS  documentation and using the provisions that are triggered by an  EIS.

A transit agency may have a project that goes through a  NEPA review and then begins construction of the project that can last  a number of years.

The report states that the NEPA assignment  program was initially created as a pilot program to provide information to  Congress and the public as to whether delegation of DOT\u2019s  environmental review responsibilities resulted in more efficient  environmental reviews. In addition, in MAP-21, Congress declared that  it is in the national interest to expedite the delivery of surface  transportation projects by substantially reducing the average length of the  environmental review process. State DOT officials from the five NEPA  assignment states we reviewed cited anticipated time savings or greater  efficiency in environmental review as a reason for taking on this authority.  For example, Texas DOT officials said they expected to save time by  eliminating FHWA approval processes that they described as time  consuming. With NEPA authority, the state puts in place its own approval  processes to carry out the federal government\u2019s NEPA review  responsibilities, and agrees to take on the risk of legal liability for  decisions made in this capacity.", "Additional states have expressed interest and have taken steps to apply  for NEPA authority.

To calculate time savings, each state has established a  baseline\u2014of the time it took to complete NEPA review before it assumed  NEPA authority\u2014to compare to the time it takes to complete NEPA  review after assuming NEPA authority. The baseline is to serve as a key  reference point in determining the efficiency of state-led NEPA reviews.  Thus far, the two states that have had NEPA authority long enough to  report results are California and Texas, and only California has reported  results for EISs. The California DOT reported that its EIS reviews now  take about 6 years to approve, which it determined to be a 10-year  improvement over the 16-year (15.9 years) baseline the state DOT  established. For environmental assessment reviews, the California DOT  reported completion times of about 3.5 years, which it determined to be a  1-year improvement over the established baseline. The Texas DOT has  not started and completed an EIS review since assuming NEPA authority  but reported that its environmental assessment reviews have taken about  1.5 years, compared to the baseline of almost 2.5 years.", "However, we found California and Texas DOTs\u2019 reported time savings to  be questionable due to the methods used to compare time frames and  challenges associated with establishing baselines. First, there is an  inherent weakness in comparing the NEPA review time frames before  and after NEPA authority because the comparison does not isolate the  effect of assuming NEPA authority on NEPA review time frames from  other possible factors. As discussed earlier, we have previously found  that such factors include the extent of public opposition to a project and  changes in transportation priorities, among other factors. Further,  according to a report from the American Association of State Highway  and Transportation Officials, such a comparison does not include  information to control for non-environmental factors that are important to  project delivery time frames, including delay in completion of design work  necessary to advance the environmental review and changes in project  funding that put a project on hold. Moreover, neither California nor  Texas DOTs\u2019 time frame comparisons isolate the effects of NEPA  assignment from other streamlining initiatives that may have helped  accelerate delivery of projects, such as potential benefits realized from  other project delivery provisions.", "Second, California and Texas have faced challenges creating appropriate  baselines. States are responsible for determining how many and which  projects to include in baseline calculations and adopting their own  methodologies. While circumstances and conditions are different across  states and states can be expected to have different experiences,  California\u2019s current 16-year EIS baseline is over double that of Texas\u2019 EIS  baseline. In 2012, we found that for the 32 projects in which FHWA was  the lead agency and signed the EIS in fiscal year 2009, the average time  to complete the process was about 7 years. According to information  contained in California DOT reports to the state legislature from 2007 and  2009, California\u2019s original baseline for EISs was comprised of 1 project  that resulted in an EIS baseline of 2.5 years. In 2009 state DOT officials  increased the number of EIS projects in order to achieve what they  viewed as a more representative mix. This process increased California\u2019s  EIS baseline six-fold, which has been consistently used since that time.  Specifically, California used the median of five projects that had review  times of around 2.5 years, 6.2 years, 15.9 years, 16.6 years, and 17.3  years. These projects were selected because they were among the final  EIS projects that were reviewed prior to California\u2019s assuming NEPA  authority.", "However, the EIS baseline may not be meaningful. First, it includes outlier  projects, which are projects that take much longer than usual to complete.  According to California DOT officials, this factor is a limitation to  determining time savings because the outliers increased the EIS baseline  and therefore makes subsequent time savings look greater than they are.  Next, despite the increase in EIS projects included in the baseline, a 2016  California DOT report to the state legislature stated that this new EIS  baseline may still not be meaningful because of the relatively small  sample size, and therefore the inferences that can be made from EIS  analysis on time savings are limited. The report caveats that \u201cthe EIS  analysis should not be used as a major indicator of the effectiveness of  NEPA assignment,\u201d but still reports the EIS analysis results. However,  California DOT uses the figure in determining and reporting time savings.  For example, information available on the California DOT\u2019s web site as of  November 2017 presents these data and states that they are evidence of  saving \u201csignificant time in reviewing and approving its NEPA documents  since undertaking NEPA assignment.\u201d", "Moreover, the California DOT\u2019s reported median time frame of 6 years for  EIS reviews only accounts for those projects that have both started and  completed their environmental review since the state assumed NEPA  authority. As only 10 years have passed since California assumed NEPA  authority in 2007, all EIS reviews started and completed since 2007  automatically have shorter time frames than the 16-year baseline. Thus, it  will be 2023 before any EIS reviews in California could equal the  baseline, let alone exceed it, making any EIS review started after  assumption of NEPA authority and completed before 2023 appear to  demonstrate time savings.", "Texas DOT officials stated that they had challenges determining a  baseline for environmental assessments because there is no nationally  accepted standard definition of when an environmental assessment  begins. Moreover, Texas DOT recently revised its environmental  assessment baseline, reducing it from 3 years to 2.5 years and including  projects over a 2-year period instead of a longer 3-year period due to  uncertainties with quality of the older data, according to Texas DOT  officials. Texas also included, then excluded three outliers from its revised  baseline (reviews that took between 6 and 9 years to complete) because  officials determined they were not representative of typical environmental  assessment reviews. While improving project data to create more  accurate baselines is beneficial, it also results in different time savings\u2019  estimates over time and illustrates the challenges of constructing sound  baselines.", "As previously discussed, states that are considering or have recently  decided to assume NEPA assignment authority have relied, at least in  part, on time savings reported by California and Texas. As additional  NEPA assignment states begin calculating and reporting time savings as  outlined in their MOUs with FHWA, the inherent weakness of a pre- and  post-assignment baseline comparison, combined with challenges  establishing sound baselines, creates the potential for questionable  information about the program\u2019s effects to be reported and relied upon by  other states considering applying for NEPA assignment.

According to the MOUs, FHWA\u2019s annual audits include evaluating the  attainment of performance measures contained in each MOU. Each of the  five MOUs contains four performance measures including: (1)  documenting compliance with NEPA and other federal laws and  regulations, (2) maintaining internal quality control and assurance  measures for NEPA decisions including legal reviews, (3) fostering  communication with other agencies and the general public, and (4)  documenting efficiency and timeliness in the NEPA process by comparing  the completion of NEPA documents and approvals before and after NEPA  assignment.", "According to FHWA officials, the agency interprets evaluating the  attainment of performance measures contained in the MOU as ensuring  that the state has a process in place to assess attainment.

Each  of the subsequent four NEPA assignment states we reviewed also  included timeliness performance measures in their respective MOUs.  However, the DOT Office of Inspector General reported in 2017 that  while FHWA is not statutorily required to measure performance  regarding the environmental review process for NEPA assignment  states, the lack of data collection and tracking inhibits FHWA\u2019s ability  to measure the effectiveness of NEPA assignment in accelerating  project delivery. The DOT Office of Inspector General recommended  that FHWA develop and implement an oversight mechanism to  periodically evaluate the performance of NEPA assignment states,  which has not yet been implemented.", "While FHWA does not, according to officials, have the authority to assess  states\u2019 measurement of timeliness performance, FHWA has a role and  the authority to provide guidance or technical assistance to states to help  find solutions to particular problems and to ensure complete and quality  information is provided to Congress, state DOTs, and the public to help  make informed policy choices.

However, the same report cited a number of limitations and  challenges with the underlying data, and as a result, the data may not  be accurate. FTA officials told us that its new internal grant  management system, TrAMS, also has the capability to track EIS  reviews and environment assessments, but they are in the early  stages of collecting this information. Given that data on the number of  NEPA reviews are either not available (EIS and environmental  assessments) or potentially unreliable (categorical exclusions), data  on the percentage of NEPA reviews are also not available. However,  FTA officials believe that similar to highway projects, the most  common type of NEPA reviews that transit agencies process are  categorical exclusions.", "Costs of NEPA Reviews: FTA and transit agencies do not track costs  of processing NEPA reviews for transit projects. According to FTA and  our previously issued work, separating out the costs for NEPA reviews  (versus \u201cplanning\u201d costs or \u201cpreliminary design\u201d costs) within the  project delivery process would be difficult to determine."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our work focused on federal-aid highway and transit projects and the  provisions included in the past three surface transportation  reauthorizations that are intended to accelerate the delivery of such  projects (i.e., project delivery provisions). In particular, this report: (1)  identifies the provisions aimed at accelerating the delivery of highway and  transit projects that were included in the last three surface transportation  reauthorizations; (2) examines the extent to which the provisions were  used by state departments of transportation (state DOT) and transit  agencies and the provisions\u2019 reported effects, if any, on accelerating the  delivery of projects; and (3) evaluates the extent to which DOT has  assigned National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) authority to  states and the reported effects. In addition, in appendix I, we identify  available information on the number and percentage of the different types  of NEPA reviews, and costs of conducting NEPA reviews.", "To identify all relevant project delivery provisions, we reviewed language  in the three most recent surface transportation reauthorizations and  included those provisions with the goal to accelerate the delivery of  federal-aid highway or transit projects. The three reauthorizations we  reviewed are as follows:  the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A  Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU)\u2014the seven project delivery  provisions we used were derived from provisions we had previously  identified from SAFETEA-LU, Title VI, on Transportation Planning and  Project Delivery;  the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21),  Division A, Title 1, Subtitle C, entitled Acceleration of Project Delivery  (Sections 1301 through 1323); and  the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), Division  A, Title 1, Subtitle C, entitled Acceleration of Project Delivery  (Sections 1301 through 1318).", "One provision (MAP-21 \u00a71318(a)-(c)) included statutory language  directing the Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop additional  project delivery provisions through rulemaking. Accordingly, we reviewed  the DOT regulations promulgated in response to that requirement (23  C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 771.117(c)(24)-(30), 771.118(c)(14)-(16), 771.118(d)(7)-(8) and  identified 12 additional project delivery provisions. We combined  provisions that were modified in later statutory language and did not  specify between different versions of the provisions, as this precision was  not necessary for our purposes. For example, the 150-Day Statute of  Limitations provision was created in SAFETEA-LU (section 6002) as a  180-day statute of limitations and amended in MAP-21 (section 1308) to  150 days, which is the version we used. We also grouped the provisions  into categories for ease of understanding; determined if provisions were  applicable to highway projects or transit projects, or both; and specified if  provisions were required or optional, based on professional judgement  and legal review. We define \u201crequired\u201d provisions to mean that federal  agencies or state or local transportation agencies that are subject to a  provision must adhere to the requirements and obligations in the  provision, if all the conditions for its use have been satisfied. We define  \u201coptional\u201d provisions to mean that the relevant entity (a federal agency or  state or local transportation agency) can choose to use the provision if  circumstances allow.", "We met with officials from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to confirm that we had a  complete list of project delivery provisions for highway and transit  projects.", "To determine states\u2019 awareness, use, and perceived effects of the project  delivery provisions on highway projects over the previous 5 years, we  surveyed state DOTs within all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and  Puerto Rico. We directed the survey to officials in state DOTs that  oversee environmental compliance for highway projects under NEPA.  Because these officials do not have responsibilities with respect to three  Advance Planning category\u2019s provisions that allow certain activities to  occur prior to the completion of a NEPA review, we excluded these  project delivery provisions from the survey. We also excluded two  provisions from the survey that are related to DOT assignment of federal  NEPA authority, because their use requires a written agreement between  FHWA and state DOTs, and we addressed those provisions separately  through interviews with states that have such written agreements in  place. Our survey response rate was 100 percent. In order to ensure that  respondents would interpret our questions as intended, prior to  administering the survey, we conducted pretests with state DOTs in four  states: Georgia, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. In each pretest, we  conducted a session with state DOT officials during which the officials  completed the survey and then provided feedback on the clarity of the  questions. Based on the feedback, we refined some questions and  restructured parts of the survey. After the four pretests were completed,  we provided a draft copy of the survey to FHWA and the American  Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for  their review and comment. Both provided technical comments that we  incorporated, as appropriate. Based on early interviews with highway  project stakeholders and our pretests, we determined that the survey  should be sent to environmental officials at the state DOTs. Additional  information about our survey methodology includes the following:", "To determine whom we should send the pretest and survey to (i.e.,  the survey respondent), we used a list of environmental officials at the  state DOTs compiled by AASHTO. We took steps, such as sending  early notification e-mails, to help ensure that the list of respondents  we created was accurate.", "We launched our survey on March 7, 2017. We sent e-mail reminders  and telephoned survey respondents who had not completed the  survey after two weeks, urging them to do so as soon as possible. We  reviewed survey responses for omissions and analyzed the  information provided. The survey and aggregated responses\u2014with  the exception of open-ended responses and information that would  identify individual state DOTs\u2014are provided in appendix IV.", "For each of the provisions included on the survey, we included  references to legal citations in order to minimize confusion among  provisions or versions of provisions.", "We provided space in the survey for respondents to provide optional  comments for each individual provision and for each category of  provisions. We analyzed these comments primarily for additional  context and as a source of illustrative examples.", "Because all state DOTs were included in our survey, our analyses are  not subject to sampling errors. However the practical difficulties of  conducting any survey may introduce non-sampling errors. For  example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted or the  sources of information available to respondents can introduce errors  into the survey results. We included steps both in the data collection  and data analysis stages, including pretesting, to minimize such non- sampling errors. We also sent a draft of the questionnaire to FHWA  and AASHTO for review and comment.", "We examined the survey results, reviewed survey responses during  follow-up interviews with selected states, and performed computer  analyses to identify inconsistencies and other indications of error and  addressed such issues, where necessary. A second, independent  analyst checked the accuracy of all computer analyses to minimize  the likelihood of errors in data processing.", "Based on the survey results, we conducted follow-up interviews with  officials from 10 state DOTs to discuss their views about the effects the  project delivery provisions had on the duration of highway projects in their  states in the past 5 years. We did not independently verify state DOT  officials\u2019 estimates of time savings. We selected state DOTs that reported  a range of use and effects of the provisions; we also selected  geographically diverse states. The 10 states we selected were Arizona,  California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas,  Virginia, and Wyoming. We also asked these state DOTs about their use  and experiences with the three Advance Planning category\u2019s provisions  we excluded from the survey. These interviews are not generalizable to  all states but provide additional context for responses.", "To determine transit agencies\u2019 awareness, use, and views about the  effects of the project delivery provisions applicable to transit, we selected  a non-generalizable sample of 11 transit agencies, provided a \u201cchecklist\u201d  of the provisions to the officials regarding their awareness and use of the  provisions, and interviewed officials at those agencies that oversee NEPA  reviews for transit projects. We selected these agencies based primarily  on the number of times they issued a notice of intent to prepare an EIS in  the Federal Register from 2005 through 2016 to identify those transit  agencies that may have experience preparing EISs or some another  NEPA review and experience using transit project delivery provisions.  While notices of intent to prepare an EIS do not always result in a transit  agency\u2019s conducting an actual EIS review, they indicate instances in  which a transit agency plans to conduct an EIS review. Other factors,  such as ridership and geographic location, were also considered to select  the 11 transit agencies. We identified contacts for the transit agencies by  calling the transit agencies\u2019 Planning and Environmental Review  departments and identifying individuals that had experience with  environmental reviews and project delivery provisions. We interviewed  officials at the following transit agencies:", "Capital Metro (Austin, Texas),", "Chicago Transit Authority,", "Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority,", "Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority,", "Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority,", "Sacramento Regional Transit District,", "San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority,", "San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency,", "Sound Transit (Seattle, Washington),", "Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and", "Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon.", "Similar to the survey we provided to state DOTs regarding highway  projects, we provided the transit agencies with a \u201cchecklist\u201d of the  provisions in which the transit agency officials indicated whether they had  heard of and used the provisions. To understand why the provisions may  not be used by selected transit agencies, we also examined the  frequency in which transit agencies filed a notice of intent to prepare an  EIS in the Federal Register. After discussions with FTA, we used the  number of times transit agencies filed a notice of intent to prepare an EIS  as a proxy because agencies that have performed multiple EISs, which  are typically complex in nature, are more likely to use the provisions and  be able to offer insight. Transit agencies may also have experience using  provisions related to categorical exclusions since transit agencies process  their NEPA reviews more commonly using categorical exclusions.  However, we did not examine the extent to which categorical exclusions  are used by transit agencies as a proxy to identify agencies that have  experience using the provisions in part because FTA\u2019s current database,  TrAMS, does not have comprehensive data on categorical exclusions.  We discussed transit agency officials\u2019 views about the effects of the  provisions during our interviews. These interviews are not generalizable  to all transit agencies but provide anecdotal information and context.", "To evaluate the extent that DOT has assigned NEPA authority to states  and the effects states have reported from assuming NEPA authority, we  identified states that have assumed NEPA authority based on information  from FHWA: Alaska, California, Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Utah. We did  not include Alaska in our review because that state did not assume NEPA  authority until November 2017. For the five states we reviewed, we  interviewed state DOT officials and reviewed relevant documentation  including memorandums of understanding and analyses the state DOTs  conducted on NEPA assignment authority, such as methodologies for  calculating NEPA assignment time savings. We also surveyed the state  DOTs that have not yet sought NEPA authority to assess their interest in  assuming NEPA authority. In addition, we interviewed FHWA officials  about procedures to oversee the performance of NEPA assignment  states and interviewed FHWA division officials from those states.
