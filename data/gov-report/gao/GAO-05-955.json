The participating judges funded approximately 75 percent of JSAS normal costs during plan year 2002, 64 percent during plan year 2003, and 78 percent during plan year 2004. On average over the 3-year period, the participating judges funded approximately 72 percent of JSAS normal costs, while the federal government funded approximately 28 percent. The variance in the government's contribution rates was a result of the fluctuation in normal costs resulting from several combined factors, such as changes in assumptions; lower-than-expected rates of return on plan assets; demographic changes--retirement, death, disability, new members, and pay increases; as well as an increase in plan benefit obligations. For the 3 years covered by the review, GAO determined that an adjustment to the judges' contribution rate was not needed because their average contribution share for the review period was approximately 72 percent, which exceeded the minimum 50 percent contribution goal specified by law. In addition, GAO examined the annual share of normal costs covered by judges' contributions over a 9-year period and found that on average the participating judges funded approximately 55 percent of JSAS's normal costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report was prepared in response to the requirements of the Federal  Courts Administration Act of 1992, which requires that we review certain  aspects of the Judicial Survivors\u2019 Annuities System (JSAS).

Appendix I provides additional information regarding retirement plans  that are available to federal judges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of JSAS", "paragraphs": ["JSAS was created in 1956 to help provide financial security for the families  of deceased federal judges. It provides benefits to surviving eligible  spouses and dependent children of judges who participate in the plan.  Judges may elect coverage within 6 months of taking office, 6 months after  getting married, or 6 months after being elevated to a higher court, or  during an open season authorized by statute. Active and senior judges  currently contribute 2.2 percent of their salaries to JSAS, and retired  judges contribute 3.5 percent of their retirement salaries to JSAS. Upon a  judge\u2019s death, the surviving spouse is to receive an annual annuity that  equals 1.5 percent of the judge\u2019s average annual salary during the 3 highest  consecutive paid years (commonly known as the high-3) times the judge\u2019s  years of creditable service. The annuity may not exceed 50 percent of the  high-3 and is guaranteed to be no less than 25 percent. Separately, an  unmarried dependent child under age 18, or 22 if a full-time student,  receives a survivor annuity that is equal to 10 percent of the judge\u2019s high-3  or 20 percent of the judges\u2019 high-3 divided by the number of eligible  children, whichever is smaller. JSAS annuitants receive an annual  adjustment in their annuities at the same time, and by the same  percentage, as any cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) received by CSRS  annuitants. Spouses and children are also eligible for Social Security  survivor benefits.", "Since its inception in 1956, JSAS has changed several times. Because of  concern that too few judges were participating in the plan (74 percent of  federal judges participated in 1985, which was down from 90 percent in  1976), Congress made broad reforms effective in 1986 with the Judicial  Improvements Act of 1985. The 1985 act (1) increased the annuity formula  for surviving spouses from 1.25 percent to the current 1.5 percent of the  high-3 for each year of creditable service and (2) changed the provisions  for surviving children\u2019s benefits to relate benefit amounts to judges\u2019 high-3  rather than the specific dollar amounts provided in 1976 by the Judicial  Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act. In recognition of the significant benefit  improvements that were made, the 1985 act increased the amounts that  judges were required to contribute from 4.5 percent to 5 percent of their  salaries, including retirement salaries.", "The 1985 act also changed the requirements for government contributions  to the plan. Under the 1976 Judicial Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act, the  government matched the judges\u2019 contributions of 4.5 percent of salaries  and retirement salaries. The 1985 act modified this by specifying that the  government would contribute the amounts necessary to fund any  remaining cost over the future lifetime of current participants. That  amount is limited to 9 percent of total covered salary each year. Despite  the benefit improvements in the 1985 act, the rate of participation in JSAS  continued to decline. In 1991, the rate of participation was about 40  percent overall and 25 percent for newly appointed judges.", "In response to concerns that required contributions of 5 percent may have  created a disincentive to participate, Congress enacted the Federal Courts  Administration Act of 1992. Under this act, participants\u2019 contribution  requirements were reduced to 2.2 percent of salaries for active and senior  judges and 3.5 percent of retirement salaries for retired judges. The 1992  act also significantly increased benefits for survivors of retired judges.  This increase was accomplished by including years spent in retirement in  the calculation of creditable service and the high-3 salary averages.  Additionally, the 1992 act allowed judges to stop contributing to the plan if  they ceased to be married and granted benefits to survivors of any judge  who died in the interim between leaving office and the commencement of  a deferred annuity.", "As of September 30, 2004, there were 1,329 active and senior judges, 207  retired judges, and 304 survivor annuitants covered under JSAS, compared  with 1,265 active and senior judges, 193 retired judges, and 283 survivor  annuitants as of September 30, 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining Cost for JSAS", "paragraphs": ["AOUSC is responsible for administering and maintaining reliable  information on JSAS.

Appendix II provides more details on the formulas used to determine  participants\u2019 and the federal government\u2019s contributions and lump sum  payments.", "The cost of a retirement or survivor benefit plan is typically not measured  by annual expenditures for benefits. Such expenditures are not an  indicator of the overall long-term cost of a plan. The more complete  calculation of a plan\u2019s cost is the present value of projected future outlays  to retirees or survivors, based on the current pool of participants, with  such costs allocated annually. This annual cost allocation is referred to as  the normal cost. Normal cost calculations, prepared by an actuary, are  estimates and require that many actuarial assumptions be made about the  future, including mortality rates, turnover rates, returns on investment,  salary increases, and COLA increases over the life spans of current  participants and beneficiaries. The plan\u2019s actuary, using the plan\u2019s funding  method\u2014in this case, the aggregate cost method\u2014determines the plan\u2019s  normal cost.

To  satisfy our objectives, we examined the normal costs reported in the JSAS  annual report submitted by AOUSC to the Comptroller General for plan  years 2002 through 2004. We also examined participants\u2019 contributions,  the federal government\u2019s contribution, and other relevant information in  each annual report. An independent accounting firm hired by AOUSC  audited the JSAS financial and actuarial information included in the JSAS  annual reports, with input from an enrolled actuary regarding relevant  data, such as actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. An  enrolled actuary certified those amounts that are included in the JSAS  annual reports. We discussed the contents of the JSAS reports with  officials from AOUSC for the 3 plan years (2002 through 2004).

For example, the judges\u2019  contribution rate of 2.39 percent and the federal government\u2019s  contribution rate of 0.80 percent in plan year 2002 were based on the  September 30, 2001, valuation contained in the plan year 2002 JSAS report.", "The judges\u2019 contribution of JSAS normal costs shown in table 1 fluctuated  from approximately 75 percent in plan year 2002, to approximately 64  percent in plan year 2003, and to 78 percent in plan year 2004. The federal  government\u2019s contribution of JSAS normal costs also varied, from  approximately 25 percent in plan year 2002, to approximately 36 percent in  plan year 2003, and to approximately 22 percent in plan year 2004. During  those same years, judges\u2019 contribution rates remained almost constant,  while the federal government\u2019s contribution rate increased from 0.80  percent of salaries in plan year 2002 to 1.34 percent of salaries in plan year  2003, and then decreased to 0.65 percent in plan year 2004. The variance in  the federal government\u2019s contribution rates was a result of the fluctuation  in normal costs resulting from several combined factors, such as changes  in assumptions; lower-than-expected return on plan assets; demographic  changes\u2014retirement, death, disability, new members, and pay increases;  as well as an increase in plan benefit obligations.", "Specifically, the value of total plan assets increased from $473.8 million in  plan year 2002 to $484.0 million in plan year 2003, and then decreased to  $479.8 million in plan year 2004. However, accumulated plan benefit  obligations increased steadily, from $385.4 million in plan year 2002, to  $388.5 million in plan year 2003, and to $393.9 million in plan year 2004.  Although the judges\u2019 contribution rate remained fairly constant, their  contribution of normal costs rose to approximately 78 percent in plan year  2004 because total normal costs decreased. During 2004 plan year,  contributions from the federal government and judges totaled almost   $5.1 million, somewhat less than the actuarial cost of $6.9 million. A  primary reason for the difference between total contributions and the  plan\u2019s actuarial cost was that the approximately 1.3 percent return on the  market value of plan assets was lower than the 6.25 percent assumed rate  of investment return on plan assets. The resulting actuarial loss increased  the required contribution level for the plan by 0.82 percent of total payroll  for participating judges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adjustment to Contribution Rates Not Needed", "paragraphs": ["Based on information in JSAS actuarial reports for the 3 years under  review, we have determined that participating judges\u2019 future contributions  do not have to increase in order to cover the minimum 50 percent of JSAS  costs required by the Federal Courts Administration Act.

As shown in table 1,  the judges\u2019 average contribution for JSAS costs for this review period was  approximately 72 percent, which exceeded the 50 percent contribution  goal for judges.", "Because future normal costs are estimates that may change in any given  year, adjusting judges\u2019 contribution rates whenever they are found to be  generating more or less than 50 percent of JSAS costs is not practical.  Future normal costs may change because of certain events that occur  during the course of a year, such as the number of survivors or judges who  die, the number of new judges electing to participate in JSAS, and the  number of judges who retire, and because the values of, and rates of  return on, plan assets could create normal statistical variances that would  affect the annual normal costs of the plan. Because the plan has only 1,536  participants and 304 survivor annuitants, such variances can have a  significant effect on expected normal costs and lead to short-term  variability. Therefore, it is important to take a long-term view when  evaluating whether contribution rates for judges are appropriate to  achieve a 50 percent JSAS contribution share for judges.", "For example, as shown in table 2, although the judges\u2019 contribution share  for plan year 2004 was approximately 78 percent, the judges\u2019 average  contribution share for plan years 1996 through 2004 was approximately 55  percent\u2014significantly closer to the 50 percent contribution goal.", "Another drawback to making frequent changes to the judges\u2019 contribution  rate in response to short-term fluctuations in their contribution share  could be a decline in JSAS participation.

Specifically, AOUSC stated that we did not present in our report the  adjustment that would be needed to the participating judges\u2019 contribution  rates to achieve the 50 percent funding of the program\u2019s costs by the  judges. In AOUSC\u2019s view, this omission is not consistent with Congress\u2019s  intent in enacting the Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992.", "We disagree with AOUSC\u2019s view as to the purpose of section 201(i) of the  act. Since enactment, we have interpreted this section as providing a  minimum percentage of the costs of the program to be borne by its  participants because the statute requires us to recommend adjustments  when the judges\u2019 contributions have not achieved 50 percent of the costs  of the fund. We do not view the section as calling for parity between the  participants and the federal government with respect to funding the  program. Thus, for the 3 years covered by this review, we determined and  reported that judges\u2019 contributions funded approximately 72 percent of  normal costs of JSAS, and therefore, an adjustment to the judges\u2019  contribution rates was not needed under the existing legislation because  the judges\u2019 contributions achieved 50 percent of JSAS costs. We have  consistently applied this interpretation of the act\u2019s requirement in all of  our previous mandated reviews.", "However, if one were to interpret the act as calling for an equal sharing of  the program\u2019s costs between participants and the government, then, on the  basis of the information contained in the JSAS actuarial report as of  September 30, 2004, participating judges\u2019 future contributions would have  had to decrease a total of 0.86 percentage points below the current 2.2  percent of salaries for active judges and senior judges and 3.5 percent of  retirement salaries for retired judges in order to fund 50 percent of JSAS  costs over the past 3 years. If the decrease were distributed equally among  the judges, those currently contributing 2.2 percent of salaries would have  had to contribute 1.34 percent, and those currently contributing 3.5  percent of retirement salaries would have had to contribute 2.64 percent.", "As we have noted both in this report and prior reports, because of the  yearly fluctuations that are experienced by JSAS, short-term trends are not  sufficient for use in making informed decisions. As we stated in our report,  future normal costs may change because of certain events that occur  during the course of a year, such as the number of survivors or judges who  die, the number of new judges electing to participate in JSAS, and the  number of judges who retire. Also, the values of, and rates of return on,  plan assets could create normal statistical variances that would affect the  annual normal costs of the plan.
