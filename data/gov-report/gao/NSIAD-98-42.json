Although nearly all of these objects are thought to be smaller than 1 centimeter, about 110,000 are estimated to be between  1 and 10 centimeters, and about 8,000 are larger than 10 centimeters. Only the approximate 8,000 objects are large enough, or reflect radar energy or light well enough, to be routinely observed by the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) existing space surveillance sensors.

The Naval Space Surveillance System (known as the Fence) is a chain of radar equipment extending from California to Georgia that was constructed to detect foreign reconnaissance satellites and provide warning to Navy ships of such satellite overflights. The system is still operational, and the Navy plans to modernize it beginning in 2003 to improve its maintainability. Also, Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radars were constructed in Alaska, Greenland, and England to detect and track intercontinental ballistic missiles that could be launched at North America. A secondary mission for these missile warning radars has always been space surveillance.

In contrast, in recent years, individual space shuttle missions have averaged about 7 per year and 11 days per mission. In future years, NASA is planning about eight shuttle missions per year. The Council concludes that the space station will face a significant risk of being struck by potentially damaging meteoroids or orbital debris.", "The space station is to operate at low-earth altitudes\u2014between 330 to  500 kilometers. According to the National Science and Technology Council, debris orbiting at altitudes up to about 900 kilometers lose energy over time through friction with the atmosphere and fall to lower altitudes, eventually either disintegrating in the atmosphere or falling to the earth. New debris is periodically added, sometimes unexpectedly. For example, in June 1996, a Pegasus rocket broke up at an altitude of about  625 kilometers, creating 668 observable objects. Also, it is likely that an unknown number of other objects were created, but they are not observable because of their small size.

Regarding space surveillance, the team concluded that next-generation ground-based radars and potential space-based systems should be able to provide reliable near-earth tracking of space objects that are 5 to 10 centimeters in size.

The National Research Council report stated that the risk of the space station colliding with untracked debris could be lowered if more objects were tracked.

The study also observed that the timing is right to evaluate the presumed inherent space surveillance capabilities of SBIRS-Low to determine if those capabilities could actually be provided. Although GBR and THAAD were not specifically addressed in the study, it indicated that a system with similar generic capability would be stressed to achieve NASA\u2019s 1 centimeter requirement. Finally, the study suggested that several technology efforts be continued to provide a hedge against an uncertain set of future space control threats and priorities.", "A significant point in the Space Architect\u2019s study was that NASA\u2019s  1 centimeter requirement would be both technically challenging and expensive. In its comments on our draft report, DOD stated that the requirement is not considered feasible within current budget constraints. Until the Joint Space Management Board provides directions regarding the study\u2019s results, implementation plans will not be prepared. Even then, the plans may not sufficiently address NASA\u2019s needs without agreement between DOD and NASA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NASA relies on DOD for space surveillance support, and both agencies need improved surveillance capabilities. However, four DOD systems that could provide such capabilities\u2014the Naval Space Surveillance System, SBIRS-Low, GBR, and THAAD\u2014lack sufficient coordination, both within DOD and between DOD and NASA. The three missile defense sensors (SBIRS-Low, GBR, and THAAD) could provide a collateral space surveillance capability, a concept DOD has successfully used over the years. In times of constrained budgets, capitalizing on ways to satisfy multiple missions with the same resources appears to be prudent.", "A coordinated plan between DOD and NASA that considers all existing and planned capabilities could be beneficial in making cost-effective decisions to satisfy a consolidated set of emerging national security and civil space surveillance requirements. Without a coordinated plan, DOD and NASA would not be taking advantage of potential efficiencies. The DOD Space Architect, along with NASA and the intelligence space sector, could provide a means for developing such a plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of NASA, in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, develop a coordinated governmentwide space surveillance plan that (1) sets forth and evaluates all feasible alternative capabilities to support human space flight and emerging national security requirements and (2) ensures that any planned funding for space surveillance upgrades is directed toward satisfying consolidated governmentwide requirements."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
