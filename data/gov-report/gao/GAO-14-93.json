The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated GAO to review the services' ROTC programs. This report assesses the extent that ROTC programs (1) met goals and minimum annual requirements for producing officers over a 5-year period, (2) have established performance measures and conducted evaluations for managing ROTC programs, and (3) are subject to oversight and have effective processes for communicating with key stakeholders.

Further, GAO's analysis found that half of the Department of Defense's (DOD) ROTC units did not meet DOD's minimum average annual production requirement over the 5-year period reviewed. Further, cost per commissioned officer varies greatly depending on unit production. For example, excluding tuition costs, the average cost per officer produced across all units was about $68,000, compared to an average cost of about $95,000 per officer for units that produced fewer than 15 officers on average annually from fiscal years 2008 through 2012.", "DOD's instruction specifies factors to consider before closing ROTC units, but these factors do not constitute clearly defined performance measures that provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and efficiency of ROTC programs, and service evaluations of ROTC programs are ad hoc. DOD's instruction specifies that in assessing units for closure, the services are to consider the quality of officers produced by a unit but it does not clearly define characteristics that comprise quality, which has led to the inconsistent application of the measure by the services. The services conducted 11 evaluations over the past decade to assess performance and identify units for consolidation or closure. However, the evaluations have largely occurred on an ad hoc basis because the services have not established a systematic process to routinely evaluate ROTC program performance. Key attributes of successful performance measures include clearly, defined measures. Moreover, results-oriented program management practices include routine program evaluations that determine how well a program is working. Without clearly defined performance measures and routinely conducted evaluations, it will be difficult for the services to accurately determine if ROTC programs are effectively and efficiently operating.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) conducts some oversight functions, such as setting policy for the ROTC program. However, although specified in guidance, OSD does not review the services' methodologies for closing ROTC units because OSD officials believe this is a service responsibility. Further, the services do not consistently communicate with key stakeholders, such as members of Congress and schools, about performance of ROTC programs, except when closure decisions are being considered. This may have contributed to the difficulty the services have experienced in gaining political support for such closures. GAO has noted that regular communication with stakeholders helps build trusting relationships to gain buy-in. Without clearly delineated responsibilities for oversight of ROTC programs and a formal strategy to communicate with key stakeholders on ROTC program performance, DOD will find it difficult to obtain the support that is needed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ROTC programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to DOD, to include establishing clearly defined performance measures and conducting routine program evaluations; reexamining oversight roles and responsibilities; and developing a strategy for communicating with Congress and other key stakeholders on program performance.

In particular, ROTC\u2019s  geographically diverse presence is credited with helping to preserve the  citizen-soldier tradition of producing officers that reflect the communities  they serve, and provides the possibility of a military career to students  who otherwise would not have considered it to be an option.

Further, in 1992, we issued a report  on officer commissioning programs including ROTC, in which we found  that the services were not systematically assessing these programs or the  quality of officers they produced and that the lack of coordinated  management and oversight hampered efforts to make officer production  cost-effective. Most recently, in 2007, we recommended that the Army  develop and implement a dedicated strategic plan to address current and  projected officer accession and retention shortfalls. The Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military services concurred or  partially concurred with our prior recommendations related to closures of  underproductive units and the need to develop a comprehensive strategy  that helps to ensure ROTC resources are used in the most efficient  manner possible.

We also compared the average annual production of individual units to DOD\u2019s minimum production requirement  for unit viability during the same time period. We obtained data on  program and unit level costs and analyzed these data by comparing the  cost of an ROTC unit to its actual officer production, and comparing the  general cost of establishing and maintaining different types of ROTC  units. We assessed the reliability of these data by conducting electronic  testing of these data and discussing any data limitations with appropriate  service officials.

The program was established by the  National Defense Act of 1916 to supplement the military academies in  preparing selected students for commissioned military service and to  provide officers for the reserve forces. The services organize their ROTC  programs into administrative units and assign a command structure,  including a commanding officer, to each unit. In addition to a commanding  officer, each ROTC unit has additional staff assigned to the unit, including  enlisted and officer personnel, and for Army and Navy, civilian personnel.

To meet the  requirements set by service headquarters, the military services typically  operate ROTC programs using a 5-year production cycle, beginning the  year prior to school entry and culminating in the graduation year. ROTC\u2019s  relevance extends beyond its quantitative production capability. ROTC  supports the concept of a citizen-soldier and the all-volunteer force with  its potential to provide officers from a variety of backgrounds and  experiences available within the student population on a college or  university campus.

Key  attributes of successful performance measures include clearly defined,  comprehensive measures that enable an organization to evaluate  accomplishments, make decisions, and balance competing priorities.", "DOD\u2019s instruction specifies five factors for the military services to  consider before closing a unit, including, the (1) quality of the officers  produced by the unit, (2) operations and maintenance cost of maintaining  the unit, (3) numbers of officers produced to meet service commissioning  goals from categories that are difficult to achieve, (4) number of officers  produced by the unit, and (5) number and location of units in an area or  state where the unit being considered for closure resides. However,  several of these factors, which officials told us are the measures they  currently use to assess the programs, are not clearly defined. Specifically,  DOD\u2019s instruction directs the services to consider the quality of officers  produced by a unit that is being evaluated for closure. However, the  instruction does not include guidance on how the services should define  and assess quality, which could lead to the inconsistent application of the  measure by the services. Another example is that DOD\u2019s instruction  directs the services to consider the geographic representation of ROTC  units. However, the instruction does not describe how concentrated the  ROTC presence in an area or state should be, which could lead the  services to under- or over-emphasize the relative importance of an ROTC  unit to a particular area.", "Furthermore, DOD\u2019s instruction requires officer production from each unit  to be adequate to justify DOD investment and generally requires ROTC  units to produce a 5-year average of 15 officers annually to remain  viable. However, DOD\u2019s production requirement does not take into  account a service\u2019s investment in a particular ROTC unit because it does  not account for cost-related factors, such as the differences in the cost of  tuition for public and private colleges or for in-state and out-of-state  students. Moreover, the tuition cost difference is not insignificant, with  college tuition for some schools costing six times more than the annual  average in-state tuition of about $7,100 for a 4-year college or  university. Despite the significant variance in tuition, all ROTC units are  subject to the same numerical production requirement regardless of the  actual cost each service incurs at a particular college or university.  Because such cost data are not consistently accounted for, it is not clear  how the production requirement can be used to justify DOD\u2019s investment.", "The absence of clearly defined measures also affects the objectivity of  DOD\u2019s unit closure consideration factors because it requires the services  to subjectively determine how each factor should be defined and applied.  Further, these determinations can change over time without explanation.  For example, we reviewed the methodologies used by each service to  identify units for potential closure and found that, in addition to the five  factors to consider before closing a unit, two of the services incorporated  additional factors into the closure consideration process. For example, in  fiscal year 2012, the Navy included the U.S. News and World Report  ranking of the schools associated with the units as 1 of 12 factors in its  closure considerations, and the Air Force included \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d  as an important consideration. However, neither service identified  specifically how these factors correlate to the factors in DOD\u2019s instruction,  defined how these factors contribute to a service-specific need, or  explained why these factors were added to the 2012 analysis. In  comments on a draft of this report, Navy officials pointed out that the U.S.  News and World report ranking correlates to the quality of applicants to  the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program, a specific Navy officer accession  requirement. However it is not clear specifically how the Navy made that  correlation, nor why the Navy added this ranking for its 2012 review. We  recognize that the services need some flexibility to prioritize factors on the  basis of their individual needs for newly commissioned officers, but  inconsistent measurements limit the services\u2019 ability to compare program  progress, results, and efficiency over time.", "We reviewed service policies for ROTC programs and likewise found no  additional guidance on how to define or apply the closure consideration  factors in DOD\u2019s instruction.  Although the Army regulation specifies a  process for categorizing potential closures, Army officials told us that the  disestablishment categories specified in the regulation have not been  used for years because, according to officials, the process was too time  consuming. The variability of the factors used in considering ROTC  units for closure hinders the services\u2019 efforts to compare evaluation  results over time, even within a single service. Until clearly defined and  comprehensive performance measures are established to evaluate  overall program performance, the services will have limited information  available about their ROTC programs\u2019 overall progress toward their goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ad Hoc Evaluations to Determine Potential Unit Closures Do Not Provide Needed Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of fully developed performance measures, the military  services have evaluated aspects of their respective ROTC programs.

Our prior work  has shown that results-oriented program management practices include  routine program evaluations, which are a key source of information about  how well a program is working and whether it is achieving its intended  results. Further, these practices indicate that a body of evidence is more  valuable to decision makers than a single study; multiple studies with  similar results strengthen confidence in their conclusions.", "The military services\u2019 ROTC programs have, over the past decade,  conducted a total of 11 evaluations\u2014largely driven by the need to  produce cost-savings to help offset DOD\u2019s near-term budget shortfalls\u2014 to identify ROTC units that could potentially be consolidated or closed.  These evaluations have provided the services with some useful  information on the performance of ROTC programs, but they have largely  occurred on an ad hoc basis because the services have not established a  systematic process to routinely evaluate ROTC program performance  using comprehensive performance measures. For example, service  officials told us that the Army conducted 3 evaluations over 6 years; the  Navy conducted 4 evaluations over 3 years; and the Air Force conducted  4 evaluations over 8 years on production of officers by individual ROTC  units. These evaluations provided information about individual ROTC unit  performance, with a focus on officer production. However, the evaluations  did not assess the overall ROTC program against strategic goals and  objectives. Our prior work has shown that leading organizations that have  progressed toward results-oriented management use performance  information to identify gaps in performance, to improve organizational  processes, and to improve their performance by aligning measures with  the goals and objectives at each level of the organization.  Further, the commitment of managers to results-oriented management is critical to the  increased use of performance information that could be measured against  ROTC program goals and objectives to influence policy and program  decisions. In addition, this commitment could be demonstrated by their  willingness and ability to make decisions and manage programs on the  basis of results, and to inspire others to embrace such a model. Without  routine evaluations that measure progress toward strategic goals and  objectives, decision makers cannot determine the cost-effectiveness or  efficiency of ROTC programs over time and cannot reliably identify trends  in program performance.", "Furthermore, without DOD guidance for comprehensive evaluations of  ROTC programs, each service\u2019s program managers developed a  service\u2019s own methodology to evaluate the productivity of ROTC units.  Each service\u2019s methodology varies based on their chosen combination of  factors from DOD\u2019s instruction, and how they are prioritized. As we  previously noted, DOD Instruction 1215.08 requires the military services  to consider the operation and maintenance cost of maintaining ROTC  units that are being evaluated for productivity and possibly considered for  closure. However, we reviewed the methodologies used by each service  to evaluate unit productivity and found that the operations and  maintenance costs of ROTC units were not routinely considered in their  evaluations. Specifically, in recent evaluations of unit productivity, the  Army and the Air Force did not consider any ROTC costs, and the Navy  considered only the cost of tuition. As a result, the services may be using  results of incomplete evaluations to draw conclusions about unit  performance.

Although DOD guidance specifies service  Secretary responsibilities for and the authority to close ROTC units,  service officials told us that recommended closures and consolidations  have not been acted on because some senior service officials have  concluded that it is easier to maintain underproductive ROTC units than  attempt to secure the congressional support needed for their closure.  Importantly, DOD\u2019s instruction gives service Secretaries discretion on  which units to close.

However, the military services do not  consistently adhere to this requirement, and thus may be missing  important opportunities to build awareness about the ROTC program and  to leverage the support of schools in meeting annual production goals.  For example, Army and Navy officials told us that they currently do not  regularly communicate with school administrators about the level of  officer production at their respective college or university.  In contrast, Air  Force officials told us that they provide written notification annually to  participating colleges and universities on their level of officer production.  Until the military services establish a formal strategy to communicate with  key stakeholders on ROTC program performance, the military services  will find it difficult to obtain the support that is needed to make the  necessary changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ROTC  programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While ROTC programs continue to be the largest and most important  source of newly commissioned officers for DOD, they do so with a  structure where half of the units do not meet DOD\u2019s production  requirements. Further, service efforts to revise this inefficient structure are  hampered by performance measures that are not clearly defined, allow  for inconsistent application of factors for closure, and do not provide a  comprehensive understanding of programs\u2019 efficiency or cost- effectiveness. Moreover, the department\u2019s management approach has  not required routine program evaluations and this has led to ad hoc  analyses that present challenges in supporting unit closure  recommendations. Clearly defined and comprehensive performance  measures and routine evaluations using these measures against strategic  goals and objectives would give OSD and the services tools to identify,  collect, and evaluate a range of relevant performance information for their  ROTC programs. This information, particularly when available over a  period of time, would allow OSD and the services to recognize the  programs\u2019 accomplishments, balance competing priorities, and address  the retention or disestablishment of underproductive units.", "Effective oversight and regular communication with stakeholders are  critical to the program\u2019s effectiveness and continued success. Clear lines  of responsibility when combined with performance measures provide  leadership and decision makers with the transparency and authority  required to make difficult decisions about the program.

DOD also provided technical comments on  the draft report, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "Regarding our first recommendation to establish performance measures  that are clearly defined and include cost components, DOD concurred  with our recommendation but stated that our report contained a \u201cminor  discrepancy\u201d because it did not include the Navy\u2019s explanation of how a  particular unit closure consideration factor\u2014outside of those specified in  DOD Directive 1215.08\u2014contributed to a service-specific need.  Specifically, our draft report noted that, in fiscal year 2012, the Navy  included the U.S. News and World Report ranking of the schools affiliated  with a Naval ROTC unit as one of twelve factors included in its unit  closure consideration process, but that it did not define how its use of this  factor correlated to its need for a specific type of officer. We updated the  draft to include the Navy\u2019s comment that U.S. News and World Report  ranking correlates to the quality of applicants to the Navy Nuclear  Propulsion Program, a specific Navy officer accession requirement. We  also clarified that because the services are required to subjectively  determine how factors should be applied, these factors can change over  time without justification. We therefore continue to believe that these  inconsistent measurements limit the services\u2019 ability to compare program  progress, results and efficiencies over time.", "For our other five recommendations, DOD concurred with each of them  and estimated actions would be completed by July 2015. We encourage  DOD to begin taking actions now to facilitate implementation of these  recommendations as soon as possible.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the  Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, and appropriate  congressional committees.

We chose to assess the officer production from  each service\u2019s ROTC program for fiscal years 2008 through 2012  because it is the most recently completed 5-year period at the time of our  review. We determined the overall productivity of the services\u2019 ROTC  programs by comparing the number of ROTC officers produced to the  ROTC officer goals as outlined in service-specific guidance for fiscal  years 2008 through 2012. Using fiscal year 2012 data found in fiscal year  2014 budget documents and other service documents, we compared  overall officer production with other major commissioning sources. We  determined the productivity of ROTC units by comparing the average  annual production of individual units from fiscal year 2008 through 2012  to the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) minimum production requirement  in the DOD Instruction for Senior ROTC (DOD Instruction 1215.08)\u2014a  minimum of 15 officers a year averaged over 5 years for 4-year schools  and a minimum of 7 officers a year averaged over 5 years for 2-year  schools. We also analyzed the data provided to determine the degree to  which the units are not meeting minimum production requirements and  the degree to which the units met minimum production requirements. In  particular, we analyzed ROTC officer production data from fiscal years  2008 through 2012 to determine (1) the number and percentage of ROTC  units that met and did not meet the DOD minimum production  requirement for ROTC officer production and (2) the number and  percentage of ROTC units that produced officers in specific ranges of  officer production (e.g., fewer than 5, 5 to fewer than 10, 10 to fewer than  15, 15 to fewer than 20, 20 to fewer than 30, etc. to over 50). We also  reviewed fiscal year 2012 staff data of military personnel located at each  unit provided to us by the military services and DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012  composite rates to determine the cost of military personnel per each  ROTC unit in fiscal year 2012. In addition, we reviewed the fiscal year  2014 budget documentation to identify the average operation and  maintenance cost (excluding scholarships) per ROTC unit in fiscal year  2012. We used these data to determine the fiscal year 2012 cost of  ROTC units that met and did not meet DOD minimum production  requirements for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 .To assess the reliability  of the production and cost data, we discussed these data with officials  from the military services to gain an understanding of the processes and  databases used to collect and record data and to understand existing  data quality control procedures and known limitations of the data. When  we found inconsistencies in the data, we followed up with service officials  to attempt to reconcile these differences. We determined that these data  were sufficiently reliable for determining the extent to which the military  services are meeting ROTC production goals and unit level requirements  as well as the cost per unit.", "To assess the extent to which the services have established performance  measures and evaluations for determining the structure of ROTC  programs, we reviewed relevant legislation, specifically sections 2101- 2111b of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, and department and service guidance  for ROTC programs, to identify what, if any, guidelines for cost-effective  program management are identified. In addition, we reviewed prior GAO  reports on ROTC and officer accessions programs to determine what  recommendations and actions have previously been taken in regard to  improving the efficiency and effectiveness of ROTC programs. We also  obtained and analyzed information from each of the services to determine  the frequency with which the services evaluated unit productivity to  identify units for potential consolidation or closure. Further, we identified  the measures used by each service to conduct these evaluations and  compared them with key attributes of effective performance measures  that our prior work has shown are needed to successfully evaluate  program performance. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military services  who are responsible for officer accessions and service-specific ROTC  programs. We discussed with these officials the extent to which the  services were meeting ROTC requirements for producing newly  commissioned officers, ROTC guidance and policies, roles and  responsibilities, program performance and costs, procedures for the  establishment and disestablishment of ROTC units, assessments of  ROTC unit productivity, and program oversight.", "To assess the extent to which the military services\u2019 ROTC programs are  subject to oversight and have effective processes for communicating with  key stakeholders, we reviewed and analyzed relevant OSD and military  service guidance to identify guidelines and responsibilities for conducting  oversight of ROTC programs and communicating with key stakeholders  about ROTC program performance. We obtained and analyzed  documentation on military service correspondence with schools about  ROTC program performance and compared them with provisions in DOD  Instruction 1215.08 pertaining to communication with schools.
