Officials in these locations largely attributed these declines to greater use of mediation and resolution meetings\u2014methods that IDEA requires states to implement. Despite the declines, officials in these locations said that higher rates of hearings persisted because of disputes over private school placements or special education services. GAO did not find noteworthy trends in the use of other IDEA dispute resolution methods, including state complaints, mediation, and resolution meetings. States and territories reported on GAO's survey that they used mediation, resolution meetings, and other methods they voluntarily implemented to facilitate early resolution of disputes and to avoid potentially adversarial due process hearings.", "States, territories, and other stakeholders generally reported on GAO's survey or in interviews that alternative methods are important to resolving disputes earlier. Some stakeholders cited the potential of these methods to improve communication and trust between parents and educators. Some state officials said that a lack of public awareness about the methods they have voluntarily implemented was a challenge to expanding their use, but they were addressing this with various kinds of outreach, such as disseminating information through parent organizations.", "The Department of Education (Education) uses several measures to assess states' performance on dispute resolution but lacks complete information on timeliness and comparable data on parental involvement. Education requires all states to report the number of due process hearing decisions that were made within 45 days or were extended; however, it does not direct states to report the total amount of time that extensions add to due process hearing decisions. Similarly, Education collects data from states on parental involvement\u2014a key to dispute prevention\u2014but does not require consistent collection and reporting, so the data are not comparable nationwide. Leading performance measurement practices state that successful performance measures should be clearly stated and provide unambiguous information.

First enacted in 1975 as the  Education for All Handicapped Children Act, IDEA was last reauthorized  in 2004. Its purposes include ensuring that a free appropriate public  education is available to children with disabilities, protecting their and  their parents\u2019 rights under the Act, and assisting states and local  educational agencies (LEA) in financing their education. To accomplish  these purposes, the Act requires that states accepting IDEA funds ensure  that schools develop, with input from parents, an individualized education  program (IEP) for each eligible child and implement certain procedural  safeguards, including the opportunity to present a complaint with respect  to matters related to the identification, evaluation, or educational  placement of children with disabilities or the provision of a free  appropriate public education to the child. IDEA and its implementing  regulations provide formal methods\u2014due process complaint and hearing  procedures and state complaint procedures\u2014for resolving disputes  between parents and school districts, which represent important  protections for families under IDEA. However, federal policymakers have  recognized the often adversarial and costly nature of escalated disputes  between parents and school districts\u2014especially those that involve due  process hearings. Similarly, Education has observed that due process  hearings generally are expensive for all parties, time-consuming, and are  universally understood to be a marker of serious unresolved differences  about a student\u2019s need for special education and related services or the  nature or location of services. Reauthorizations of IDEA have included  provisions to promote early and less costly methods of dispute resolution.  In 1997, IDEA was amended to require states to offer parties to a dispute  the opportunity to voluntarily use mediation, whenever a due process  complaint was filed. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA required states to  expand the availability of mediation, allowing parents and districts to use  it at any point; that is, before or after filing a due process or state  complaint. It also required parties to attend a resolution meeting within 15  days of when a parent files a due process complaint to encourage them  to resolve disputes prior to due process hearings, unless both parties  agree to waive the meeting or use IDEA\u2019s mediation process. Resolution  meetings and mediation are regarded by Education as alternative dispute  resolution methods.", "In preparation for the next reauthorization of IDEA, you asked us to  examine the use of dispute resolution methods, including mediation and  resolution meetings, since the 2004 reauthorization. This report examines  the following questions:  1.  What are the recent trends in methods used to resolve IDEA disputes  between parents and school districts?  2.  What are the views of stakeholders regarding the value of alternative  methods for resolving disputes?  3.  How do Education\u2019s performance measures related to dispute  resolution compare to leading practices in performance  measurement?", "To describe the recent trends in methods used to resolve IDEA disputes,  we analyzed data collected by Education and compiled by the National  Center on Dispute Resolution in Special Education operated by the  Consortium for Appropriate Dispute Resolution in Special Education  (CADRE) for all states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories from  school year 2004-05 through 2011-12\u2014the most recent data available at  the time we did our work. We reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations, as well as Education\u2019s policies, procedures and guidance to  gain an understanding of requirements related to dispute resolution. We  assessed the reliability of dispute resolution data by (1) performing  electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3)  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We supplemented trend data with information on dispute  resolution that we collected in a web-based, self-administered survey of  special education directors (or other officials performing that role) in all  states and U.S. territories (60 entities in total).the questionnaire in consultation with subject matter specialists, special  education stakeholders, and state special education directors, which we  selected for their knowledge of special education dispute resolution. For  example, we consulted two organizations that collaborated on a prior  survey of state directors of special education on dispute resolution.  Survey data collection took place from late 2013 through January 2014  and we obtained a 100 percent response rate.", "We designed and tested  To describe the views of stakeholders regarding the value of alternative  methods for resolving disputes, we collected responses in a survey of  state and territory special education directors and conducted other  activities. We asked survey questions about the perceived importance of  alternative methods for resolving disputes as well as challenges faced  and assistance received in implementing these methods. In addition to  states\u2019 views on alternative dispute resolution, we also collected  information from national organizations and subject matter specialists in  special education, including organizations representing states, school  districts, parents, and students, which we selected based on their  knowledge of special education dispute resolution. To obtain the  perspective of parents of children with disabilities, we gathered the  perspectives of organizations representing the views and rights of these  parents. We also held discussion groups with 14 parents identified by the  state educational agency (SEA) and Parent Information and Training  Centers in one state regarding their recent experiences in using  alternative methods for resolving disputes. The views of these parents  are not generalizable but still provide valuable information to illustrate the  range of parent views on alternative methods to resolving disputes in  special education. Additionally, we conducted a search of related  literature and reviewed prior GAO work on this topic.", "To evaluate how Education assesses states\u2019 performance in IDEA  dispute resolution, we reviewed Education\u2019s state performance measures  related to dispute resolution and compared them to nine attributes of  successful performance measures previously identified by GAO, such as   In assessing  whether performance measures are designed to be clear.Education\u2019s measures against these attributes, we analyzed Education  dispute resolution performance data and spoke with Education officials  about performance measures and monitoring of dispute resolution.

For example, a parent might file a due process complaint  over whether a school district is using the appropriate instructional  methods for a child. After filing a complaint but prior to holding a hearing,  IDEA requires parties to a dispute to attend a resolution meeting where  parents discuss their complaint and the facts that form the basis of the  complaint and the LEA is given the opportunity to resolve the complaint,  unless the parent and the LEA agree in writing to waive the meeting or  use IDEA\u2019s mediation process. The purpose of the resolution meeting is  to achieve a prompt and early resolution of a parent\u2019s due process  complaint to avoid a more costly and adversarial due process hearing and  the potential for civil litigation. If the parties reach an agreement at the  resolution meeting, then a due process hearing is not necessary. If the  parties do not reach an agreement or choose to waive this meeting, a due  process hearing is held. A due process hearing is an administrative  proceeding in which an impartial hearing officer receives evidence,  provides for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses by each  party, and then issues a report of findings of fact and a decision.

That is, over two-thirds (69 percent) of  mediations resulted in agreements while less than a quarter (22 percent)  of all resolution meetings resulted in agreements.

Under its regulations, Education  requires states and school districts, where applicable, to ensure that  decisions are reached in due process hearings within 45 days after the  expiration of the 30-day resolution period or adjusted resolution periods.These regulations also permit a hearing officer to grant specific  extensions of this 45-day timeline, at the request of either party to the  hearing. According to Education\u2019s guidance on performance measures,  all states are required to report the number of due process hearing  requests that were adjudicated within 45 days, or a timeline that includes  any approved extensions. However, this guidance does not direct states  to report the amount of time that extensions add to due process hearing  decisions. Leading performance measurement practices identified in our  past work state that successful performance measures should, among  other things, be clearly stated and provide unambiguous information.", "As shown in figure 6, nearly half of all due process hearing decision  timelines were extended in school year 2011-12; in California, New York,  and Pennsylvania, the large majority of hearing decisions were made  under extended timelines. The decisions in these three states accounted  for more than 65 percent of all hearing decisions nationally. Despite the  more frequent use of extensions in California and New York, in 2011 they  achieved about 99 percent and 86 percent, respectively, of the 100  percent performance target that Education established for hearing  decision timeliness. Education\u2019s current performance measure creates  the appearance that most hearing decisions in California and New York  were timely even though extended hearings took an unknown amount of  time, and no information is available about whether these extended  timeframes affected the provision of services to children with disabilities.", "Education officials told us that, while they were aware of the use of  extensions in states, they did not know how much time extensions add to  hearing decisions because they do not collect this information. They  stated they were not concerned specifically about the effect of extensions  on the timeliness of dispute resolution because they believe extensions  are generally used for appropriate reasons, such as providing additional  opportunities for resolving disputes prior to a hearing, accommodating  parties\u2019 schedules, and affording parents sufficient time to resolve  disputes.", "A range of special education stakeholders, including state education  officials and officials from national organizations that represent parents,  students, and school systems, agreed that extensions to hearing  decisions are requested by parties for a variety of reasons, including  when (1) weather and school vacations result in school closures; (2)  some or all parties (parents, district personnel, attorneys, and expert  witnesses) are not available; (3) attorneys or parents require additional  time to prepare cases; and (4) the parties involved want to allow  additional time to schedule a mediation.", "Though Education does not gather data on how much time extensions  add on average to the dispute resolution process, some stakeholders we  spoke with provided examples of extensions that typically ranged from a  few weeks to several months. Several, including disability advocates and  a state education official, stated that some decisions are extended by up  to a year or more. Another noted that timelines for hearing decisions in  one state typically get extended four or five times.", "Stakeholders differed in their views on the extent to which the time added  to due process decision timelines by extensions affected the education of  children with disabilities. Some stakeholders stated there is likely to be  little or no negative effect on children\u2019s education because of IDEA\u2019s \u201cstay  put\u201d provision, which generally ensures that children will stay in their  current educational placement until a dispute resolution proceeding is  completed. However, other stakeholders pointed out that extensions  could cause some children not to receive appropriate educational  services in a timely manner. For example, one stakeholder commented  that for children currently placed in a program under the \u201cstay put\u201d  provision, an extended hearing decision could mean the child would  continue to receive educational services that may be inappropriate.  Another stakeholder commented that extended decisions could also  adversely affect children for whom \u201cstay put\u201d does not apply, such as  those waiting to be identified for educational services.", "Because Education\u2019s current measures do not provide clear and  complete information on the total amount of time that due process hearing  decisions take or the reasons for any time extensions, Education and  other stakeholders, such as Congress, lack information about when and  whether extended decisions could adversely affect the education of  children with disabilities. Further, Education lacks information that could  be used to identify trends and patterns within a state or across states that  could help Education better target its oversight or monitoring. Lastly, as  currently reported, states\u2019 results on this measure may provide Congress  with a misleading picture of the amount of time that hearing decisions  take, particularly in states with high rates of extensions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parental Involvement Performance Data Do Not Support Dispute Resolution Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Education collects data from states on parental involvement in the  education of children with disabilities, but these data are not comparable  across states, and as a result Education cannot use these data to target  its oversight of states\u2019 dispute resolution activities. One of Congress\u2019  findings in passing IDEA was that decades of research had demonstrated  that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective  by strengthening the role and responsibility of parents, and Education  has recognized the importance of parental involvement in fostering  relationships between parents and educators and preventing special  education disputes. Accordingly, Education developed a performance  measure for parental involvement and requires states to collect and report  the results of this measure annually. Its measure is defined as the  percentage of parents with a child receiving special education services  who report that schools facilitated parental involvement as a means of  improving services and results for children with disabilities, but states  collect and analyze this information in different ways. According to  Education officials, although IDEA does not specifically require Education  to collect parental involvement data, parental involvement is such a  critical factor in ensuring children needing special education services are  provided such services that they believe it is important for states to collect  and report such data. In 2002, the National Center for Special Education  Accountability Monitoring (NCSEAM)\u2014a national technical assistance  center funded by Education\u2014developed and validated a scale for states  to use to measure parental involvement because of the lack of survey  instruments designed to obtain parents\u2019 perceptions of schools\u2019 facilitation  of their involvement. To date, over half of states and territories use the  NCSEAM scale to collect and report data for this measure. Education  officials told us they believed states gather data that is meaningful and  useful for their own efforts. However, these officials said that Education  cannot determine which states provide high quality parental involvement  data, nor does Education use these data to monitor and oversee states\u2019  performance in this area and is unable to compare state performance  because states have considerable latitude to determine the  methodologies they use to collect the data and these methodologies  consequently vary across states. As a result, Education is unable to  assess the performance of individual states or compare states\u2019  performance on this measure.", "The lack of comparable parental involvement data from states can be  attributed to a variety of factors, according to PACER Center (Parent  Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights), which recently operated the  National Parent Technical Assistance Center and conducted annual  analyses of states\u2019 parent involvement data for Education. PACER  officials stated they found significant variability among states in their  survey instruments, sampling and analysis methods, and the performance  targets states set for parental involvement. In previous analysis, PACER  reported that in 2011, 34 states used a version of the parental  involvement surveys developed by NCSEAM, 10 states used their own  state-developed instrument, 10 states adapted questions from the  NCSEAM or other parent surveys to develop their own surveys, and 3   According to PACER officials,  states used a combination of surveys.states\u2019 use of different survey instruments results in parents responding to  questions that may represent varying types of parental involvement. They  also noted that states varied in how they analyze survey results for the  purposes of reporting on Education\u2019s measure. For example, in some  states only half of the questions require positive responses for the survey  to be scored positive overall for parental involvement on Education\u2019s  measure; in others, a much higher percentage of questions require  positive responses to be scored positive overall for parental involvement.  Ultimately, PACER officials suggested that the meaningfulness of parent  involvement data depends on the ability to use it to make valid  comparisons across states and this requires that Education establish and  require states to adopt consistent data collection and analysis methods.  Others have also noted that the lack of consistency in data collection  compromises the meaningfulness of the data. For example, a subject  matter specialist noted that recent parental involvement data show a wide  range of state performance on this measure\u2014from below 20 percent to  above 90 percent\u2014raising important questions about validity that may  undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the data. The specialist noted the  lack of comparability in state data and the recognition among states that  Education does not use the data for oversight may discourage states from  improving their parental involvement measures and practices.", "Education officials said they explored the option of revising its parental  involvement measure when some states raised issues about the burden  of collecting the data but ultimately decided not to change it after  encountering significant resistance from parent and advocate groups.  Specifically, officials said they informally proposed that states report  information about how they address and measure parental involvement in  their state without requiring states to use a quantitative measure or  targets. Education presented this proposal to a range of stakeholder  groups, including state officials, Parent Training and Information Centers,  advocates, and parents, among others. Education officials said parents  and advocates were strongly opposed to the proposal to eliminate the  current measure, suggesting instead that the department require that all  states take a standard approach to collecting parent involvement data.  For example, one parent advocacy organization stated that comparability  of parental involvement data across states is critical and that Education  should require a consistent approach to data collection for all states to  ensure that the status of parental involvement for all families of children  receiving special education services is reflected in their results. However,  one organization representing states commented on the burdens of  collecting data for the measure, pointing to the costs to states of mailing  out parent surveys and noting that most surveys are not returned. On the  other hand, conducting parent surveys does not necessarily entail high  costs, according to one subject matter specialist who provided comments  to Education. She noted that Florida took a number of steps to lower  survey costs without compromising data quality, including moving to a  web-based survey, with printed survey forms available to parents on  request, and suggested that alternatives to costly survey mailings exist  and should be considered. Also, PACER officials have stated that  requiring a consistent approach to collecting parental involvement data  may decrease some of the data collection burden associated with  Education\u2019s measure because states would not need to develop their own  approaches.", "Education officials told us they question the usefulness of comparable  parental involvement data across states for oversight and pointed to data  on the overrepresentation of racial and ethnic groups in special  education, among other IDEA measures, that are also not comparable  across states. However, in 2013 GAO found these data do not provide a  consistent picture on overrepresentation. Specifically, we found that the  flexibility to define how states measure overrepresentation resulted in  inconsistent definitions and data collection methods across states and  recommended that Education adopt a standard approach to  measurement for all states. In responding to this recommendation,  Education said that it did not have all the information necessary to  determine whether it is appropriate to develop a single standard for  overrepresentation. Education began soliciting public comments from  stakeholders beginning in June 2014 to assist the department in  considering the development of such a standard.", "Leading performance measurement practices state that organizations that  have progressed toward results-oriented management use performance  information as a basis for decision making and that full benefit of  collecting such information is realized only when managers actually use it   Uses of performance information to improve results include  to manage. monitoring, resource allocation, and identifying and sharing effective  practices, among others. The usefulness of performance information also  depends, in part, on the extent to which the data are collected using  consistent procedures and definitions.", "Without comparable parental involvement data across states, Education  lacks important performance information which limits its ability to oversee  states\u2019 dispute resolution activities, including monitoring and identifying  problems with parental involvement in states and recommending  improvement activities for states to take; recognizing and incentivizing  high performance; assessing states\u2019 needs for technical assistance on  parental involvement and making appropriate resource decisions; and  identifying and helping to share promising parental involvement practices  among states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Both IDEA and Education recognize the importance of parental  involvement in the education of children with disabilities. Having parents  who are appropriately informed and involved in decision-making  regarding the education of students with disabilities can lead to the  resolution of disputes in a more collaborative manner without the use of  formal dispute resolution methods and may result in greater trust between  parents and school districts, and earlier, less adversarial dispute  resolution. In addition, resolving disagreements before they escalate and  become adversarial is in the collective best interest of parents, students,  and districts.", "It is also important for Education to hold states accountable for timely  dispute resolution to protect the educational interests of children with  disabilities. In particular, it is important that Education have an effective  measure of hearing decision timeliness for monitoring states\u2019 dispute  resolution performance. However, Education\u2019s measure does not provide  clear, complete information about the duration of this process, information  which is useful for ensuring effective program monitoring and targeted  technical assistance. While Education tracks the number of hearing  decisions made within 45 days, without information on the amount of time  added to decisions timelines by extensions, Education is limited in its  ability to monitor in this area, which could negatively affect children and  their families by, for example, delaying the provision of appropriate  special education services.", "Additionally, Education views parental involvement as a critical factor in  ensuring children needing special education services are provided such  services and for this reason collects parental involvement data from  states. However, without making the data more comparable across  states, Education may be prevented from rigorously evaluating states\u2019  performance in this area and may be limited in its ability to identify  promising practices and effectively target assistance to states in their  efforts to resolve disputes at an early state.

To assist its oversight of dispute resolution, take steps to improve the  comparability of parental involvement data while minimizing the  burden to states, and use the data for better management decision  making. Steps to consider could include establishing and requiring  that states follow standard data collection and analysis procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment.  Education\u2019s comments are produced in appendix I. Education also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated into our report  where appropriate. Education neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendations but proposed alternative actions. However, Education\u2019s  proposed actions will not effectively address the weaknesses we  identified in Education\u2019s performance measures and we continue to  believe our recommendations are valid.", "In its comments, Education recognized the importance of promptly and  fairly resolving special education disputes between parents and school  districts and agreed that additional information on extensions could be  useful in targeting its monitoring and technical assistance activities in  states with large numbers of hearings issued within extended timelines.  However, Education stated that collecting data from all states and  territories on the amount of time that extensions add to hearing timelines  would not necessarily improve its capacity to ensure that states and  territories are properly implementing IDEA\u2019s dispute resolution  procedures. Instead, Education proposed that it conduct follow up  monitoring with any state that reports 10 or more fully adjudicated  hearings in a given year where at least 75 percent of the decisions are  issued with extended timelines. While this approach might be useful for  Education\u2019s targeting of monitoring and assistance to states\u2014particularly  if monitoring includes collecting information about the duration of  extensions, why parties request extensions and the effects of extended  timelines on children\u2019s education\u2014we believe Education\u2019s proposal alone  will not correct the potentially misleading picture its timeliness measure  creates regarding of the amount of time that hearing decisions actually  take. As noted in the report, some stakeholders pointed out that  extensions could cause some children not to receive appropriate  educational services in a timely manner. Thus, we continue to see  advantages in addressing the core weakness of its measure by collecting  information from all states on the amount of time that extensions add to  hearing decision timelines. Further, Education noted that only 12 states  and territories had 10 or more fully adjudicated hearings in 2011-12 and  stated that it is not appropriate or efficient to burden all states in collecting  these data. However, requiring states with fewer hearings to report this  information is unlikely to create significant administrative burden for them,  as they would be providing information on a small number of decisions.  Without reliable performance information, the public lacks a clear picture  of the time required to reach due process hearing decisions and the  potential impact on affected children.", "Regarding our recommendation that it improve the comparability of  parental involvement data it collects and use the data for better  management decision making, Education stated it does not believe there  is a need to improve the comparability of states\u2019 parental involvement  data. More specifically, Education said that these data are designed to  measure state performance against targets that each state sets, based on  state-specific needs and circumstances. To improve the quality of  parental involvement data, Education said it will work with states through  its technical assistance centers to help build their capacity to collect high  quality data. We commend Education\u2019s proposal to assist states in this  way; however, its approach will continue to require states to report  parental involvement data that Education cannot use to assist with  oversight and manage for results related to dispute resolution. For  example, absent comparable performance information across states,  Education could not monitor states with weak performance on parental  involvement or identify and assist states in sharing promising parental  involvement practices that may help prevent disputes from developing.  One approach Education could consider to improve the comparability of  parental involvement data would be to establish and require that states  follow standard data collection and analysis procedures in reporting the  existing measure. Education stated that standardizing the collection of  parental involvement data among states would result in increased  administrative burden on some states. However, in our report we note  that Education\u2019s former national technical assistance center on parental  involvement suggested that consistent data collection may, in fact,  decrease administrative burden because states would not need to  develop their own approaches. Until Education collects data that it can  use to effectively manage this effort, it will likely be limited in its ability to  enhance collaboration between parents and educators, which facilitates  resolving disputes earlier through less formal and costly means.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
