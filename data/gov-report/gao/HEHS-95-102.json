The severity of these problems reported varies; some veterans report relatively mild symptoms, while others report debilitating illnesses. The cause or causes of these problems is unknown, but many causes have been suggested, including exposure to chemical or other toxic agents, parasitic infestations, medications given as a precaution against possible exposure to nerve agents, and stress. Persian Gulf veterans\u2019 health concerns have received considerable attention by Congress, federal agencies and the media. Both the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have undertaken research efforts to determine the extent and causes of these illnesses and have established programs to provide health examinations to identify and respond to these veterans\u2019 health concerns.", "You asked that we obtain information related to health concerns for certain Gulf War veterans from the 123rd Army Reserve Command (ARCOM), headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Members of the ARCOM, according to command officials, were among the first to raise Persian Gulf-related health concerns. Early in 1992, the Surgeon General of the Army directed a team from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research to examine the 125 ARCOM members who, by that time, had made their health concerns known to the ARCOM.", "In response to your request, we obtained information on the current military and health status of these 125 Persian Gulf War veterans, the health care they have received, and their opinions of that health care. Most of this information was obtained through a survey of the 125 ARCOM veterans we conducted in November 1994. Of the 125, 89 responded. The information reported from the survey cannot be generalized beyond these respondents to any other Persian Gulf veterans. Information on health status and quality of care was not verified through means such as physical examinations and is based solely on the perceptions of the respondents. We also interviewed officials from the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs; the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research; the VA medical center in Indianapolis, Indiana; and the ARCOM.

In January 1992, officials of the ARCOM first became aware of members\u2019 medical complaints and symptoms. In February 1992, one ARCOM member, concerned about these health complaints, distributed an unofficial questionnaire asking members if they had health concerns. In March 1992, the ARCOM surgeon examined some of the members who were complaining of health problems.", "By early spring 1992, the ARCOM was aware of 125 members who had health concerns. Those concerns included fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and loss of memory. In response to the Surgeon General\u2019s directive, the Walter Reed team visited the ARCOM headquarters on April 11 and 12, 1992, to examine the soldiers. The ARCOM attempted to schedule appointments for all 125 soldiers; 79 reported for the examination.

Additionally, in June 1994, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness asked the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to direct that no service member with symptoms \u201cassociated with Persian Gulf illness\u201d be discharged unless he or she requests it in writing or he or she can be medically retired or separated. In October 1994, the National Defense Authorization Act for 1995 (P.L. 103-337, Oct. 5, 1994) provided a presumption that a Persian Gulf veteran who is ill became ill as a result of service in the Persian Gulf, unless medical evidence establishes another cause, and specifies that such a presumption can be used in disability determinations.

Any veteran who served during the Persian Gulf War is eligible for this examination. VA had begun providing examinations in September 1992, before enactment of the legislation, and by January 1995, about 40,000 had been given. Initial examinations are given at VA medical centers or clinics by physicians specifically charged with conducting these examinations.

This program is to communicate information through a toll-free telephone number and a semiannual newsletter to all those on the Persian Gulf War Health Registry. The registry was authorized in November 1992 by the Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Status Act, which specified five groups who were to be included: Persian Gulf veterans who (1) had requested the VA examination, (2) had applied for medical service in VA medical facilities, (3) had filed a claim for compensation for a disability that might be related to Persian Gulf service, (4) had died and are survived by a claimant for VA dependency and indemnity compensation, or (5) had received the DOD special examination and asked to be included in the VA registry.", "VA is continuing publication of the Persian Gulf Review.
