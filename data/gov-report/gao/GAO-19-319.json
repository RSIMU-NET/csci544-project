In selecting projects, the Corps is to conduct economic analyses of project alternatives, which may include hard structures, natural infrastructure, or a combination, to compare their costs and benefits. Corps guidance states that for coastal storm and flood risk management projects it is to select the alternative determined to have the maximum net benefits (benefits minus project costs). The Corps calculated project costs for the eight projects, such as planning, design, construction, and maintenance costs. It calculated damage reduction benefits for seven projects by estimating reduced damages to existing structures in the project area, including to homes and commercial buildings. Corps guidance allows the economic analysis to also include incidental benefits of a project, and four projects incorporated recreational benefits of alternatives, such as increases in recreational visits because beaches would be larger. The Corps did not include other types of incidental benefits, such as environmental or other social benefits, for the eight projects. Corps documentation for one project identified environmental benefits of constructing wetlands as part of the project, such as improving ecosystems and filtering water. However, Corps officials said they did not incorporate these benefits into the economic analysis because the benefits could not be monetized.", "The Corps faces challenges in developing cost and benefit information for some types of natural infrastructure and has initiated steps to address this. For example, a 2015 Corps report identified knowledge gaps in understanding how natural coastal infrastructure, such as wetlands, may perform during coastal storms. These knowledge gaps make it challenging for the Corps to develop cost and benefit information for some natural infrastructure alternatives and compare them to other alternatives, such as those that use hard infrastructure. The Corps recognizes the need to obtain additional data to better develop cost and benefit information and has begun taking steps to do so. For example, in 2018, the Corps initiated a project to help identify natural infrastructure knowledge gaps and prioritize key areas for research. The Corps plans to incorporate information gathered from this project into a strategic plan that is intended to help inform research funding decisions for fiscal year 2020, according to a Corps official."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Coastal areas are home to a considerable portion of the U.S. population,  with about 40 percent of the population living in coastal shoreline counties  and contributing to the production of $8.3 trillion of goods and services  annually. Coastal storms and flooding pose significant risks to coastal  communities and may cause substantial property damage. For example,  according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), the three largest hurricanes during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane  season caused an estimated $265 billion in damage in the United States.  Moreover, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program\u2019s  2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment, damage to coastal areas from  extreme weather events combined with rising sea levels threaten  approximately $1 trillion in national wealth held in coastal real estate.", "State and local governments have primary responsibility for managing  U.S. coastlines, but the federal government plays a key role in  implementing projects to reduce coastal risks from storms and floods.

For decades, the Corps has  used hard infrastructure (e.g., seawalls and levees) as well as beaches  and dunes to help reduce the risks from coastal storms and flooding. The  Corps also helps to repair infrastructure damaged by natural disasters.  For example, in response to natural disasters in 2017, the Corps  allocated approximately $645 million in supplemental appropriations for  emergency repairs for flood control and coastal risk reduction projects.", "Over the last several years, some federal, state, and local governments,  as well as nongovernmental organizations and academia, have  increasingly supported using natural infrastructure as an alternative to  hard infrastructure for reducing risks in coastal areas. Natural  infrastructure includes (1) natural features that may provide coastal risk  reduction and that are created over time by physical, biological, geologic,  and chemical processes operating in nature or (2) nature-based features  created by human design, engineering, and construction to provide  specific services, such as coastal storm risk reduction. Natural  infrastructure may involve using a variety of natural features, including  beaches, dunes, wetlands, reefs, and aquatic vegetation. Natural features  can also be combined with hard infrastructure to create a hybrid approach  for reducing the risks to coastal areas from coastal storms and flooding.  Studies have shown that using natural features, such as wetlands and  marshes, can help reduce the risks to coastal communities from storms  and flooding and provide other benefits, such as support for fisheries,  recreational opportunities, and carbon sequestration.", "You asked us to review the uses, costs, and benefits of natural coastal  infrastructure for the Corps\u2019 coastal storm and flood risk management  projects.

We compiled this information into a list of 179  projects and analyzed it to select specific projects for further review. From  this list, we excluded projects without a coastal storm or flood risk  reduction objective. This resulted in 79 projects with coastal storm and  flood risk management objectives. To select specific projects for further  review, we then categorized projects by Corps district to identify districts  with the highest number of coastal storm and flood risk management  projects. We separated districts by their coastlines (Atlantic, Gulf, and  Pacific) and selected the district on each coastline with the highest  number of projects. For each selected district, we randomly selected  two projects with a coastal storm and flood risk management objective for  review, for a total of eight projects (see table 1).", "For each of the eight projects, we obtained and analyzed information on  (1) the location and purpose of the project, (2) how the Corps identified  and considered project alternatives, and (3) the economic analysis  conducted. For example, to analyze the Corps\u2019 economic analysis, we  reviewed the types of costs and benefits the Corps analyzed for each  project, and whether the Corps used standard approaches of economic  analysis outlined in the agency\u2019s guidance, such as comparing project  results to expected conditions without the project. We interviewed Corps  officials at the districts with knowledge of the projects and relevant Corps  policies. In addition, we interviewed nonfederal sponsors for three  projects with planning documentation issued since 2007 (10 years prior to  our review) for their perspective on how the Corps considered the costs  and benefits for the projects. The findings from our analysis of the eight  selected projects are not generalizable to all Corps projects with coastal  storm and flood risk management objectives, but provide illustrative  examples of how the Corps considers the costs and benefits for a  geographically diverse range of randomly selected projects that used  natural infrastructure. See appendix I for more information about the eight  projects we reviewed.", "To describe challenges in developing cost and benefit information for  using natural infrastructure, we conducted a literature review, reviewed  Corps documents related to the use of natural infrastructure, and  interviewed Corps officials and stakeholders with experience in using  natural infrastructure. To conduct the literature review, we searched the  ProQuest, Scopus, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development, and the World Bank databases for economic articles using  search terms such as coastline, natural infrastructure, and green  infrastructure. Our initial searches identified 98 studies that we reviewed  to determine if they were (1) published after 2010, (2) peer reviewed, and  (3) focused on analyzing the economic costs and benefits associated with  using natural infrastructure for coastal storm and flood risk reduction in  the United States. Based on the application of these criteria, we identified  six studies that met our selection criteria for in-depth assessment. To  review these studies, we compared their assessment of benefits and  costs of using natural coastal infrastructure with relevant federal  guidelines and leading practices established by the Office of Management  and Budget, GAO, and others. Specifically, we assessed the extent to  which the studies included the elements of an economic analysis as  defined in GAO\u2019s Assessment Methodology for Economic Analysis and  consistent with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-94. Based  on our review, we determined that the six studies are sufficiently reliable  for purposes of this report.", "In addition, we reviewed Corps documents identifying challenges  associated with using natural infrastructure. We also interviewed Corps  officials with experience in researching natural infrastructure and  constructing projects about any challenges related to using natural  infrastructure. Finally, we interviewed a nongeneralizable selection of  stakeholders to obtain additional perspectives on any challenges related  to identifying the costs and benefits of using natural infrastructure. We  identified stakeholders from our review of economic literature.  Specifically, stakeholders we interviewed included officials from NOAA\u2019s  Office for Coastal Management and researchers from the University of  California Santa Cruz, the University of Minnesota, the Environmental  Defense Fund, and The Nature Conservancy. To identify any steps the  Corps has taken to address these challenges, we interviewed Corps  officials from the Civil Works Directorate and the Engineer Research and  Development Center about the agency\u2019s initiatives and obtained  supporting documentation, where available.

More specifically, coastal communities face threats from erosion and  damages from waves, wind, and storm surges. For example, during  Superstorm Sandy in 2012, shoreline water levels rose across the East  Coast, causing billions of dollars in property damage to homes and  businesses. These threats can be exacerbated by several factors,  including sea level rise and commercial and residential development,  according to Corps documents on coastal risk reduction and resilience.  For example, rising sea levels increase the risks from regular tidal  flooding and coastal storms and new construction along coastlines can  increase the number of people and buildings at risk from the storms.", "The Corps constructs projects to help reduce the risks from coastal storm  hazards and mitigate erosion, wave damage, and flooding, which may  include the use of hard structures. The Corps has decades of experience developing projects that use hard structures, such as  revetments, seawalls, and storm surge barriers, to reduce the risks from  coastal storm hazards, according to a 2014 report by the National  Academy of Sciences (see fig. 1).", "Natural infrastructure can also be designed and developed for coastal  storm and flood risk reduction purposes. Natural infrastructure can involve  several types of natural features that have the potential to reduce risks to  coastal areas from storms (see fig. 2). Diverse natural features occur in  different areas of the United States. For example, some areas along the  Florida Gulf Coast are host to mangroves\u2014coastal wetlands found in  tropical and subtropical regions\u2014that can reduce the impacts of high  energy waves from storm surges. The extent to which natural  infrastructure can reduce risks to coastal areas from storms and flooding  depends on the types of natural features being used. For example,  underwater vegetation, such as seagrass, has less capacity to reduce  wave energy than a coral reef, which is a hard underwater structure,  according to scientific studies.", "According to a 2014 National Academy of Sciences report, in addition to  reducing the risks of storms and flooding for coastal communities,  projects using natural infrastructure may provide other benefits,  depending on the type of natural feature associated with the project.  Among other things, natural infrastructure has the potential to enhance  commercial and recreational fisheries and create recreational  opportunities. For example, natural infrastructure may support fish  habitats, which could enhance a commercial or recreational fishery. In  addition, wetlands may improve habitats for birds, which could enhance  bird watching activities.

Upon statutory authorization for a study and  appropriations to fund it, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor enter into  an agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a potential project.  Nonfederal sponsors are to participate in the planning process, as well as  remain involved through project design, construction, and post-project  operations and maintenance. For example, for projects where the Corps  constructs hard infrastructure, such as a seawall, the nonfederal sponsor  is to assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance costs  associated with the seawall after its construction.

The project team then inventories conditions in the project area,  including physical, economic, and social conditions, and forecasts how  these conditions may change over the life of a potential project. As it  continues the scoping phase, the project team identifies various  measures that could address the problem, such as replenishing an  existing beach or constructing a seawall.

To identify beneficial and  adverse effects of each alternative, the Corps uses four general  categories established in the Principles and Guidelines, as shown in table  2. The Corps\u2019 Planning Guidance states that project teams should  evaluate alternatives using the four categories of analysis, but the  evaluation from two categories\u2014National Economic Development and  Environmental Quality\u2014must be included in each feasibility study.  According to the Planning Guidance, evaluating projects\u2019 potential costs  and benefits through these categories of analysis provides a basis for  determining which alternatives should be eliminated from consideration,  modified, or selected for further analysis.

This  analysis allows the team to compare costs and benefits directly across  the alternatives, including alternatives using natural infrastructure, hard  infrastructure, or a combination of the two. Specifically, the project team is  to develop estimates for each project alternative\u2019s net economic  benefits\u2014benefits minus costs\u2014to identify and select the project  alternative with the maximum net benefits. The Corps\u2019 Planning Guidance  states that the Corps shall select coastal storm and flood risk  management projects determined to have the maximum net benefits.", "Our review of Corps guidance and eight selected projects identified the  following costs and benefits that the Corps generally incorporated into its  economic analyses:", "Project costs. According to the Corps\u2019 Planning Guidance, project  costs include three categories: implementation costs, other direct  costs, and associated costs. Implementation costs, for example,  include planning and design, construction, construction contingency,  operations, maintenance, repair, and other costs necessary to  implement a project. The eight selected projects that we reviewed  included analyses of project costs, which mostly focused on  implementation and interest costs. For example, the costs for the  Corps\u2019 Jacksonville District Lido Key project included initial  construction costs (i.e., beach construction and hard infrastructure  designed to reduce shore currents), future beach replenishment costs  (i.e., operations related to placing material on beaches to replenish  eroding shores), and monitoring costs (e.g., measurement of beach  fill, sediment type, and habitat quality).", "Damage reduction benefits. Reducing damages to existing  structures, including homes and commercial buildings, is the primary  benefit the Corps considers when identifying benefits for coastal storm  risk management project alternatives, according to the Corps\u2019  Planning Guidance. The guidance outlines general steps for  estimating damage reduction benefits, which are to be calculated and  included in each coastal storm and flood risk management  alternative\u2019s economic analysis. In seven of the eight projects we  reviewed, the Corps analyzed damage reduction benefits as part of its  economic analysis. For example, the Corps\u2019 project team for the  New York District Union Beach project determined the potential  damage reduction benefits of each alternative by estimating the  alternative\u2019s potential to reduce (1) damages to coastal property from  flooding and waves, (2) public emergency spending, and (3)  administrative costs for the National Flood Insurance Program (see  fig. 5).", "We also found that for some selected projects, the Corps identified and  incorporated additional benefits into the projects\u2019 economic analyses,  including the following:  Incidental recreational benefits. Corps project teams may include in  the economic analysis recreational benefits that stem directly from the  project alternative but that are incidental to the primary purpose of  damage reduction, according to the Corps\u2019 Planning Guidance.  Specifically, Corps project teams may include recreational benefits,  such as increases in recreational visits because beaches are larger in  their economic analysis of project alternatives, but recreational  benefits are limited to no more than 50 percent of the total economic  benefits used to justify an alternative (i.e., demonstrate that an  alternative has greater benefits than costs). After an alternative has  been economically justified, the team can use the full estimated  recreational benefits with the damage reduction benefits to select the  alternative with maximum net benefits. In our review of eight projects,  we identified four projects where the Corps project team included  recreational benefits in its economic analysis for the project alternative  that was selected. For one such project, the Los Angeles District\u2019s  Encinitas-Solana Beach project, the Corps\u2019 economic analysis  showed that the selected project alternative had lower damage  reduction benefits than project costs. However, when the Corps  added recreational benefits\u2014as allowed by Corps policy\u2014the  combined annual damage reduction and recreational benefits resulted  in the alternative having greater benefits than costs (see fig. 6).", "Other direct incidental benefits. The Corps may also consider other  direct incidental benefits in its economic analysis, as appropriate,  according to the Principles and Guidelines. In our review of eight  projects, we identified three projects that included estimated incidental  benefits aside from recreational benefits. The three projects included  economic benefits associated with reduced maintenance costs for  local communities, whose expenses for maintaining local beaches  would decline after the Corps projects were constructed. Other than  these reduced maintenance costs, the Corps did not include other  types of direct incidental benefits, such as environmental or other  social benefits, in the economic analyses for the eight projects we  reviewed. According to Corps officials, some project alternatives using  natural infrastructure may provide direct incidental benefits that are  not included in the economic analysis, such as environmental and  social benefits. For example, the draft feasibility study for the New  York District\u2019s Jamaica Bay project states that natural infrastructure  can provide direct incidental benefits, such as improving ecosystems,  filtering water, and improving aesthetics. The Corps acknowledged  these incidental benefits and their importance to communities in its  draft feasibility study, but did not incorporate these benefits into its  economic analysis because they could not be monetized, according to  Corps district officials. Corps headquarters officials said incidental  benefits that cannot be monetized in the economic analysis are  considered in the planning process through the evaluation of other  Principles and Guidelines categories.", "Two reports published by the National Academy of Sciences stated that  when assessing project alternatives, the Corps primarily uses qualitative  measures to assess benefits that are difficult to monetize but that  relegates such effects to secondary status compared to the monetized  estimates of costs and benefits. Moreover, a 2004 National Academy of  Sciences report found that the Principles and Guidelines outlines a  process that focuses on the effects that can be monetized, which does  not allow for full consideration of a project\u2019s total economic effects.", "Nonetheless, for three of the eight projects we reviewed, we found that  the Corps modified its approach in selecting the use of natural  infrastructure as part of the recommended alternative. For instance, for  the Encinitas-Solana Beach project, the Corps granted an exception to its  planning process and recommended a locally preferred plan. In certain  circumstances, Corps project teams can deviate from the Corps\u2019 Planning  Guidance that calls for the Corps to select the project alternative with the  maximum net benefits. Corps headquarters officials said that requesting  such an exception is the primary method the agency uses for  recommending a project alternative that does not meet the Corps  maximum net benefits requirement for a project focused solely on coastal  storm or flood risk management. For the Encinitas-Solana Beach project,  the California Coastal Commission found that the Corps\u2019 proposed  alternative with the maximum net benefits was inconsistent with the  mission of California\u2019s coastal management program to protect and  enhance the state\u2019s coastal environment. In particular, the Commission  had concerns about the size of the project and the amount of sand to be  added to the beach under the proposed alternative, as well as the  potential adverse effects on a nearshore natural reef and marine  resources. In response, the Corps\u2019 Los Angeles District worked with the  project\u2019s nonfederal sponsors to address the commission\u2019s concerns and  revised the project by reducing its size and potentially lessening its  environmental impacts. The commission approved the revised project  alternative in November 2013.", "The Corps\u2019 Planning Guidance also allows projects with multiple  objectives to incorporate other analyses in selecting a recommended  alternative. For the Philadelphia District\u2019s Lower Cape May project,  ecosystem restoration was the project\u2019s primary objective, but it also had  a coastal storm risk management objective. According to the project\u2019s  feasibility study, the project focused on protecting and restoring a  freshwater marsh that was being flooded with salt water from storms  because of continued beach erosion. The Corps used a cost- effectiveness analysis to meet the primary objective, which compared  environmental measures (e.g., the number of acres of habitat restored)  with the costs of different alternatives. In addition, this project included a  beach component to protect the marsh from saltwater intrusion. In the  process of designing beach alternatives, the Corps project team  conducted a damage reduction benefit analysis to determine an optimal  size for the beach that would provide the greatest net damage reduction  benefit to nearby communities. This analysis helped inform the Corps  decision to select a beach design option that met the project\u2019s primary  objective of protecting the ecosystem, while also providing the most  incidental damage reduction benefits to local communities, according to  Corps district officials.", "For the third project, the New York District\u2019s Jamaica Bay project, the  Corps incorporated natural features into the project, although it did not  directly include the economic benefits of these features in its economic  analysis. For the project, the Corps project team recommended an  alternative that was designed to address frequent flooding within Jamaica  Bay at three locations. The project team incorporated wetlands into the  design at one location, along with hard infrastructure. The nonfederal  sponsors of the project told us that they advocated for the inclusion of  these natural features, where appropriate, because of their risk reduction  and ecological benefits. In response to the interests of nonfederal  sponsors, the Corps project team developed and recommended the  alternative incorporating hard infrastructure, such as floodwalls, along  with coastal wetlands. The Corps did not include the risk reduction  benefits from the wetlands in the economic analysis, but the draft  feasibility study noted that the project was economically justified based on  the monetary benefits of the hard infrastructure alone and that the  wetlands provided additional benefits that could not be monetized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Faces Challenges in Developing Cost and Benefit Information for Some Types of Natural Infrastructure and Has Initiated Steps to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["Based on our literature review, agency documentation, and interviews  with Corps officials and other stakeholders, we found that the Corps faces  challenges developing cost and benefit information for some natural  infrastructure to help inform the process for selecting project alternatives  and conducting economic analyses in feasibility studies.

In  addition, there are knowledge gaps about how these natural features will  change over time and how any changes might affect the long-term  performance of the features.", "A Corps report from January 2015 also identified knowledge gaps in  understanding how some natural infrastructure, such as wetlands, may  perform during coastal storms or floods. According to the report,  wetlands may reduce storm surge, but in some instances water can be  redirected, potentially causing a storm surge increase elsewhere. Corps  officials noted that all structures\u2014whether natural or hard\u2014change over time, requiring maintenance and repair, but said that natural infrastructure  may change more dramatically than hard infrastructure and over a shorter  period of time. For example, a healthy wetland could restore itself and  reduce maintenance costs after a major storm or require the Corps to  take action to restore the wetland after the storm event, which could  increase the costs of maintaining the wetland. Corps officials also stated  that there are knowledge gaps regarding whether wetlands can absorb  major storm surges and how these features would perform in the event of  recurring coastal storms in a short period of time. Specifically, natural  features may be damaged during intense storms (e.g., wetlands can  erode and vegetation may be stripped apart), which may degrade the  long-term performance of the features.", "Because the Corps does not have information on performance for some  natural features, it has been unable to update engineering guidance to  include the use of some natural features, according to Corps officials. A  Corps headquarters official explained that the agency must first develop a  broader understanding of how some natural features, such as wetlands,  perform under various coastal storm scenarios over time before it can  begin to develop design guidance for using these features for coastal  storm protection and flood risk management projects.", "A Corps headquarters official said that the agency recognizes the need to  obtain additional information on natural infrastructure and has initiated  steps to address the challenge related to developing information on the  performance of some types of natural infrastructure. In particular, in  October 2016, the Engineer Research and Development Center began  collaborating with several entities, including other federal agencies,  international partners, academic institutions, and nongovernmental  organizations, to develop guidelines for using some types of natural  infrastructure. According to the scoping document, this effort is to entail  developing guidelines to support various phases of building natural  infrastructure projects, including conceptualization, design, engineering,  construction, and maintenance. According to the Corps official, an  anticipated key output from the international effort includes developing  information on defining performance for different types of natural  infrastructure features and options for measuring performance depending  on project objectives. The final product is expected to include chapters  with information on analyzing natural infrastructure benefits and related  monitoring, maintenance, and adaptive management issues, among  others.", "The Corps official stated that the guidelines will not be official Corps  guidance or policy, but Corps project teams and other practitioners can  use the guidelines as a resource for identifying best practices in planning  projects and assessing potential alternatives. For example, the guidelines  will include case studies illustrating design and engineering concepts for  certain types of natural features. The guidelines are scheduled for  publication in March 2020.", "The Corps has also developed a separate internal initiative to help fill  knowledge gaps regarding how some natural features\u2019 performance can  provide benefits relevant to flood risk management, among other benefits.  Specifically, the Corps\u2019 Engineering With Nature\u00ae Initiative is focused on  sharing natural infrastructure best practices that are emerging, and  communicating the information to staff in the Corps\u2019 district offices and  other key stakeholders. According to a Corps official, the goal of this  initiative, among other things, is to help familiarize the Corps\u2019 district staff  with existing natural infrastructure information and relevant case studies.  The Corps\u2019 Galveston and Philadelphia Districts have projects that may  incorporate natural infrastructure. For example, the Galveston District is  considering opportunities through the Coastal Texas study to use  natural features, such as barrier islands, wetlands, and reefs, in  combination with hard infrastructure (e.g., levees), to reduce the risks  from storms and floods. Similarly, the Corps\u2019 Philadelphia District is  considering a plan to design, construct, and evaluate natural features as  part of the New Jersey Back Bays Storm Flood Risk Management  study.", "In addition, in 2018, the Corps\u2019 coastal working group initiated a project  within the Corps to help identify natural infrastructure knowledge gaps  and prioritize key areas for research based on requests for information  received from Corps\u2019 districts. The Corps plans to incorporate  information gathered from this project into a strategic plan that is intended  to help inform research funding decisions for fiscal year 2020, according  to a Corps official."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenge in Monetizing Environmental and Social Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Our review of economic literature identified challenges in estimating the  total economic benefits associated with using natural infrastructure  features. Several studies noted that data for conducting economic  analyses are not readily available. For example, one study noted that  there is insufficient information on how restoring wetlands might affect the  survival of certain endangered species. Such information is needed,  according to the study, to provide insight on the extent to which such  features might generate economic benefits. Another study noted that  because projects that combine natural features with more traditional  structures (i.e., hybrid projects) are relatively new, less is known about  their effectiveness or their costs and benefits. Finally, according to  another study, estimating recreational benefits associated with natural  habitats, such as coastal marshes, can be difficult because there is  insufficient information about the extent to which the public visits those  sites.", "In the eight projects we reviewed, Corps project teams did not estimate  incidental benefits other than recreational benefits or through avoiding  maintenance costs for coastal storm and flood risk management projects.  As previously discussed, environmental and social benefits are  considered incidental benefits, and Corps guidance indicates that they do  not have to be included in the economic analysis. On the other hand,  when assessing potential alternatives of coastal storm and flood risk  management projects in its feasibility studies, the Corps can quantify or  describe the benefits qualitatively and consider these effects during the  planning process, outside of the economic analysis. For example, the  Corps has measures to quantify changes in habitat, such as number of  acres of wetlands restored. The Corps can also qualitatively describe  habitat benefits for specific species. However, these nonmonetized  benefits may not affect the selection of the recommended alternative,  which is generally based on the monetized net benefit estimates of each  proposed alternative.", "The Corps has begun developing a process for identifying, describing,  and considering a broader array of potential benefits when assessing  natural infrastructure alternatives for specific projects. Specifically, a June  2017 memorandum from the Corps\u2019 Director of Civil Works indicated that  projects with coastal storm and flood risk management objectives as well  as other objectives should consider social and environmental benefits in  the formulation, design, and implementation of projects within existing  legislation and Corps policy. A Corps headquarters official said that the  agency is not attempting to monetize all potential benefits but is  considering options for accounting for potential benefits other than  through the traditional monetary assessments of costs and economic  benefits. A Corps headquarters planning group is currently working on  developing an initiative that would identify a process for using a flexible  approach for considering the social and environmental effects of natural  infrastructure for coastal storm and flood risk management projects. For  example, project teams may have the option of determining whether to  incorporate nonmonetized social and environmental benefits, such as  enhancing public safety in coastal communities, into the decision-making  process for selecting the recommended alternative. The Corps official  stated that the agency has begun working on developing guidance for this  initiative and expects to issue the guidance in calendar year 2019."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Department of Defense.
