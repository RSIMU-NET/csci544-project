Agencies use established methods and data to estimate the future costs of a program based on what is known today. Based on budgeting and accounting guidance, GAO determined that agencies' estimation processes should include various key elements to help ensure that estimates are supported, reliable, and reasonable. For example, agency management should compare estimated and actual cash flows to identify potential trends. The figure below lists the key elements GAO identified based on relevance to creating credible cost estimates.", "To assess how agencies addressed these key elements in their subsidy cost estimation processes, GAO assessed (1) the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-102) Program, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, and (3) the Department of Education's (Education) William D.

To include a different type of credit  program in our evaluation, we also selected the GSM-102 program, which  can be characterized as having a lower volume of loans and larger  average loan amounts.

Before fiscal year 1992,  when FCRA took effect, the cost of credit programs was recorded in the  budget on a cash basis (the expected amount of cash paid out minus the  cash received in a given year). As a result, the budget cost associated  with a loan guarantee was not recorded until a default occurred, which  may have been many years after the guarantee was made. Further, direct  loans appeared to cost the same as grants because the total amount of a  loan was recorded as a cost when the loan was made and loan  repayments were not recorded until the year received. Both were  inaccurate and provided policymakers with distorted information for  comparing credit programs to noncredit programs and to each other. This  also created a bias in favor of loan guarantees over direct loans because  loan guarantees appeared to be less expensive than direct loans,  regardless of the actual lifetime cost to the government.", "FCRA was enacted with the intent of improving the accuracy of the cost  of federal credit programs reported in the budget by requiring agencies to  measure the government\u2019s net long-term cost of federal credit programs  to permit better cost comparisons both among credit programs and  between credit and noncredit programs. The policies enacted under  FCRA, sometimes referred to simply as credit reform, recognized that the  actual cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee is not captured by its cash  flows in any one year, but rather is the net present value\u2014worth in terms  of money paid immediately\u2014of its cash flows over the life of the loan.

The efforts to make reasonable subsidy cost estimates  begin with establishing and using reliable records of historical credit  performance data and taking into consideration current and forecasted  economic conditions. Agency management is responsible for  accumulating relevant, sufficient, and reliable data on which to base the  estimates. Further, according to the primary accounting standard for  direct loans and loan guarantees, subsidy cost estimates should be  based on a systematic methodology to project expected cash flows into  the future. To accomplish this task, an agency develops a cash flow  model, which is a mathematical model that generally uses historical  information and various assumptions related to future loan performance,  including loan repayments, prepayments, defaults, recoveries, and the  timing of these events. Such a cash flow model, which is based on sound  economic, financial, and statistical theory, identifies factors that affect  loan performance. In addition to using historical data, other relevant  factors may be considered by agencies when estimating future loan  performance. These factors may include (1) economic conditions that  may affect loan performance, (2) financial and other relevant  characteristics of borrowers, (3) the value of the collateral to loan  balance, (4) changes in recoverable value of collateral, and (5) newly  developed events that would affect loan performance.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Direct Student Loan Program). We  selected the Direct Student Loan Program and the MMI Fund because  these programs represented the largest federal direct loan and loan  guarantee programs, respectively. These two programs can be  characterized as a high volume of loans with relatively lower average loan  amounts compared to other federal credit programs. To include a different  type of credit program in our evaluation, we also selected the GSM-102  program, which can be characterized as a low volume of loans and  significantly larger average loan amounts.", "We met with CCC, FHA, and Education officials responsible for preparing  and approving subsidy cost estimates to discuss the subsidy cost  estimation process for the programs we selected.
