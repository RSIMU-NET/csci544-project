Subtitle D of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 allows Energy to help its contractor employees file state workers' compensation claims for illnesses determined by a panel of physicians to be caused by exposure to toxic substances in the course of employment at an Energy facility. Energy began accepting applications under this program in July 2001, but did not begin processing them until its final regulations became effective on September 13, 2002. The Congress mandated that GAO study the effectiveness of the benefit program under Subtitle D of this Act. This testimony is based on GAO's ongoing work on this issue and focuses on three key areas: (1) the number, status, and characteristics of claims filed with Energy; (2) the extent to which there will be a \"willing payer\" of workers' compensation benefits, that is, an insurer who--by order from, or agreement with, Energy--will not contest these claims; and (3) the extent to which Energy policies and procedures help employees file timely claims for these state benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of June 30, 2003, Energy had completely processed only about 6 percent of the nearly 19,000 cases it had received.

While the majority of cases (86 percent) associated with major Energy facilities in nine states potentially have a willing payer of workers' compensation benefits, actual compensation is not certain. This figure is based primarily on the method of workers' compensation coverage used by Energy contractor employers and is not an estimate of the number of cases that will ultimately be paid. Since no claimants to date have received compensation as a result of their cases filed with Energy, there is no actual experience about how contractors and state programs treat such claims. Claimants have been delayed in filing for state worker's compensation benefits because of two bottlenecks in Energy's claims process. First, the case development process has not always produced sufficient cases to allow the panels of physicians who determine whether the worker's illness was caused by exposure to toxic substances to operate at full capacity. While additional resources may allow Energy to move sufficient cases through its case development process, the physician panel process will continue to be a second, more important, bottleneck. The number of panels, constrained by the scarcity of physicians qualified to serve on panels, will limit Energy's capacity to decide cases more quickly, using its current procedures.

Congress mandated that we study this issue and  report to the Senate Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and  Appropriations and the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and  Appropriations.", "For the last several decades, the Department of Energy (Energy) and its  predecessor agencies and contractors have employed thousands of  individuals in secret and dangerous work in the nuclear weapons  production complex. Over the years, employees were unknowingly  exposed to toxic substances, including radioactive and hazardous  materials, and studies have shown that many of these employees  subsequently developed illnesses. The Energy Employees Occupational  Illness Compensation Program provides for compensation to these  employees who developed occupational illnesses and, where applicable, to  their survivors. Congressional Committees, as well as individual Members  of Congress, claimants, and advocates have raised concerns regarding  Energy\u2019s processing of claims and the availability of benefits once claims  have been decided.", "As title XXXVI of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2001, which was signed into law on October 30, 2000, this  legislation has two major components. Subtitle B provides eligible  workers who were exposed to radiation or other toxic substances and  who subsequently developed illnesses such as cancer and lung disease a  onetime payment of up to $150,000 and covers future medical expenses  related to the illness. The Department of Labor administers these benefits,  payable from a compensation fund established by the same legislation.  Subtitle D allows Energy to help its contractor employees file state  workers\u2019 compensation claims for illnesses determined by a panel of  physicians to be caused by exposure to toxic substances in the course of  employment at an Energy facility. The legislation did not set aside funding  for payment of benefits under Subtitle D.", "My testimony today reflects our ongoing review of the effectiveness of  Energy\u2019s implementation of Subtitle D. We focused our work on three key  areas: (1) the number, status, and characteristics of claims filed with  Energy; (2) the extent to which there will be a \u201cwilling payer\u201d of workers\u2019  compensation benefits; that is, an insurer who\u2014by order from, or  agreement with, Energy\u2014will not contest these claims; and (3) the extent  to which Energy policies and procedures help employees file timely claims  for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits.", "In summary, as of June 30, 2003, Energy had fully processed about 6  percent of the nearly 19,000 cases received, and more than three-quarters  of all cases were associated with facilities in nine states. Energy had not  begun processing over half of the cases received. While some other case  characteristics can be determined, such as illness claimed, systems  limitations prevent reporting on other case characteristics, such as the  reasons for ineligibility or basic demographics. While the majority of cases  (86 percent) associated with major Energy facilities in nine states potentially  have a willing payer of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, actual compensation  is not certain. In certain states such as Ohio and Iowa, there are likely to be  many cases that lack willing payers, and in some instances may be less  likely to receive compensation than a comparable case with a willing  payer in a different state. The 86 percent figure reflects the number of  cases for which contractors and their insurers are likely to not contest a  workers\u2019 compensation claim, rather than the number of cases that will  ultimately be paid. For all claimants, actual compensation is not certain  because of additional factors such as variations in state workers\u2019  compensation programs or contractors\u2019 uncertainty on how to compute  the benefit. Claims for workers\u2019 compensation have been delayed by two  bottlenecks in Energy\u2019s claims process. First, Energy\u2019s case development  process has not always produced sufficient cases to keep physician panels  operating at full capacity. While additional resources may allow Energy to  move a sufficient number of cases through its case development process,  the physician panel process will continue to be a second and more  important bottleneck.

In addition, we  conducted site visits to three Energy facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee,  the state with facilities accounting for the largest number of Subtitle D  claims.

In implementing EEOICPA, the President acknowledged that it  had been Energy\u2019s past policy to encourage and assist its contractors in  opposing workers\u2019 claims for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits based  on illnesses said to be caused by exposure to toxic substances at Energy  facilities. Under the new law, workers or their survivors could apply for  assistance from Energy in pursuing state workers\u2019 compensation benefits,  and if they received a positive determination from Energy, the agency  would direct its contractors to not contest the workers\u2019 compensation  claims or awards. Energy\u2019s rules to implement the new program became  effective in September 2002, and the agency began to process the  applications it had been accepting since July 2001, when the law took  effect.", "Energy\u2019s claims process has several steps, as shown in figure 1. First,  claimants file applications and provide all available medical evidence.  Energy then develops the claims by requesting records of employment,  medical treatment, and exposure to toxic substances from the Energy  facilities at which the workers were employed. If Energy determines that  the worker was not employed by one of its facilities or did not have an  illness that could be caused by exposure to toxic substances, the agency  finds the claimant ineligible. For all others, once development is complete,  a panel of three physicians reviews the case and decides whether  exposure to a toxic substance during employment at an Energy facility  was at least as likely as not to have caused, contributed to, or aggravated  the claimed medical condition. The panel physicians are appointed by the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) but paid by  Energy for this work. Claimants receiving positive determinations are  advised that they may wish to file claims for state workers\u2019 compensation  benefits. Claimants found ineligible or receiving negative determinations  may appeal to Energy\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals.", "Each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia has its own workers\u2019  compensation program to provide benefits to workers who are injured on  the job or contract a work-related illness. Benefits include medical  treatment and cash payments that partially replace lost wages.  Collectively, these state programs paid more than $46 billion in cash and  medical benefits in 2001. In general, employers finance workers\u2019  compensation programs. Depending on state law, employers finance these  programs through one of three methods: (1) they pay insurance premiums  to a private insurance carrier, (2) they contribute to a state workers\u2019  compensation fund, or (3) they set funds aside for this purpose as self- insurance. Although state workers\u2019 compensation laws were enacted in  part as an attempt to avoid litigation over workplace accidents, the  workers\u2019 compensation process is still generally adversarial, with  employers and their insurers tending to challenge aspects of claims that  they consider not valid.", "State workers\u2019 compensation programs vary as to the level of benefits,  length of payments, and time limits for filing. For example, in 1999, the  maximum weekly benefit for a total disability in New Mexico was less than  $400, while in Iowa it was approximately $950. In addition, in Idaho, the  weekly benefit for total disability would be reduced after 52 weeks, while  in Iowa benefits would continue at the original rate for the duration of the  disability. Further, in Tennessee, a claim must be filed within 1 year of the  beginning of incapacity or death. However, in Kentucky a claim must be  filed within 3 years of exposure to most substances, but within 20 years of  exposure to radiation or asbestos."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Has Fully Processed Few Cases, and Systems Limitations Complicate Program Management", "paragraphs": ["As of June 30, 2003, Energy had completely processed about 6 percent of  the nearly 19,000 cases that had been filed, and the majority of all cases  filed were associated with facilities in nine states.

While Energy officials report that during the  major systems changes that occurred in July 2003, fields were added to the  system to track appeals information, no information is yet available  regarding ineligibility decisions. In addition, basic demographic data such  as age and gender of claimants are not available. Gender information was  not collected for the majority of cases.

For example, Energy established a goal of completing  case development within 120 days of case assignment to a case manager.  However, the data system developed by contractors to aid in case  management was developed without detailed specifications from Energy  and did not originally collect sufficient information to track Energy\u2019s  progress in meeting this 120-day goal. Furthermore, status tracking has  been complicated by changes to the system and failure to consistently  update status as cases progress. While Energy reports that changes made  as of July 2003 should allow for improved tracking of case status, it is  unclear whether these changes will be applied retroactively to status data  already in the system.

It was necessary to assume that all cases filed would receive a positive  determination by a physician panel because sufficient data are not  available to project the outcomes of the physician panel process. More  specifically, there are indications that the few cases that have received  determinations from physician panels may not be representative of all  cases filed, and sufficient details on workers\u2019 medical conditions were not  available to enable us to independently judge the potential outcomes. In  addition, we assumed that all workers experienced a loss that was not  previously compensated because sufficient data were not available to  enable us to make more detailed projections on this issue.", "As shown in table 1, most of the contractors for the major facilities in  these states are self-insured, which enables Energy to direct them to not  contest claims that receive a positive medical determination. In addition,  the contractor in Colorado, which is not self-insured but has a commercial  policy, took the initiative to enter into an agreement with Energy to not  contest claims. The contractor viewed this action as being in its best  interest to help the program run smoothly. However, it is unclear whether  the arrangement will be effective because no cases in Colorado have yet  received compensation. In such situations where there is a willing payer,  the contractor\u2019s action to pay the compensation consistent with Energy\u2019s  order to not contest a claim will override state workers\u2019 compensation  provisions that might otherwise result in denial of a claim, such as failure  to file a claim within a specified period of time. However, since no  claimants to date have received compensation as a result of their cases  filed with Energy, there is no actual experience about how contractors and  state workers\u2019 compensation programs treat such cases.", "About 14 percent of cases in the nine states we analyzed may not have a  willing payer. Therefore, in some instances these cases may be less likely  to receive compensation than a comparable case for which there is a  willing payer, unless the claimant is able to overcome challenges to the  claim. Specifically, these cases that lack willing payers involve contractors  that (1) have a commercial insurance policy, (2) use a state fund to pay  workers\u2019 compensation claims, or (3) do not have a current contract with  Energy. In each of these situations, Energy maintains that it lacks the  authority to make or enforce an order to not contest claims. For instance,  an Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation official said that the state  would not automatically approve a case, but would evaluate each workers\u2019  compensation case carefully to ensure that it was valid and thereby  protect its state fund.", "Concerns about the extent to which there will be willing payers of benefits  have led to various proposals for addressing this issue. For example, the  state of Ohio proposed that Energy designate the state as a contractor to  provide a mechanism for reimbursing the state for paying the workers\u2019  compensation claims. However, Energy rejected this proposal on the  ground that EEOICPA does not authorize the agency to establish such an  arrangement. In a more wide-ranging proposal, legislation introduced in  this Congress proposes to establish Subtitle D as a federal program with  uniform benefits administered by the Department of Labor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Factors Make Compensation Not Certain", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to Subtitle B provisions that provide for a uniform federal  benefit that is not affected by the degree of disability, various factors may  affect whether a Subtitle D claimant is paid under the state workers\u2019  compensation program or how much compensation will be paid. Beyond  the differences in the state programs that may result in varying amounts  and length of payments, these factors include the demonstration of a loss  resulting from the illness and contractors\u2019 uncertainty on how to compute  compensation.", "Even with a positive determination from a physician panel and a willing  payer, claimants who cannot demonstrate a loss, such as loss of wages or  medical expenses, may not qualify for compensation. On the other hand,  claimants with positive determinations but not a willing payer may still  qualify for compensation under the state program if they show a loss and  can overcome all challenges to the claim raised by the employer or the  insurer.", "Contractors\u2019 uncertainty on how to compute compensation may also cause  variation in whether or how much a claimant will receive in compensation.  While contractors with self-insurance told us that they plan to comply with  Energy\u2019s directives to not contest cases with positive determinations,  some contractors were unclear about how to actually determine the  amount of compensation that a claimant will receive. For example, one  contractor raised a concern that no guidance exists to inform contractors  about whether they can negotiate the degree of disability, a factor that  could affect the amount of the workers\u2019 compensation benefit. Other  contractors will likely experience similar situations, as Energy has not  issued guidance on how to consistently compute compensation amounts.", "While not directly affecting compensation amounts, a related issue  involves how contractors will be reimbursed for claims they pay. Energy  uses several different types of contracts to carry out its mission, such as  operations or cleanup, and these different types of contracts affect how  workers\u2019 compensation claims will be paid. For example, a contractor  responsible for managing and operating an Energy facility was told to pay  the workers\u2019 compensation claims from its operating budget. The  contractor said that this procedure may compromise its ability to conduct  its primary responsibilities. On the other hand, a contractor cleaning up an  Energy facility was told by Energy officials that its workers\u2019 compensation  claims would be reimbursed under its contract, and therefore paying  claims would not affect its ability to perform cleanup of the site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bottlenecks in Energy\u2019s Claims Process Delay Filing of Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims", "paragraphs": ["As a result of Energy\u2019s policies and procedures for processing claims,  claimants have experienced lengthy delays in receiving the determinations  they need to file workers\u2019 compensation claims.

NIOSH has  indicated that the pool of physicians with the appropriate credentials and  experience (including those already appointed) may be limited to about  200. Even if Energy were able to increase the number of panel physicians  to 200, with each panel reviewing 3 cases a month, the panels would not  be able to review more than 200 cases in any 30-day period, given current  procedures.

For example, the agency is currently planning to establish  permanent physician panels in Washington, DC. Physicians who are  willing to serve full-time for a 2- or 3-week period would staff these panels.  In addition, the agency is considering reducing the number of physicians  serving on each panel\u2014for example, initially using one physician to review  a case, assigning a second physician only if the first reaches a negative  determination, and assigning a third physician if needed to break a tie.
