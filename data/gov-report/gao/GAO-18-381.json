To address these objectives, GAO selected four agencies with the largest burden hour estimates, reviewed the 50 ICRs with the largest burden hour estimates at each agency, with a focus on the 2 largest ICRs at each as case studies, and interviewed agency officials and OMB staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies GAO reviewed\u2014the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Transportation (DOT), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2014generally used existing data, such as historical data, to estimate the time, or \u201cburden hours,\u201d it takes for the public to complete an information collection request (ICR). IRS reported gathering original data on public burden through surveys of taxpayers to help estimate the burden for its two largest ICRs. When data were unavailable for one or more elements of the burden calculation (e.g., average time per response), agencies relied on professional judgment, informed in some instances by internal consultation with issue area experts.", "GAO found two limitations with the agencies' current approaches for estimating burden. First, 76 of 200 ICRs that GAO reviewed, including the 2 largest ICRs at IRS and DOT, did not translate burden hours into dollars, or estimated \u201crespondent time costs.\u201d Although the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies to include these costs, it reviewed and approved all 76 ICRs. ICRs that included respondent time costs did not consistently include fringe benefits, such as insurance contributions, in part because of a lack of clear guidance from OMB. Inconsistencies in estimating respondent time costs could lead to inconsistent implementation of new requirements under Executive Order 13771 that agencies offset the incremental costs of new regulations with reductions in regulatory burden, including paperwork burden, elsewhere.", "Second, while all agencies and OMB reported having independent review processes in place, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), GAO found instances where 3 of the 4 selected agencies\u2014USDA, HHS, and DOT\u2014did not detect math errors through these review processes or inconsistencies among estimates provided on Reginfo.gov, and in the more detailed ICR supporting statements. For example, GAO found that one ICR underestimated burden by as much as $270 million, and another overestimated burden time by more than 12 million hours. Agencies acknowledged they followed their review processes but not detect the errors and inconsistencies. OMB also did not detect the errors and inconsistencies in its review of the ICRs. Until agencies ensure that their review processes detect errors or inconsistencies, the public may have less confidence in agencies' ability to effectively manage and minimize burden.", "While the agencies solicited public comments through the Federal Register , as required by the PRA, IRS and DOT did not always provide the level of information in the notices (e.g., the frequency of the collection) needed to allow the public to evaluate the burden estimates. Also, agencies did not always consult with the public beyond these notices, as required under the PRA. Of the 200 ICRs GAO reviewed, 113 contained information in their supporting statements indicating public consultation beyond the Federal Register notices. Only 6 of these 113 indicated that public outreach was related to the burden hour estimates. OMB could help ensure that agencies consistently obtain public input by directing agencies to consult with the public beyond the Federal Register notices on each ICR, as required in the PRA. However, OMB continues to believe that additional consulting should occur only for ICRs where important information may be missed by the public notice and comment period.

By using the incorrect number of respondents when calculating burden  hours, the Agricultural Marketing Service overestimated the Mandatory  Country of Origin Labeling ICR\u2019s total burden by 171,444 hours.", "In addition, the agency did not consistently apply its stated assumptions  (e.g., about the average burden time per response) in the development of  respondent time cost estimates, resulting in underestimated costs  presented to the public, as shown in table 4. For instance, the ICR  contained two different maintenance recordkeeping costs: one described  in the narrative and another in the summary tables in the supporting  statement. Both underestimated recordkeeping costs. Our review found  that, had the agency\u2019s stated assumptions been consistently applied, the  actual cost estimate would have been approximately $463.2 million, or  $104.5 million higher than the largest maintenance recordkeeping cost  estimate in the supporting statement. According to Agricultural Marketing  Service officials, external pressure and accelerated timelines resulted in a less effective review of the ICR. Agency officials acknowledged that they  did not follow review processes or adequately review the supporting  statement.

For example, in a  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) ICR, we found that the  agency correctly stated its assumptions in the supporting statement but,  due to a math error that was not detected during the review process,  incorrectly calculated the respondent time cost in the second year of the  collection based on these assumptions. Because it did not detect this  error, HHS underestimated respondent time costs by approximately $14.4  million or about 40 percent of the published total respondent time costs in  the second year for that ICR, as shown in table 5.", "In another ICR, published in July 2013, CMS overestimated the public\u2019s  burden by approximately 12.8 million hours. Agency officials attributed  the discrepancy to two significant math errors. Officials said that these  math errors were resolved and the burden hours recalculated in a  subsequent renewal of the information collection in 2017. According to  HHS officials, ICRs go through multiple levels of review before HHS  approves the ICR. Program offices conduct an initial review of ICRs  before passing them on to the Office of the Chief Information Officer  (OCIO), which then conducts a final review of ICRs before final  submission to OMB, including a basic check of the math used in  calculating burden hours.", "Additionally, in 19 of the 50 HHS ICRs we reviewed, including HHS\u2019s  largest ICR and the two CMS examples above, we identified  discrepancies in reported burden hours between the supporting  statements and Reginfo.gov (see table 6). For the public to evaluate the  methodology used to develop the final burden estimate posted on  Reginfo.gov, the two sources need to be consistent. Reasons for such  discrepancies, according to HHS officials, included data entry errors,  estimate changes made in supporting statements that were not reflected  on Reginfo.gov, and calculation errors. We also found 14 instances where  HHS did not include an ICR supporting statement on Reginfo.gov. Based  on our findings, HHS examined the discrepancies in table 6, and in June  2018 reported that all of the issues that we identified had been corrected.  CMS said that in general most of the issues identified can be attributed to  human error due in part to staff shortages and tight ICR submission  timelines. CMS said that it takes the errors very seriously and will continue to work to refine its internal review processes to improve the  quality of its ICR submissions.", "HHS officials attributed some the discrepancies between the burden  estimates found in the supporting statements and the estimates found on  Reginfo.gov to instances when OMB works directly with program offices  within the department on revisions to a burden estimate without involving  OCIO. For example, according to HHS officials, in one instance shown in  table 6, the supporting statement reported an initial estimate of 30,708  burden hours. Later, the estimate was revised based on input that OMB  provided directly to the program office and was reported on Reginfo.gov  as 12,845,827 burden hours. OCIO was not aware that the change had  been made.

In the ICR\u2019s supporting statement,  DOT calculated its total annual burden hours by using an average burden  time per response of 170 seconds for one information collection activity.  However, DOT did not include 30 seconds for one of the inspection tasks  that was stated in the calculation\u2019s assumptions found in the supporting  statement. Officials said that this error may have been an inadvertent  miscalculation and identified 200 seconds as the accurate average  burden time per response. As a result, DOT underestimated the ICR\u2019s  total annual burden by approximately 450,000 hours, nearly 4 percent of  the reported total annual burden hours for the ICR (see table 7).", "As part of its review process, DOT uses a checklist for reviewing ICRs,  which includes checking the math for burden hours and costs in  supporting statements. An official acknowledged that, while DOT follows  its review process, the agency missed this calculation error at multiple  steps. The official said that the information collection had been active for  a long period of time and that not detecting the error was not material in  terms of PRA compliance. However, this example illustrates that a small  error of 30 seconds per response can have a large impact on the overall  burden hour and cost estimate. The DOT official said that it will correct  the error in a revised ICR.", "In the examples above, both OMB and agencies reviewed and approved  the ICRs\u2014including some of the largest ICRs at each of the agencies\u2014 but did not detect or address the math errors in the supporting  statements, inconsistencies between published estimates in supporting  statements and Reginfo.gov, or missing supporting statements during the  review process, allowing incorrect burden hour and cost estimates to be  publicly released. The PRA requires OMB to provide directions and  oversee the review and approval of collections of information and the  reduction of the information collection burden. OMB reviews the ICRs to  ensure they are consistent with applicable laws and policies related to  information quality. According to OMB officials, OMB desk officers check  the burden calculations for consistency and reasonableness. The desk  officers also check that the estimates are properly and consistently  calculated. This includes reviewing the burden calculations to ensure that  they are mathematically accurate. When we asked OMB officials about  the ICRs cited in this report where we detected mathematical errors, they  told us that they will review these ICRs to determine what response is  needed.", "Until agencies ensure that their review processes adequately detect  errors and inconsistencies, the agencies cannot ensure that their burden  estimates are reliable, may result in less confidence in agencies\u2019 ability to  accurately compute and report burden and as such, less confidence in  agencies\u2019 ability to effectively manage and minimize the burden they  impose on the public. According to the Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, management should periodically review  policies, procedures, and related control activities for continued relevance  and effectiveness in achieving the entity\u2019s objectives. Therefore, if  agencies\u2019 review processes do not detect errors or inconsistencies in  supporting documents, then the public may have inaccurate or incomplete  information on the burden imposed by an information collection.  Additionally, without reliable burden estimates and complete information,  Congress and the administration cannot ensure that agencies\u2019 efforts to  reduce burden to comply with Executive Order 13771 are effective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies We Reviewed Conducted Varying Levels of Public Consultation and Received Little Input on Burden Estimates", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Conducted Public Outreach, but Public Notices Received Few Comments and Did Not Always Contain Needed Information to Evaluate Burden Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Agencies met the PRA requirement to post Federal Register notices and  solicit public comments for all 200 information collections that we  reviewed.

Table 8 shows that while 35 of the 161 ICRs received  comments (including 3 of the top 8 case study ICRs), only 10 received  comments that were related to the burden estimates (including only one  case study ICR), according to the ICR supporting statement and related  documents.", "Based on our review of these 10 comments, 2 comments resulted in  increases to agencies\u2019 burden estimates while another 5 resulted in no  burden estimate change, but allowed the agency to further explain the  basis for its estimates, and provided increased transparency for the  public. For example, as a result of feedback from a trade association, USDA revised its burden hour estimate for a particular component of the  National Organic Program ICR from 1 hour to 10 hours. The trade  association said it would take 10 to 60 hours to develop a label and get it  approved. Because this estimate was not based on a formal survey,  USDA did not use the upper range provided by the commenter but did  acknowledge that it may have underestimated the burden, according to  the ICR supporting statement. In the other example, DOT officials revised  the overall burden for an ICR on drivers\u2019 medical certificates from 9.8  million hours to 10.2 million hours based on a comment that called to their  attention an incorrect assumption about the collection\u2019s frequency. The  agencies also made more transparent the specific sources used to  determine the burden estimates for five of the ICRs in response to public  comments. For example, one comment prompted HHS to provide  additional details on the components of the burden hour estimate for the  ICR and identify the relevant source data.", "Officials at DOT and HHS said that, in some cases, they rely on public  input in response to the 60-day Federal Register notices to validate their  burden estimates, and if they do not receive any comments, they do not  make any changes to the ICRs. For example, according to DOT officials,  FMCSA relies on public comments to suggest revisions to ICRs that are  up for renewal. In cases where no one has submitted any comments on  the burden estimate, DOT officials reported that they assume the burden  hour estimate per respondent is accurate and do not change the  estimate.", "Despite the value of public input, agencies\u2019 Federal Register notices did  not always contain a complete description of the elements that make up  the burden estimates. As a result, the public may not have had enough  information to comment on the reasonableness of the estimates. PRA  and OMB regulations require that agencies solicit comments from the  public both in the Federal Register and through other means, in part to  evaluate the accuracy of the agency\u2019s burden estimate, including the  validity of the methodology and assumptions used to calculate the  burden. Generally, three basic elements of the burden estimate formula in  the Federal Register notices provide the public with sufficient information  to review the burden estimates. As previously stated, these elements are:  (1) the number of respondents, (2) the frequency of response, and (3) the  average burden time per response. However, agencies do not  consistently include all of these elements in the Federal Register notices.", "Figures 4 and 5 show two examples of 60-day Federal Register notices in  which agencies provided varying levels of detail on the burden hour  estimates. In figure 5, USDA has provided burden information in its SNAP  information collection by using tables and a summary that provides the  estimated number of respondents, the frequency of response (i.e.,  number of responses per respondent), and the average burden time per  response. In addition to providing data on these three elements, USDA  grouped burden estimates by activity and type of respondent. This made  it possible for the public to be able to review and comment on the specific  assumptions used to develop the estimated hours per response. In  particular, the notice shows burden data for time spent on the application,  recertification application, reports, and notices for both state agencies and  households.", "Conversely, figure 5 shows an example where IRS has only provided the  estimated total annual burden hours for the ICR without providing any of  the elements used to calculate the estimated burden hours\u2014the  frequency of the information collection, the number of respondents, and  the average burden time per response.", "A member of the public is more likely to be able to meaningfully comment  on the average burden time per response (e.g., 19 minutes for a  household to complete the initial SNAP application, as shown in figure 4)  than an aggregate estimate (e.g., 284,599 total burden hours to complete  a form used to report and summarize income from rents, royalties,  partnerships, and other sources, as shown in figure 5).", "In 9 of the 10 instances in which USDA, HHS, and DOT received  comments related to the burden estimates, the 60-day notices contained  either all of these required elements or sufficient information to be able to  calculate all of these elements. Agencies that do not consistently  include these basic elements of the burden estimate reduce the likelihood  that the public will be able to provide meaningful input to improve the  accuracy of their burden estimates. For the two ICRs that resulted in a  change in the burden estimate, USDA and DOT included detailed  information for the burden time per response in their respective 60-day  notices, which allowed the public to comment on these estimates.", "As shown in table 9, of the 200 ICRs that we reviewed, 25 did not contain  enough information to allow the public to reasonably determine the  frequency of response, number of respondents, or average burden time  per response: 13 at IRS, 11 at DOT, and 1 at HHS. In general, if  agencies do not provide sufficient data for the elements needed to  evaluate burden estimates, they may not benefit from receiving well- informed comments to ensure more reliable estimates, or to provide an  opportunity for greater transparency concerning their rationale for existing  burden estimates.", "Our analysis found that 13 IRS ICRs (none of which were case study  ICRs) did not have enough information on the frequency of the collection  to allow the public to reasonably review the burden estimate and thereby  provide meaningful input. IRS officials said that they did not always  include data on the frequency of the collection because it might cause  confusion for those instances where only a portion of the respondent  population will respond to the collection more than once in a given year.  Instead, IRS officials noted that their current policy is to include the  estimated number of respondents, the estimated time per response, and  the estimated total burden hours in each Federal Register notice for ICRs.", "In early 2017, IRS established a new position to review ICRs and ensure  that the agency\u2019s PRA policies are properly implemented. According to  IRS, this has helped to ensure that IRS includes estimated number of  respondents, the estimated time per response, and the estimated total  burden hours in each Federal Register notice.

According to the DOT official, in  response to our findings, DOT\u2019s Office of General Counsel is conducting  an education campaign to reinforce the necessity of providing fully  transparent information regarding ICR burden during all stages of the  notice process.", "In addition, DOT did not always include the average burden time per  response in its Federal Register notices, in part because DOT\u2019s templates  do not direct officials to provide this information. A DOT official said that  the templates presume that the individual reading the notice will have  sufficient information to calculate this element. However, we found that  average burden time per response could not reasonably be calculated  using the other information provided in 10 of the notices that we reviewed  in part because one or more other elements of the burden estimate were  missing.

While the PRA requires consultation on every  ICR, OMB guidance only recommends public consultation in general but  does not direct agencies to consult beyond the publication of the notices.  When they did consult with the public, agencies did not always use these  consultations as an opportunity to explicitly ask about burden hour  estimates. Of the 200 information collections we reviewed, 113  contained information in their supporting statements indicating that the  agencies performed public consultations beyond the Federal Register  notices (see table 10). Only 3 of the 8 case study ICRs that we reviewed  indicated that the agencies performed public consultations beyond the  Federal Register notices.", "In the 50 ICRs we reviewed, DOT provided information about public  consultation in about one-quarter of its ICR supporting statements. A  DOT official stated that DOT generally conducts outreach through the  rulemaking process through discussions with stakeholders about the  activities and fundamentals of the rule. Through this outreach process,  rather than speaking explicitly about estimated burden hours, DOT and  stakeholders discuss what the regulations require and whether those  requirements are burdensome. According to the official, stakeholders will  tell OMB if the burden estimate is incorrect. But DOT generally does not  conduct additional outreach about burden estimates during ICR renewals,  which occur at least every 3 years. HHS also provided information about  public consultation in about one-third of its ICRs.", "Agencies\u2019 public consultation beyond the publication of Federal Register  notices include federal advisory committee meetings, board meetings,  webinars, and periodic stakeholder meetings. In addition, the outreach  targeted a wide range of stakeholders, including associations, individuals  subject to the information collection, and industry representatives.", "OMB\u2019s guidance directs agencies to include descriptions in ICR  supporting statements of efforts to consult with the public about  information collection burden. However, only 6 of these 113 ICR  supporting statements\u20144 at USDA and 2 at DOT\u2014indicated that public  outreach was related to the burden hour estimates, despite OMB\u2019s  guidance. Agencies generally did not use public consultation beyond the  publication of Federal Register notices to seek input on burden estimates.  For example, USDA officials said that the Agricultural Marketing Service  engages industry on a regular basis through meetings and seminars, but  that it does not explicitly ask for feedback on the ICR burden hour or cost  estimates and assume that industry representatives will raise any existing  issues with the ICRs at these meetings.", "At HHS, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) officials stated that there are  instances where they receive feedback during conferences or through  communications initiated by the public or members of Congress.  However, OCR officials let people bring up the subject of the accuracy of  OCR\u2019s burden hour estimates on their own. At DOT, for five of the six  Federal Railroad Administration ICRs we reviewed that involved  consultation with the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee, the supporting  statements do not show evidence of discussions of the ICRs\u2019 burden  estimates during committee meetings, and the agency did not reference  any comments on these estimates or summarize them in the supporting  statements. At IRS, 40 of the 43 IRS ICR supporting statements that  identified public consultation specifically highlighted periodic meetings to  discuss tax laws and tax forms with representatives of professional  associations in the fields of law and accounting. IRS officials said that  they do not specifically raise the issue of burden hour estimates during  these meetings, but only ask stakeholders for general comments.", "The lack of public consultation beyond Federal Register notices is due, in  part, to a lack of guidance from OMB. In 2005, we recommended that  OMB alter its current guidance to all federal agencies to direct agencies  to consult with potential respondents beyond the publication of Federal  Register notices. OMB disagreed with this recommendation, stating that  it interprets publication in the Federal Register as the principal means of  agency consultation with the public, with PRA notices on forms providing  an opportunity for further public input. OMB staff told us in January 2018  that they still hold this view. Specifically, OMB staff said that additional  consulting should occur for those ICRs where important information may  be missed by the notice and comment period. In a June 2018  conversation, OMB staff acknowledged that public consultation could be  particularly beneficial the first time that an ICR is renewed after the initial  approval. At that point, the public will have had its first experiences  responding to the information collection, which can inform its feedback to  agencies. However, given the different types of changes that can occur  over time that could affect burden estimates\u2014such as changes in  technology, the economy, and the original source data used to generate  burden estimates\u2014we continue to believe that it is important to actively  consult with the public on each renewal, particularly given the low level of  response that agencies receive in response to Federal Register notices  for ICR renewals.", "In our 2005 report, agencies also expressed concerns that consultation  for every ICR would not be a good use of agency resources. Officials  stated that the greatest opportunity is at the rulemaking stage. However,  as previously discussed, agencies have existing public outreach efforts  whose broader use would not require significant additional time and  resources. Without leveraging opportunities to engage in direct public  consultation with the public for every ICR, agencies may miss  opportunities to obtain additional comments on ICRs, which some  agencies stated they rely on to check the accuracy of their estimates and  in two cases have resulted in significant revisions. Further, emphasizing  those elements of the burden estimate where quality data are limited and  stakeholder experiences are most relevant (e.g., the time per response)  could help agencies focus outreach on the most pertinent information.", "We maintain that the PRA requirement regarding public consultation in  addition to the 60-day Federal Register notice is clear: both requirements  are introduced together, with no distinction between them: agencies shall  \u201cprovide 60-day notice in the Federal Register, and otherwise consult with  members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed  collection.\u201d Based on our review of the four agencies, we believe that  such consultation can be completed in an efficient and effective  consultation manner using many of the outreach mechanisms currently in  place.

This  information is essential for agencies to appropriately balance the burden  of these information collections with their public benefit and for properly  measuring progress toward applicable burden reduction goals. The PRA  provides two mechanisms to help ensure the quality of these estimates: a  multi-layered independent review process and mandatory public  consultation requirements. However, the errors, omissions, and other  discrepancies that we found in agencies\u2019 ICRs indicate these  mechanisms are not operating as effectively as they could be.", "Independent review processes are only able to ensure an accurate and  reliable estimate when agencies and OMB use them consistently to  detect errors and correct them. However, we found that USDA, HHS, and  DOT failed to adequately apply their own review processes, resulting  errors and discrepancies between the supporting statement and  Reginfo.gov. Similarly, OMB approved ICRs containing mathematical  errors in the supporting statements and inconsistencies between the  supporting statements and Reginfo.gov. If the agencies\u2019 and OMB\u2019s  review processes do not detect mathematical errors and inconsistencies,  then Congress and the public may have inaccurate or incomplete  information on the estimated burden imposed by an information collection  may result in less confidence in agencies\u2019 abilities to accurately compute  and report the burden and as such, less confidence in agencies\u2019 ability to  effectively manage and minimize the burden they impose on the public.", "As part of its review process, OMB also reviews ICRs for compliance with  PRA and applicable regulations, and policies. However, OMB approved  numerous ICRs without the required respondent time cost information. If  OMB does not take action to ensure that agencies consistently follow its  guidance to include respondent time costs, agencies will likely continue to  and omit this information. In addition, OMB\u2019s current formal guidance  does not offer specific instructions on when and how to include fringe  benefits like paid leave and retirement contributions in respondent time  costs. Without clear guidance, agencies may continue to inconsistently  estimate respondent time costs, which could potentially result in  underestimated time costs at some agencies as well as inconsistent  implementation of efforts to reduce regulatory burden.", "Public input, when available, often resulted in improvements in the quality  of agencies\u2019 burden estimates. However, the four agencies are missing  opportunities to improve the quality of their estimates by not better  leveraging existing public outreach efforts. While Federal Register notices  provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the burden  estimates, we found that DOT and IRS did not always provide sufficient  information in their notices on the methodologies used to calculate the  burden to allow the public to meaningfully comment on agencies\u2019 burden  estimates.", "At the same time, given the few comments that agencies receive in  response to these notices, it is clear that Federal Register notices alone  are not sufficient. We found that agencies are already actively engaging  with stakeholders through a number of means, including federal advisory  committee meetings, periodic stakeholder meetings, and webinars, but  are not fully using these opportunities to explicitly seek input on their  burden estimates.

IRS plans  to transition additional information collections to this more rigorous  approach in the coming years. This could improve the quality of burden  hour estimates and provide the cost estimates that IRS is currently  lacking for other collections.

In  addition, we interviewed OMB staff to obtain information about its role in  reviewing ICRs submitted by agencies, as well as its relationship with the  selected agencies.", "To assess the reliability of Reginfo.gov data on burden hours and  annualized costs for each ICR, we interviewed OMB staff and reviewed  documentation of the Reginfo.gov website and the Regulatory Information  Service Center/Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Consolidated  Information System (ROCIS), which is the system that agencies use to  track information collection requests and that underlies information  provided on Reginfo.gov. We compared the data from Reginfo.gov with  the data found in the supporting statements. We interviewed agency  officials and OMB staff about the discrepancies between these two  information sources. We found that the Reginfo.gov data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of selecting the case study agencies and ICRs  subject to our review.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to July 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Thomas J.
