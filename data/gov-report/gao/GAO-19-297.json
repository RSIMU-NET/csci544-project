ICE is responsible for managing SEVP, which certifies schools to enroll foreign students. Various ICE offices have a role in preventing, detecting, and responding to potential fraud in the program. GAO was asked to review potential vulnerabilities to fraud in SEVP. GAO examined, among other things, the extent to which ICE (1) implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and recertification processes and (2) implemented fraud risk controls related to DSO training.", "GAO analyzed ICE policies and documentation, including fraud risk guidance and procedures for school certification and recertification; analyzed 2013 through 2017 recertification data; and interviewed officials from five ICE field offices that GAO selected based on their experience investigating program fraud. GAO also interviewed officials from 17 selected schools located near these ICE field offices. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in November 2018. Information that DHS deemed sensitive has been omitted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has identified several fraud risks to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). As shown in the figure below, these include risks associated with school owners and designated school officials (DSO) who help ICE oversee students in the program. These fraud risks may occur as schools apply to become SEVP-certified, accept foreign students, and apply for recertification every 2 years.", "ICE has implemented controls to address fraud risks related to school certification, but long-standing delays in recertifying these schools exacerbate fraud risks. By statute and regulation, ICE must conduct recertification reviews every 2 years to ensure that schools continue to meet program requirements\u2014an important fraud risk control. Between 2013 and 2017, ICE recertified about 12,900 schools. However, according to ICE officials, they have been unable to meet the 2-year time frame and, as of June 2018, had 3,281 recertification petitions waiting for review. To help manage its queue, ICE has lengthened the period between recertification reviews by extending schools' certification expiration dates by 180 days, which is inconsistent with its regulation and may allow fraudulent schools to operate longer without detection. Although ICE is taking steps to increase resources for recertification, it is unclear whether these steps will ensure recertification is conducted consistently with ICE regulations.", "ICE relies on DSOs to, among other things, update and maintain foreign-student data in ICE's foreign-student information system and report suspected fraud to ICE. However, ICE does not provide DSOs with training that addresses fraud risks to the program. In June 2018, ICE officials stated that they plan to develop this fraud training for DSOs, but do not have documented plans or timelines for when it would be completed. By developing these plans, the agency would be better positioned to ensure that DSOs receive the training needed to address potential fraud in the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that ICE (1) notify schools 180 days prior to the 2-year certification expiration date, as required, and evaluate whether additional resources for recertification are needed, and (2) develop a plan to implement fraud-specific training for DSOs. ICE concurred with all of GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As of March 2018, more than 1.2 million foreign students in the United  States were enrolled in 8,744 schools approved to participate in the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Student and Exchange Visitor  Program (SEVP). DHS\u2019s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) is responsible for managing SEVP, which certifies schools  authorized to enroll foreign students in academic and vocational  programs, and oversees such schools and students. We previously  reported that foreign students bring needed skills to an increasingly  knowledge-based economy and make other valuable contributions to  society, but have also reported on fraud risks posed by SEVP-certified  schools and foreign students in the United States.", "In our 2011 and 2012 reports on student visas, we identified instances in  which fraudulent schools exploited the U.S. immigration system by  knowingly reporting to SEVP that foreign students were fulfilling their  immigration status requirements, such as maintaining a full course load,  when they were not attending school or were attending intermittently. In  addition, we reported that terrorist attacks in the United States have  pointed to the need for close monitoring and oversight of foreign  students. For example, one of the September 11, 2001, terrorists  entered the country on a student visa and subsequently attended flight  schools. We also found that ICE had not developed a process to identify  and analyze program risks. Further, we found that ICE did not  consistently implement internal controls to verify schools\u2019 legitimacy and  eligibility, such as independently verifying state licensure and  accreditation documentation, during initial SEVP certification and once  schools begin accepting foreign students. In our 2012 report, we  recommended that ICE take actions to improve the identification and  assessment of risks in SEVP and to consistently implement procedures  for ensuring schools meet the criteria for SEVP certification, among other  things. ICE concurred with the recommendations and, in response, took  action to address them, such as by developing and institutionalizing a  risk-management process and improving controls over the program.  Appendix I presents additional details on the recommendations in our  2012 report and actions taken by ICE to address those recommendations.", "SEVP and the Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU),  within ICE, have a role in preventing, detecting, and responding to  potential fraud in SEVP. Regarding certified schools, SEVP develops  and implements controls to monitor school compliance with the program,  including controls designed to prevent and detect potential fraud; provides  support to the schools; and conducts reviews to assess schools\u2019  continued eligibility to enroll foreign students. In addition, SEVP is  responsible for the oversight of foreign students while they are in the  United States to ensure that they comply with the terms of their admission  into the country. SEVP does so, in part, by approving individuals  nominated by their employing schools to serve as Designated School  Officials (DSO). DSOs are responsible for entering and maintaining  students\u2019 complete information in a timely manner, such as by entering  information on courses of study and attendance in ICE\u2019s Student and  Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). In addition, CTCEU is  responsible for, among other things, combating the criminal exploitation of  the foreign-student visa system, including through coordination with  SEVP. In this role, CTCEU tracks, coordinates, and oversees criminal  investigations in response to potential cases of fraud in the program.", "You asked us to review potential vulnerabilities to fraud in SEVP. This  report examines efforts that ICE has taken since our 2012 report to  address fraud risks. Specifically, we examine the extent to which ICE has  taken steps to strengthen its management of fraud risks in SEVP,  implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification  and recertification processes, and  implemented fraud risk controls related to the eligibility, suitability, and  training of DSOs.", "This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on  November 20, 2018, which included sensitive information related to SEVP  internal controls used to help prevent and identify noncompliance or fraud  in the program.

Specifically, we  assessed ICE\u2019s standard operating procedures, adjudicator guidance,  training materials, and other guidance to determine whether the  certification and recertification controls described in these documents  addressed the high-risk indicators ICE has identified. We also compared  ICE\u2019s controls in these areas to GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government (Federal Internal Control Standards) related to  risk management, as well as principles of the Fraud Risk Framework.", "We also conducted covert testing of SEVP\u2019s internal control activities  related to the school certification process. Specifically, we submitted  certification petitions and conducted other covert investigative work for  three fictitious schools and petitioned to obtain SEVP certification. For the  first school, among other things, we submitted incomplete documentation  to SEVP. For the second school, among other things, we submitted  complete documentation, but we did not schedule a site visit as directed  by SEVP. Site visits are visits to the petitioning school by SEVP staff to,  among other things, interview school officials and review the facilities. For  our third school, among other things, we completed the petition for  certification and submitted it to SEVP, and participated in a site visit with  SEVP officials using a rented space as a fictitious school location. For all  three petitions, we used publicly available information to construct our  scenarios. We also used publicly available hardware, software, and  materials to produce counterfeit or fictitious documents, which we  submitted, as appropriate for our testing. We then documented any  actions taken by SEVP on the submitted petitions, such as requests to  provide additional supporting documentation, among other potential  actions. Results for all three covert tests, while illustrative, cannot be  generalized to the full population of petitioners.", "To determine the extent to which ICE has implemented fraud risk controls  related to the eligibility, suitability, and training of DSOs, we analyzed  documentation on DSO eligibility, current and planned DSO background  checks, and DSO roles and requirements, including training. We  assessed the implementation of these controls against criteria in Federal  Internal Control Standards and the Fraud Risk Framework. Also, we  reviewed documentation on the current and planned DSO background  checks, including existing procedures for DSO vetting and initial  requirements and a draft policy for future enhancements to such checks.  We compared these documents to leading practices for project planning  in the Project Management Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management  Body of Knowledge.

We also interviewed ICE\u2019s  Homeland Security Investigations Special Agents (ICE agents) from  headquarters and 5 of ICE\u2019s 26 field offices, a process that allowed us to  obtain their perspectives on fraud risks in the program. We selected  these offices based on their experience in investigating previous cases of  school or student-related fraud, among other considerations. In addition,  we interviewed eight SEVP field representatives whose areas of  responsibility include California, New Jersey, and New York to gather  information on representatives\u2019 roles and activities identifying and  reporting potential school and student-related fraud or noncompliance.  We selected these representatives based on their proximity to the ICE  field offices we visited.", "As part of our site visits, we also interviewed DSOs at 17 SEVP-certified  schools on their roles, responsibilities, and training. We selected these  officials because, as of September 2017, they represented a group of  officials from SEVP-certified schools of various types and sizes and were  located in proximity to our selected ICE field-office locations. As we did  not select a probability sample of ICE field offices, field representatives,  or DSOs to interview, the information from these individuals cannot be  generalized but provided us with useful insights into previous cases of  known or suspected fraud or noncompliance and the role of both the field  representatives and the DSOs.

For example, in 2014, ICE  began developing an SEVP Risk Assessment Model and Framework,  which provides an overview of how SEVP identifies, assesses, responds  to, and reports on identified internal and external risks to the program.  Specifically, SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework\u2014which  was updated several times between 2014 and 2017\u2014discusses  categories of fraud risks to the program, including fraud associated with  schools, DSOs, and students. Moreover, in 2014, ICE developed a Risk  Assessment Tool for SEVP that uses data from SEVIS records to identify  potential fraud and other noncompliance issues among certified schools.  The tool prioritizes different risk indicators\u2014such as the proportion of the  school that consists of foreign students\u2014and ranks schools by risk level.  SEVP officials stated that schools identified as high risk receive additional  administrative review by the Compliance Unit. According to SEVP officials  and documentation we reviewed, ICE has continued to update and refine  the tool since 2014 to improve its effectiveness in helping to identify  program risks, including fraud risks.", "Through these and its oversight efforts, ICE has identified various fraud  risks in SEVP; such risks may take various forms, including immigration  benefit fraud, which involves the willful or knowing misrepresentation of  material facts for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit, such as  a nonimmigrant student status, without lawful entitlement. According to  ICE documentation we reviewed and officials we spoke to, the fraud risks  to the program generally fall into four broad categories: schools, students,  DSOs, and third-party brokers, who are individuals engaged in the fee- or  commission-based recruitment of foreign students, among other activities.  Figure 3 illustrates the types of fraud that may occur in these four  categories during different stages of a certified school\u2019s involvement in  the program, as we identified in ICE documentation and through our  interviews with ICE officials.", "For specific examples of fraud risks that ICE has identified in SEVP, see  figure 4.", "ICE has also taken steps since 2012 to strengthen its fraud risk- management efforts in response to our prior recommendations. For  example, in our 2012 report on SEVP risks, we found that, among other  things, ICE did not have a process to assess risks in SEVP and did not  consistently implement existing internal controls for determining school  eligibility. To address this and other findings, we made eight  recommendations to enhance ICE\u2019s ability to assess program risks,  prevent and detect school certification fraud, and improve the controls  over SEVP. ICE took action that addressed these eight recommendations  and has developed various tools designed to strengthen its fraud risk- management efforts (see app. I).", "Further, ICE has taken steps to improve collaboration and coordination to  enhance fraud risk management between SEVP and CTCEU, the unit  within ICE responsible for managing criminal investigations. More  specifically, ICE has embedded agents within SEVP\u2019s Compliance Unit,  and these agents help provide law-enforcement expertise within the unit  and act as liaisons with ICE agents located in the field to provide  information and support ongoing criminal investigations. According to a  senior ICE official with CTCEU, the embedded agents have helped  streamline processes and provide expertise to aid administrative and  investigative efforts. Figure 5 shows the process for coordination between  CTCEU and SEVP.", "Further, ICE officials with CTCEU stated they have acquired specialized  software tools to manage fraud tips and to conduct open-source and  related research on certified schools suspected of acting fraudulently. To  help identify and prioritize leads, ICE officials stated that they use a  software tool to efficiently help review and prioritize tips received through  ICE\u2019s tip line, which gathers tips from the general public on suspicious or  potential criminal activity. To aid investigations of schools, ICE explored  the use of another specialized software to aid the review of online social  media associated with schools or individuals, among other things.", "In addition, changes to SEVIS have aided ICE\u2019s efforts to manage fraud  risks in the program. In 2008, ICE initiated an effort to modernize SEVIS  to address identified system vulnerabilities, such as the inability to  capture detailed school data that would allow the detection of patterns  and anomalies that could indicate fraud. Although SEVIS modernization is  not yet complete, changes made in the system have helped to improve  system usability and the ability to identify suspected fraud in the program,  according to program officials. For example, system edit checks  implemented in 2015 and 2016 to verify user-entered names and  addresses have enhanced data quality by helping to identify and prevent  likely data-entry errors. SEVP officials also stated that improved data  quality can help make it easier to distinguish potential fraud from  unintentional data-entry errors. ICE officials we spoke to and related  documentation we reviewed stated that SEVIS modernization efforts may  include additional functionality, such as the ability to create person-centric  records for each student."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICE Does Not Have Some Components of a Fraud Risk Profile Needed to Fully Assess and Manage Fraud Risks", "paragraphs": ["Although ICE has developed a Risk Assessment Model and Framework  and taken other action to improve fraud risk management in SEVP, ICE  has not fully developed and implemented a \u201cfraud risk profile\u201d that would  help guide its efforts. According to our Fraud Risk Framework, an  effective antifraud entity tailors the approach for carrying out fraud risk  assessments to its programs. This approach allows an agency to,  among other things, develop a fraud risk profile that  identifies the inherent fraud risks affecting the program, assesses the likelihood and effect of each type of fraud risk that the determines the agency\u2019s tolerance for certain types or levels of fraud  risks in the program, examines the suitability of existing controls for each fraud risk, and documents the program\u2019s fraud risk profile.", "Effective managers of fraud risks use this profile to help decide how to  allocate resources to respond to fraud risks. Further, Federal Internal  Control Standards require managers to respond to identified risks.  Appendix III provides additional information on the key elements in the  fraud risk-assessment process including the development of a fraud risk  profile.", "Our assessment of SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework  found that while it describes the program\u2019s approach for managing fraud  risks, it does not include all of the key elements of a fraud risk profile:", "First, SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework identifies three  broad categories of inherent fraud risks that affect the program (those  posed by schools, DSOs, and students), but does not include all risks  that the program or its stakeholders have identified, such as the risk of  third-party brokers. As noted previously, ICE agents and program  officials identified brokers as a risk to the program because brokers  have helped facilitate school and student fraud and misused or stolen  student funds in the past. However, according to ICE officials with  SEVP, SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework was not  designed to define all of the risks posed to SEVP.", "Second, while SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework  assesses the potential effect of its risk posed by students, schools,  and DSOs, it does not discuss the likelihood of the risk\u2019s occurrence.  For example, the Risk Assessment Model and Framework contains a  narrative outlining the potential negative consequences of each of the  three broad risk categories but does not address the likelihood of  those risks occurring. According to SEVP officials, SEVP\u2019s Risk  Register helps identify and determine the likelihood of identified  program risks. However, our review of the Risk Register found that it  is used to track program-wide risks and does not identify or discuss  specific fraud risks. Further, these officials stated that many of the  components in a fraud risk profile are included in SEVP\u2019s Risk  Assessment Tool, but this tool was developed to prioritize the review  of SEVP-certified schools that have potential compliance issues and  was not designed to address all SEVP fraud risks such as the risks  posed by students or brokers. Using information on the likelihood of  risk occurrence can help managers decide how to allocate resources.  For example, managers can use this information to make decisions to  allocate resources to addressing fraud risks that are most likely to  occur or have relatively high impact.", "Third, SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework does not  assess the agency\u2019s tolerance for all fraud risks to the program. For  example, while SEVP officials stated that students represent a  significant risk to the program, they have not fully assessed the extent  of risks associated with student fraud or the agencies\u2019 tolerance for it.  In October 2017, the SEVP Director stated that SEVP was just  beginning to get a better understanding of student risks, but had not  done an assessment of their likelihood and tolerance. However, SEVP  officials acknowledged the importance of fully assessing student risks  because of the challenges that can be associated with detecting,  preventing, and responding to student fraud.", "Fourth, SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Model and Framework does not  examine the suitability of existing fraud controls or prioritize all  residual risks that remain after inherent risks have been mitigated by  existing control activities. We found that, while the Risk Assessment  Model and Framework discusses different internal controls and tools  used to prioritize and address risks in the school certification and  recertification process, such as the Risk Assessment Tool, it does not  explicitly identify any internal controls or tools used to prioritize or  address student risks. In addition, the Risk Assessment Model and  Framework does not identify and prioritize residual fraud risks that  ICE has flagged as being vulnerabilities to the program. According to  ICE agents in four field offices and officials in the Compliance Unit,  limitations to SEVP\u2019s ability to prevent some schools that present  fraud risks from obtaining certification or continuing to participate in  the program after fraud risks have been identified represent residual  risks to the program. For example, officials in the Compliance Unit  stated that certified schools that have been accredited through an  accrediting body recognized by the Department of Education  generally represent a lower fraud risk, but ICE has still experienced  noncompliance and cases of fraud with these schools. At one point  several fraud cases were tied to the same accrediting body. In  another example of a potential residual risk to the program, ICE field  agents stated that potentially fraudulent schools may continue to  operate during criminal investigations, which can take several years to  investigate and prosecute. During the investigation, schools may  remain in operation and continue to enroll foreign students, provided  their certification is not withdrawn through other administrative  actions.

ICE field agents with two of five field offices we visited stated that it can  be challenging to identify fraudulent schools as compared to legitimate  ones during the initial certification of schools. For example, agents  familiar with one investigation stated that after ICE began investigating a  school for suspected fraud, the owner tried to establish another school,  which was only identified because of a lead provided through interviews  conducted during the investigation. Further, because tools such as the  Risk Assessment Tool use data analytics, but rely on information  collected from current SEVP-certified schools, it can be difficult to identify  schools with fraud concerns before they are certified to participate in the  program.", "Using a network approach in our analysis of 2,439 SEVP-certified  schools, we identified 11 connections that could raise fraud concerns.  Specifically, we conducted a network analysis utilizing both public and  proprietary information associated with certified schools as of September  2017. We obtained basic information on these schools from ICE, such as  school names and addresses. We also used public records associated  with these schools related to businesses and people, such as past and  current executives. Using this information and freely available public  software, we identified relationships among certified schools that ICE had  previously identified as having potential compliance or fraud concerns  and other certified schools that did not have such concerns. For example,  in 11 connections, we identified instances in which an executive appeared  to have been employed by a school under active criminal investigation or  administrative review who was either previously or later employed by a  different school not under investigation or review. Moreover, for 2 of the  11 connections, we found additional derogatory information associated  with executives tied to SEVP-certified schools that could raise fraud  concerns. For instance, one executive had employment terminated from a  previous school and was under investigation for misappropriating school  funds for personal use. While these connections do not prove fraud or  noncompliance, they do provide information about potential risks, which  can inform the prioritization of administrative and investigative resources  during certification.", "ICE currently has limited ability to identify associations among schools  with potential fraud concerns before they are certified to participate in the  program.

SEVP  officials stated that, if necessary, they can further extend the certification  expiration date to accommodate the time needed for their review. For  instance, SEVP may not adjudicate this school\u2019s petition until December  2018. Once SEVP completes its adjudication in December 2018, the  school\u2019s new certification expiration date would be June 2021 (2 years  and 180 days after December 2018).

However, SEVP\u2019s Director and Certification Unit officials stated  that a recertification process that prioritizes reviews based on school risk  would not be particularly helpful or add value in addressing school  compliance concerns because the officials already have a number of  mechanisms they can use, as previously discussed, to address potential  noncompliance, including conducting out-of-cycle reviews of high-risk  schools.", "Although ICE considers schools\u2019 risk-related information during the  adjudication process and may identify noncompliant or potentially  fraudulent schools through ongoing monitoring activities, ICE has not  determined the extent to which there are residual fraud risks posed by  schools in the recertification queue that ICE has identified as higher-risk  than other schools awaiting recertification. According to GAO\u2019s Fraud  Risk Framework, managers should rank residual fraud risks in order of  priority, using the likelihood and impact analysis, as well as risk tolerance,  to help decide how to allocate resources to respond to residual fraud  risks, all of which is documented in a fraud risk profile. As previously discussed, a fraud risk profile (1) identifies the inherent fraud risks  affecting the program, (2) assesses the likelihood and effect of each type  of fraud risk that it has identified, (3) determines the agency\u2019s tolerance  for certain types or levels of fraud risks in the program, and (4) examines  the suitability of existing controls for each fraud risk.

For these types of checks, ICE officials within CTCEU  are to review the prospective DSO\u2019s biographic information from both the  Form I-17 and the proof of U.S. citizenship or immigration status  documentation received by the school. After ICE officials in CTCEU  complete this check, they are to forward the findings to SEVP for review.  If SEVP determines that a prospective DSO is unsuitable for participation  in the program, ICE officials in SEVP are to send a notice of rejection to  the nominating school. From April 2017 to March 2018, ICE screened  approximately 4,750 prospective DSOs and identified 68 individuals with  a criminal history. ICE rejected the nomination of 15 of these prospective  DSOs, because, for example, they had criminal histories that included  instances of identity theft, fraud in obtaining U.S. citizenship, and  conspiracy, among other crimes. ICE officials stated that certain crimes  will not necessarily disqualify a candidate, such as misdemeanors, traffic- related infractions, or other lesser crimes.", "As of June 2018, ICE officials told us that they are developing a more- comprehensive background-check process to screen prospective DSOs  against additional government data sources. Specifically, ICE officials told  us that they are seeking to partner with DHS\u2019s Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) to collect biometric information (e.g., fingerprints) on  prospective DSOs at TSA\u2019s enrollment provider locations nationwide  during the school certification process. ICE officials stated that they  intend to provide the biometric information they collect through TSA\u2019s  enrollment provider to ICE\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR),  and OPR officials will review such information to determine DSOs\u2019  suitability. According to agency documentation, ICE\u2019s OPR would vet  such information against data sources to screen these individuals for prior  criminal histories such as sexual misconduct, terrorist activities, and  immigration violations. According to ICE officials, they also intend to use  this process to periodically review the suitability of incumbent DSOs.", "While ICE officials have told us they intend to expand the screening of  prospective DSOs, ICE does not have a documented implementation plan  that outlines how the project will be executed. The Project Management  Institute\u2019s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge  (PMBOK\u00ae Guide) identifies standards related to project-management  processes, including the need to have documented implementation plans  describing how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled, as  well as requirements and techniques for communication and establishing  agreements among stakeholders. In addition, GAO\u2019s Schedule  Assessment Guide identifies best practices associated with developing  and maintaining a reliable, high-quality schedule. ICE provided us with a  draft of its revised background-check policy, talking points on its plans for  these checks, and draft requirements it shared with TSA in December  2016. However, these documents do not provide a detailed project- implementation plan to guide ICE\u2019s effort. As of June 2018, ICE and TSA  officials have met twice in the last 2 years, and ICE officials do not have  any documents or other written details on their planned coordination with  TSA. SEVP\u2019s Director acknowledged that SEVP will need to develop a  project plan to help guide its coordination with TSA and ICE\u2019s OPR.

To  detect noncompliance and fraud that may be committed by DSOs during  this process, ICE has established mechanisms to monitor information  entered and identify data for computers used by DSOs through SEVIS  compliance checks, among other things. For example, according to  agency officials, ICE monitors DSO actions in SEVIS to help prevent  noncompliance and fraud.", "In addition to monitoring DSOs\u2019 use of SEVIS, ICE provides support and  training to DSOs to help ensure they can effectively update and maintain  student records in SEVIS and provide recommendations to students  regarding the maintenance of their status, according to our review of ICE  documentation and interviews with ICE and school officials. According to  program rules, DSOs are responsible for understanding SEVP regulations  related to the requirements for foreign students\u2019 admission, maintenance  of status, and change of status and requirements for school approval. To  assist them, ICE officials and DSOs that we interviewed told us that  SEVP uses its field representatives to provide DSOs with a point of  contact for questions related to the program. According to SEVP\u2019s internal  guidance, field representatives are expected to visit the schools within  their areas of responsibility at least once a year to provide in-person  guidance and training to DSOs. DSOs at 15 of the 17 schools we visited  stated that the field representatives were helpful, including with providing  guidance on how to comply with SEVP rules and regulations.", "In addition, SEVP internal guidance encourages DSOs to take its web- based training course on the responsibilities and obligations for both  DSOs and foreign students in SEVIS. However, this course is voluntary.  According to ICE officials and field representatives, the extent to which  DSOs take the voluntary training varies\u2014some DSOs receive additional  training beyond the voluntary SEVP training, but other DSOs do not  complete any training. ICE officials noted that the voluntary online training  may be perceived as cumbersome and that, since it is not required, many  DSOs instead reach out to field representatives or call the SEVP  Response Center to get answers to questions that are covered by  existing training materials. ICE officials also stated that they do not know  the extent to which DSOs have completed the online training because  they do not track this information. Further, the officials acknowledged that  since training is voluntary, some DSOs may not complete it before  assuming their responsibilities and gaining access to SEVIS.", "ICE officials we interviewed told us they encounter problems with DSOs  complying with record-keeping requirements; however, they believe most  of these issues are a result of DSOs not understanding program rules or  their own responsibilities within the program. According to agency  documentation, in 2014 SEVP found that some DSOs were inconsistently  reporting school information in several SEVIS data fields. In addition,  SEVP\u2019s Risk Assessment Tool includes a number of high-risk indicators  that may stem from DSO record-keeping errors within SEVIS, including  students listed as enrolled in an academic program not available at that  school (e.g., doctoral students at schools without doctorate degrees  available) and students listed as active who have long exceeded their  program\u2019s end date or authorized employment\u2019s end date. Errors such as  these make it difficult for ICE officials to know whether the information in  SEVIS is inaccurate due to unintentional mistakes by the DSO or whether  the school or its employees may be engaged in potential fraud. For  additional examples of potential noncompliance or fraud, see the box  below.", "Potential Designated School Official Noncompliance or Fraud  Student and Exchange Visitor Program officials cited the following examples of potential  noncompliance or fraud that they have encountered, among others: the reported foreign-student enrollment listed in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information  System (SEVIS) does not seem to correspond with the number of students attending class or  the size of the school\u2019s physical space, all enrolled foreign students listed in SEVIS are living at the same address, and students repeatedly transfer to several different schools.", "Field representatives at one location we visited noted that DSOs with  multiple job responsibilities may not have time to keep up with SEVP  rules and policy updates. Similarly, DSOs at 7 of the 17 schools we spoke  with mentioned that they have multiple job responsibilities beyond their  DSO duties. In addition, SEVP officials indicated that DSOs have a high  rate of turnover, especially at small schools, and may lack the expertise to  effectively follow program requirements.", "SEVP officials acknowledged that mandatory training could help reduce  the number of unintentional violations by DSOs who may not adequately  understand the program\u2019s regulations, thus allowing SEVP staff to focus  their monitoring efforts on schools and individuals who may be engaged  in intentional noncompliance and fraud. In June 2018, ICE officials told us  that they recently received internal agreement to require all new DSOs to  complete training prior to gaining full access to SEVIS once the officials  release a new version of their DSO training program. However, SEVP  officials could not provide documentation on their plans, including time  frames for completing the revised DSO-training program, whether to  require DSO training, or how they will track DSO compliance. Federal  Internal Control Standards calls for agencies to demonstrate a  commitment to competence, including recruiting, developing, and  retaining competent individuals. Further, it recommends that agencies  establish expectations of competence for key roles, including possessing  the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities, and training individuals  appropriately.

According to ICE officials,  some DSOs may receive fraud-specific training from ICE agents through  the Project Campus Sentinel initiative; however, these visits are limited to  a small portion of certified schools each year. During a Project Campus  Sentinel visit, ICE guidance states that an ICE agent will meet with DSOs  and provide information on how to detect potential fraud, including  student visa exploitation and national security vulnerabilities. In addition,  ICE guidance encourages ICE agents to remind DSOs to contact them  when they encounter these instances. In fiscal year 2017, ICE officials  reported that ICE agents visited 400 of the more than 18,000 SEVP- certified school campuses in existence at that time. According to ICE  officials, the agency can only conduct a limited number of Project  Campus Sentinel visits to schools each year due to competing  investigative priorities.", "The DSOs we spoke with varied in their understanding of the role they  should play in identifying and reporting fraud to SEVP. Specifically, DSOs  at 8 of 17 schools told us they did not receive training on SEVP-related  fraud risks or could not identify SEVP-provided, fraud-specific training.  For example, DSOs at one school told us that there is confusion among  DSOs about their role to prevent and report fraud and that this issue has  been discussed at past training events and conferences. Specifically, they  stated that there is some confusion over the difference between fraud and  noncompliance. According to these DSOs, they are responsible for  addressing issues of noncompliance, but they do not actively look for  SEVP-related fraud. A DSO from another school told us she interprets the  DSO role as providing program oversight, including oversight related to  fraud, and that she previously reported an instance of potential student  fraud to ICE when she encountered suspicious immigration paperwork. In  addition, DSOs at another school told us that they were not aware of any  training related to fraud risks within SEVP but noted that guidance about  fraud trends or potential red-flag indicators could be useful.", "The Fraud Risk Framework identifies training as one way of  demonstrating an agency\u2019s commitment to combating fraud.

Specifically, the  Fraud Risk Framework discusses leading practices for training and  education, including communicating responsibilities for implementing  fraud controls and details on how and where to report fraud. In addition,  increasing awareness of fraud schemes, including red flags and risk  indicators, through training and education can serve a preventive purpose  by helping create a culture of integrity and compliance within the program  and can enable managers, employees, and stakeholders with  responsibility for implementing aspects of the program to better detect  potential fraud. According to ICE officials, DSOs can serve as the front  line against SEVP-related fraud, and they provide a significant portion, if  not the majority, of fraud-related tips.", "In June 2018, ICE officials told us that, in response to discussions that we  had during our review, they plan to incorporate fraud training into the  revised DSO training. However, because ICE officials just recently made  that decision, they had not yet developed documented plans for this  training or timelines for when it would be completed. While agreeing to  incorporate fraud training into the revised DSO training is a good first  step, the development and execution of those plans will be needed to  strengthen fraud controls.

However, ICE  does not have a fraud risk profile that identifies all of SEVP\u2019s fraud risks,  discusses the likelihood of those risks, assesses related controls, and  identifies the agency\u2019s tolerance for risk. Such a fraud risk profile would  help ICE more effectively assess whether additional internal controls or  changes to policies or regulations are needed. Moreover, ICE has not yet  fully employed the use of data analytics, such as network analysis, to help  it identify potentially fraudulent schools before they become certified to  enroll foreign students and help it better use its administrative and  investigative resources.", "ICE has also made improvements to its processes for certifying and  recertifying SEVP schools and monitoring DSOs\u2014all of which can help  reduce the risk of fraud in the program. However, ICE continues to delay  the recertification process by initiating the school recertification reviews  after the 2-year certification expiration date, which is not consistent with  ICE regulations. Further, ICE has not included an assessment of residual  risks posed by the current recertification queue\u2014as a part of the fraud  risk profile previously noted\u2014and as a result does not have a full  understanding of the risks associated with schools awaiting recertification.  Although DSOs play an important role in helping ICE oversee students in  the program, ICE has recognized they can pose fraud risks to the  program. However, ICE does not routinely verify DSO-submitted eligibility  information and DSO suitability for participation in SEVP, and therefore  does not have reasonable assurance that only eligible and suitable DSOs  are participating in the program.

We  reviewed documents including regulations, processes and procedures,  and guidance related to fraud risk management, school certification, and  recertification processes, and the role of DSOs. We evaluated the extent  to which ICE\u2019s practices were consistent with Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government and GAO\u2019s A Framework for  Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs. In particular, we analyzed  ICE documentation, such as standard operating procedures, policy  statements, and guidance for adjudicators to determine how ICE\u2019s  processes and systems identify and assess risk in SEVP, including the  SEVP Risk Assessment Model and Framework, Risk Assessment Tool,  Risk Register, and other internal guidance. In addition, we reviewed  information from ICE\u2019s current SEVP administrative, watch, and criminal  investigative cases and analyzed information on past cases of SEVP  fraud, including indictments.", "Also, we interviewed ICE officials within SEVP to evaluate the extent to  which the program has taken steps to strengthen its management of fraud  risks since 2012. We met with senior officials from SEVP, including  SEVP\u2019s Director and management of the Risk Management Support  Team, School Certification Unit (Certification Unit), Analysis and  Operations Center (Compliance Unit), Policy Team, and Field  Representative Unit. We interviewed officials from ICE\u2019s Office of the  Principal Legal Advisor to discuss regulatory priorities and legal  authorities related to fraud prevention and detection. We also interviewed  officials from ICE\u2019s Identity Benefit Fraud Unit and Domestic Operations  to discuss their roles in SEVP-related fraud prevention. In addition, we  met with officials from CTCEU headquarters, including the Student and  Exchange Visitor Information System Exploitation Section and criminal  investigators from 5 of the 26 ICE field offices to discuss past cases of  SEVP-related fraud and steps taken to identify and prioritize fraud risk.  We visited ICE field offices in Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and San  Francisco, California; Newark, New Jersey; and New York, New York. We  selected these locations based on a mix of criteria, including the following  characteristics: (1) number of ongoing investigations of certified schools;  (2) reported previous and current experience investigating SEVP-related  fraud; (3) number of field representatives assigned to or located near the  field office; and (4) number of schools that were located proximate to the  field office and that were either pending recertification, as of July 2017, or  have been recertified since August 2016. As we did not select a  probability sample of ICE field offices to interview, the results of these  interviews cannot be generalized to all of ICE\u2019s 26 field offices. However,  the interviews provided us with perspectives of ICE officials responsible  for conducting school fraud investigations, including their views on the  process SEVP has established for certifying and monitoring schools,  fraud, and national security vulnerabilities related to foreign students, and  any challenges field offices have faced in their investigations.", "We conducted a network analysis utilizing both public and proprietary  information associated with currently certified schools to determine the  potential to utilize additional data analytics to aid fraud risk-management  efforts in SEVP. To develop this analysis, we identified a list of schools  that, as of July 2017, had been identified by ICE as either being under  active criminal investigation or subject to additional oversight or  administrative action due to compliance concerns. We also selected a list  of SEVP-certified postsecondary schools without such identified concerns  as of September 2017. We restricted our set of schools to those with at  least 20 foreign students as of September 2017. In total, 2,439 schools  comprising 170 with concerns and 2,269 without such concerns were  analyzed. We then used an outside vendor to provide public and  proprietary information such as descriptive information associated with  these schools including addresses, businesses, and past executives.  Using these data, we used network-analysis techniques to identify  connections between both those schools with criminal or compliance  concerns and schools without such identified concerns. We determined  whether each of the postsecondary schools without compliance concerns  were linked to any of those with compliance concerns via executive  employment. Specifically, we identified instances in which an official  associated with a school with criminal or compliance concerns was  associated with another school not identified as having those concerns.  The underlying logic behind this focus was that schools associated with  an official linked to a school of concern may potentially indicate the need  for further review of possible criminal or compliance concerns. To further  validate this information, we conducted additional research using  investigative databases and the Internet to try to verify the instances  identified in our analysis such as by ensuring the time frames of the  connection appeared relevant or to verify the identity of individuals and  schools involved. While such connections are not proof of criminal or  compliance problems, they may potentially be indicative of them. This is a  diagnostic that has been used in other fraud-related network research.", "For our second objective, to evaluate the extent to which ICE has  implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and  recertification processes, we assessed documentation describing SEVP\u2019s  school certification and recertification controls, interviewed headquarters  and selected field-office ICE officials, and analyzed agency-provided  recertification data. Specifically, we assessed SEVP\u2019s standard operating  procedures, including its Adjudicator\u2019s Manual, training materials, and  other guidance to determine whether the certification and recertification  controls described in these documents addressed the high-risk indicators  ICE identified in its Risk Assessment Tool. We used this analysis to  determine any potential noncompliance and fraud vulnerabilities in these  controls. We also assessed SEVP\u2019s controls in these areas against  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to risk  management, as well as principles of the Framework for Managing Fraud  Risks in the Federal Government. Additionally, we interviewed ICE  officials in SEVP\u2019s Certification Unit, which is responsible for adjudicating  certification and recertification petitions, and the Compliance Unit, which  is charged with monitoring schools for ongoing compliance with regulatory  record-keeping and reporting requirements. To understand how ICE  Homeland Security Investigations agents in the field offices work with  officials in SEVP and the CTCEU to investigate school fraud, we  conducted semistructured interviews with ICE agents in five field offices.  We also interviewed ICE officials from SEVP\u2019s Field Representative Unit  as well as eight field representatives assigned to or located near the  selected field offices to gather information on the representatives\u2019 roles  and activities in identifying and reporting potential school fraud.", "Further, we conducted covert testing of SEVP\u2019s internal control activities  related to the school certification process. Specifically, we submitted  certification petitions and conducted other covert investigative work for  three fictitious schools, each of which are subject to particular petition  requirements.", "For one of the fictitious schools, we tested SEVP certification controls that  require schools to submit complete documentation by submitting a  petition for the school that was missing several of the required  documents. For our second school, we tested SEVP controls requiring  schools to schedule and complete a site visit conducted by an SEVP field  representative, by submitting a completed petition for the accredited  business school, but avoiding the site visit and requesting that our  paperwork move forward without it.", "For our third fictitious school, we submitted a petition and participated in a  site visit with SEVP officials, using a rented space as a fictitious school  location. We tested SEVP controls related to verifying petition  documentation, and whether SEVP site-visit officials followed established  procedures for the site visit.", "For all three petitions, we used publicly available information to construct  our scenarios. We then documented any actions taken by SEVP on the  submitted petitions, such as completeness checks, investigative steps,  adjudication decisions or requests to provide additional supporting  documentation, among other things. Results for all three covert tests,  while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the full population of petitions.", "For our third objective, to determine the extent to which ICE implemented  fraud risk controls related to the eligibility and suitability of DSOs, we  assessed guidance, training, and policies related to DSOs.

We reviewed DSO training materials,  including the Online Training for DSOs and the Study in the States  website. To determine how ICE identifies fraud risk associated with  DSOs, the controls in place for addressing and mitigating these risks, and  its efforts to identify potential vulnerabilities in its controls, we met with  ICE officials at headquarters and five selected field offices, as discussed  above. To identify the extent to which they have DSO training and  antifraud responsibilities and requirements, we interviewed selected field  representatives. Furthermore, we interviewed DSOs at 17 selected  certified postsecondary schools on their roles and responsibilities and  training resources.

According to SEVP officials, denials resulting from  recertification reviews are often based on historical discrepancies in the  DSO\u2019s data entry, record-maintenance and Form I-20 issuance issues, or  a negative change in the school\u2019s operating status, such as a loss of state  licensure. By regulation, an appeal of a notice of denial or withdrawal  must be made within 15 days after service of the decision. Schools denied recertification must, according to regulations, wait at least 1  calendar year from the date of denial of recertification or withdrawal  notice before being eligible to petition again for certification.", "If, upon the completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a  school has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the  record-keeping, retention, reporting, or other requirements, SEVP will  institute withdrawal proceedings by serving the school a notice of intent to  withdraw SEVP certification. Failure of a school to respond to a notice of  intent to withdraw within 30 days will result in an unappealable withdrawal  of the school\u2019s certification. At the conclusion of withdrawal proceedings,  a school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result  of an out-of-cycle review will receive a notice of withdrawal. SEVP  withdrew on notice approximately 211 certifications from fiscal years 2013  through 2017 (see fig. 12). If SEVP staff identify an issue during an out- of-cycle review that seems to be an error not warranting withdrawal,  SEVP could issue a Remedial Action Plan to the school describing the  issues it needs to address to retain its program eligibility. According to  SEVP officials, once they have gathered enough evidence and made the  decision to withdraw the school\u2019s certification, SEVP can temporarily  terminate the school\u2019s ability to issue Forms I-20 to students. For  example, SEVP officials explained that if a school that is otherwise in  compliance lets its accreditation lapse, SEVP may revoke its authority to  issue Forms I-20 until it renews its accreditation.", "Regarding automatic withdrawals, SEVP will serve a notice of intent to  withdraw SEVP certification to the school 30 days prior to its certification  expiration date if, up until that point the school has failed to file a  complete petition for recertification. From fiscal year 2013 through fiscal  year 2017, SEVP automatically withdrew 1,763 certifications (see fig. 12).  SEVP will not accept a petition for recertification and the school will be  automatically withdrawn immediately if such school has effectively  relinquished its SEVP certification by not petitioning for recertification,  abandoning its petition, or not submitting a complete recertification  package by the certification expiration date. Certified schools can also  voluntarily withdraw their certification at any time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Latesha Love (Assistant  Director), Kathryn Bernet (Assistant Director), Nick Weeks (Analyst-in- Charge), David Aja, David Dornisch, Gabrielle Fagan, April Gamble, Gina  Hoover, Lauren Kirkpatrick, Kirsten Lauber, Barbara Lewis, Sasan J.  \u201cJon\u201d Najmi, Robin Nye, George Ogilvie, Ramon Rodriguez, Constance  Satchell, Sabrina Streagle, Shana Wallace, and Helina Wong made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Are some U.S. schools fraudulently certifying that their foreign students are currently enrolled and attending classes?", "We previously reported on fraud in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program such as \"sham\" schools that help students get visas to live in the U.S. without requiring that they attend classes.
