While most public high schools, regardless of poverty level, offered courses like algebra and biology, disparities in access were associated with school poverty level for more advanced courses like calculus, physics, and those that may allow students to earn college credit, like Advanced Placement (AP) courses (see figure). High-poverty schools were less likely to offer the math and science courses that most public 4-year colleges expect students to take in high school, according to GAO's analysis of college websites. GAO's regression analysis also showed that smaller schools and certain types of schools, like charter schools, are less likely to offer the college preparatory math or science courses that many colleges look for during the admissions process.", "Officials GAO interviewed in selected high-poverty high schools said their students can face a number of complex challenges in preparing for college. For instance, officials said that many students are academically behind when they enter high school and are unable to progress to more advanced courses. Further, high-poverty schools may not offer rigorous courses, such as AP courses, due to lack of resources or teaching staff. Students in high-poverty schools also face other stressors that can make going to college challenging. Officials at 9 of the 12 schools GAO visited cited the effects of poverty on their students, such as homelessness, hunger, and trauma, that make preparing for college difficult. School officials also said the steps involved in applying to and enrolling in college can be difficult to navigate for many students in high-poverty schools. Officials in selected schools reported efforts to address these challenges, such as offering free college courses and obtaining outside supports to assist with college advising."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Students from low-income families earn bachelor\u2019s degrees at rates that  are significantly lower than their more affluent peers. This is concerning  because higher levels of education are associated with higher lifetime  earnings, and a bachelor\u2019s degree, in particular, can be a powerful tool for  lifting individuals out of poverty. One study found that among individuals  who started out in the lowest 20 percent income group, those earning a  college degree were over four times more likely to move to the highest  income group than those who did not finish college. Similarly, another  study found that adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher are more likely  to report that they are at least doing okay financially than those with a  high school degree or less. Not all students are interested in pursuing a  4-year college degree. However, the low rates of degree attainment for  low-income students raises questions about whether the students who  wish to pursue higher education have access to courses that support their  admission to college.", "You asked us to review the spectrum of college preparatory course  offerings available in high-poverty schools and challenges students in  these schools face preparing for college. Specifically, we (1) examined  the extent to which high schools of different poverty levels offer courses  to prepare students academically for college, and (2) described  challenges that students in high-poverty schools face in being prepared to  attend college.", "To determine the extent to which schools offer courses to prepare  students academically for college, we analyzed U.S. Department of  Education (Education) data on course offerings, among other things, on  the nation\u2019s public schools. Specifically, we analyzed data from  Education\u2019s school year 2015-16, the most recent available, Civil Rights  Data Collection (CRDC), which collects data on course offerings in  schools, among other things, such as characteristics of students  attending schools (e.g., race, sex, disability), school type (e.g., traditional,  charter), and school size. To explore whether course offerings varied by  level of school poverty, we matched schools in the CRDC to the same  schools in another Education data collection, the Common Core of Data  (CCD), which contains information on the percentage of students in a  school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, for school year 2015-16,  and sorted them into poverty quartiles. To understand the interplay of  poverty and race, we further analyzed the student demographics of  schools in these poverty quartiles. In addition, this descriptive analysis  also examined the variation in course offerings by school size, type, and  locale. Both the CRDC and CCD are school-level data collections of K-12  public schools. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report by reviewing documentation, conducting electronic  testing, and interviewing Education officials.", "Colleges often look for students to have taken certain courses or a  sequence of courses in preparation for college. To test whether offering  certain courses or sequences of courses were associated with school  characteristics, like its poverty level, we conducted an additional analysis  using Education\u2019s data. Specifically, we used a generalized linear  regression with a logistic regression model to test whether a school  offering: at least three math courses (algebra I, geometry, and algebra II);  at least three science courses (biology, chemistry, and physics); and any  Advanced Placement (AP) courses was associated with particular school  characteristics, like poverty, while controlling for other school  characteristics, like school size and demographic makeup. Similarly, we  conducted a separate regression for individual course offerings (algebra I,  calculus, biology, etc.). By controlling for other related school  characteristics that might also be associated with offering a given course  or sequence of courses, the model tests whether an association with a  particular school characteristic of interest, such as poverty, remains when  controlling for other related school characteristics. To better understand  the courses that colleges expect students to take in high school, we  reviewed the academic admission criteria posted on the websites of a  nationally-representative random sample of public 4-year colleges in the  Unites States. We focused on public 4-year colleges because these  institutions offer a bachelor\u2019s degree and are generally a more affordable  4-year option because they often offer lower tuition to in-state residents.", "To gather information on the challenges students in high-poverty schools  face in being prepared for college, we conducted site visits to 12 high  schools: 4 schools in each of 3 states (California, Georgia, and  Wisconsin). We selected high-poverty schools that provided us with a  range in the numbers of different types of math, science, and AP courses  offered. We also selected high schools that provided variation in size,  school type, and location. At each of the 12 high schools, we interviewed  the principal and other key leadership staff, and high school counselors.  We interviewed by phone state educational agency officials in each of the  three states, as well as school district officials for most of the high schools  we visited.

GEAR UP aims to increase the number of low- income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in  postsecondary education. In 2016, OPE awarded approximately $323  million in grants through GEAR UP. In addition, Education\u2019s Office of  Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) provides grants and  technical assistance to states and districts to encourage advanced course  opportunities and college and career readiness initiatives.

For example, in a recent review, Education\u2019s OCR  reviewed whether Black students in a Virginia school district had the  same access to educational opportunities as other students. OCR found a  significant disparity between the numbers of Black and White high school  students who take AP, advanced courses, and dual credit programs.  These discrimination cases can be resolved through several means,  including voluntary resolution, dismissal, or closure due to insufficient  evidence. Education may also terminate federal funds if Education  determines that a recipient is in violation of civil rights laws and the  agency is unable to reach agreement with the parties involved.", "Justice has the authority to file suit in federal court to enforce the civil  rights of students in public education. Specifically, Justice investigates  discrimination in school resources based on complaints filed under  federal civil rights laws and monitors and enforces open federal school  desegregation orders where Justice is a party to the litigation. For  example, in 2015 Justice entered into a court-approved agreement with a  Louisiana city school board after finding that more college preparatory  courses were offered in schools that predominantly serve White students  than in schools that predominately serve Black students. This agreement  required, among other things, that the district ensure that all students  were given the opportunity to take all courses offered in the district.", "In addition to enforcement actions, Education and Justice help promote  equitable access to education resources by issuing guidance and  providing technical assistance. For example, in 2014, OCR issued  guidance addressing equitable access to educational resources, in part,  to address chronic and widespread racial disparities in access to rigorous  courses, academic programs, and extracurricular activities which can  hinder the education of students of color. In this guidance, OCR describes  proactive ways to address potential disparities in academic and  extracurricular programs that are differentiated based on academic rigor  (e.g., gifted and talented or college preparatory programs) or content  (e.g., business, music, art, or career and technical education programs).  This guidance includes the following steps that states and school districts  can take to help ensure equal access to educational resources: designating an employee to review policies governing how resources  are distributed to and within schools; evaluating resource access across and within schools; notifying parents, students, and community members of avenues to  raise concerns about resource access; and  taking proactive steps to identify disparities in access to resources.", "Education also offers technical assistance, through various means, such  as conducting webinars, sponsoring and presenting at conferences, and  disseminating resource guides to schools and school districts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "High-Poverty Schools Offer Fewer of the Courses That Prepare Students for Public 4- Year College", "paragraphs": ["At a Glance: Student Access to College Preparation Courses and  Admissions Expectations", "Poverty and Student Demographics", "Schools with the highest concentration of poor students were  predominantly comprised of Black and Hispanic students.", "Access to more advanced math and science courses (e.g.,  calculus and physics) decreased as the level of school poverty  increased.", "Larger high schools offered more advanced math and science  courses than smaller schools, regardless of poverty level.", "Charter schools offered fewer advanced math and science  courses than traditional and magnet schools, regardless of  poverty level.", "Public 4-year colleges generally expect applicants to have  completed three or four math and three or four science credits  in high school, but we found that the percentage of schools  offering these recommended courses decreased as poverty  level increased."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "High-Poverty High Schools Largely Comprised of Black and Hispanic Students", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of Education data for school year 2015-16 showed that high- poverty high schools were predominately comprised of Black and  Hispanic students, while low -poverty schools had a higher proportion of  White students.

Officials explained that family challenges and  obligations can compound the academic challenges and make navigating  the college admissions and enrollment process difficult for their students.", "Students have not made sufficient academic progress to be admitted to  college, according to officials we interviewed at 12 high-poverty schools  (see fig. 13). Officials representing most of these schools (10 of 12)  reported that their students were often academically behind. For example,  at one urban and predominantly Black Wisconsin high school, officials  said that 80 percent of 9th graders were performing below grade-level  targets for reading and math, and at a Georgia high school where nearly  all of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, officials  said that over 30 percent of freshman students in school year 2016-17  had to repeat the 9th grade.", "Insufficient academic progress can be compounded by challenges high- poverty schools face in offering advanced coursework. For example,  officials at five schools said they did not offer calculus; officials at three of  these schools noted this was because most students typically did not take  algebra I in middle school and, therefore, did not have the time to  progress to calculus. Officials at a high school with over 900 students  reported they did not offer calculus or AP math courses due to low  student demand and that they must weigh the cost of providing a course  with the number of students who would benefit. Two high-poverty high  schools we visited that did not offer calculus courses were exploring  offering the courses to students through videoconference. However, an  official from one school district we interviewed said the district uses  videoconference as a last resort because they have found students learn  better with a teacher physically present allowing for more exchange of  dialogue. In addition, the challenge of finding and retaining high-quality  teachers can exacerbate the difficulties high-poverty schools face in  offering advanced courses, according to state educational agency officials  in two of the states we visited. Offering advanced courses is important to  providing challenging opportunities for students and avoiding remedial  coursework once in college, according to college and high school officials  we interviewed. Officials we interviewed stressed that taking advanced  courses provides students with challenging academic opportunities that  help to prepare students for the rigor of college courses, whether they  pass their AP exams or not. A representative of a college advising  organization said that while it is possible to get into college without  higher-level math courses, these courses often determine if a student  needs remedial math in college. Officials from two college advising  organizations said that when students are required to take remedial  courses in college, it can have a detrimental effect. They said remedial  courses generally cost money but do not provide credits towards  graduation and can delay graduation, and sometimes can contribute to  students leaving college without a degree.", "School officials for almost all the schools we visited (11 of 12) also said  that students often had low GPAs and SAT or ACT scores, which made  them less competitive applicants for admission or scholarships to 4-year  colleges. For example, the average GPA for 11th grade students at three  Wisconsin high schools we visited was below 2.0; officials at one school  told us that last year\u2019s valedictorian had a 3.0 GPA. Further, officials at  multiple schools said students feared they would not do well on the ACTs  or SATs; and one counselor said this means that many students did not  even try. Low GPAs and college entrance exam scores may be a  particularly acute roadblock to 4-year college in areas where the state  university system has grown increasingly competitive due to high  demand, according to a counselor at one predominantly Hispanic  California high school who said the state system is looking for students  with 4.0 GPAs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Difficult Life Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["In addition to insufficient academic progress, a confluence of family,  financial, and social-emotional challenges often confronts students in  high-poverty schools, making it difficult for them to prepare for college,  according to our interviews with school officials (see fig. 14).", "School and state education officials said that a range of stressors can  compound the difficulties poor students face with learning and academic  achievement.

In one high school, officials reported that a school  staff member handed out care packages to students every Friday to  ensure students had something to eat on the weekend. Officials also  reported that students demonstrated behavioral and emotional issues in  their schools. Officials at one Wisconsin school said they have noticed a  large increase in anxiety among students. This anxiety can be paralyzing  for some students and, for others, can result in explosive and violent  behavior that affects other students\u2019 ability to learn, according to the  school officials.", "Officials in 11 of the high-poverty schools we visited said that going to  college often conflicts with a student\u2019s need to help support their families  or that the cost of college can be prohibitive. Some students provide an  important source of income for their family or are the caregiver for family  members, according to officials in nine schools. Family obligations can  also affect students\u2019 decisions about whether to take college preparation  courses, according to one school administrator. For example, the  principal of a California charter school said a high-performing student  dropped an AP course because the demands from family were so great.  In addition, officials in six schools said that the cost of college can deter  low-income students. One of these officials reported that even with  financial aid and scholarships, their students may not be able to cover  even small gaps in funding. According to one high school counselor, the  cost of going to college plus the practicalities of getting to and from school  and figuring out how to pay for meals during breaks if dorms or the  cafeteria are closed, are concerns for low-income students.", "Parents struggling with poverty may not expect their children to go to  college, according to college advising officials and officials at most  schools (10 of 12) we visited. For example, officials at one Georgia high  school said that many students are aiming to be the first in the family to  graduate high school (first generation high school graduates), and do not  prioritize college. Similarly, at another school, officials said parents and  students do not have the expectation of going to college because the  parents had not been to college themselves. Students from high-poverty  schools may continue to harbor low expectations upon admission to  college because they feel they do not belong, according to a principal and  a college advising official. In addition, first generation students usually do  not have the family support and knowledge to feel confident in their  abilities to navigate college life, as a college admissions official noted.  School officials at one high school we visited said their students, who  attend high school in a highly segregated area, have felt overwhelmed  and intimidated trying to transition to a college with a predominately white  student population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Navigating College Processes", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors\u2014from the availability of high school counselors to  taking college entrance exams\u2014can make the college admissions and  enrollment processes difficult for students in high-poverty schools,  according to school, college, and college advising organizations in the  communities we visited (see fig. 15).", "College admission officials in two of the states we visited noted the  importance of the high school counselor in navigating the college  admissions process, such as taking students to college fairs and building  relationships with colleges. However, counselors often face high  caseloads and competing priorities, such as getting kids to graduate and  handling emotional and social issues, according to multiple school  officials and local college advising organizations. In one rural school we  visited, one counselor handled the needs of about 400 students and was  also the bus driver and occasional substitute nurse. Taking the SAT and  ACT exams can also pose challenges for students. For example,  according to administrators at one school, the cost of the exams may be a  deterrent. At another high school, counselors noted that students may  lack transportation to the test site and, at another school, officials said  weekend jobs kept students from taking the tests.", "Applying for financial aid can also be challenging for students from high- poverty schools, according to school and college advising organization  officials. At six of the schools we visited, officials said that sometimes  parents are reluctant to report their income, because they are  undocumented or because the process is unfamiliar. In addition, some  school officials told us that even families with legal immigration status can  be reluctant to submit personal information to government websites  because they distrust how the information will be used. College advising  officials we interviewed in two states said that complicated family financial  situations, such as when a student cannot obtain income information from  a parent, can also make the financial aid process difficult. In addition,  officials from two college advising organizations said that financial aid  award packages can be difficult to understand. For instance, they said  that these packages may not clearly explain what amount the student is  responsible for paying. Further, the aid letters may not indicate the  additional cost associated with room and board, books, and  transportation, according to one of these officials.", "Finally, even after a student has been admitted to college, they still may  experience obstacles before classes begin, according to our interviews.  Four officials reported that lack of college advisement over the summer  after high school graduation has led to \u201csummer melt,\u201d when students do  not attend college as planned. Officials from a college advising  organization said that sometimes students missed a step in the  enrollment process, such as paying deposits or tuition balances before  the semester begins."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some High-Poverty Schools Are Trying to Ease Roadblocks to College", "paragraphs": ["Officials representing selected state educational agencies, school  districts, and high-poverty schools we visited reported that they try to  mitigate the barriers students in high-poverty schools face in being  prepared to attend a 4-year college, despite resource challenges.", "Free access to college courses. Providing students with free access to  college courses was one way some states and schools have been able to  help students prepare for college. For example, Georgia\u2019s dual enrollment  program allows high school students to earn college credit for free while  working on their high school diploma. The program covers tuition,  mandatory fees, and books. Administrators at a Georgia high school  reported that the program has allowed some students to earn an  associate\u2019s degree upon graduation from high school, helping to ease the  cost burden of college. A charter school we visited in California partners  with local colleges and covers tuition, text books, and transportation for  college courses. The school principal said that the school does not offer  calculus, but students can take it at a local community college and  receive college credit.", "Outside supports for college advising. In Georgia, officials from a  college advising organization reported helping with the college admission  process in selected schools, including registering students to take the  ACT or SAT, organizing college visits, helping students research  colleges, and helping students and parents apply for financial aid. They  also said they used text messages as a way to reach out to students and  remind them to complete certain steps in the enrollment process. In  addition, officials from half of the schools we visited (6 of 12) reported  their schools had, or previously had, federal grants that supported college  readiness activities for disadvantaged students. For example, one  Wisconsin high school where most students are eligible for free or  reduced-priced lunch (90 percent) and are Black (82 percent) or Hispanic  (14 percent) had a GEAR UP grant that supported students in the classes  of 2017 and 2018 since middle school, according to the school  administrators.", "Strategies to exhibit a college-going culture. To help encourage  students to consider college as a possibility, officials at some high-poverty  schools we visited reported using strategies to exhibit a \u201ccollege-going  culture\u201d within the school. For example, based on our site visit interviews  and observations, schools displayed college banners; opened college and  career counseling centers; provided incentives, such as prizes, to  complete financial aid applications; and posted testing and scholarship  information in prominent locations (see figs. 16 and 17). At one urban  high school we visited in Georgia, teachers displayed their alma maters  on their classroom doors and the school held \u201cCollege Fridays\u201d so  students could learn about different colleges, according to school  administrators.", "All-hands-on deck approach. One California school reported using an  \u201call-hands-on-deck\u201d approach to getting students through the college  admission process. Teachers, counselors, and administrators work  together to track and follow up with students to ensure they take the  needed coursework and do not miss a step in the admissions process.  Officials reported that school staff built personal connections with the  students and with the community outside of the school to encourage buy- in surrounding the college application process. At a high school in  Georgia where 100 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced- priced lunch, school officials said they also used an all-hands-on-deck  approach to help students persevere through personal challenges they  face, such as balancing work and school or dealing with trauma. The  school provides a team of administrators and counselors for each grade  level to better identify when a student may be struggling and help support  students\u2019 college preparation goals, according to school administrators.", "Alignment of graduation requirements and college admission  requirements. Wisconsin officials reported that the state made changes  to better align high school requirements with college and career readiness  expectations, and universities\u2019 expectations by increasing its math and  science graduation requirements from two units to three units of each,  starting with the 2017 graduating class. According to a 2014 analysis by  the Education Commission of the States, 18 states have complete or  partial alignment between state high school graduation requirements and  statewide higher education minimum admission requirements. In  addition, the University of California and the California State University  systems have established a uniform minimum set of courses, known as  A-G requirements, required for admission as a freshman. These courses,  offered in California high schools and online schools, are designed to  ensure students have attained a body of general knowledge for more  advanced study, according to information from the University of  California. Even though it is not a state requirement, one Georgia school  district reported that it requires two units of foreign language because it is  a requirement of the University System of Georgia.", "Free college admission tests. In two of the states we visited, officials  reported that students may take select college entrance exams or  preparatory exams during a school day free of charge. Georgia pays for  all 10th graders in public schools to take the Preliminary SAT (PSAT).  Wisconsin officials reported that the state requires and provides the  funding for all 11th graders in the state to take the ACT. A school district  in California we visited noted that it covers the cost of the PSAT for 9th,  10th, and 11th graders in the district, as well as the SAT for 11th graders.  In addition, officials at several schools said they offer students free online  test preparation tools.", "College initiatives to improve access and retention. Officials at  colleges in all three states we visited reported having initiatives that  helped increase admissions or ease the transition to college for low- income or first-generation students. For example, officials at the  University of Georgia said the college guarantees admission to the  valedictorian of every accredited high school in the state. Admissions  officials said this helped students with fewer educational opportunities to  be competitive for admissions. California State University (CSU)\u2013Los  Angeles, as well as other CSU campuses, has a program to help improve  access and retention of low-income and educationally disadvantaged  students. Under the program, the university accepts a limited number of  students who do not meet regular admission criteria and provides  academic, and in some cases financial, assistance to these students. The  university also offers a 6-week \u201csummer bridge\u201d program for first  generation students since they are most in danger of dropping out  between high school graduation and the first day of college classes in the  fall. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, an admissions official said  the university develops transfer plans for students who start at a 2-year  community college, to ease the transition to a 4-year college."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Education and  Justice for review and comment.

Specifically,  the CRDC is a biennial survey that is mandatory for every public school  and district in the United States. Conducted by Education\u2019s Office for  Civil Rights (OCR), the survey collects data on the nation\u2019s public schools  (pre-K through 12th grade), including course offerings, student  characteristics and enrollment, and disciplinary actions. The CRDC  collected data from nearly every public school in the nation  (approximately 17,000 school districts, 96,000 schools, and 51 million  students in school year 2015-16). The course offering variables we used  in our analysis are for those courses typically associated with and  reported by high schools. As a result, our analysis only includes high  schools that have all grades 9, 10, 11, and 12 (a total of 14,111 high  schools). We thus excluded schools that had any grades K-8. Further, we  excluded juvenile justice facilities\u2014because the provision of educational  offerings may function differently in those schools\u2014and schools with  fewer than 10 students. Our analysis was conducted using the public-use  data file of the CRDC for school year 2015-16, the most recent data  available at the time of our analysis.

Although  our analyses of these data showed disparities, taken alone, these  disparities do not establish whether unlawful discrimination has occurred.", "The 2015-16 CRDC survey collected data on several math and science  courses that are considered by Education to be college-preparatory  courses. The college-preparatory math courses included in the CRDC  are: algebra I; geometry; algebra II; advanced mathematics; and  calculus. The college preparatory science courses included in the CRDC  are: biology; chemistry; and physics.

The district reported to Education that it was also pursuing efforts  that would allow students to earn college credit, increase the number of  courses, and improve the courses to provide high-level course choices for  students. Before OCR concluded its investigation, district school officials  voluntarily entered into a resolution agreement with Education, which  committed the district to take certain actions, such as implementing  programs designed to ensure that equally effective and qualified teachers  are equitably distributed throughout the district and ensure Advanced  Placement and other higher-level college preparatory courses are taught in the district\u2019s predominantly Black high schools, and provide students  the opportunity to engage in-person with course instructors.", "Education Case 2: Equitable Access to College Preparatory  Programs for Black, Hispanic, and English Learner (EL) Students in  a New York School District. In 2013, OCR investigated whether a New  York school district discriminated against Black, Hispanic, and EL  students by establishing and implementing policies and procedures that  resulted in their exclusion from college and career ready programs and  courses, such as honors courses and AP courses. OCR reviewed  information that the district provided regarding its high school honors  courses and analyzed data from the district that revealed that Black,  Hispanic, and EL students were underrepresented to a statistically  significant degree in high school honors courses and AP courses. OCR  also reviewed information concerning the district\u2019s gifted and talented  program at the elementary and middle school levels and its advanced  courses at the middle school level. Data provided by the district indicated  that Black, Hispanic and EL students were underrepresented to a  statistically significant degree in middle school advanced courses, as well  as in some of the district\u2019s enrichment programs. OCR noted that  enrollment in these programs and courses could potentially have an effect  on later enrollment in high school honors and AP courses. Before the  conclusion of OCR\u2019s investigation, the district voluntarily entered into a  resolution agreement with Education. The agreement committed the  district to take specific actions including hiring a consultant with expertise  in addressing the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, and EL  students in advanced and enrichment courses. According to the  agreement, the consultant was to study the underrepresentation and  make specific recommendations, as appropriate, for improving the  district\u2019s efforts to provide all students with equal access to and an equal  opportunity to participate in its advanced courses and programs.", "Education Case 3: Representation of Black Students in Advanced  Courses and Enrichment Programs in a New Jersey School District.  In 2014, OCR determined that Black students in a New Jersey school  district were underrepresented in high school AP courses. Specifically,  OCR found that Black students comprised 51.5 percent of high school  students in the district, but only 18.7 percent of students in AP courses in school year 2012-13. In addition, OCR determined that in middle schools,  Black students were underrepresented in the district\u2019s advanced math  courses, as well as in the math enrichment programs at certain schools in  the district. Before the conclusion of OCR\u2019s investigation, the district  voluntarily entered into a resolution agreement with Education. The  agreement committed the district to take specific actions including hiring a  consultant with expertise in addressing the underrepresentation of Black  students in college and career preparatory courses. According to the  agreement, the consultant was to study the underrepresentation and  make recommendations, as appropriate, for improving the district\u2019s efforts  to provide all students with equal access to and an equal opportunity to  participate in its advanced courses and programs.", "Education Case 4: College Preparation Opportunities for Black  Students in a Virginia School District. In 2014, OCR investigated  whether a Virginia school district discriminated against Black students by  failing to provide them with the same resources and educational  opportunities that it provided to White students to prepare them for  postsecondary education or careers. As part of this review, OCR  reviewed information regarding the district\u2019s high school higher-level  learning opportunities, including advanced courses, AP courses, and dual  credit programs (where students enroll in courses at a local community  college). In addition, OCR collected and reviewed information about other  possible barriers to college and career readiness, including student  discipline. OCR found a significant disparity between the numbers of  Black and White high school students who take AP, advanced courses,  and dual credit programs. Preliminary information provided by the district  indicated disproportion in the representation of Black students in  advanced math classes, gifted programs, and accelerated reading  programs in elementary schools. When speaking with students about  what they considered in determining whether to enroll in these courses,  many students informed OCR that they took AP or advanced courses if  they took advanced courses in middle school and elementary school.  OCR also reviewed student discipline, particularly exclusionary  disciplinary that removes students from the school setting, because,  according to OCR, such removals can serve as a potential barrier to  college and career readiness. Before OCR concluded its investigation,  the district voluntarily entered into a resolution agreement with Education  to resolve the case. The agreement committed the district to retain the  services of a consultant with expertise in addressing the  underrepresentation of Black students in gifted programs, elementary and  middle school advanced courses, and high school AP and dual credit  courses. The consultant\u2019s role was to examine the root causes for  underrepresentation and to make recommendations about what  measures, if any, the district should take as part of its on-going efforts to  provide all students with equal access to advanced courses and  programs. According to the agreement, the consultant was to study the  underrepresentation and make recommendations, as appropriate, for  improving the district\u2019s efforts to provide all students with equal access to  and an equal opportunity to participate in its advanced courses and  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Justice", "paragraphs": ["Justice also investigates allegations of discrimination related to school  resources in response to complaints filed under federal civil rights  statutes and monitors and enforces open federal school desegregation  orders where Justice is a party to the litigation.

As part of an ongoing civil rights lawsuit against an  Alabama school district, in 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern  District of Alabama approved a consent order filed by Justice and the  district to reconfigure school attendance zones, improve access to quality  course offerings, and address racial discrimination in student discipline,  among other areas. The proposed consent order required the district to  provide equal educational opportunities to Black students by revising  attendance zones and growing and strengthening magnet programs to  improve diversity at many of its schools. It also required the district to  expand access for Black students by taking a number of steps, including  expanding access for Black students to college counseling and advance course offerings such as AP and International Baccalaureate (IB). It also  required the district to expand access for Black students to pre- kindergarten, gifted programs, and academic afterschool programs. The  district agreed to implement measures to promote faculty and  administrator diversity and to ensure that all students are aware of and  can equally participate in extracurricular activities.", "Justice Case 2: Equitable Access to Course Offerings in a Louisiana  School District. As part of an ongoing civil rights lawsuit against a  Louisiana School Board, in 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western  District of Louisiana approved a consent decree between Justice and the  school board. This consent decree addressed district\u2019s fulfillment of its  desegregation obligations, terminating long-standing judicial supervision  of the district in this matter. Prior to this consent decree, in 2010, the court  directed the district to offer the same courses at every high school.  However, 5 years later, the court found that a high school in the district,  which predominantly served White students, offered 32 more courses,  including college preparatory courses, than another high school, which  predominantly served Black students. Similarly, across all schools in the  district (elementary, middle, and high), the schools that were racially  identifiable as White had far more gifted and talented course offerings  than other schools. In the consent decree, the district agreed, among  other things, to strive to have all courses listed in its course catalog taught  at each high school. Further, if a course is ultimately not taught at a given  school, students at that school would be given the opportunity to take the  course at another school in the district. The district also agreed to provide  free transportation, at the student\u2019s request, and to adjust the student\u2019s  schedule and the scheduling and location of the course, as necessary, to  facilitate the student\u2019s attendance at the course.", "Justice Case 3: Access to College and Career Readiness Programs  and Courses for American Indian Students in a New Mexico School  District. In 2017, Justice and OCR resolved a compliance review of a  New Mexico school district. The purpose of the review was to determine  whether the district discriminated against American Indians by excluding  them from college and career readiness programs and courses, such as  gifted and talented, AP, and honors courses. Justice and OCR also  evaluated whether the district discriminated against American Indian  parents by not providing them with information surrounding the  aforementioned programs and courses in a language they understand.  District staff surveyed during this review recommended ways to address  American Indian student underrepresentation in college and career  readiness programs and courses. On February 14, 2017, the district  entered into a resolution agreement with OCR and Justice, committing to  take specific actions to ensure that it is providing an equal opportunity  and equal access for all students to its advanced and higher level  learning opportunities. The district agreed to several actions including  reaching out to an equity assistance center or consultant for technical  assistance in addressing the underrepresentation of American Indian  students in the college and career readiness programs and courses and  improving outreach to the American Indian community."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Additional Data Tables", "paragraphs": ["This appendix contains several tables that show the underlying data used  throughout this report, as well as additional analyses we conducted using  the Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) and  Common Core of Data (CCD) for school year 2015-16.
