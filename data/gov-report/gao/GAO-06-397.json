DOD's benefit provides health care services, including mental health services, to some OEF/OIF veterans for 180 days following discharge or release from active duty. Additionally, some veterans may purchase extended benefits for up to 18 months. VA also offers health care services to OEF/OIF veterans following their discharge or release from active duty. VA offers health benefits for OEF/OIF veterans at no cost for 2 years following discharge or release from active duty. After their 2-year benefit expires, some OEF/OIF veterans may continue to receive care under VA's eligibility rules. Using data provided by DOD, GAO found that 9,145 or 5 percent of the 178,664 OEF/OIF servicemembers in its review may have been at risk for developing PTSD. DOD uses a questionnaire to identify those who may be at risk for developing PTSD after deployment. DOD providers interview servicemembers after they complete the questionnaire. A joint VA/DOD guideline states that servicemembers who respond positively to three or four of the questions may be at risk for PTSD. Further, we reviewed a retrospective study that found that those individuals who provided three or four positive responses to the four PTSD screening questions were highly likely to have been previously given a diagnosis of PTSD prior to the screening. Of the 5 percent who may have been at risk, GAO found that DOD providers referred 22 percent or 2,029 for further mental health evaluations. DOD cannot provide reasonable assurance that OEF/OIF servicemembers who need referrals receive them. According to DOD officials, not all of the servicemembers with three or four positive responses to the PTSD screening questions will need referrals for further mental health evaluations. DOD relies on providers' clinical judgment to decide who needs a referral. GAO found that DOD health care providers varied in the frequency with which they issued referrals to OEF/OIF servicemembers with three or more positive responses; the Army referred 23 percent, the Marines about 15 percent, the Navy 18 percent, and the Air Force about 23 percent. However, DOD did not identify the factors its providers used in determining which OEF/OIF servicemembers needed referrals.

Despite its  planned implementation of our recommendation to identify the factors  that its health care providers use to make referrals, DOD disagreed with  our finding that it has not provided reasonable assurance that OEF/OIF  servicemembers receive referrals for further mental health evaluations  when needed.", "To support its position, DOD identified several factors in its comments  that it stated may explain why some OEF/OIF servicemembers with the  same number of positive responses to the four PTSD screening questions  are referred while others are not. For example, DOD health care providers  may employ watchful waiting instead of a referral for a further evaluation  for servicemembers with three or four positive responses to the PTSD  screening questions. Additionally, DOD stated in its technical comments  that providers may use the referral category of \u201cother\u201d rather than place a  mental health label on a referral by checking the further evaluation  categories of mental health or combat/operational stress reaction. DOD  also stated in its technical comments that health care providers may not  place equal value on the four PTSD screening questions and may only refer  servicemembers who indicate positive responses to certain questions.  Although DOD identified several factors that may explain why some  servicemembers are referred while others are not, DOD did not provide  data on the extent to which these factors affect health care providers\u2019  clinical judgments on whether to refer OEF/OIF servicemembers with  three or four positive responses to the four PTSD screening questions.", "Until DOD has better information on how its health care providers use  these factors when applying their clinical judgment, DOD cannot  reasonably assure that servicemembers who need referrals receive them.  DOD\u2019s plans to develop this information should lead to reasonable  assurance that servicemembers who need referrals receive them.", "DOD also described in its written comments its philosophy of clinical  intervention for combat and operational stress reactions that could lead to  PTSD. Central to its approach is the belief that attempting to diagnose  normal reactions to combat and assigning too much significance to  symptoms when not warranted may do more harm to a servicemember  than good. While we agree that PTSD is a complex disorder that requires  DOD health care providers to make difficult clinical decisions, issues  relating to diagnosis and treatment are not germane to the referral issues  we reviewed and were beyond the scope of our work. Instead, our work  focused on the referral of servicemembers who may be at risk for PTSD  because they answered three or four of the four PTSD screening questions  positively, not whether they should be diagnosed and treated.", "Further, DOD implied that our position is that servicemembers must have  a referral to access mental health care, but there are other avenues of care  for servicemembers where a referral is not needed. We do not assume that  servicemembers must have a referral in order to access these health care  services. Rather, in this report we identify the health care services  available to OEF/OIF servicemembers who have been discharged or  released from active duty and focus on how decisions are made by DOD  providers regarding referrals for servicemembers who may be at risk for  PTSD. DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "VA provided comments on a draft of this report by e-mail. VA concurred  with the facts in the draft report that related to VA.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;  the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, the Air Force, and  the Navy; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and appropriate  congressional committees.

We reviewed the  policies, procedures, and guidance issued by DOD\u2019s TRICARE and VA\u2019s  health care systems and interviewed DOD and VA officials about the  benefits and services available for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  We defined an OEF/OIF veteran as a servicemember who was deployed in  support of OEF or OIF from October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2004,  and had since been discharged or released from active duty status. We  classified National Guard and Reserve members as veterans if they had  been released from active duty status after their deployment in support of  OEF/OIF.", "We interviewed officials in DOD\u2019s Office of Health Affairs about health  care benefits, including length of coverage, offered to OEF/OIF veterans  who are members of the National Guard and Reserves and have left active  duty status. We attended an Air Force Reserve and National Guard training  seminar in Atlanta, Georgia, for mental health providers, social workers,  and clergy to obtain information on PTSD mental health services offered  to National Guard and Reserve members returning from deployment. To  obtain information on DOD\u2019s Military OneSource, we interviewed DOD  officials and the manager of the Military OneSource contract about the  services available and the procedures for referring OEF/OIF veterans for  mental health services. We interviewed representatives from the Army, Air  Force, Marines, and Navy about their use of Military OneSource.", "We interviewed VA headquarters officials, including mental health experts,  to obtain information about VA\u2019s specialized PTSD services. We reviewed  applicable statutes and policies and interviewed officials to identify the  services offered by VA\u2019s Vet Centers for OEF/OIF veterans. In addition, to  inform our understanding of the issues related to DOD\u2019s post-deployment  process, we interviewed veterans\u2019 service organization representatives  from The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam  Veterans of America.", "To determine the number of OEF/OIF servicemembers who may be at risk  for developing PTSD and the number of these servicemembers who were  referred for further mental health evaluations, we analyzed computerized  DOD data. We worked with officials at DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower Data  Center to identify the population of OEF/OIF servicemembers from the  Contingency Tracking System deployment and activation data files. We  then worked with officials from DOD\u2019s Army Medical Surveillance Activity  (AMSA) to identify which OEF/OIF servicemembers had responded  positively to one, two, three, or four of the four PTSD screening questions  on the DD 2796 questionnaire. AMSA maintains a database of all  servicemembers\u2019 completed DD 2796s. The DD 2796 is a questionnaire that  DOD uses to identify servicemembers who may be at risk for developing  PTSD after their deployment and contains the four PTSD screening  questions that may identify these servicemembers. The four questions are:  Have you ever had any experience that was so frightening, horrible, or  upsetting that, in the past month, you    have had any nightmares about it or thought about it when you did not  want to?  tried hard not to think about it or went out of your way to avoid situations  that remind you of it?    were constantly on guard, watchful, or easily startled?  felt numb or detached from others, activities, or your surroundings?", "Because a servicemember may have been deployed more than once, some  servicemembers\u2019 records at AMSA included more than one completed   DD 2796. We obtained information from the DD 2796 that was completed  following the servicemembers\u2019 most recent deployment in support of  OEF/OIF. We removed from our review servicemembers who either did  not have a DD 2796 on file at AMSA or completed a DD 2796 prior to DOD  adding the four PTSD screening questions to the questionnaire in   April 2003. In all, we reviewed DD 2796\u2019s completed by 178,664 OEF/OIF  servicemembers. To determine the criteria we would use to identify  OEF/OIF servicemembers who may have been at risk for developing  PTSD, we reviewed the clinical practice guideline for PTSD developed  jointly by VA and DOD, which states that three or more positive responses  to the four questions indicate a risk for developing PTSD. Further, we  reviewed a retrospective study that found that those individuals who  provided three or four positive responses to the four PTSD screening  questions were highly likely to have been previously given a diagnosis of  PTSD prior to the screening. To determine the number of OEF/OIF  servicemembers who may be at risk for developing PTSD and were  referred for further mental health evaluations, we asked AMSA to identify  OEF/OIF servicemembers whose DD 2796 forms indicated that they were  referred for further mental health or combat/operational stress reaction  evaluations by a DOD health care provider.", "To examine whether DOD has reasonable assurance that OEF/OIF  veterans who needed further mental health evaluations received referrals,  we reviewed DOD\u2019s policies and guidance, as well as policies and  guidance for each of the military service branches (Army, Navy, Air Force,  and Marines). Based on electronic testing of logical elements and our  previous work on the completeness and accuracy of AMSA\u2019s centralized  database, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "NDAA also directed us to determine the number of OEF/OIF veterans who,  because of their referrals, accessed DOD or VA health care services to  obtain a further mental health or combat/operational stress reaction  evaluation. However, as discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, we  could not use data from OEF/OIF veterans\u2019 DD 2796 forms to determine if  veterans accessed DOD or VA health care services because of their mental  health referrals. DOD officials explained that the referral checked on the  DD 2796 cannot be linked to a subsequent health care visit using DOD  computerized data. Therefore, we could not determine how many  OEF/OIF veterans accessed DOD or VA health care services for further  mental health evaluations because of their referrals. We conducted our  work from December 2004 through April 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, key contributors to this report  were Marcia A.
