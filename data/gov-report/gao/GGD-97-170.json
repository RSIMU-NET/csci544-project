In addition to the primary comparisons required by our objectives, we also developed additional analyses of physicians\u2019 compensation, which are discussed in appendix I.", "In our previous report on federal/private sector pay comparisons, we noted that experts in labor market analysis suggested that federal/private compensation comparisons that focus exclusively on pay may be misleading. A more complete analysis of total compensation would be needed to consider factors such as differences in pay plans and job responsibilities, federal restrictions limiting amounts of either basic or special pay, working conditions, job satisfaction, and risks of being laid off. This would apply to comparisons among federal positions as well. Because much of this information was not available from studies of physicians\u2019 pay and because of the time constraints for completing this review, we only obtained pay-type information for federal and private sector physicians and did not assess these other factors. In addition, as agreed, we did not evaluate the significance of recruitment or retention problems upon which PCAs are based. Therefore, we did not attempt to make conclusions or recommendations on the sufficiency, size, or continued need for PCAs under title 5.", "On the basis of our preliminary work, we agreed to obtain physicians\u2019 pay and benefit information for full-time federal physicians paid under titles 5, 37, and 38 of the U.S. Code. In doing our work, we interviewed officials from HHS, DOD, VA, OPM, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to obtain descriptive information on the various types of pay and benefits that physicians received and on recent actions that affect or have the potential to affect physicians\u2019 pay. HHS, VA, DOD, and the Commissioned Corps provided us with payroll information, which we used to make our comparisons. Unless otherwise stated, except for military physicians, federal physicians\u2019 pay data in this report are for calendar year 1996. We did not verify the pay information we obtained. Our scope and methodology are described in greater detail in appendix III.", "We also purchased and reviewed several studies on physicians\u2019 compensation that were prepared by private consulting firms. These studies contained pay information for physicians in various medical specialties who were employed primarily in group practices, health maintenance organizations (HMO), and hospitals.

Federal physicians paid under titles 37 and 38 and some HHS physicians eligible for title 38 special pay could receive special pay based on their certifications as specialists by one of the recognized American Medical or Osteopathic Specialty Examining Boards. Such special payments included board-certified pay, incentive and scarce-specialty pay, and multiyear special pay.", "In selected medical specialties in which large numbers of federal and private physicians practiced (general surgery, internal medicine, psychiatry, and family practice), our comparison of pay information from studies of private sector physicians\u2019 pay and the pay of federal physicians who were paid under titles 37 and 38 showed that private sector physicians were generally paid more.

The provisions that were delegated related directly to pay rates and systems, premium pay, position classification, and hours of work. The purpose of this delegation was to give these departments additional flexibilities to maintain quality health-care staffs. As of May 1997, HHS was the only agency to have used this expanded authority to provide special pay to its physicians. Information on how HHS used this title 38 pay authority showed that, based on average pay, HHS physicians paid under title 38 earned $17,825 more than HHS physicians receiving PCAs.", "According to an HHS official, HHS agencies\u2019 use of title 38 pay authorities has enabled HHS to remain reasonably competitive with salary levels in the private sector. Another HHS official said that budgetary constraints have limited the number of physicians who can receive title 38 special pay and have forced HHS to concentrate on positions for which recruitment and retention have historically been difficult. For example, the FDA has focused its efforts on providing title 38 special pay to supervisors and team leaders.", "Another action that has the potential to affect physicians\u2019 pay involved VA. VA indicated that some thought was being given to changing the manner in which its physicians are paid. In 1995 and 1996, a task force appointed by VA\u2019s Under Secretary for Health met to discuss the development of a new pay system for physicians and dentists. The task force\u2019s objectives were to design a pay system that used a total salary concept that continued to consider local pay markets along with a new incentive pay component to reward exceptional performance and productivity.", "VA officials told us that, as of July 1997, the Veterans Health Administration was continuing to examine issues dealing with types of information available regarding local market pay and how to measure and link clinical performance and total salaries. Instead of physicians being automatically entitled to special pay by virtue of their length of service, geographic location, or medical specialty, the system under discussion would consider the local market, an individual\u2019s performance and experience, and other relevant factors in determining physicians\u2019 pay.
