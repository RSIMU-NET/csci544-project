VETS provides states with grants for DVOP and LVER staff to provide veterans and eligible persons employment and training opportunities, with priority given to the needs of disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era, through the states\u2019 employment service systems established under the Wagner-Peyser Act. As part of the DVOP and LVER grant agreements, states must provide or ensure veterans\u2019 priority and other special considerations in the provision of services to veterans at every point where the public employment and training delivery system services are available.

Bill, the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944. DVOP specialists were initially established by executive order in 1977 and later authorized by the Veterans\u2019 Rehabilitation and Education Amendments of 1980. Although DVOP and LVER staff are employees of their states\u2019 employment service systems, their positions are funded by grants to the states administered by VETS, and they are to serve veterans exclusively. Furthermore, the duties of DVOP and LVER staff are specified by federal law and include outreach to locate veterans, job development for veterans, networking in the community for employment and training programs, providing labor exchange services to veterans, making referrals to support services, and case management.", "The state VETS directors monitor local employment offices to determine whether DVOP and LVER staff are carrying out these duties. For example, they examine the performance of assigned DVOP and LVER staff in such areas as job development assistance, employer visits, and case management. DVOP and LVER staff have many similar job duties\u2014such as networking with employers, veterans\u2019 organizations, federal agencies, and community-based organizations. The primary focus for DVOP specialists is on locating veterans with disabilities and other barriers to employment and assisting them in removing barriers and finding jobs and job training opportunities.

The DVOP and LVER grant agreements include assurances by states that LVER staff and DVOP specialists serve eligible veterans exclusively. Under federal law, all state employment service staff must give priority to veterans over nonveterans for services; the assignment of DVOP or LVER staff does not relieve other local employment office staff of their requirement to provide priority service to veterans. To implement this priority service, for example, states may place a 24-hour \u201chold\u201d on a new \u201cjob order\u201d received from an employer until veterans can be identified and contacted.

For example, in fiscal year 1997, the number of DVOP specialist positions funded (1,568) was 78 percent of the statutory number of positions (2,008), and the number of LVER staff positions funded (1,340) was 84 percent of the statutory number of positions (1,600). Furthermore, funding for the DVOP grant, adjusted for inflation, declined by 19 percent over the past 10 years.

At that time, VETS publishes the number of positions each state should receive according to the statutory funding level for both DVOP and LVER grants. Based on this information, states submit requests for funding on a worksheet that documents, for each grant, the number of positions, the cost of salaries and benefits, the state\u2019s cost per position for DVOP and LVER staff, and the total funds the state is requesting. As part of the allocation request, states are required to calculate the proportion of the DVOP and LVER grants used for administrative and support expenses. Administrative and support expenses associated with the DVOP and LVER grants differ across the states. These expenses include costs such as travel, supplies, a portion of central office personnel, communications, rent, and utilities. When appropriations for the DVOP and LVER grants do not support the number of statutorily authorized positions, each state\u2019s share of the appropriation is calculated on the basis of a proportionate reduction.", "Because DVOP and LVER grants are multiyear grants, the grant funds are adjusted annually. After the first year of a grant period, states submit a modification or revised request for funds that includes a new worksheet reflecting updated costs for each year of the grant cycle. In fiscal year 1995, for example, states requested funding according to the statutory funding levels. However, in fiscal year 1996, VETS directed states to submit grant modifications based on a 5-percent reduction from their initial 1995 grant award. In fiscal year 1997, VETS directed states to submit proposed modifications based on VETS\u2019 estimated amount for each grant by state.", "After VETS notifies states of their actual grant allocations, the states must submit state fiscal operating plans that show planned quarterly DVOP and LVER spending plans. This becomes an important document as the states proceed through the grant year because VETS uses these documents to adjust each state\u2019s grant amount, if necessary, during the year. Each quarter, VETS reviews state obligations and expenditures against state fiscal operating plans. VETS has the authority to reallocate up to 95 percent of unobligated DVOP and LVER funds at the end of each quarter from states with excess funds to states that request additional funding through a grant modification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DVOP State Allocations", "paragraphs": ["VETS uses the formula specified in the law\u2014one DVOP specialist for each 6,900 veterans residing in the state who are either veterans of the Vietnam era, veterans who first entered active duty as a member of the armed forces after May 7, 1975, or disabled veterans\u2014together with cost information from each state to determine the amount of funding for each state. First, VETS determines (1) the number of veterans residing in a state who are Vietnam- and post-Vietnam-era veterans and (2) the number of disabled veterans residing in a state\u2014those receiving either VA compensation or receiving military disability compensation through a medical discharge or retirement. These two factors are added\u2014which may result in some double counting\u2014and the sum is divided by 6,900 to determine the number of DVOP specialists for the state. The state\u2019s funding allocation is computed by multiplying the number of DVOP specialists by the state\u2019s cost per position. This allocation is then adjusted proportionately on the basis of the actual funds appropriated\u2014which has generally supported fewer positions than the number of positions determined by statute. For example, the state with the largest DVOP population, California, should have had 256 DVOP specialists by statute in fiscal year 1997 but projected that funding would support 180 positions, or 30 percent fewer. (See app. III for an example of the formula calculation and the underlying data used to calculate the number of statutory DVOP positions for fiscal year 1997.)", "The cost per DVOP position varies from state to state. In fiscal year 1997, the average projected cost per DVOP position was $51,431 but ranged from $24,222 to $67,333. Of the 50 states, those with the highest costs per DVOP position (over $65,000) included Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, New York, and Wisconsin; those with the lowest costs per DVOP position were Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina, and West Virginia. The variation in cost across the states results from the differences in each state\u2019s salary and administrative and support expenses. For example, for fiscal year 1997, the average administrative and support costs for the DVOP grant were 25.3 percent of the grant but were as high as about 35 percent in Wisconsin and as low as 18 percent in Alaska and Delaware (see figs. 4 and 5).

The first part of the formula provides that each state receive the number of LVER positions it had on board as of January 1, 1987, plus 1 additional position, bringing the national total to 1,439. The second part of the formula dictates how the remaining 161 positions will be allocated across the states by taking an average of three factors relating to the number of veterans in a state, the number of veterans registered for employment assistance, and the number of full-service local employment service offices. Like the DVOP funding, VETS adjusts state allocations proportionately according to actual appropriations. For example, the state with the most LVER positions by statute\u2014California, with 121 positions\u2014projected that it could fund 100.5 LVER positions with the fiscal year 1997 appropriation.

In recent testimony, we criticized VETS\u2019 current performance standards because they focus more on process than on results and noted that performance is evaluated only in relative, not absolute, terms. VETS officials are aware of weaknesses in the current performance measurement system and are currently assessing better ways to measure services provided to veterans and to evaluate the impact of those services. VETS would like to put greater emphasis on results, but VETS is uncertain whether it will develop measures based on absolute levels of service to veterans. Several states are conducting pilot programs to measure alternative ways of measuring performance; however, states are being held accountable to the current performance standards during the pilot period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VETS Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["As required by federal law, VETS has established performance standards to determine state compliance with requirements to provide employment services to veterans, evaluating states in five service categories: (1) veterans placed in or obtaining employment, (2) Vietnam-era veterans and special disabled veterans placed in jobs on the Federal Contractor Job Listing, (3) veterans counseled, (4) veterans placed in training, and (5) veterans who received some reportable service. To ensure priority service to veterans, VETS expects veterans to be served at a rate exceeding the service to nonveterans. Veterans and eligible persons should be served at a rate 15 percent higher than nonveterans, Vietnam-era veterans at a rate 20 percent higher, and disabled veterans at a rate 25 percent higher. Placement rates for special disabled veterans in jobs listed by federal contractors should also be 25 percent higher than the rate for nonveterans. Thus, if a state\u2019s placement rate for nonveterans was 8.55 percent, the placement rate for veterans should be 9.83, or 15 percent higher than the nonveteran placement rate.", "For program year 1995, the national placement rate for nonveterans was 20.4 percent and so the veterans\u2019 placement standard was 23.5 percent. The actual placement rate for veterans was 26.1 percent, which exceeded the standard. (See table 1.) The only area where a substantial number of states failed to meet the standards was in \u201creportable services.\u201d In over half of these cases, the state\u2019s standard was at 100 percent or more. Iowa, for instance, categorizes formulating employment development plans\u2014which also involves counseling and interviewing\u2014as a reportable service; because this is done for every employment service client, it is impossible for veterans to be served at a higher rate than nonveterans. (See app. VII for program year 1995 performance, by state, for all five service categories.)", "States must meet the minimum goals but can negotiate higher goals with the VETS state director. For program year 1995, 24 states negotiated higher goals for one or more of the veteran groups. For example, New York increased each goal by 1 percentage point simply because the state wanted to do a bit better than the floor levels established by VETS. Idaho increased all of its performance standard goals by 5 percentage points and met its goals. Wisconsin had increased all goals but failed to meet several performance standards during program year 1995; for program year 1996, Wisconsin renegotiated its goals to the minimum required level.", "The current system for measuring service to veterans sets the base standard to the number of nonveteran applicants served. Consequently, a state that has a poor level of service to nonveterans would be held to a lower standard for service to veterans than a state with a better overall performance. For example, in one state with a low placement rate for nonveteran applicants (5.62 percent) for program year 1995, the state was required to place 363 veteran applicants, or 6.47 percent of its total veteran applicants. In this instance, the state met its performance standard by placing 416 of its veteran applicants. On the other hand, a state with a higher placement rate for nonveterans did not meet its performance standard even though it placed nearly 22 percent of its veteran applicants. (See fig. 8.)", "VETS officials monitor state compliance with the performance standards and are required to report annually to the Congress on the states\u2019 success in meeting the performance standards. If a state does not meet a performance standard, VETS officials must decide either to accept the state\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d explanation or to require a corrective action plan. During program year 1995, VETS determined that all but 15 states met their performance standards. Failure to meet one or more of the quantitative performance standards, however, does not itself constitute failure to provide priority services to veterans. State and regional VETS officials identify other factors that may affect the delivery of quality services before making any noncompliance determinations. For example, a state\u2019s placement rate for nonveteran applicants may be artificially inflated. In particular, one state has numerous migrant seasonal farmworkers registered at local employment service offices, thereby establishing an artificially high baseline against which placement rates for veterans are measured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VETS Plans to Revise Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["VETS has directed its field staff and state partners to provide input regarding the development, piloting, and evaluation of new performance measurement systems. VETS officials have characterized the present measurement system as activity- and volume-driven, providing states little incentive to focus services on those veterans who are marginally job ready or are most in need of intensive employability development services. According to the Acting Assistant Secretary for VETS, absolute levels of performance would be desirable, but it would be difficult to establish absolute standards that could take into account variances in state situations such as economic factors and geographic size. However, VETS is currently testing new ways of measuring performance. The states that are piloting new initiatives are Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, and Utah.

When filling DVOP and LVER staff positions, states generally make a priority list from qualified and available candidates and, if candidates cannot be found that fit the federal eligibility requirements, the state would present the list to the state VETS director for concurrence.

State VETS directors explained that since a memorandum of understanding was signed August 1, 1995, between VETS and VR&C, networking efforts between DVOP and LVER staff and VR&C staff have generally improved. They said a point of contact is usually established within the state\u2019s employment service office and this individual obtains information from VR&C regarding clients who are job ready; the point of contact then refers the client to the appropriate DVOP or LVER staff in the area where the client would like to work.

Seventy percent of those DVOP specialists and 85 percent of those LVER staff spent up to 6 days per month on TAP activities. TAP operates as a partnership between the Departments of Labor, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, and its activities generally involve conducting workshops to help military personnel and their spouses make decisions as they move from military service to civilian life and to help transfer military experience into a civilian job or career. Workshops include instruction in conducting successful job searches, career decision-making, current occupational and labor market conditions, and resum\u00e9 and cover letter preparation.
