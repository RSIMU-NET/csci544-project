DOD established the Defense Critical Infrastructure Program (DCIP) to assure the availability of mission-critical infrastructure. GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which DOD has (1) incorporated aspects of DCIP into its exercises in the Transportation Defense Sector and (2) developed DCIP training standards departmentwide and made installation personnel aware of existing DCIP expertise. GAO examined a nonprojectable sample of 46 critical assets representing the four military services, five combatant commands, and selected installations within five defense sectors. GAO reviewed relevant DOD DCIP guidance and documents and interviewed cognizant officials regarding DCIP exercises, training, and awareness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) and the installations GAO visited that have critical transportation assets have incorporated aspects of critical infrastructure assurance into their exercises. DOD's DCIP guidance requires the combatant commands and the military services to conduct annual DCIP exercises, either separately or in conjunction with existing exercises. DCIP guidance also requires commanders to ensure submission of lessons learned from these exercises. For example, TRANSCOM has included aspects of critical infrastructure assurance in its two major biennial exercises. Although military personnel at 13 of the 19 installations GAO visited that have critical transportation assets generally were not aware of DCIP, GAO found that all 19 of these installations conduct routine exercises that often involve aspects of critical infrastructure assurance, and they incorporate lessons learned from past exercises into future exercises. For example, personnel at these installations conduct antiterrorism, emergency management, and continuity of operations planning exercises that often include critical assets located on the installation. While several of the combatant commands and military services included in GAO's review of the five defense sectors have independently developed DCIP training at the headquarters level, DOD has not yet developed DCIP training standards departmentwide, and installation personnel remained largely unaware of existing DCIP expertise. DOD's DCIP instruction requires the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas' Security Affairs (ASD[HD&ASA]) to provide policy and guidance for DCIP and oversee the implementation of DCIP education, training, and awareness of goals and objectives. ASD(HD&ASA) recognizes the need for DCIP training and program awareness, as noted in its March 2008 critical infrastructure strategy. However, given the newness of the strategy, ASD(HD&ASA) has not yet established departmentwide DCIP training standards for assuring the availability of critical infrastructure or a time frame for implementing the training standards. In the absence of established DCIP training standards, the combatant commands and military services are variously developing and implementing their own DCIP training programs. For example, the Navy has established an information assurance training program that includes a DCIP module. Furthermore, installation personnel GAO spoke with, with few exceptions, were not familiar with DCIP or aware of DCIP expertise at the combatant command and military service headquarters levels. In addition, DOD has not developed an effective way to communicate to installation personnel the existence of DCIP expertise. Consequently, they rely on other, more established programs that in some cases do not emphasize the consideration of the full spectrum of threats and hazards. Without DCIP training standards departmentwide and a means of communicating them to installation personnel, the combatant commands and military services potentially may develop mutually redundant or inconsistent training programs, and installation personnel will continue to be unaware of existing DCIP expertise."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on a global network of DOD- and  non-DOD-owned critical infrastructure to carry out its missions, and the  incapacitation or destruction of one or more of the assets constituting this  network could have a debilitating effect on DOD\u2019s ability to project,  support, and sustain its forces and operations worldwide. Because of its  importance to DOD operations, this critical infrastructure represents an  attractive target to adversaries and may also be vulnerable to a host of  natural disasters and accidents. In September 2003, the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Americas\u2019  Security Affairs (ASD) was assigned responsibility for DOD\u2019s  critical infrastructure protection efforts. ASD(HD&ASA) subsequently  issued guidance in August 2005 establishing the Defense Critical  Infrastructure Program (DCIP) to assure the availability of mission-critical  infrastructure and articulating the roles and responsibilities for DOD  organizations involved in the program. Under DCIP, DOD created   10 functionally based defense sectors and designated a Defense  Infrastructure Sector Lead Agent (hereinafter referred to as sector lead  agent) for each sector. DOD also created several other complementary  programs, including the Antiterrorism Program, established to protect  DOD assets and personnel from terrorist acts, and the Information  Assurance Program, established to protect and defend DOD information  and information systems. Both programs predate DCIP, yet they  contribute indirectly to the protection and assurance of critical assets.  Although not the focus of this report, these complementary programs  indirectly support elements of DCIP.", "In response to your request, we have thus far issued six reports since May  2007. Our first report examined the extent to which DOD has developed a  comprehensive management plan for DCIP and the actions needed to  identify, prioritize, and assess defense critical infrastructure. The second  report examined DOD\u2019s efforts to implement a risk management approach  for defense industrial base critical assets. The third report examined the  extent to which DOD included highly sensitive assets in its critical  infrastructure program. The fourth report focused on threats and  vulnerabilities affecting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  (ISR) operations at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada. The fifth report  focused on DOD\u2019s efforts to assure the availability of critical assets in the  Transportation Defense Sector. Finally, the sixth report focused on DOD\u2019s  efforts to assure the availability of critical infrastructure in the Space, ISR,  and Global Information Grid (GIG) Defense Sectors (referred to as the   Tri-Sector throughout this report). All of our related products are listed in  the Related GAO Products section at the end of this report.", "In 2007, we reported that DCIP implementation at the department, military  service, and combatant command headquarters levels was relatively  immature. To determine the status of DOD\u2019s efforts regarding DCIP  training and exercises, this report examines the extent to which DOD has  (1) incorporated aspects of DCIP into its exercises in the Transportation  Defense Sector and (2) developed DCIP training standards  departmentwide and made installation personnel aware of existing DCIP  expertise. Our recent work examining the assurance of critical  infrastructure focused on 5 of the 10 defense sectors: GIG, ISR, Public  Works, Space, and Transportation. This report\u2019s objective examining the  extent to which DOD has incorporated aspects of DCIP into its exercises  in the Transportation Defense Sector focused on DCIP-related exercises  conducted by U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) and on  exercises conducted at individual installations we visited that have critical  transportation assets. For our second objective, the scope of our work on  the extent to which DOD has developed DCIP training standards  departmentwide and made installation personnel aware of existing DCIP  expertise focused on efforts at the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD); at the four military services; within five combatant commands\u2014 U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), U.S. European Command, U.S.  Pacific Command (PACOM), U.S. Strategic Command, and TRANSCOM;  and at selected installations that have critical assets representing each of  the five defense sectors that we visited. Regarding DCIP awareness, the  scope of our work focused on installation personnel who are responsible  for critical transportation assets.", "We drew a nonprobability sample of critical assets in the United States  and abroad, using draft critical asset lists developed by the Joint Staff,  each of the four military services, TRANSCOM, the Defense Intelligence  Agency, and the Defense Information Systems Agency. We selected assets  for our review based on the following criteria: (1) overlap among the  various critical asset lists; (2) geographic dispersion among geographic  combatant commands\u2019 areas of responsibility; (3) representation from  each military service; and (4) with respect to transportation assets,  representation in TRANSCOM\u2019s three asset categories: air bases, seaports,  and commercial airports. Using this methodology, we selected 46 total  critical assets for review\u201422 transportation assets and 24 Tri-Sector  assets\u2014in the United States and in Europe, the Middle East, and the  Pacific region.", "Further, we reviewed relevant DOD guidance pertaining to DCIP training  and exercise requirements and interviewed officials from OSD, the Joint  Staff, defense agencies, the military services, combatant commands, and  sector lead agents responsible for DCIP.

However, unlike DCIP, some  of these programs do not emphasize an all-threats, all-hazards approach to  assuring critical infrastructure. DOD guidance requires the testing of  antiterrorism and continuity of operations plans annually through  various exercises. DOD\u2019s antiterrorism guidance requires that  commanders maintain antiterrorism exercise documentation for no less  than 2 years to ensure incorporation of lessons learned. These  antiterrorism exercises often contain aspects of DCIP, such as   (1) developing adaptive plans and procedures to mitigate risk,   (2) restoring capability in the event of a loss or degradation of assets,   (3) supporting incident management, and (4) protecting critical  infrastructure-related sensitive information. For example, even though  installation personnel are often unaware of DCIP, we found that exercises  testing antiterrorism and continuity of operations plans typically include  critical installation infrastructure, and exercises for emergency  management plans sometimes include assuring the availability of critical  transportation assets in the event of natural disasters. Several installations  in Japan that we visited conducted exercises that assure the availability of  critical transportation assets located on those installations. Also, several  installation officials responsible for critical transportation assets in  PACOM\u2019s area of responsibility with whom we met told us that they  conduct exercises that examine the impact of natural disasters, such as  earthquakes and typhoons, on critical infrastructure. Installation officials  responsible for critical transportation assets in CENTCOM\u2019s area of  responsibility told us that they incorporate lessons learned into future  exercises. For instance, an installation in the Middle East used exercises  to prepare for its response to and recovery from major accidents, natural  disasters, attacks, or terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological,  nuclear, or high-yield explosives, and has incorporated its findings into  planning for future exercises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Developed DCIP Training Standards Departmentwide, and Installation Personnel Remain Unaware of Existing DCIP Expertise", "paragraphs": ["Although several of the combatant commands and military services we  visited have variously developed headquarters-level DCIP training  programs, DOD has not developed DCIP training standards  departmentwide.

Specifically, the strategy states that  ASD(HD&ASA) will establish baseline critical infrastructure education  requirements. Given that this strategy is relatively new, DCIP training  standards have not yet been established departmentwide nor has DOD  established a time frame for implementing the training standards.  However, in the absence of DCIP training standards departmentwide, we  determined through our work examining the five defense sectors that  several combatant commands and military services have independently  developed their own training programs or modules. For example, PACOM  officials stated that they have conducted internal PACOM training and  education on critical infrastructure assurance. U.S. Strategic Command  has conducted internal training and continuous education for its staff.", "Further, TRANSCOM and CENTCOM officials told us that they have  developed critical infrastructure training for their headquarters-level  personnel. Additionally, CENTCOM officials told us that the development  of their internal critical infrastructure training was still in its initial stages.  Conversely, U.S. European Command officials told us that they are  currently focused almost exclusively on identifying critical infrastructure  and threats to those assets.", "Moreover, the Department of the Navy has developed a DCIP training  module that it has incorporated into its information assurance training.  The module provides an overview of critical infrastructure protection and  the vulnerabilities created by increased interdependencies. The U.S.  Marine Corps has begun familiarizing its installation antiterrorism officers  with DCIP through required training for its Critical Asset Management  System, used by the U.S. Marine Corps to track critical infrastructure. Air  Force officials told us that they have a mission assurance training module  that includes critical infrastructure protection, and like the U.S. Marine  Corps, they conduct training for major Air Force commands on their  version of the Critical Asset Management System. Further, officials we  spoke with at the Air Mobility Command\u2014an Air Force major command  and subcomponent command to TRANSCOM\u2014told us that they provide  annual DCIP training to their air mobility wings. Army officials we met  with did not identify Army-specific DCIP training but stated that training  needs to be comprehensive and not defense sector specific.", "However, because there are no DCIP training standards departmentwide  and combatant command- and military service-level training has not  reached installation personnel responsible for assuring the availability of  defense critical infrastructure, installation personnel rely on other, more  established programs, such as the Antiterrorism Program. However, unlike  DCIP, some of these programs do not emphasize consideration of the full  spectrum of threats and hazards that can compromise the availability of  critical infrastructure. For example, the Antiterrorism Program focuses  on terrorist threats to assets and personnel. While some DCIP training  exists, the combatant commands\u2019 and military services\u2019 development of  disparate training programs, without benefit of DCIP training standards  departmentwide, may result in programs that contain potentially  conflicting information.
