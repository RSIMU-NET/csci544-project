As shown below, most denied boardings are passengers who \u201cvoluntarily\u201d gave up their seat for compensation of the airline's choosing, such as airline vouchers.

For example, on March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) ordered the immediate grounding of the Boeing 737  MAX aircraft. As a result, some airlines were forced to substitute smaller  aircraft on some of their flights, among other actions, resulting in a  significant number of passengers being denied boarding involuntarily.  Regardless of the cause, involuntary denied boardings can be  inconvenient and costly for passengers.", "The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring that  airlines adhere to federal consumer protections afforded to passengers,  including those related to airlines\u2019 denied boarding practices.

We also analyzed passenger complaint data  on denied boardings submitted to DOT by passengers from 2012 through  2018 to identify the frequency, types, and changes in the number and  types of complaints submitted to DOT over time. To assess the reliability  of the denied boarding data, we reviewed relevant federal regulations  describing airlines\u2019 reporting requirements for denied boardings and DOT  technical directives, which provide additional information to airlines on the  types of data they are required to report and how to report such  information to DOT. For both the denied boardings and passenger  complaint data, we analyzed the data and compared it to published DOT  reports to search for outliers or data anomalies. We also interviewed  DOT program officials to confirm that DOT had not made any changes to  how either data source are collected or reported since our last review in  2018. Since we determined that no changes had been made to the  processes, we also relied on our 2018 data reliability assessment.

To identify airlines\u2019 actions to reduce  denied boardings or mitigate the effect of such actions on passengers, we  interviewed representatives from one airline industry association and two  consumer advocate organizations, as well as three airline revenue  management specialists. We selected these stakeholders based on the  following factors: their inclusion in prior GAO reports, their relevant role  regarding denied boardings or airline revenue management, and  recommendations from other stakeholders or DOT.

Successfully overbooking requires that airlines  accurately predict the number of passengers who will not show up for a  given flight. In deciding how much to overbook flights, airlines use  historical data to identify factors that make passengers more or less likely  to show up for their flights; these factors can be passenger or flight  specific. For example, according to representatives from an airline  industry association, leisure passengers are less likely than business  passengers to change their flights at the last minute, because their tickets  typically have more restrictions and higher change fees. As a result,  according to these representatives, airlines generally oversell fewer seats  on flights heavily traveled by leisure passengers, such as flights during  the holiday season or flights to common vacation destinations (e.g.,  Disney World). Similarly, these same representatives said that airlines are  less likely to overbook the last flight of the day on a given route because  passengers are more likely to show up for these flights.", "A number of other factors, in addition to overbookings, can lead to airlines  denying boarding to passengers. These factors can be driven by safety  concerns, operational necessity, or personnel needs. For example, a  passenger may be denied boarding for safety or security reasons if they  are too intoxicated to fly or if they are unruly (e.g., they get into a fight).  Passengers may also be denied boarding to accommodate flight crews  that need to get to a different location or U.S. air marshals, who tend to  book flights near planned departure times.", "DOT does not regulate airlines\u2019 overbooking practices, aside from  requiring airlines to inform passengers that a flight may be overbooked.  Instead, DOT\u2019s regulations primarily focus on oversales, which can be the  result of an overbooking and occur when some passengers with  confirmed space on a flight cannot be accommodated (i.e., \u201cdenied  boardings\u201d). Passengers are voluntarily denied boarding if they willingly  accept the airline\u2019s offer of compensation, in any amount, in exchange for  relinquishing their confirmed seat. Any other passenger denied boarding  is considered to have been denied boarding involuntarily. Because of  these regulations, airlines generally have a standard process for denying  boarding to passengers, both voluntarily and involuntarily, and  communicating denied boarding information to passengers.", "When a flight is oversold, airlines are required to solicit passengers to  voluntarily give up their seats, before denying boarding to passengers  involuntarily. To encourage passengers to volunteer to relinquish their  seat, airlines may offer incentives, such as money or vouchers for future  flights. There is no minimum or maximum amount of money or vouchers  that the airline is required to offer, and passengers can negotiate  compensation amounts. Federal regulation requires that airlines inform  each passenger solicited to volunteer for denied boarding whether they  are in danger of being involuntarily denied boarding and, if so, the  compensation the airline is obligated to pay. In cases where a flight is  oversold and airlines do not get enough volunteers who are willing to  relinquish their seat, they will select passengers to give up their seats  involuntarily\u2014sometimes referred to as being \u201cbumped.\u201d", "Airlines are required by regulation to establish boarding priority rules  detailing the factors they consider when selecting passengers to be  denied boarding involuntarily. These factors may include when the  passenger checks in, the fare paid, and the passenger\u2019s frequent flyer  status. However, according to DOT\u2019s website, the criteria cannot subject  a passenger to any unjust or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.  For example, an airline cannot use a passenger\u2019s race when making  decisions about denied boardings. Further, some airlines make  exceptions to their boarding priority rules for passengers with disabilities,  including generally not denying them boarding.", "Airlines are required to compensate certain passengers who are denied  boarding involuntarily. Minimum compensation amounts are set in  regulation and, as shown in table 1 below, vary based on the price of the  ticket, the length of time the passenger is delayed reaching their  destination, and whether the flight\u2019s arrival airport is domestic or  international. Airlines generally must provide compensation by cash or  check when the passenger is denied boarding involuntarily, in addition to  a written statement explaining the terms, conditions, and limitations of the  compensation, and describing the airlines\u2019 boarding priority rules and  criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Denied Boardings Have Declined in Recent Years, but Some Passengers Denied Boarding Reported Significant Inconveniences", "paragraphs": ["The total number of passengers denied boarding\u2014voluntarily or  involuntarily\u2014 generally decreased from 2012 to 2018. Moreover,  denied boardings represented a small percentage of the total number of  passengers who boarded flights. On an annual basis, denied boardings  accounted for between about 44 (in 2018) and about 100 (in 2012)  passengers per 100,000 actual boardings\u2014a rate of less than 0.1 percent  of actual boardings. As illustrated in figure 1, of these passengers  denied boarding, most are voluntary. For example, in 2018, for every  100,000 actual boardings, about 43 passengers were voluntarily denied  boarding and about one passenger was involuntarily denied boarding.", "Passenger complaints submitted directly to DOT about denied boardings  also generally decreased from 2012 to 2018, relative to total complaints  and passenger boardings.

On an annual basis,  from 2012 through 2018, the number of complaints about denied  boardings reported to DOT ranged from about 410 (in 2018) to about 650  (in 2015). We have previously reported, however, that DOT\u2019s complaint  data provide an incomplete picture of all passenger complaints because  passengers may not be aware that they can report complaints to DOT,  and DOT\u2019s complaint data do not include complaints from passengers  submitted directly to airlines. Specifically, in 2018, we reported that  across all complaint categories, DOT estimated it received one complaint  for every 50 complaints the airline receives.", "In an effort to avoid denied boardings, airlines can, in some cases,  accommodate passengers in a different section of the aircraft, either by  upgrading or downgrading passengers. A revenue management specialist  and representatives from an airline industry association we interviewed  said that, with limited exceptions, airlines generally do not overbook their  premium cabins. Our review of DOT data found that in recent years, until  2018, airlines have generally upgraded fewer passengers to avoid denied  boardings. According to representatives from an airline industry  association, the decrease in the number of passengers upgraded is likely  because airlines have fewer empty premium seats in their first-class  cabins than in past years because they are selling more of these seats.  For example, a stakeholder said that airlines are now selling upgrades on  the day of departure and allowing more customers to use miles to  upgrade their seat, leaving fewer available empty premium seats when  flights are oversold.", "DOT permits airlines to downgrade passengers, as long as the airline  refunds the passenger the difference in fares. In practice,  representatives from an airline industry association said that when a  passenger in a premium cabin is to be denied boarding, airlines generally  offer the passenger the option of a premium cabin seat on another flight  or to downgrade to the economy cabin along with compensation for the  fare differential. In our review of seven airline\u2019s contracts of carriage, five  explicitly stated that if passengers are downgraded, they will be entitled to  an appropriate refund, and the other two airlines do not include  information about downgrades in their documents because they do not  have different cabins of service. According to representatives from an  airline industry association, the refund amount is calculated based on the  average difference of fare paid between the two cabins, and it is  dependent on the flight\u2019s origin and destination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Passenger Compensation for Involuntary Denied Boarding", "paragraphs": ["While the average amount of compensation for passengers involuntarily  denied boarding has increased in recent years, a smaller percentage of  such passengers received compensation. As previously mentioned, in  certain situations, passengers who are denied boarding involuntarily may  not be eligible for compensation. For example, airlines are not required to  compensate passengers if an airline uses a smaller aircraft than originally  planned for operational or safety reasons and thus cannot accommodate  all confirmed passengers. Our review found that the percentage of  passengers that were involuntarily denied boarding who qualified for  compensation decreased from 76 percent in 2012 to 64 percent in 2018.", "Aircraft substitution may be contributing to fewer passengers being  eligible for compensation, according to DOT data. For example, one  airline that does not overbook experienced a number of operational  issues in 2016 and 2017 that forced it to operate many of its flights with  smaller aircraft. As a result, the airline had to deny passengers boarding  involuntarily, and these passengers were not eligible for compensation.  As figure 3 shows, from 2015 to 2018, most of the passengers who were  denied boarding involuntarily and were not eligible for compensation were  ineligible due to airlines using smaller aircraft on some flights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects of Involuntary Denied Boardings on Passengers", "paragraphs": ["Although the total number of involuntary denied boardings decreased  from 2012 to 2018, any passenger involuntarily denied boarding could  face varying levels of disruptions to their travel plans. Passengers who  are rebooked on the next scheduled flight may encounter minimal  inconveniences or expenses. However, other passengers may face more  significant travel disruptions, according to representatives from consumer  advocate organizations we interviewed. Our review of a non- generalizable sample of passenger complaints submitted to DOT in May  and June 2019 also identified instances where passengers reported  incurring significant costs in terms of time and money as a result of being  denied boarding involuntarily. For example, one passenger reported  missing a wedding and paid about $450 in additional hotel costs. In  another instance, a passenger missed their cruise after being denied  boarding involuntarily. Consumer advocates also told us that passengers  may incur costs such as lodging, meals, and transportation, or might miss  work as a result of being denied boarding involuntarily.", "Airlines\u2019 ability to rebook passengers who are involuntarily denied  boarding on the next available flight can be limited. Over the past several  years, airlines have increasingly flown with fewer empty seats\u2014 particularly on certain routes\u2014than was typical in the past, according to  DOT data. With fewer open seats, airlines have limited options to rebook  passengers who are denied boarding. For example, across all departing  flights at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2018, on  average, 86 percent of seats were filled. These data represent averages  across all flights and stakeholders said that factors such as time of day,  day of the week, season, and flight origin or destination can affect the  number of empty seats on a particular flight. For example, flights on  Sunday evening tend to be fuller than flights on Tuesday. One airline  revenue management specialist estimated that about 25 to 30 percent of  all flights have no empty seats. Representatives from consumer advocate  organizations that we interviewed said that planes are operating at  record-high levels of capacity, and one advocate stated that no  transportation system is designed to operate at or near capacity all of the  time, which they believe some airlines are doing on certain routes.", "In addition, we have previously reported that service to smaller  communities is generally less frequent, providing airlines with fewer  opportunities to rebook passengers than for more traveled routes.  Airlines may also not be able to rebook passengers who are denied  boarding on a different airline that has seat availability if they lack  commercial agreements to do so. Further, according to representatives from an industry association representing airlines, while most airlines  have agreements in place that allow passengers to be rebooked on a  different airline, these agreements are primarily used to accommodate  passengers on delayed and canceled flights. According to these  representatives, passengers who are denied boarding are almost always  re-accommodated on the same airline, given that the customer typically  volunteers to take a later flight on the same day. Our review of seven  airlines\u2019 contracts of carriage found that four of them have documented  policies in place to rebook passengers who are denied boarding on a  different airline.", "Our review of DOT data found that fewer passengers are being rebooked  on flights that arrive within an hour of their original flight. Specifically, in  2012, 11.5 percent of rebooked passengers were accommodated on such  a flight, compared to 0.11 percent in 2018. While DOT collects data on  passengers who are delayed less than an hour, no other information is  available to measure the amount of time a passenger is delayed when  they are denied boarding. However, based on our review of passenger  complaints, we found instances where passengers reported having to  wait until the following day to board a flight with available seats."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Airlines Have Taken a Range of Actions to Reduce Denied Boardings and Minimize Their Effects on Passengers", "paragraphs": ["Decreases in involuntary denied boardings are due in part to recent  airline actions. As mentioned previously, involuntary denied boardings  can be costly for both passengers whose travel plans are disrupted, and  airlines that have to compensate passengers for such disruptions and  then face criticism for denying boarding to passengers with confirmed  seats. As a result, airlines have taken a range of actions, primarily  intended to reduce such incidents. Some of these actions also provide  additional incentives for passengers to volunteer to be denied boarding.  Moreover, stakeholders, including consumer advocates and an  association representing airlines, agreed that voluntary denied boardings  are preferred to involuntary denied boardings, given that airlines and  passengers willingly accept the outcome.", "Reducing the rate or eliminating overbookings. Some airlines  have reduced their rate of overbooking or eliminated them altogether  in an effort to reduce voluntary and involuntary denied boardings,  according to stakeholders and our prior work. In our 2018 report,  representatives from three airlines told us their airline had reduced or  stopped overbooking flights. Our review of seven airlines\u2019 customer  service documents found that two airlines explicitly stated that they do  not overbook their flights.", "Improving the ability to predict no-shows or rebook passengers.  According to representatives from an industry association  representing airlines, airlines have made investments to improve their  software for predicting the number of passenger no-shows in an effort  to reduce voluntary and involuntary denied boardings. These  representatives also told us that airlines have hired additional  personnel dedicated to more precisely forecasting no-show rates and  proactively identifying rebooking options for passengers who are  denied boarding.", "Improving communication with passengers. Some airlines have  taken steps to notify passengers about potential denied boardings  earlier in the travel process\u2014in some cases before travelers have left  for the airport\u2014in an effort to encourage volunteers, according to  stakeholders we interviewed. These stakeholders said that providing  advance notice likely further reduces any burden on passengers  associated with changing their travel plans. In 2018, five of the nine  airlines we interviewed told us they had begun soliciting volunteers to  give up their seat earlier in the process. More specifically, according  to representatives from an industry association that represents  airlines, some airlines call passengers prior to their arrival at the  airport to gauge their willingness to give up their seat. Other airlines  solicit volunteers at the check-in kiosk, which limits the need for  airlines to identify passengers during the boarding process at the  gate. None of the stakeholders we interviewed described any  communication methods that were specific to passengers with  disabilities. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, four airlines (out  of seven) explicitly state in their contracts of carriage that they  generally do not deny boarding to passengers with disabilities.", "Increasing and diversifying compensation for passengers. Some  airlines have offered additional incentives or increased compensation  amounts to encourage passengers to voluntarily give up their seat.  While airlines have historically provided passengers with travel  vouchers to solicit volunteers, some have started offering alternative  forms of compensation, such as gift cards for Amazon and other  retailers, iPads, or travel vouchers with fewer restrictions or that also  cover ancillary fees.", "Our review of DOT data indicates that relative to the number of  passengers denied boarding involuntarily, more passengers have  volunteered to give up their seat, lessening the need to deny  passengers boarding involuntarily. For example, in 2012, for every  one passenger denied boarding involuntarily, about nine volunteered  to be denied boarding. In contrast, in 2018, for every one passenger  denied boarding involuntarily, about 33 volunteered to be denied  boarding.", "Providing passengers with the opportunity to propose  acceptable voluntary denied boarding compensation. Some  airlines solicit passengers with flexible travel plans to identify  compensation amounts they would willingly accept in exchange for  voluntarily giving up their seats and taking another flight. Once  passengers submit their required compensation amount to the airline,  the airline can then use that information to select passengers with the  lowest amount of required compensation to accept a denied  boarding. This process allows airlines to, among other things,  potentially avoid involuntary denied boardings, and identify which  passengers require the least compensation in exchange for their  travel flexibility. Airlines conduct this process on their website, via their  mobile app, or at the check-in kiosk. In some cases, passengers who  would consider changing their plans in exchange for compensation  provide the airline with a specific dollar amount that they would be  willing to accept to give up their seat. In other cases, airlines require  each passenger to select a predetermined amount of compensation  that they would accept to give up their seat, as illustrated in figure 4.  For example, based on the figure below, an airline that oversold its  flight would select a passenger who volunteered to give up their seat  in exchange for $250, assuming at least one passenger selected that  amount. If no passengers selected that amount, the airline would  identify a passenger with the next lowest amount\u2014in this case, $350.  Our review identified at least three airlines that use this type of  process to solicit volunteers to give up their seats.", "Providing additional tools to employees. According to stakeholders  we interviewed, airlines have given their employees more discretion  regarding the offers they can make to encourage passengers to  volunteer to be denied boarding on an oversold flight, or provide  training on handling such incidents.", "While representatives from both consumer advocate organizations we  interviewed generally supported some of the airlines\u2019 actions to manage  oversold flights, they also identified additional actions that airlines or DOT  could take. Both consumer advocates we spoke to would like to see  airlines increase transparency and passenger education related to denied  boarding compensation. For example, these advocates believe that prior  to agreeing to be voluntarily denied boarding, airlines should be required  to inform passengers: (1) of the current compensation amounts for  involuntary denied boardings, and (2) that compensation can be provided  by cash or check (as opposed to a voucher). Having such information  would allow passengers to make more informed decisions about the  compensation they would willingly accept to be voluntarily denied  boarding. Additionally, one consumer advocate said explicitly that they  would also like airlines to inform passengers who are involuntary denied  boarding that compensation amounts set by DOT are minimum amounts.", "Regarding potential additional actions, the FAA Reauthorization Act of  2018 required that DOT issue a rulemaking clarifying, among other  things, that the compensation amounts set by DOT for involuntary denied  boardings are the minimum compensation amounts that passengers can  receive. In October 2019, DOT officials indicated that DOT intends to  issue its final rule in July 2020. Moreover, in November 2018, we made  three recommendations to DOT to improve its passenger education  efforts by, among other things, capturing feedback from passengers  directly, and identifying available short- and long-term budgetary  resources for these efforts. DOT agreed with our recommendations and  is in the process of implementing them.", "More broadly, both consumer advocates we interviewed called for an end  to overbookings. This could be achieved either voluntarily by airlines or in  regulation by DOT. These advocates said that overbooking is an outdated  practice that protected airlines from high no-show rates during a time  when passengers could make multiple reservations and did not incur  change fees. Given that this is no longer the case, it is not necessary for  airlines to overbook their flights, according to these consumer advocates.  They also pointed out that airlines have significant flexibility in their  business operations, including, denying boarding when a flight is  overbooked, or changing flight schedules. In contrast, passengers have  little, if any, recourse if they need to change their travel plans. Most  tickets have restrictions that prevent passengers from making changes to  their flights without incurring high change fees. Consumer advocates  believe that eliminating overbooking would have limited effects on  airlines, given the restrictions on passengers\u2019 tickets.", "According to three airline revenue management specialists, if airlines  were prohibited from overbooking flights, they would likely end up  operating aircraft with more empty seats, compared to current trends.  Moreover, they also noted that if flights were less full, there could be  certain negative implications for airlines and passengers. For example,  when fewer seats on a flight are filled with paying passengers, airlines\u2019  average costs per passenger are higher because many aspects of  airlines\u2019 operational costs\u2014such as salaries for crew, mechanic services,  and airport landing fees\u2014are generally the same, regardless of the  number of passengers onboard. These same revenue management  specialists also noted that a greater number of empty seats will generally  decrease airline\u2019s revenue. One of them estimated that the reduced  revenues could amount to tens of millions of dollars.", "Some airlines would also likely change their revenue management  practices, according to airline revenue management specialists. Those  changes would largely focus on how airlines price their tickets. While two  airlines have made a business decision not to overbook and have  accepted the financial trade-off, revenue management specialists said  that eliminating overbooking would be difficult for other airlines. In  particular, all three revenue management specialists agreed that if airlines  were prohibited from overbooking, some airlines may offer fewer  discounted fare tickets. Two revenue management specialists also said  that it is likely that airlines would increase the average fare across all  tickets slightly to account for the increased costs and potential lost  revenue. Finally, one revenue management specialist also said that  airlines might add additional restrictions on tickets, such as by increasing  penalties associated with a passenger not showing up for their flight or  cancelling their ticket at the last minute. Moreover, even if airlines  stopped overbooking, some passengers would still be denied boarding  because factors other than overbooking\u2014including some that are beyond  the airline\u2019s control\u2014can lead to denied boardings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment.
