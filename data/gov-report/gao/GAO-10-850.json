Data on these risks--collected through a safety reporting system (SRS) from reports of hazards, incidents, and accidents--can support safety efforts. However, no such system exists for all biological labs, and a limited system--managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)--applies to only a subset of these labs. While a national SRS has been proposed, design and implementation are complex. In this context, GAO was asked to identify lessons from (1) the literature and (2) case studies; and to apply those lessons to (3) assess CDC and APHIS's theft, loss, or release (TLR) system for select agents, such as anthrax, and (4) suggest design and implementation considerations for a labwide SRS. To do its work, GAO analyzed SRS literature; conducted case studies of SRSs in aviation, commercial nuclear, and health care industries; and interviewed agency officials and biosafety specialists."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature, effective design and implementation of a safety reporting system (SRS) includes consideration of program goals and organizational culture to guide decisions in three key areas: (1) reporting and analysis, (2) reporter protection and incentives, and (3) feedback mechanisms. Program goals are best identified through stakeholder involvement and organizational culture, through assessment. Case studies of SRSs in three industries--aviation, commercial nuclear, and health care--indicate that (1) assessment, dedicated resources, and management focus are needed to understand and improve safety culture; (2) broad reporting thresholds, experience-driven classification schemes, and local-level processing are useful SRS features in industries new to safety reporting; (3) strong legal protections and incentives encourage reporting and prevent potential confidentiality breaches; and (4) a central, industry-level unit facilitates lesson sharing and evaluation. While the CDC and APHIS Select Agent Program (SAP) has taken steps in the three key areas to improve the usefulness of the TLR system for select agents, steps for improvement remain. Specifically, the agencies have taken steps to better define reportable events, ensure the confidentiality of reports, and dedicate resources to use TLR data for safety improvement. However, lessons from the literature and case studies suggest additional steps in the three key areas to enhance the usefulness of the system. For example, lowering reporting thresholds could provide precursor data and limited immunity could increase the incentive to report. Finally, the CDC and APHIS are in a unique position--as recognized authorities in the lab community and with access to TLR reports from across the industry--to guide SRS evaluation and ensure safety lessons are broadly disseminated. For a national safety reporting system for all biological labs, existing information--about labs' organizational culture and the lab community's limited experience with SRSs--suggests the following features in the three key areas: (1) Reporting and analysis. Reporting should be voluntary; available to all workers; cover hazards, incidents, and less serious accidents; accessible in various modes (Web and postal); and with formats that allow workers to report events in their own words to either an internal or external SRS system. (2) Reporter protections and incentives. Strong confidentiality protections, data deidentification processes, and other reporting incentives are needed to foster trust in reporting. (3) Feedback mechanisms. SRS data should be used at both the local and industry levels for safety improvement. An industry-level entity is needed to disseminate SRS data and to support evaluation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, in developing legislation for a national SRS for biological labs, Congress consider provisions for certain system features.

USDA agreed with the three recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The growing federal emphasis on identifying and protecting against  biological weapons attacks, as well as other factors, have led to an  increase in the number of biological laboratories in the United States.  Although data suggest that injury and illness rates for these labs are below  that of general industry, working with infectious agents always involves  inherent risk. To date, catastrophes have been avoided in the United  States, although serious injuries and deaths have occurred among  laboratory workers. These injuries and deaths might have been prevented  had relevant data on safety been quickly shared throughout the laboratory  community. For example, two microbiologists died in July and December  2000 of a laboratory-acquired infection (LAI) from exposure to bacterium  Neisseria meningitidis. In a review of how often this LAI had occurred,  investigators found 14 previously unreported LAIs from exposure to the  bacteria\u20148 of which were fatal. Had these LAIs been reported and the  safety issues surrounding this specific bacterium communicated earlier,  the two deaths in 2000 might have been prevented.", "Given the increase in biological labs and therefore risks, it is essential to  understand the sources of risk and how to communicate them. These  sources can best be identified through the collection of safety data. Such  data can come from accidents that result in injuries or deaths. However,  they can also come from concerns about hazardous conditions or  incidents such as errors without consequences, near misses, or close calls.  Collecting data on accidents, incidents, and hazards can help identify  accident precursors\u2014the actions, nonactions, processes, and  environmental or mechanical conditions that can lead to accidents. If the  precursors can be identified, communicated, and eliminated, the  occurrence of accidents\u2014in particular those resulting in injury or death\u2014 might be prevented. Safety reporting systems (SRS) are a key tool  industries use to collect such information. However, there is no national  labwide SRS for quickly and efficiently collecting, analyzing, and  communicating such information for biological labs. Nevertheless, some  mechanisms exist through which such data might be communicated. For  example, incidents of LAIs are sometimes reported in academic journals,  in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly  Reports (MMWR), or as a result of Occupational Health and Safety  Administration (OSHA) regulations. However, there are a variety of  barriers to reporting through these mechanisms, and it is generally  acknowledged that LAIs are underreported because of concerns about  stigma or punishment. Consequently, a great deal of potential safety data  is never communicated. In addition, the CDC and the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)  together maintain a mandatory reporting system for theft, loss, and release  (TLR) of select agents, as required under the select agent regulations.  However, we have found lapses in labs reporting to this program,  suggesting the need for improvement. Moreover, the Select Agent Program  regulates only those labs that possess, use, and transfer select agents and  toxins, and therefore covers only a fraction of U.S. biological labs for  which there is no SRS. Consequently, a great deal of valuable safety data  falls through the cracks, and potentially avoidable accidents continue to  occur.", "Recognizing the need for an effective mechanism to collect safety data,  bills were introduced in both the Senate and House of Representatives  that, if enacted, would establish a new SRS for all biological labs. While  this legislation provides a framework for establishing such a system,  questions remain about what constitutes the most effective design and  implementation features for a biological lab SRS. Despite these questions,  it is known that effective design and implementation include the use of  existing information, such as from the literature and case studies, to  identify lessons learned that can guide decisions. For example, when the  health care industry began to explore the potential of SRSs for hospitals,  many in the industry looked to the literature and other industries, such as  aviation, to identify lessons learned for design and implementation.  Similarly, for biological labs, although they are a unique working  environment, information from the literature and other industries can  identify lessons learned for the design and implementation of a lab SRS.  You therefore asked us to identify lessons for designing and implementing  an effective lab safety reporting system, from (1) the literature and (2)  case studies of SRSs in the airline, commercial nuclear power, and health  care industries; and to apply those lessons to (3) assess the theft, loss, and  release reporting system, part of the Select Agent Program, and (4) suggest  design and implementation considerations for a national safety reporting  system for all biological labs.", "To accomplish our objectives, we (1) reviewed an extensive selection of  both academic and applied literature related to safety science  (organizational safety and human factors) and SRS evaluation across a  wide variety of industries; (2) conducted case studies of SRSs in the  aviation, commercial nuclear power, and health care industries by  reviewing relevant documentation and academic literature, observing  safety task force and reporting system committee meetings, and  conducting open and structured interviews of agency officials, as well as  SRS and human factors experts in the three industries; (3) interviewed  national and international biosafety specialists, relevant HHS and USDA  officials, biological laboratory directors, and biosafety officers; and (4)  applied criteria\u2014derived from our review of the literature and case  studies\u2014for improving the Select Agent Program reporting system and for  designing and implementing an SRS for all biological labs. With respect to  the case studies, while we collected information on a wide variety of  safety reporting programs in the three industries\u2014and in some cases  comment on these different programs\u2014we primarily developed our  lessons from one reporting program in each of the three industries.  Specifically, we developed lessons from the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s (FAA) National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA)-run Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) in aviation; the  Institute of Nuclear Power Operation\u2019s (INPO\u00ae) Significant Event and  Evaluation Information Network (SEE-IN\u00ae) system in commercial nuclear  power; and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) health care reporting  program, which includes the Patient Safety Information System (PSIS) and  the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS). We chose to focus on these  programs because they represent fairly long-standing, nonregulatory,  domestic, industrywide, or servicewide reporting programs. For more  detailed information on our methods, please see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 to September 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Biocontainment laboratories\u2014designed with specific environmental,  storage, and equipment configurations\u2014support containment efforts in  the day-to-day work with biological agents. These labs are designed,  constructed, and operated to (1) prevent accidental release of infectious  or hazardous agents within the laboratory and (2) protect lab workers and  the environment external to the lab, including the community, from  exposure to the agents. For example, the biological safety cabinet (BSC) is  laboratory safety equipment that is used when manipulating infectious  organisms. BSCs are enclosed cabinets with mechanisms for pulling air  away from the worker and into a HEPA filter, which provides protection  for the worker and prevents releases into the environment. BSCs might be  designed with a limited workspace opening, or they might be completely  enclosed with only gloved access and air pressure indicators to alert users  to potential microbial releases. The selection of the BSC would depend on  the (1) lab\u2019s risk assessment for the specific agent and (2) nature of work  being conducted, as guided by the Biosafety in Microbiological and  Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), and other relevant guidance, such as  OSHA regulations and National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for  research involving recombinant DNA.", "There are four biosafety levels (BSL). These levels\u2014consisting of a  combination of laboratory practices, safety equipment, and laboratory  facilities\u2014are based on the type of work performed, information about the  infectious agent, and the function of the laboratory. These levels include  combinations of laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment,  and facilities that are recommended for labs that conduct research on  infectious mircro-organisms and toxins:  Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) is suitable for work with agents not known to  consistently cause disease in healthy adults and present minimal potential  hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.", "Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) is suitable for work with agents that pose  moderate risks to personnel and the environment.", "Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) is suitable for work with indigenous or exotic  agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal disease, if inhaled.", "Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) is required for work with dangerous and  exotic agents that pose a high risk of life-threatening disease or have  aerosol or unknown transmission risk.", "Examples of agents and toxins used within these labs include those that  primarily affect    humans and animals, such as Botulinum neurotoxin, a naturally occurring  poison, lethal to humans and animals, but used for medical and cosmetic  purposes in drugs such as Botox;    animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious viral  disease of cloven-hoofed animals\u2014such as cattle, swine, and sheep\u2014that  causes debilitation and losses in meat and milk production (while FMD  does not have human health implications it does have severe economic  consequences); and    plants, such as certain varieties of Xylella Fastidiosa, which can kill citrus  plants, but does not have human health implications.", "Lab levels can also vary depending on their use. For example, research  that involves animal or plant pathogens may be designated as animal  biosafety levels (ABSL) 1-4 or BSL-3-AG. Similarly, some people may refer  to BSL-3 labs as \u201chigh-containment\u201d labs and BSL-4 labs as \u201cmaximum  containment\u201d labs. There are also several types of labs\u2014including clinical,  research, teaching, public health (or reference), and production (or  commercial)\u2014which are generally categorized on the basis of the work  conducted. While these labs all involve work with infectious micro- organisms, there are regulatory, accrediting, and risk differences  associated with each type. For example, clinical labs within hospitals test  patient samples and may often be unaware of the micro-organism they are  handling until their tests have identified it. In contrast, research, reference,  and production (commercial) labs, while they each have different  purposes and environments, tend to be aware of the micro-organisms they  are handling. Clinical labs also have specific accrediting and state  reporting requirements, and their control structure for handling illnesses is  different from other types of labs. We use the general term \u201cbiological lab\u201d  to include biological labs of all levels or types that handle micro-organisms  or clinical samples. We use this general and inclusive term because SRSs  could be used in any environment with safety risks, including different  types or levels of labs. However, this does not necessarily imply that a  single SRS is appropriate or applicable to all labs of varying type or level,  although an SRS that encompasses the largest view of a domain as  possible has significant advantages. For example, one national SRS would  provide information that can cross boundaries where common and similar  practices exist and avoid the \u201cstove-piping\u201d of safety information.", "Many different federal agencies have some connection with biological  labs. Such agencies are involved with these labs in various capacities,  including as users, owners, regulators, and funding sources. The CDC  and APHIS regulate entities that possess, use, and transfer select agents  and toxins. In addition, entities are required to report the theft, loss, or  release of any select agent or toxin to the CDC or APHIS, although we had  found reporting failures at some labs subject to this requirement.", "Along with environmental, storage, and equipment configurations, various  guidelines for lab practices support worker and public safety. These  biosafety guidelines offer general and agent-specific containment and risk  assessment practices. For example, the BMBL suggests microbial  practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards that vary by type of  agent and intended use. These documents are updated periodically\u2014the  BMBL is currently in its fifth edition\u2014in order to \u201crefine guidance based  on new knowledge and experiences and to address contemporary issues  that present new risks that confront laboratory workers and the public  health.\u201d While the BMBL and other guidelines are useful for promoting  safety, they also recognize there are unknown and emerging laboratory  safety risks and that ongoing efforts to gather information about those  risks is essential for continued safety improvement. One of the key  information sources for these updates is published reports of LAIs.  However, it is widely recognized that these reports reflect only a fraction  of actual LAIs.", "To develop evidence-based guidelines and safety-improvement initiatives,  other industries with inherent risks to workers and the general public\u2014 such as aviation, commercial nuclear power, and health care\u2014collect and  analyze safety data. These data can come from safety events. Safety event  levels\u2014depicted in terms of a risk pyramid (see fig. 1)\u2014increase in  severity as they decrease in likelihood. Whether and where the lines are  drawn\u2014between accidents (fatal or nonfatal), incidents, and hazards\u2014 varies (1) across industries and (2) according to whether the safety event  resulted in no ill effects, minor injuries, or severe injuries or deaths.", "Events at the top of the pyramid\u2014generally identified as \u201caccidents\u201d  (sometimes further divided depending on fatality)\u2014have significant  potential for harm or result in actual harm to one or more individuals.  These events can include radiological exposure, industrial chemical spills  or explosions, airline crashes (with or without loss of life), patient  medication errors that result in illness or death, and LAIs. Accidents\u2014 especially fatal ones\u2014are generally infrequent, hard to conceal, and often  required to be reported. Events at the center of the risk pyramid\u2014 generally referred to as \u201cincidents\u201d\u2014are those that could have resulted in  serious harm but did not. Incidents occur more frequently than accidents  and include near misses, close calls, or other potential or actual adverse  events and violations, although definitions vary within and across  industries. For events at the base of the pyramid\u2014generally referred to as  \u201chazards\u201d\u2014no incident or accident need occur. These events include  observations about the work environment, procedures, equipment, or  organizational culture that could be improved relative to safety.", "Safety data from accidents, incidents, and hazards provide the source  information for analysis of accident precursors\u2014the building blocks of  events that can lead to injury or death. The focus on precursor data arose  as a result of the limited amount of data that could be identified from  accident investigations. Such data are often \u201ctoo sparse, too late and too  statistically unreliable to support effective safety management.\u201d In  addition, the severity and sometimes fatal consequences of accidents often  preclude investigators from gathering sufficient detail to fully understand  systemic (as opposed to individual) causes of the accident. Incident data  are a particularly rich source of precursor information because incidents  occur more frequently than accidents. Moreover, incidents do not often  rise to the level of regulatory or legal violation because no serious harm  has occurred. Workers are therefore generally less fearful of punishment  in reporting their mistakes at this level.", "Collection of safety data and analysis of accident precursors focus on  trying to identify systemic, rather than individual, causes of error.  Industries often take this system-based approach to risk management  because they recognize that \u201cblaming problems on \u2018human error\u2019 may be  accurate, but it does little to prevent recurrences of the problem. If people  trip over a step x times per thousand, how big must the x be before we  stop blaming people for tripping and start focusing on the step?\u201d The  system-based approach focuses on analyzing accident precursors to  understand \u201chow and why the defenses failed.\u201d According to this  approach, blaming individuals for accidents\u2014as in the person-based  approach\u2014not only fails to prevent accidents, but also limits workers\u2019  willingness to provide information about systemic problems. When  precursor information from accidents, incidents, and hazards are analyzed  as part of a system, evidence-based, industrywide safety improvements are  possible. For example, analysis of reports of health care workers  improperly medicating patients has helped identify and address systemic  problems with medication labeling and storage. In such cases, hospitals  could have punished an individual for the error. Instead, they focused on  learning rather than blame, which encouraged worker reporting and led to  needed changes in medication labeling and storage. This, in turn, improved  patient safety because any health care worker\u2014not just the one that  reported the error\u2014will be less likely to improperly medicate patients in  the future.", "SRSs\u2014both mandatory and voluntary\u2014are the key tool for capturing  detailed safety data. Many industries have recognized that the costs of  repeated accidents or managing the aftermath of an accident can far  outweigh the costs to establish and maintain a reporting system. Despite  vast differences across industries, the sources of risk\u2014humans,  technology, and environment\u2014are the same. Consequently, the tools\u2014 such as SRSs\u2014that industries other than biological labs use to understand  these risks can also support evidence-based, industrywide biosafety  improvement efforts. This is especially significant in understanding the  risks in biological labs because current biosafety guidelines are based on  limited information.", "While individual states or labs may have reporting mechanisms, no formal  system exists for sharing data among all labs. In addition, while data  reported through academic journals or state disease registries is  accessible industrywide, there are significant reporting barriers. For  example, before information about an incident becomes available to  others through academic publications, infections must be recognized as  laboratory-acquired, deemed scientifically interesting, written up and  submitted for peer review, and accepted for inclusion in an academic  journal. Furthermore, concerns about losing funding or negative publicity  can create barriers to an institution\u2019s willingness to encourage publication  of LAI information. Reports of infections through state disease registries  are also limited because information about the source of the infection is  generally not collected and not all infectious diseases are required to be  reported. In addition, the infected individual must see a health practitioner  who recognizes the status of the disease as reportable and takes steps to  report it. Finally, releases without infection\u2014or without recognized  infection as a result of a release\u2014are unlikely to be reported at all, despite  the valuable precursor data that could be gleaned from the event.", "A system for collecting safety data from across the lab community has  been proposed as a means to improve the evidence base for biosafety  guidelines. However, as indicated by reporting lapses to the mandatory  system for theft, loss, and release of select agents, implementation of a  reporting system does not immediately create a highly useful one, to which  all workers instantaneously submit data on their errors. Finally, when  initiating any reporting system, it is important to consider up front and  throughout a myriad of design and implementation issues so as to ensure  the system is operating as effectively as possible.

An SRS can be  designed and implemented to meet a variety of subgoals as well. Subgoals  can include capabilities for trend analyses, accountability improvement,  liability reduction, and performance indicators. The overall goals and  subgoals should be determined in advance of design decisions, so that  decisions in the three key areas support program goals. Identification and  agreement on program goals is best accomplished through the  involvement of appropriate stakeholders, such as management, workers,  industry groups, accrediting bodies, and relevant federal entities,  according to the literature.", "Even with well-defined goals, the success of any SRS is intertwined with  the organizational culture in which it will operate. Organizational  culture\u2014the underlying assumptions, beliefs, values, attitudes, and  expectations shared by those in the workplace\u2014affects implementation of  programs in general and, in particular, those designed to change that  underlying culture. SRSs are fundamentally tools that can be used to  facilitate cultural change\u2014to develop or enhance a type of organizational  culture known as a culture of safety. A culture of safety implies individual  and organizational awareness of and commitment to the importance of  safety. It also refers to the personal dedication and accountability of all  individuals engaged in any activity that has a bearing on safety in the  workplace. Development of a positive safety culture often involves a shift  in how workers view and address safety-related events. This shift is  supported by data on safety-related events provided by SRSs.  Accordingly, an environment in which workers can report safety events  without fear of punishment is a basic requirement for a safety culture and  an effective SRS. In addition, an important consideration in design and  implementation is where on the safety culture continuum an organization  is currently positioned and where it would like to be positioned. It is  unlikely that workers would report safety events in organizations with  punishment-oriented cultures\u2014where workers are distrustful of  management and each other. To promote reporting in such environments,  systems can be designed with features that help alleviate these worker  concerns. However, understanding where the organizational culture is in  relation to reporting is essential for choosing system features that will  address these concerns.", "Changing organizational culture is also generally recognized as a long-term  effort that takes at least 5 to 10 years.

Similarly,  if reporting is waning but safety events continue to occur, adjustments to  reporting incentives, definitions of events, and other features may be  necessary to improve reporting. Such ongoing assessment of  organizational culture can also help identify areas where system  adjustments are needed and support efforts to evaluate the contributions  of the SRS to safety culture improvement. As with any tool for cultural  change, the value of the SRS will be commensurate with the investment in  its use.

Mandatory  reporting is also generally preferred where there is potential or realized  association with injury or death and related regulatory and legal  implications, as in accidents. Voluntary reporting is generally preferred  when the program goal is learning\u2014identifying actions, processes, or  environmental factors that lead to accidents.

If the  reporting threshold is set too high, significant safety hazards may go  undetected and unreported. In such environments, a low initial threshold  for reporting might be helpful, raising it over time as workers develop  familiarity with reportable events. However, because of the greater  frequency of incidents and safety concerns, voluntary SRSs can be  overwhelmed by the volume of submitted reports. SRSs that focus on a  particular type of incident or hazard area may help to counteract this  problem. In addition, if the reporting threshold is set too low, reporters  may feel events are too trivial for reporting and that the SRS has little  value. For example, surveys of nurses and doctors have shown a range of  opinions that constitute a barrier to reporting, including beliefs that not all  near-miss errors should be reported or that reporting close calls could  result in significant change.

Such data allow benchmarking of similar  occurrences and promote a better understanding of core hazards that exist  across an industry. Clearly defined and familiar classification terminology  can also help workers understand when and what to report. However,  achieving a well-defined and clear classification scheme\u2014especially one  that can be used across an industry\u2014can be difficult because different  groups within an organization or across an industry may classify events  differently.

For example, organizational learning systems, like FAA\u2019s  NASA-run Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), include a broad  definition of safety-related events to facilitate voluntary reporting of all  events. Alternatively, mandatory systems may include a more specific  classification scheme to capture deviations from standard operating  procedures. However, overly restrictive schemes may lead workers to  focus on certain events and neglect to report others. For example, if a  classification scheme is developed to consider only compliance with an  industry\u2019s standard operating procedures, workers may not report safety- related incidents that involve factors other than compliance. Similarly,  overly detailed classification schemes may be confusing for reporters if  they do not know the appropriate codes to apply. In addition, a  classification scheme must be clear enough for workers to understand  what counts as a reportable incident. Otherwise, underreporting or  misreporting of incidents may result. If possible, use of pre-existing  industry-specific terminology in the classification scheme can support  information flow across the industry and help workers\u2014especially in  industries new to safety reporting\u2014adapt to the SRS.

However, a 1994 National  Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) evaluation, requested by the  FAA, found that FAA funding provided to NASA for the operation and  management of the ASRS had not kept pace with the work. According to  a NASA ASRS official, because resources were insufficient to perform a  detailed analysis on all the reports, reports are triaged. Only those deemed  most hazardous receive deeper analysis.

For example, one study  found the various professions within hospitals disagreed\u2014when presented  with scenarios such as late administration of medication\u2014as to whether  an error had occurred. In congressional testimony in 2000, we had  observed that if the VA hospital system was to implement an SRS, the VA  would face a challenge in creating an atmosphere that supports reporting  because hospital staff have traditionally been held responsible for adverse  patient outcomes. In our 2004 report, we also found that power  relationships, such as nurses reluctant to challenge doctors, can be  obstacles to patient safety. However, after the first 3 years of the VA health  care system\u2019s SRS, the cultural change that supports safety reporting was  under way at three of four facilities studied, as a result of experiential  training in addition to conventional classroom training. The growth in  reported events to the VA SRS over the last 10 years and our 2004 study  suggest that the actions that the VA took can be successful in supporting a  safety culture and reporting.", "Experiential\u2014that is, on-the-job\u2014training, in addition to conventional  classroom experience, fostered the habit of reporting safety events at  many VA hospitals. Since the initial years of the VA\u2019s hospital SRS,  clinicians and other VA workers have been selected to participate in the  hospital-based analysis of SRS reports so that they could learn how the  reports would be used. Once patient safety managers prioritized reports,  interdisciplinary teams of hospital staff, including local frontline  clinicians, looked for underlying causes and devised systemic fixes.  Through this experience, clinicians and other hospital staff saw first-hand  the rule-driven and dispassionate search for root causes that resulted in a  systemic fix or policy change rather than punishment. We found that (1)  this training fostered a cultural shift toward reporting systemic problems  by reducing fear of blame, and (2) staff were impressed with the team  analysis experience because it demonstrated the switch from blame and  the value of reporting close calls. In addition, the VA brought together  facility-level workers, including patient safety managers from VA medical  centers across the nation, to introduce them to the SRS. Through these  seminars, staff were introduced to SRS terms, tools, goals, and potential  obstacles. They heard success stories from industry and government,  findings from the early VA safety culture surveys, and recent alerts and  advisories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changing Safety Culture Requires Management Focus", "paragraphs": ["To overcome cultural barriers to safety reporting\u2014such as fear of  punishment, lack of trust between coworkers and management, and  hierarchical prohibitions on communication\u2014management  demonstrations of support for the SRS are important.

In the early stages of ASRS implementation, the FAA and ASRS staff relied  on small group briefings and promotional documents to foster awareness  and trust in reporting. For example, the FAA, through its Advisory  Circular, notified the aviation community that the system was operational  and, along with NASA, issued press releases and conducted briefings  about the system. In addition, industry groups and airlines publicly  expressed support for the system, and, according to a 1986 NASA report,  an advisory group carried \u201cthe word about ASRS program plans and  accomplishments back to their respective constituencies.\u201d Other early  promotional efforts included the distribution of descriptive brochures and  posters to operators, FAA field offices, air traffic control facilities, and  airline crew facilities. As a result of these efforts, according to NASA\u2019s  1986 report, the number of reports coming into the system in the early  years exceeded expectations. However, a NAPA study 8 years later raised  concerns about the lack of publicity. That study found that pilots lacked  knowledge of the ASRS and the immunity features and questioned the  FAA\u2019s credibility. NASA responded with a second promotional surge by (1)  publishing its first CALLBACK, a monthly online bulletin, and (2) touring  FAA regional headquarters to promote the SRS. However, the NAPA study  concluded that the lack of internal FAA support for the ASRS had limited  the degree to which FAA uses ASRS data, and led to questioning the  legitimacy of ASRS products and activities. That study also found that FAA  line officers (with the exception of the Office of Aviation Safety) thought  the ASRS had limited utility, and some even suspected bias in reporting as  a result of reporters\u2019 interest in earning immunity from FAA enforcement  actions. To address these concerns, the FAA has recently been advised to  elevate the importance of establishing an initial shared vision among all  stakeholders through open discussion and training and sustained  promotion efforts.", "INPO focused on leaders and employee loan programs to change the  industry\u2019s safety culture one employee and one plant at a time.  Leadership\u2019s demonstrated commitment to safety is a key INPO principle  for a robust safety culture. This key principle stems from the philosophy of  having \u201ceyes on the problem.\u201d That is, plant managers must be out in the  work areas, seeing things and talking to employees in order to reinforce a  safety culture. This principle also includes reinforcing standards and  encouraging candid dialogue when safety issues arise. Such reinforcement  can be in the form of rewards for reporting, such as being congratulated at  plant meetings for a \u201cgood catch.\u201d Managers also have incentives to  encourage workers to report. Following its biannual inspections, INPO  summarizes its assessment of the plant\u2019s safety conditions, providing a  numeric score, partly based on the robustness of the plant\u2019s SRS. These  safety scores are important to plant managers because they can affect  regulatory oversight and insurance premiums. Scores range from 1 to 5,  with 1 as the top safety rating. While these assessments may result in more  attention and assistance for safety improvements, they also instill pride in  the plant, and at annual managers\u2019 meetings, managers of plants with the  highest scores receive recognition.", "INPO has also facilitated active peer review and employee loan programs  to break down the insularity of the TMI era. When individuals with in- depth industry experience participate in the inspection process and work  at INPO headquarters, they see firsthand the excellence other plants  practice and how those practices relate to INPO safety initiatives.", "The VA hospitals used small group meetings, storytelling, and small  rewards to reinforce safety reporting. At the most successful VA hospital  we reviewed in 2004, administrators held more than 100 small group  meetings where storytelling was used in order to introduce the new SRS.  VA hospital administrators used examples from aviation wherein two  airline pilots failed to communicate well enough to avoid a fatal crash. The  crash might have been avoided had the first officer challenged the captain.  This story raised parallels with the medical hierarchy and led to  discussions about similar unequal power relationships in the hospital.  Administrators introduced more effective ways to challenge authority,  naming it \u201ccross-checking.\u201d An early report to the VA SRS, which involved  nearly identical packaging for an analgesic and a potentially dangerous  drug, was made into a poster as part of the campaign for the SRS. The  more successful VA hospitals rewarded the month\u2019s best safety report with  a plate of cookies or certificates to the cafeteria.

In each of the industries, the  creation of an SRS involved broadening workers\u2019 concepts of safety  events, in addition to accidents, that were worthy of reporting.  Nevertheless, early reporting still tended toward accidents and technical  issues\u2014accidents because they were fairly evident and harder to hide and  technical issues (as opposed to human factors) because the external  nature of the fault provided some distance from individual blame.  Reporting these technical events helped workers become more  comfortable with reporting and provided objective links between their  reports and systemic safety improvements, according to several industry  officials. Over time, workers\u2019 ability to identify less concrete, but equally  unsafe, nontechnical issues grew. The industries managed this growth, in  part, by keeping the threshold and definitions for reportable events simple.  In some cases, direct reporting\u2014as opposed to reporting hierarchically, up  the chain of command\u2014was used to eliminate the fear that workers might  have about reporting a mistake to the boss.

The plant-level corrective action  programs have a zero threshold for reporting\u2014that is, workers can report  anything of concern. To make the definition for reporting clear to workers,  INPO characterizes the reporting threshold in terms of asking workers to  report events that they would want to know about if the event had  happened elsewhere. In addition to establishing low reporting thresholds,  a broad spectrum of workers are encouraged to report to the plant\u2019s  corrective action programs. Open reporting and low reporting thresholds  are necessary to ensure the fullest coverage of significant event reporting,  according to an INPO liaison. While the individual plants are expected to  assess and address the bulk of reports, they must also identify the most  significant reports to send to INPO. Plants forward between 3,000 and  4,000 concerns to INPO each year from the estimated 400,000 concerns  reported and resolved at the plant level through their corrective action  programs. To ensure all staff are encouraged to report any event of  interest, INPO examines the robustness of the plant\u2019s reporting culture  during biannual plant inspections. As part of this process, INPO also  compares corrective action reports to SEE-IN data to determine whether  there are reports in the corrective action system that were not forwarded  to INPO that should have been.

While the  ASRS receives reports directly from reporters, the FAA\u2019s Voluntary Safety  Programs branch (VSP) launched a bilevel SRS program in which 73  airlines are primarily responsible for receiving and processing reports and  implementing solutions.

Under most current laws, reports  generated before an accident are considered discoverable evidence  afterwards. Such laws may deter companies from soliciting and  collecting reports about safety problems and workers from reporting  them. To address these concerns, the three industries offered a variety of  mechanisms for protecting and encouraging reporting, including  confidentiality provisions, process protections, and reporting incentives.  Confidentiality provisions, rather than anonymous reporting, are the most  common approach to protecting reporters\u2019 identities because they allow  follow-up with the reporters; however, their protections are not ironclad.  And, as SRS program managers in some of the industries discovered, even  the perception that confidentiality can be, or has been, breached can  discourage reporting. In the three industries, most of the laws supporting  SRS confidentiality protections are a patchwork of older laws not  originally intended to back up an SRS. Most also have exceptions to  confidentiality if Congress or law enforcement agencies demand access to  the protected documents. Some of the systems rely on existing laws, such  as exceptions in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); other systems  have a legal and regulatory basis crafted for related purposes. As SRS  failures in other countries illustrate, legal protections can be  strengthened or weakened through legislative action.", "Recognizing the fragility of confidentiality provisions, the three industries  also relied on processes and incentives to protect and encourage  reporting. Processes, such as deidentification of reports, support  confidentiality provisions. Some industries apply it to both the reporter  and the organization or unit involved. Data deidentification at the  organizational level supports organizational buy-in for reporting, makes it  less likely that reporters will be discouraged from reporting, and facilitates  industrywide sharing by removing fear of reprisal. In addition, limited  immunity provisions or small rewards were used, in some industries, as  incentives to encourage safety reporting, especially in environments of  mistrust. Limited immunity provisions apply when certain requirements\u2014 such as timely reporting\u2014are met. These provisions provide reporters  (individuals or organizations) with a means for avoiding or mitigating civil  or regulatory penalties. With respect to rewards, even seemingly small  incentives can be effective in promoting trust in reporting.", "The FAA protects its reporters through a combination confidentiality and  limited immunity, relying on regulation, policy statements, and procedural  or structural arrangements. For the much older ASRS, confidentiality is  maintained both as part of the interagency agreement between NASA and  the FAA and through procedural efforts, such as deidentification of  reports, as well as regulation. Section 91.25 of the Federal Aviation  Regulations prohibit the FAA from using information obtained solely from  these ASRS reports in enforcement actions against reporters unless  criminal actions or accidents are involved. Specifically, after following up  with the reporter and analyzing the report, the NASA office removes  information that could identify the reporter, including the reporter\u2019s name,  the facility, airline, or the airport. NASA destroys the identity portions of  the original reports so that no legal demands could reveal them. The  ASRS\u2019s information processing and deidentification of reports has ensured  the confidentiality of its reports for over 30 years, despite pressures from  the regulator and outside entities to reveal them. To strengthen the  confidentiality agreement between the FAA and NASA, the FAA has  determined by regulation that it will generally not use reports submitted to  NASA in enforcement actions and provides some disciplinary immunity for  pilots involved in errors. In contrast, for several of the carrier-run SRSs  initiated since 1997, reports are protected from legal enforcement action  by the FAA only by policy. However, despite the combined legal and  procedural bases for protecting aviation SRS data\u2014for both the ASRS and  the other SRSs the FAA supports\u2014there are pressures to violate SRS  confidentiality.

Protecting the confidentiality of plants was  central to the inception of INPO\u2019s safety efforts, according to industry  officials. While guaranteeing its member utilities confidentiality similar to  that in a doctor-patient relationship, INPO has also cultivated an open  questioning attitude as the wellspring of safety reporting. While individual  reporters receive no confidentiality, the reporting system relies on  developing an open reporting culture. Under an INPO-NRC Memorandum  of Agreement, reports and information that INPO makes available to the  NRC will be treated as proprietary commercial information and will not be  publicly disclosed. INPO maintains legal resources for future  confidentiality challenges. In INPO\u2019s bilevel system, reports sent to INPO  do not identify the reporter, and INPO\u2019s confidentiality includes carefully  guarding the identity of individual plants or utilities.

For others, reporting takes place at the local level.

Sending reports up to a central entity ensures that safety fixes  identified through local processes are not lost to the rest of the industry.

Because the central  entity receives safety data from multiple organizations\u2014whether through  direct reporting or from local-level systems\u2014the volume and variety of  information increase the potential for identifying systemic issues and  improving safety industrywide. In addition, the industries recognize that a  central, industry-level entity might be necessary for bringing some difficult  safety problems to light. This is because the central entity is more likely to  consider the interests of the industry, whereas local-level managers might  resist identifying systemic issues that would put personal or organizational  interests at risk. These central entities, because of their position as  industry representatives, are also in a better position to disseminate  lessons across the industry and internationally.

NASA also disseminates ASRS  information via a monthly online bulletin, CALLBACK, to 85,000 members  of the aviation community on safety topics such as summaries of research  that have been conducted on ASRS data. Unions and airlines use this  information in safety training. Among the SRSs we are aware of, only the  ASRS offers access to its event database for outside researchers to  conduct analysis and for ASRS staff to perform specially requested  analyses for the FAA, NTSB, and others. The FAA also maintains an  industry-level office\u2014the VSP branch\u2014which oversees seven different  voluntary reporting systems, including the ASRS. Data from these SRSs  provide information on events that would otherwise be unknown to FAA  or others, and VSP\u2019s role is to facilitate sharing of these data at the airline  and industry levels. We observed VSP and ASRS staff representing U.S.  airline safety interests at an international aviation safety reporting meeting  to share lessons on aviation safety and SRS design and implementation.  Such participation offers opportunities for safety improvement in aviation  worldwide. For example, VSP and ASRS staff have supported efforts to  develop safety reporting systems worldwide because aviation safety does  not stop at the U.S. border. Most foreign aviation SRSs have been based on  the ASRS model. The international aviation safety organization, the  International Civil Aviation Organization, has called for each country to  have an independent aviation safety reporting system similar to ASRS.", "Despite the benefits of these SRSs, formal evaluation has provided insights  for system improvement. For example, the FAA requested the NAPA  evaluation of ASRS, which recommended the ASRS modernize by  implementing actions, such as collecting and disseminating reports in  electronic formats to better meet the needs of the aviation community.  Currently, ASRS safety reports and monthly newsletters are primarily  transmitted by e-mail. In addition to ASRS-specific evaluations, the FAA  has access to more investigations of aviation safety culture conducted  over the last decade. For example, special studies of aviation specialists,  such as controllers and maintenance workers, have identified reasons for  their lower reporting rates. These studies revealed specific aspects of  cultures in these professions that would discourage reporting. For  example, controllers were highly focused on bureaucratic boundaries that  enabled them to define away\u2014rather than report\u2014unsafe conditions they  perceived to be outside their responsibility. Alternatively, according to  FAA officials, they found a strongly punitive culture among maintenance  workers that led workers to assume that if a supervisor told them to  violate a rule, it did not create an unsafe\u2014and hence reportable\u2014 condition. These studies made possible targeted efforts, such as a  reporting program just for controllers, that resulted in a growing  proportion of safety reports from nonpilots.", "INPO\u2019s lesson-sharing program uses the Nuclear Network\u2014an industry  intranet\u2014for sharing safety information.

Information transmitted via this system includes Significant Operating  Event Reports\u2014the highest-level alert document\u2014as well as experiential  and nuclear technical information. Plants can also use the network to ask  questions or make comments that can be sent to one, several, or all users.  Apart from the direct feedback reporters receive from the plant, the key to  getting workers to participate in reporting was through seeing\u2014via the  Nuclear Network\u2014the corrective actions developed in response to reports  they had made, according to the INPO liaison. INPO is seen as a model for  other national and supranational nuclear safety organizations, such as the  World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organization representing the  global nuclear community. As such, INPO has recently begun to  participate in the Convention on Nuclear Safety, a triannual international  commercial nuclear safety effort.", "INPO also evaluates plants\u2019 safety improvement programs, although the  evaluations are generally not publicly available, according to an INPO  liaison. INPO performs a type of \u201cgap analysis\u201d at the biannual on-site  plant inspections and conducts safety culture surveys with a sample of  staff before each. Reporting gaps are evaluated at the plant level (not by  occupation or work group) by looking for reductions in report volume and  mining the plant\u2019s corrective action reports. A reduction in reporting year  to year is interpreted as an indicator of a potential problem rather than an  improvement in safety conditions, because such reductions can indicate a  lack of management support for reporting. In addition, if a plant receives a  low safety score as a result of inspection findings, INPO provides extra  attention and assistance by assigning a team of industry experts to engage  in weekly consultations with plant directors, review corrective actions,  discuss plant needs, develop solutions, and provide peer assistance and  accompaniment to seminars.", "In its position as the industry-level entity responsible for the VA SRS,  NCPS creates and disseminates key policy changes to the VA health care  system in response to trends identified from patient safety reports. For  example, the NCPS (1) designed and implemented a program that  promotes checklist-driven pre- and postsurgical briefings that, according  to the SRS program director, have been associated with reduced surgical  mortality across the VA hospital system and (2) developed new  requirements for CO2 detectors on every crash cart for checking safe  intubations outside of operating room settings. The NCPS has played a  role in disseminating its SRS model and tools for safety improvement to  other U.S. states and federal agencies, including the AHRQ. Specifically,  the NCPS provided training to all 50 states and the District of Columbia via  the Patient Safety Improvement Corps, a program funded by the AHRQ.", "The VA -supplied state training contributed heavily toward building a  common national infrastructure to support implementation of effective  patient safety practices. Further, after attending the VA seminars, several  foreign countries implementing their own SRSs have adopted tools  developed by the VA.", "The NCPS has also conducted evaluations of the SRS program, which have  provided information for SRS and safety culture improvements. For  example, in 2008, the NCPS published a study of the effectiveness of  actions hospitals developed in response to SRS reports of adverse drug  events. They found that changes in clinical care at the bedside\u2014such as  double- checking high-risk medications\u2014and improvements to computers  and equipment were effective solutions, but training was not. In addition  NCPS has conducted three safety culture surveys, the most recent of  which enabled identification of safety culture differences among staff  subgroups in order to target outreach and training.

The TLR  reporting system for select agents was developed in 2002, after the 2001  anthrax attacks. As the number and types of reported incidents  increased, an outcome of the new reporting requirements, the agencies  implemented processes to utilize the TLR system as a tool to manage the  Select Agent Program. In addition, the CDC reassessed its administration  of the system to consider how it could be used as a safety tool, rather than  just a recording system. To its credit, the CDC employed a safety science  expert to manage the TLR reporting system and is now exploring ways of  using the TLR data to identify systemic safety issues. APHIS has also  utilized the TLR as a tool to identify trends such as (1) gaps in  administrative oversight of personnel and training and (2) weaknesses in  safety and security policies and procedures in regulated entities. Each TLR  is reviewed by a compliance officer, security manager, and subject matter  experts to identify trends and areas of concern. Identified issues are  subsequently discussed with the reporting facility\u2019s senior management,  with additional monitoring and inspections as needed.", "The CDC and APHIS also rely on periodic on-site lab inspections to get an  understanding of the culture, with respect to safety and reporting, and  identify areas for outreach and training. The agencies inspect labs to  ensure that they are in compliance with the safety, security, training, and  record-keeping provisions outlined in the regulations. As part of this  process, the agencies use checklists developed from regulations and  nationally recognized safety standards to review laboratory safety and  security and to develop observations. In addition, the agencies interview  lab staff and examine documentation, such as medical surveillance  documents, exposure or incident records, and minutes from Institutional  Biosafety Committee meetings. Review of such documentation can  provide an indication of possible incidents with select agents or toxins.  During these inspections, the CDC and APHIS officials seek to (1) identify  gaps in knowledge about safety and reporting and (2) report on areas  needing improvement.", "The information the agencies derive from these inspections and from TLR  reports can provide useful information about the culture of safety and  reporting within labs. However, lessons from the literature also suggest  that systematic assessment of the culture, such as through ongoing  surveys or studies, can provide invaluable information about how the  specific working environment can affect perceptions of safety and  reporting requirements. These perceptions\u2014and variations, for example,  within or across working environments or occupations\u2014can affect what is  considered a reportable event; feelings of responsibility for or fear of  reporting; and the value of reporting safety events. For example, studies  examining the effects of culture on safety and reporting in the aviation and  health care industries have found that perceived occupational hierarchies,  such as between doctors and nurses or pilots and cabin crew; authority  structures; organizational factors; concepts of justice; and other  factors can affect safety and reporting.", "According to CDC and APHIS officials, they have no plans to arrive at such  an awareness through cultural assessment. Nevertheless, agency officials  agree that culture matters when it comes to safety and reporting. For  example, they noted that culture may differ by a lab\u2019s size and level of  resources. Larger labs or labs with more resources tend to have better  safety and reporting. Other agency officials noted that, based on career  experiences, they have become aware of safety differences across  different types or levels of labs. According to a CDC official, staff in  higher-level labs, such as BSL-4 labs, have recognized the danger of the  material they are working with. These facilities are also more likely to  have biosafety officers, whose presence, according to the CDC official,  tends to make workers more conscientious about safety. Another official  noted that, while you might find sandwiches or soda in the refrigerator of  a BSL-2 lab, these items would never be found in BSL-4 labs. Safety culture  differences between clinical and research labs were also noted by CDC  officials. Such variation in culture across labs was also noted by domestic  and international biosafety specialists we spoke with. Despite recognition  of such variation across labs, officials stated, the CDC does not have a  unified position on the issue, and the research does not exist to  definitively establish safety culture differences by lab type, occupation, or  sector. Greater awareness of cultural influences and how they affect safety  and reporting in the labs could (1) help the agencies better target outreach  and training efforts and (2) provide insights into whether reporting system  design and implementation changes are needed to address lab variations  in safety and reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CDC and APHIS Have Taken Steps to Better Define Reportable Events; Lessons Indicate That a Broadened Definition Could Further Enhance Collection of Safety Data", "paragraphs": ["The CDC and APHIS SAP has taken steps to better define reportable  events, which can increase the likelihood that workers will report when  required. For example, in early 2008, the CDC and APHIS published the  Select Agents and Toxins Theft, Loss and Release Information  Document, which includes detailed scenarios on what and when to  report. Since the TLR reporting program was established in 2002, the  agencies have seen reports increase substantially; since a 2008 initiative to  better inform the lab community of incident-reporting requirements, the  CDC and APHIS noted that they receive approximately 130 incident  reports per year. The types of labs reporting have also broadened.  According to the CDC, the increased reporting is the result of better  awareness of and compliance with reporting requirements, rather than an  increase in thefts, losses, or releases. Indeed, of the reported TLRs, there  have been no confirmed thefts, one loss, and only eight confirmed  releases.", "To clarify reportable events, the Select Agent Regulations require that the  individual or entity immediately notify the CDC or APHIS upon discovery  of a release of an agent or toxin causing occupational exposure, or release  of a select agent or toxin outside of the primary barriers of the  biocontainment area. The agencies\u2019 Select Agents and Toxins Theft, Loss  and Release Information Document further clarifies reportable events.  The document defines a release as a discharge of a select agent or toxin  outside the primary containment barrier due to a failure in the  containment system, an accidental spill, occupational exposure, or a theft.  Furthermore, any incident that results in the activation of medical  surveillance or treatment should also be reported as a release. The  document also emphasizes that occupational exposure includes any event  in which a person in a registered facility or lab is not appropriately  protected in the presence of an agent or toxin. For example, a sharp  injury from a needle being used in select agent or toxin work would be  considered an occupational exposure. While these reporting requirements  are fairly broad, they do require a degree of certainty about the occurrence  of an event. But, in some cases, recognition of a reportable event may  come only when consequences are realized.", "While the agencies\u2019 steps to better define reportable events can increase  the likelihood that recognized events will be reported, according to the  literature and biosafety specialists, lab workers are often unaware that a  release has occurred unless or until they become sick. For example, early  studies of LAIs found that as many as 80 percent of all reported LAIs could  not be traced back to a particular lab incident. A more recent study found  similar results. The absence of clear evidence of the means of  transmission in most documented LAIs highlights the importance of being  able to recognize potential hazards because the likely cause of these LAIs  is often unobserved. While a great deal is known about micro-organisms to  support safe lab practices, microbiology is a dynamic and evolving field.  New infectious agents have emerged, and work with these agents has  expanded. In addition, while technological improvements have enhanced  safety, they can also introduce new safety challenges. For example,  failures in a lab system designed to filter aerosols led to a recent company  recall of this system. The dynamic nature of the field, coupled with the  difficulty of identifying causal incidents in LAIs, suggests substantial  potential for unintentional under-reporting. In such an environment\u2014 where workers are waiting for an obvious event to occur before  reporting\u2014a significant amount of important, reportable safety  information could be lost. Consequently, while reporting requirements for  releases may now be clear for many incidents or for observed  consequences, broader reporting thresholds may be necessary to  accommodate emerging safety issues and the unobserved nature of many  LAI events.", "According to lessons from the literature and case studies, expanding  reporting thresholds\u2014in this case, to include observed or suspected  hazards\u2014can help capture valuable information for accident prevention.  The industries in the case studies all struggled with how to recognize, and  thus report, such events. However, over time, the feedback they received  from these reports, in the form of specific safety improvements, helped  workers develop familiarity and comfort with recognizing and reporting  such events. An example in the lab community might be the practice of  mouth pipetting, drawing an agent into a pipette by sucking on one end. At  one time, mouth pipetting was a common practice, despite the high risk of  exposure. Even though not every instance resulted in exposure or an LAI,  some did, and eventually the activity was recognized as a potential  hazard\u2014an accident precursor. Expanding the TLR reporting threshold to  include hazards could provide additional data that might be useful for  safety improvement efforts. For example, INPO encourages reporting of  events at all levels of the risk pyramid\u2014including the hazard level\u2014for the  corrective actions reporting programs of nuclear power plants. This level  of reporting ensures as complete coverage as possible of potential safety  issues. For the TLR, reporting at this level could be voluntary or  mandatory. Moreover, until a labwide voluntary reporting system is  implemented, reporting at this level could further develop the reporting  culture among select agent labs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CDC and APHIS Have Taken Steps to Protect Confidentiality, Which Can Encourage Reporting; Lessons Indicate That Limited Immunity Could Further Encourage Reporting", "paragraphs": ["The CDC and APHIS SAP has taken steps to incorporate deidentification  measures to further protect the confidentiality of entities reporting thefts,  losses, or releases.

As a result, the agency  provides only deidentified report forms in response to congressional  requests. In addition, to further support reporter confidentiality in the  event of audit or congressional requests to view TLR information, the CDC  has established an access-controlled reading room for viewing these  reports. It expects these measures to prevent any future prohibited  disclosure of entity-specific data, while special-need access to information  about thefts, losses, or releases is provided. According to lessons from  the literature and case studies, even the perception of a confidentiality  breach can quash reporting. Consequently, the agencies\u2019 measures to  ensure confidentiality can increase confidence in reporting.", "Apart from the requirement to report, labs also have some incentive for  reporting. One such incentive, according to CDC officials, is labs\u2019 interest  in avoiding increased oversight. In addition, lab officials know that (1)  select agents are on the list because they are dangerous and (2) it is of  critical importance to promptly report incidents to ensure proper care of  workers and the public. CDC officials stated, however, that too much  discretion about what and when to report could result in the under- reporting of more serious events. As the experiences of the case industries  illustrate, protection of reporter confidentiality is an ongoing effort, even  when strong legislative provisions exist to protect reporters\u2019 identities.

Currently, even if entities report  violations, there are no provisions for receiving immunity from these  enforcement actions. In the aviation industry, pilots face the possibility of  similar enforcement actions for violations of regulations. However, the  FAA provides some disciplinary immunity for pilots reporting violations of  regulations to ASRS. Such immunity is in recognition of the fact that (1)  information about pilots\u2019 errors is essential for identification of systemic  problems and (2) pilots would be unlikely to report their errors without  some incentive to do so. Similar provisions for limited immunity from  administrative action or reduced monetary penalty could be offered to  labs for some violations of select agent regulations.

While the CDC recognizes the usefulness of TLR reports for generating  data that can (1) help spot trends, (2) highlight areas for performance  improvement, and (3) show limitations in current procedures, it is just  beginning to collect enough data to see patterns of nonreporting,  according to CDC officials. The CDC expects that in the future, it will have  collected enough data, including inspection data, to identify reporting  patterns and conduct targeted outreach to nonreporting labs. However,  the agencies do not yet have a specific plan to identify reporting gaps in  order to develop targeted outreach and training or to assess the system\u2019s  effectiveness. To further support targeted outreach, as well as system  modification, evaluation is needed. As we have previously reported, such  evaluation can be a potentially critical source of information for assessing  the effectiveness of strategies and the implementation of programs.  Evaluation can also help ensure that goals are reasonable, strategies for  achieving goals are effective, and corrective actions are taken in program  implementation. For example, an evaluation of the ASRS program revealed  the need to improve the usefulness of the system through system  modifications and increased outreach to certain populations.

However, assessment of organizational culture is difficult in the context of  U.S. biological labs because there is an unknown number of labs and,  except for labs in the Select Agent Program, no entity is responsible for  overseeing all labs. While many federal agencies have labs and are  involved in the industry, no single regulatory body has the clear  responsibility or directive for the safety of all laboratories. Consequently,  an important part of the goal-setting and assessment process for a  biological lab SRS is determining the scope of labs to which the system  would apply. For example, specific system goals, such as the ability to  identify trends or incidence rates, may be possible with one type or level  of lab, but not another. Similarly, assessment may reveal that differences  in organizational cultures across lab types is so significant that appropriate  SRS features for one type of lab would not apply well to another.

Such context can be further refined  once assessment and stakeholder input are obtained.

One solution for industries new to SRS reporting is to apply  classification at a higher level, for example, through the event review or  analysis process.", "Ensuring the reporting process is as clear and simple as possible is  especially important for the lab community. Although LAIs are widely  recognized as under-reported, there is, at least, a long history of reporting  these events among lab workers. However, lab workers do not have as  much experience reporting events without an obvious outcome, such as an  LAI.  Many of the biosafety specialists we spoke with had difficulty  envisioning the types of events\u2014apart from LAIs\u2014that might be  reportable. In addition, even when LAIs do occur, many are never linked  with a specific causative incident, so information about potential event  precursors is never communicated or is difficult to identify. Difficulty  recognizing exposure is a reality of work in these labs. LAIs often occur  through aerosol exposure, and the activities that can create such  conditions are numerous. However, all three case-study industries  grappled with similar difficulties in recognizing and reporting events that  did not result in obviously negative outcomes. One way the industries  addressed this difficulty was to allow workers to report a broad range of  events in their own words. Over time, as workers saw concrete results  from their reports, such as improved processes or guidance, their ability to  identify less concrete, but equally unsafe hazards and incidents\u2014even  those without obvious consequences\u2014grew.

Opening reporting to all workers, and offering multiple  reporting modes (e.g., Web and postal), and using forms with open- question formats that allow workers to report events in their own words  can facilitate reporting in the face of such uncertainty, according to  lessons from the literature and case studies. Biological labs operate across  a wide range of employment sectors, locations, and levels of containment.  There are BSL-2, 3, and 4 labs in private, academic, and public settings  across the United States. Staffing models for these labs are likely as  different as the lab populations. Safety culture and reporting proclivity  also vary across lab types. For example, according to biosafety specialists,  clinical and academic labs\u2014in contrast to government and private labs\u2014 face greater challenges to creating a safety culture and reporting events.  According to one biosafety specialist, in academic labs, students expected  to complete lab work before they have received adequate safety training  may not feel they are in a position to demand such training. Specialists  also indicate that higher-level labs (BSL-3 and 4)\u2014especially the larger  ones with better resources\u2014have personnel, equipment, and/or processes  to better support safety culture than lower-level, smaller labs with fewer  resources. Furthermore, the consequences of accidents are so great at  higher-level labs that the culture is generally more cautious. At lower-level  labs, the perception of risk and actual risk are lower, so practices are not  as stringent as they would be at higher-level ones.", "The work environment at biological labs also varies. In particular, some  work is done in teams and some individually, and some is completed  overnight because of time-sensitive experiments in the research. In  addition, the solo nature of much lab research means that a single lab  worker may be the only one who knows about an incident. For lab work,  the external visibility of accidents and incidents present in aviation or  some areas of health care may not exist. Bioresearch errors are also a lot  harder to spot than errors in other industries. For example, nuclear safety  officers can use radiation detectors to determine whether breaches of  protocol have occurred by identifying hot spots in suspicious areas, such  as a phone outside the lab. No similar tracking mechanism exists for  bioresearch. Therefore, the only objective proof of most accidents is that  someone became ill. In addition, lab workers have little incentive to report  if the incident occurred as a result of their own error, according to  biosafety specialists. Although one specialist believes there is a fair degree  of reporting on equipment failures because researchers generally want to  ensure that the equipment is fixed.", "Such variation has consequences for reporting. According to lessons from  the literature and case studies, assessments can provide information about  aspects of organizational cultures, structures, or processes that can affect  reporting. However, a comprehensive assessment of this sort is difficult  because (1) the population of labs is unknown and (2) no entity is  responsible for conducting such an assessment. Given the uncertainty  about cultural influences that may affect reporting behavior, more  inclusive reporting options can facilitate reporting, according to lessons  from the literature and case studies. For example, uncertainty about lab  workers\u2019 access to reporting forms or ability to complete detailed forms  can be minimized if (1) workers can report in whichever mode is most  accessible to them (Web or postal) and (2) the forms do not require overly  detailed or technical explanations.", "In an environment where much of the work is done alone and incentives  may not exist for reporting, an SRS that is open to all lab workers  (including security and janitorial staff) can facilitate reporting where none  might occur. Accepting reports from workers not directly involved in  research can increase the volume of safety data that can be obtained.  Multimode and open-reporting formats, as suggested above, support open  reporting since staff with varying knowledge of biosafety terms\u2014such as  janitorial, security, or animal care staff\u2014are still able to report incidents  or hazards in their own words in the way that is most convenient to them.", "Historically, the preferred model of biosafety reporting is hierarchical.  This ensures that workers receive timely medical intervention and  surveillance. Although it is important that workers have a mechanism for  receiving immediate medical attention and surveillance when needed, a lot  of important safety information could be lost if only supervisors or  managers are allowed to report. Hierarchical reporting structures may  limit the amount of useful safety data that can be received because a  filtering process takes place at each level in the reporting hierarchy. As the  information moves up the reporting structure, each person assesses  whether the event is reportable. If the person decides that it is, he or she  will report his or her own interpretation of events. Allowing all workers to  directly report to an SRS removes this filter and can increase the number  of reports and the amount of information collected from reports. For  example, reports from multiple sources can enable analysis of events from  multiple perspectives. While workers should always be encouraged to  report potential exposures and other hazards to their supervisors so that  they can receive timely medical attention, they should also be able to  report incidents directly to an SRS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advantages and Disadvantages Inherent in Industry-Level and Local-Level SRS Administration Suggest a Dual Reporting Option", "paragraphs": ["The HHS and USDA\u2014as central, recognized authorities in the biological  lab community\u2014represent the kind of industry-level entities that,  according to lessons learned, are necessary for effective dissemination and  evaluation activities.

For example, if workers are concerned about reporting  safety events\u2014either to an internally managed SRS or to the regulator\u2014an  external, independently managed SRS can be useful. Alternatively, if  workers are comfortable reporting to a local SRS, these programs can be  very effective when the information from local systems is fed to a central,  industry-level entity that can analyze data across the industry and  disseminate safety improvements industrywide.", "While each case study industry differs in its approach, all three rely on  dual (or multiple) reporting options. Specifically, the FAA relies on the  independently run ASRS, as well as seven other key reporting programs, to  collect safety data. Events that meet reporting requirements can be  reported to the ASRS\u2014meeting the need for an independent reporting  mechanism for those concerned about reporting to either their local  (airline-run) SRSs or to the regulator. In addition, as part of the FAA\u2019s  other reporting programs, the FAA receives SRS data from the airlines,  which they use to develop industrywide safety improvements. The  commercial nuclear power industry also has reporting options. While each  plant has a reporting system for corrective actions, a portion of the more  significant reports are passed on to INPO for development of industrywide  safety improvements. Individuals and plants also have the option to report  to NRC\u2019s Allegation Program. Finally, in designing its reporting program,  the VA created two reporting options\u2014one externally managed by NASA  and one local, hospital-based program in which safety data are sent on to  VA\u2019s National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) for development of  industrywide safety improvements. While the industries might encourage  workers to use one option over another, they are still able to report to the  system most comfortable for them. Both options, however, utilize an entity  with industrywide visibility and recognized authority to disseminate SRS  information and direct system evaluations.", "An external, independently managed SRS for the lab community offers  several advantages, including the (1) potential to reduce workers\u2019 fear of  being punished for reporting, (2) ability to contract for system  management, and (3) centralization of safety data. Nevertheless, since the  individual labs have the most intimate knowledge of staff, pathogens, and  operations, several biosafety specialists adamantly indicated that the lab  facility was the appropriate level for reporting and analysis. According to  lessons from the literature, as well as the perspectives of biosafety  specialists, analysis of safety reports should be done by qualified biosafety  professionals and others with appropriate expertise or knowledge. In  addition, processes for local-level collection and analysis of SRS reports  can facilitate worker buy-in for reporting, according to lessons from the  case studies. However, not all labs have the same resources for collecting  and analyzing reports. Furthermore, the focus on safety culture across the  lab community may not be sufficient to support an SRS program that  operates only at the local level. But local-level support\u2014as well as  encouragement of reporting, receptivity to safety concerns, and regard for  the field of biosafety\u2014is central to a robust reporting program. Even if  there is receptivity to biosafety issues, when safety is the responsibility of  those internal to the organization, there may be conflicts of interest in  addressing safety issues. While safety improvements are most useful when  shared across the lab community, sharing this information may raise  institutional concerns about funding streams, public perception of the  institution, and professional standing of lab workers, according to  biosafety specialists we spoke with.", "Given the advantages and disadvantages of SRS administration at both the  local and agency levels, dual reporting options may be necessary, at least  initially. For example, the VA initiated its safety reporting program with  both internal and external options. Although the VA canceled the NASA- run program after nearly 10 years, in recognition of the importance of an  external reporting option, some efforts to reestablish the system continue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "In the Context of Existing Information, Lessons Suggest Several Features for Reporter Protections and Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Existing information about the potential goals for a biological lab SRS and  the organizational culture of these labs suggest certain design and  implementation features in the second key area: reporter protections and  incentives. Figure 6 shows the relationship of program goals and  organizational culture to this key area.", "Voluntary reporting to an SRS\u2014especially of incidents that do not result in  LAIs\u2014would be a new expectation for some lab workers. As mentioned  earlier, even the perception of a confidentiality breach can quash  reporting. And given that entity information from the TLR reporting  system was leaked to the press, lab workers might have reason for  concern about reporting similar incidents to a voluntary system. In  addition, the literature and biosafety specialists noted, confidentiality  concerns are among the barriers SRS managers will face in implementing a  successful reporting program. Therefore, concerns about confidentiality  suggest that a biological lab SRS will require strong confidentiality  protections, data deidentification processes, and other incentives to  encourage reporting, according to lessons learned. In addition, while the  literature suggests anonymous reporting as one solution for minimizing  confidentiality concerns, it is not an ideal one here. The complexity of  biosafety issues would require a mechanism for follow-up with the worker  or reporting entity because interpretation of the incident from a written  report can often differ from interpretation of the incident from talking  with the reporter, according to biosafety specialists.", "Biosafety specialists also noted that developing trust in reporting has the  potential to be problematic because of labs\u2019 existing reporting culture. For  example, specialists noted the following influences on lab workers\u2019  likelihood of reporting accidents or incidents:  realization that there is risk associated with laboratory work;    difficulty recognizing that an incident has occurred, and knowing that this    disincentives for reporting, such as the threat of punishment for reporting  or concerns about (1) the reputation of both the worker and the  institution, (2) the potential loss of research funds, and (3) the fact that  reporting may take time away from work; and  lack of perceived incentives for reporting, such as the failure to see the  value of reporting accidents or incidents, as well as the fact that lab work  may be done alone, which does not provide an incentive for self-reporting  of errors.", "Given the confidentiality concerns and other difficulties of introducing a  voluntary reporting system into the biological lab community,  deidentification of safety reports takes on more importance. For example,  according to biosafety specialists at one university, a primary concern  with the establishment of their SRS was anonymity, especially for those in  the agricultural labs. These researchers were concerned that if their  identities became known, they could suffer from retaliation from  organizations opposed to their research. While the SRS managers chose to  make the reports available to the public via the Web, they also deidentified  the reports to prevent individuals outside the lab community from being  able to identify individuals or specific labs. However, because the  university research community is a small one and lab work is fairly  specific, it is not overly difficult for those in the lab community to  determine who was involved in an incident if a report mentions a  particular pathogen and what was being done with it. As a result,  deidentification measures may have to go beyond simply removing  reporter information. In addition, if deidentification measures are  insufficient for maintaining confidentiality, workers and entities may need  added incentives to encourage reporting in light of the fact that their  identities may become known.", "There are several incentives for the lab community to report, according to  biosafety specialists. For example, deidentified SRS data can enhance the  evidentiary foundation for biosafety research since it provides an  extensive, heretofore unavailable data source. Such analyses benefit the  overall lab community by providing greater evidentiary basis for risk  based decisions for\u2014or against\u2014expensive or burdensome lab safety  protocols. In addition, workers\u2019 trust in reporting can be developed over  time at the local level, through rewarding, nonpunitive reporting  experiences. The relationship workers have with the lab\u2019s safety staff is  central to this effort, according to biosafety specialists. Trust in an  institution\u2019s Occupational Health Service, biosafety officer, or other  official responsible for safety encourages workers to overcome ignorance,  reluctance, or indifference to reporting. Biosafety specialists at one  university credit the success of their nonpunitive SRS to the safety-focused  relationship among the biosafety officer and lab staff. At first, according to  these biosafety specialists, the researchers were afraid that SRS reports  would be used to punish them academically or professionally. Over time,  however, they saw the implementation of a nonpunitive system that had  positive outcomes for safety improvements in the lab.", "While biosafety specialists believed that development of a reporting  culture might be difficult, they offered a number of suggestions for  overcoming reporting barriers, including (1) developing a safety office in  conjunction with the research staff, (2) ensuring continued interaction and  shared conferences on safety issues with researchers and the biosafety  office to show the value of reported information, and (3) reinforcing the  importance of reporting by showing a concern for the individual that is  exposed rather than focusing on punishment. In addition, the CDC noted  the importance of biosafety training, which is an important part of  laboratory safety culture that has an impact on workers\u2019 ability to  recognize and report safety issues. This type of continued support for  reporting\u2014as evidenced through positive feedback, awards, and  nonpunitive experiences and training\u2014fosters trust and willingness to  report, according to lessons learned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In the Context of Existing Information, Lessons Suggest Several Features for Feedback Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Existing information about the potential goals for a biological lab SRS and  the organizational culture of these labs suggest certain design and  implementation features in the third key area: feedback mechanisms.

For example, documents such as the BMBL and recombinant  DNA guidelines provide the foundational principles for lab safety  practices; they are updated periodically to reflect new information about  infectious agents and routes of exposure. In addition, the CDC\u2019s MMWR  reports provide alerts as emerging safety issues are identified. Lessons  suggest that entities with industrywide visibility and recognized authority  are ideally situated to ensure SRS data and safety improvement initiatives  are disseminated across the industry. Such entities would be better  positioned than individual labs, facilities, states, or others to disseminate  SRS-based alerts or other safety reports in a way that reaches all labs. In  addition, in order to counter the potential conflicts of interest that can  arise with sharing data across labs, biosafety specialists we spoke with  supported the notion of an \u201cindustry-level\u201d entity for disseminating safety  data. In particular, the specialists noted that the typical reporting  relationship between the biosafety officer and lab management is not  independent; this relationship might therefore inhibit sharing of safety  data beyond the individual lab. Thus, a central, industry-level unit\u2014 responsible for collecting and disseminating SRS reports from either  workers or organizations\u2014minimizes such concerns and facilitates  industrywide sharing of SRS data, according to lessons learned.", "SRS data can also support training, which is a key component of biosafety.  These data can provide the experiential basis for specific safety  precautions. For example, one biosafety specialist noted that staff want to  know this information in order to accept the need for precautions and  procedures. Currently, there is no such experiential database; however, an  industry-level entity could facilitate the creation and maintenance of such  a database from SRS data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Biosafety Specialists Note the Importance of Monitoring Safety Culture", "paragraphs": ["Some of the biosafety specialists we spoke with noted the importance of  ongoing monitoring of safety culture, for example, through a lab director\u2019s  personal investment of time and direct observation and communication  with lab workers. Without such observation and communication, as well  as feedback from workers, managers will remain unaware of areas where  the safety culture is likely to lead to serious problems. While specialists  did not specifically note the need for formal evaluation to solicit this  feedback, lessons learned suggest that evaluation is useful in this regard.  Specifically, evaluation can help identify (1) problem areas in the safety  culture and (2) where targeted outreach and training or program  modification might lead to better reporting and safety improvement. Such  evaluation is important in ensuring the system is working as effectively as  possible, according to lessons from the literature and case studies."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Safety reporting systems (SRS) can be key tools for safety improvement  efforts. Such systems increase the amount of information available for  identifying systemic safety issues by offering a means through which  workers can report a variety of events that shed light on underlying factors  in the work environment that can lead to accidents. Our extensive review  of SRS evaluation literature and case studies of SRS use in three industries  provides an empirical, experience-based foundation for developing a  framework for SRS design and implementation. This framework can be  applied across a wide variety of industrial, organizational, professional,  and cultural contexts. The industries we studied, despite their differences,  shared similar experiences designing and using SRSs for safety  improvement. The commonalities they shared provide the basis for our  lessons\u2014the pros and cons and successes and failures\u2014relating to  particular design and implementation choices across a wide variety of  work environments. However, it is important to recognize the uniqueness  of any work environment.  The biological lab community is undoubtedly a  unique working environment and blindly applying an SRS from one  industry to the lab community would be a mistake. This observation  underlies the leading finding among our lessons: in choosing the system  features most appropriate for the environment in which the SRS will  operate, consideration of program goals and organizational culture is  essential. Such consideration provides the context for choosing features in  three key areas of system design and implementation\u2014reporting and  analysis, reporter protections and incentives, and feedback mechanisms.", "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Select Agent Program (SAP)  manage a mandatory reporting system for theft, loss, and release (TLR) of  select agents. Although this system is compliance-based, it can be used\u2014 like the SRSs in our study\u2014to identify systemic safety issues. In fact, the  agencies have taken steps to use the system in this way. For example, the  agencies have dedicated expert resources to manage the system,  developed guidance to clarify reportable events and procedures to ensure  reporter confidentiality, and used information from the system to provide  feedback about safety issues to the select agent lab community. However,  lessons from the literature and case studies suggest additional actions in  assessment and the three key areas that could further improve reporting  and the usefulness of the system as a source for safety data. These  elements include an assessment of organizational culture, a lower  threshold for reportable events, limited immunity provisions, and  mechanisms for international lesson sharing and evaluation. Through  these actions, efforts to identify areas for system improvement, target  outreach and training, and encourage reporting could be supported.", "While other industries have developed industrywide SRSs, one does not  exist for the broader laboratory community. However, recognizing the  potential of such a system for the laboratory community, an interagency  task force on biosafety recommended it and Congress proposed legislation  to develop one. While current safety guidance for biological labs is based  on many years of experience working with infectious organisms and  analyses of laboratory-acquired infections (LAI), there are some  limitations to these data. For example, a widely recognized limitation is  the high rate of under-reporting of LAIs. In addition, accident and illness  data are incomplete, and reported information usually does not fully  describe factors contributing to the LAIs. Such issues limit the amount of  information available for identification of systemic factors that can lead to  accidents. A national laboratorywide voluntary SRS that is accessible to all  labs and designed around specific goals and organizational culture would  facilitate collection of such data to inform safety improvements. Analysis  of these data could support evidence-based modifications to lab practices  and procedures, reveal problems with equipment use or design, and  identify training needs and requirements.", "Establishing such an SRS for the lab community, however, would require  addressing some unique issues. Although our findings suggest that  reporting systems should be tied to program goals and a clear sense of the  organizational culture, this is problematic for biological labs because they  are not a clearly identified or defined population. In addition, there is no  agency or entity with the authority to direct such assessments across the  entire lab community. Proposed federal legislation, if enacted, would  establish a role for an SRS for the lab community to be administered by  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department  of Agriculture (USDA). If HHS and USDA are directed to develop such an  SRS, certain features for the three key areas are suggested by existing  studies, the CDC\u2019s and APHIS\u2019s experiences with the TLR reporting  system, and biosafety specialists\u2019 knowledge of organizational culture in  labs and experiences with safety reporting. Lessons developed from  experiences with the National Institutes of Health\u2019s (NIH) prototype  reporting system for its intramural research labs might inform design and  implementation considerations as well. In addition, stakeholder  involvement in goal setting is particularly important given the issues  related to visibility and oversight of the broader lab population. The  greater the stakeholder involvement, the greater the likelihood the  perspectives of labs with varying environments and cultures will be  represented. Stakeholders may also have knowledge of, and access to, labs  that can support cultural assessments and encourage reporting. Such  assessments are important for understanding differences in organizational  cultures across the diverse types and levels of labs that could affect  choices for system scope and features.", "Until a cultural assessment is conducted, existing information about likely  system goals and labs\u2019 organizational culture suggests certain features in  the three key areas\u2014reporting and analysis, reporter protections and  incentives, and feedback mechanisms. With respect to reporting and  analysis, a variety of factors suggest voluntary reporting for labs outside  the Select Agent Program, including likely system goals for learning rather  than enforcement and the need to collect information on incidents and  hazards as opposed to serious accidents. In addition, the lab community\u2019s  limited experience with this type of reporting, the diversity of lab  environments, and uncertainty about the reporting population suggest an  initially open classification scheme that allows workers to report events in  their own words, using multimode (Web or postal) and open-format  reporting options that are available to all workers. These options can  facilitate reporting in such situations. Lastly, the advantages and  disadvantages inherent in SRS administration at either the local or higher  level suggest that dual reporting options may be necessary. Such options\u2014 present in different forms in all three case industries\u2014allow workers to  submit reports to whichever level is most comfortable for them. For  example, workers would have the choice of whether to report to an  internal, lab-managed reporting program that feeds data to a central  authority or to an independent, externally managed SRS. Both of these  reporting options will also require strong confidentiality protections, data  deidentification, and other reporting incentives to foster trust in reporting.

However, the HHS disagreed with two of our  recommendations, and partially agreed with a third, to improve the theft,  loss, and release (TLR) reporting system for select agents. Specifically, the  HHS disagreed with our first recommendation\u2014to lower the threshold for  reportable events to maximize information collection\u2014noting that their  current mandatory reporting thresholds for the Select Agent Program  (SAP) provides sufficiently robust information. While we appreciate the  CDC and APHIS Select Agent Program\u2019s efforts to clarify reporting  requirements to ensure all thefts, losses, and releases are reported,  lowering reporting thresholds could further ensure all relevant reports are  received. With lower reporting thresholds, questionable events are less  likely to go unreported because of confusion about whether to report.  Furthermore, we note that reporting below the currently established  threshold could be voluntary, thereby offering registered entities a  convenient, optional mechanism for sharing identified hazards. This is  similar to the agencies\u2019 recently initiated, anonymous fraud, waste, and  abuse reporting system. However, reporting to the TLR system would  enable follow-up and feedback with the reporting lab because of its  confidential, as opposed to anonymous, nature. Lastly, biosafety  specialists we spoke with, as well as HHS staff involved in updating the  BMBL, specifically noted the lack of available data for developing  evidence-based biosafety guidelines. Data collected through the TLR  system\u2014especially if it is more comprehensive\u2014could provide such data.", "The HHS also disagreed with our second recommendation--to offer limited  immunity protections to encourage reporting.  While the HHS agrees that  identification of safety issues is important, they believe they do not have  statutory authority to offer limited immunity.  The Public Health Security  and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 required the  Secretary of HHS to promulgate regulations requiring individuals and  entities to notify HHS and others in the event of the theft, loss, or release  of select agents and toxins.  Violations of the Select Agent Regulations  may result in criminal or civil money penalties. While we do not want to  suggest that the HHS waive these penalties under a limited immunity  provision, the Act sets maximum civil money penalties for Select Agent  Regulations violations at $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for entities,  which provides the HHS Secretary, now delegated to the HHS Inspector  General, discretion to charge penalties up to those maximum amounts.  In  addition, while reporting is required by law, individuals or entities may be  concerned that reporting thefts, losses, or releases may lead to increased  inspections by the CDC or referral to the Inspector General of the  Department of Health and Human Services for investigation and possible  penalties.  Therefore, we recommend the CDC, in conjunction with other  pertinent oversight agencies, examine whether adding limited immunity  protections into the TLR reporting system would ease individuals' and  entities' fears of reporting and encourage them to provide more complete  information on thefts, losses, and releases. One possible way to  incorporate limited immunity protections into the TLR reporting system  would be to lower the civil money penalty for those individuals or entities  who properly filed a TLR report should penalties be appropriate for the  theft, loss, or release being reported.  We believe the Secretary of HHS has  sufficiently broad authority under the Public Health Security and  Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 to provide such  immunity protections.  The literature and our case studies identified  limited immunity as a key incentive for reporting, and HHS' Trans-Federal  Task Force on optimizing biosafety and biocontainment oversight noted  the potential of the Aviation Safety Reporting System--and its associated  immunity provisions--as a model for a national SRS for biological labs.", "Lastly, the HHS partially agreed with the third recommendation. While the  agency agreed with the recommendation to develop processes for  identifying reporting gaps and system evaluation to support targeted  outreach and system modification, they disagreed with the  recommendation to share TLR data for international lab safety  improvement efforts. In particular, the HHS notes its lack of authority to  regulate foreign laboratories and suggests such activities might be better  placed elsewhere in the CDC. As the literature and case studies illustrate,  it is important to share safety lessons as broadly as possible. Sharing TLR  lessons does not involve regulation of foreign labs, so additional authority  is not required. Furthermore, the recommendation is directed to the CDC  SAP because they manage the TLR system. If the CDC SAP wished to  delegate the responsibility for sharing TLR lessons with the international  lab community to another HHS entity, it would satisfy the intent of the  recommendation.", "The HHS also commented on the matters for congressional consideration,  for example, suggesting additional matters that fall outside the scope of  this review. The agency disagreed with GAO on several issues, such as (1)  the scope of the recommendations, (2) the extent to which the biological  lab industry might benefit from an SRS, (3) particular SRS features noted  in the matters for congressional consideration, and (4) reporting  thresholds and system management. These general comments and our  responses to them are included in appendix IV. The HHS also provided  technical comments which we addressed, as appropriate.", "In written comments, the USDA concurred with our recommendations,  although they noted several disagreements in their detailed responses.  With respect to our first recommendation\u2014to lower reporting  thresholds\u2014the USDA noted, like the HHS, that (1) they believe the  current reporting thresholds (providing 130 reports a year) are sufficiently  robust and (2) APHIS\u2019s other monitoring and surveillance activities are  sufficient for monitoring safety and security conditions in select agent  labs. As noted above, we believe that with lower reporting thresholds,  questionable events are less likely to go unreported because of confusion  about whether to report. Furthermore, we note that reporting below the  currently established threshold could be voluntary, thereby offering  registered entities a mechanism for sharing identified hazards in a system  that would enable follow-up and feedback with reporters.

As noted above, we believe the Secretary of  USDA has sufficiently broad authority under the Agricultural Bioterrorism  Protection Act of 2002 to provide such immunity protections for the TLR  reporting system. However, in recognition that such provisions might  require coordination with other agencies, we added this clarification to the  recommendations.", "Lastly, in response to our third recommendation\u2014to (1) share TLR data  for international lab safety improvement efforts and (2) identify reporting  gaps and conduct system evaluation\u2014the USDA noted that they did not  believe additional regulatory oversight was needed and that targeted  education and safety training in high-risk areas would likely be more cost  effective. Our recommendation does not suggest any additional regulatory  oversight. It is focused on broadly sharing lessons learned from the TLR  system and on identifying areas\u2014through analysis of TLR data and  evaluation\u2014for targeted outreach and training and system modification.  These actions are methods through which the USDA can better identify  the \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d the agency notes should be targeted for education  and training.

The safety science literature serves as  background information and was also used to develop familiarity with  safety science terms and theories required for our assessment of the SRS  evaluation literature.

We chose to focus on the aviation, commercial nuclear power, and health  care industries because they are moderate- to high-risk industries that  represent a variety of (1) organizational cultures, (2) length of experience  using SRSs for safety improvement, and (3) feature and design choices in  their SRS programs. While we collected information on a wide variety of  safety reporting programs and systems in these industries\u2014and in some  cases comment on these different programs\u2014we primarily developed our  lessons from one reporting program in each of the three industries.  Specifically, we developed lessons from the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s (FAA) National Aeronautic and Space Administration  (NASA)-run Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) in aviation, the  Institute of Nuclear Power Operation\u2019s (INPO\u00ae) Significant Event  Evaluation-Information Network (SEE-IN\u00ae) system in commercial nuclear  power, and the VA\u2019s internally managed Patient Safety Information System  (PSIS) and NASA-managed Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) in VA  health care. We chose to focus on these systems because they represent  fairly long-standing, nonregulatory, domestic, industrywide or servicewide  reporting programs. For example, NASA\u2019s ASRS has been in operation for  34 years; INPO\u2019s SEE-IN, for 30 years; and VA\u2019s PSIS and PSRS, for 10  years. Although we primarily developed our lessons from these key SRSs,  we also collected information on other notable SRSs in the industries,  including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) Allegations  Program, the FAA\u2019s Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP), and the  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s (AHRQ) Patient Safety  Organizations (PSO) program, among others.", "To assess the TLR reporting system, we interviewed agency officials,  reviewed agency and other documentation, and applied lessons from the  literature and case studies to these findings. Specifically, using a standard  question set, we interviewed HHS officials from the Coordinating Center  for Infectious Disease, Office of Health and Safety, and Division of Select  Agents and Toxins, and received responses to our question set from the  USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). In addition,  we attended an agency conference on select agent reporting and reviewed  documents from this conference and from the National Select Agent  Registry (NSAR) Web site, detailing TLR reporting requirements and  scenarios. We also reviewed GAO testimony and reports on previously  identified TLR reporting issues. Using the lessons for SRS design and  implementation derived from the literature and case studies, we applied  these criteria to identify areas for TLR improvements.", "To propose design and implementation considerations for a national  biological laboratory reporting system, we reviewed studies and other  reports on biosafety, interviewed HHS officials and domestic and  international biosafety specialists, attended conferences on biosafety and  incident reporting, and applied lessons from the literature and case studies  to these findings.

Specifically, we used a standardized question set  to gather specialists\u2019 views about overall design and implementation  considerations for a labwide reporting program, as well as how lab culture  and safety orientation (1) vary by level and type of lab; (2) affect reporting  under current requirements; and (3) might affect reporting to a national  biological lab SRS.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 through  September 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

We disagree. We do understand that the scope of statutory authority  for the Select Agent Program is limited to registered entities. That is  why our recommendations for improvements to the TLR program are  directed to the CDC and APHIS, while recommendations for a national  SRS for all labs are directed to Congress through matters for  consideration. We do not make recommendations for the national SRS  to the CDC or APHIS because they do not have authority for labs  outside the Select Agent Program.", "Furthermore, the recommendations, as well as the matters for  congressional consideration, are directly linked and logically follow  from the data presented in the report. This report has two objectives  (the third and fourth) related to an SRS for biological labs and two sets  of recommendations that flow from those objectives. We have  structured our report this way because we recognize that the statutory  authority for the Select Agent Program is limited to the oversight of  biosafety at registered entities and that creation of a new safety  reporting system would require new authority and resources, in  particular:    Objective 3\u2014applying lessons from SRS literature and case studies  to assess the theft, loss, and release (TLR) reporting system, part of  the Select Agent Program\u2014focuses on the TLR system, and thus  applies to only registered entities and associated labs. The  recommendations derived from this review of the TLR system are  directed to the CDC and APHIS Select Agent Program because they  have the statutory authority for this system.", "Objective 4\u2014applying lessons from SRS literature and case studies  to suggest design and implementation considerations for a national  safety reporting system\u2014applies to all biological laboratories, in  particular those outside the Select Agent Program. Because there is  currently no agency with specific authority for such a system to  whom we could direct recommendations, they are directed to  Congress through Matters for Congressional Consideration.  2.  We disagree. We recognize that implementation of any program has  costs. However, evidence from the literature indicates that the benefits  of an SRS can far outweigh the costs; this position was also endorsed  by experts from the three case study industries. While we certainly  encourage the NIH and CDC Select Agent Program efforts to share  information that is currently reported, assessing the sufficiency of  existing data was not within the scope of this engagement. In its  comments to an earlier report on oversight of high-containment labs  (GAO-09-574), the HHS agreed with our recommendation that lessons  learned should be synthesized and shared with the broader  community. They further noted that while the HHS and USDA have the  ability to gather such data for laboratories registered with the Select  Agent Program, a separate mechanism must be identified to gather  information about releases in laboratories that do not work with select  agents. A national SRS for all biological laboratories is such a  mechanism. In addition, the Trans-federal Task Force on Optimizing  Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight\u2014co-chaired by the HHS and  USDA\u2014recommended a new voluntary, nonpunitive incident-reporting  system, and pending legislation in both the House and Senate would  establish such a system. For these reasons, we did not revisit the issue  of whether a nationwide SRS for biological labs is necessary. Instead,  we agreed to examine the literature and SRSs in other industries to  support effective design and implementation of such a system, should  it be established.  3.  The concerns raised here do not accurately characterize the message  and matters conveyed in the report, and are not supported by evidence  from the literature and our case studies. Specifically, (1) our  recommendation to allow workers to report in their own words does  not equate to \u201cfree-form reporting.\u201d Rather, it relates to how errors are  classified and labeled and where in the process that should take place.  (See sections \u201cLesson 2: Broad Reporting Thresholds, Experience- Driven Classification Schemes, and Processing at the Local Level Are  Useful Features in Industries New to Safety Reporting\u201d and  \u201cEncouraging Workers to Report Incidents in Their Own Words  Facilitates Reporting Initially\u201d for further detail.) In commenting on  this issue, an internationally recognized SRS expert at NASA noted  that, while highly structured reporting forms may decrease the  analytical workload, the data quality is largely sacrificed for this false  sense of efficiency. Requiring the reporter to also be the analyst\u2014 evaluating aspects of the event\u2014creates unreliable assessments  because of the variability in workers\u2019 perspectives. Open-field  narrative has the best hope of providing insights that are largely  unknown by personnel who invent the structured questions.  Consequently, allowing workers to report in their own words and  applying error classifications at the analytical level serve to improve,  rather than degrade, data quality.", "In addition, an SRS does not inherently produce unintelligible reports,  redundant data, lack of quality control, and unreliable statistics. One of  our key messages is that determining system goals\u2014such as for  specific analytical capabilities or means to identify specific locations  or groups\u2014is essential to do up front, in order to select system  features compatible with these goals. In the section \u201cProgram Goals  and Organizational Culture Guide Safety Reporting System Design and  Implementation in Three Key Areas,\u201d we describe the pros and cons of  different system features and how choices for specific features should  logically flow from system goals and assessment of organizational  culture. We have recommended, for congressional consideration,  certain features for a national SRS for biological labs that appear best  aligned with existing information about system goals and lab culture.  4.  The importance of culture in SRS design and implementation is  foundational in our report, and is reflected in our graphics, findings,  conclusions, and matters for congressional consideration.  5.  We agree that this is a useful clarification and have made this change,  as appropriate, throughout the report.  6.  We do not confuse the TLR with a safety reporting system. We are  aware that the system serves a regulatory function, and recognize this  in the body of the report. However, we also recognize that this is not a  dichotomy\u2014the TLR\u2019s regulatory function does not preclude its  usefulness as a safety tool. In fact, we commend the CDC and APHIS  Select Agent Program for recognizing the TLR\u2019s potential beyond its  mere regulatory function. In particular, in the section \u201cThe CDC and  APHIS have Taken Steps to Improve the Usefulness of the TLR  Reporting System; Lessons from the Literature and Case Studies  Suggest Additional Steps,\u201d we comment on the agencies\u2019 recognition of  the system\u2019s usefulness for providing safety improvement data and our  recommendations reflect enhancements to the system for this purpose.  In addition, while we agree that a national reporting system might  address the issue of capturing events (such as near misses or identified  hazards) that are below the threshold for reporting to the TLR system,  no such system currently exists. Consequently, the TLR system is the  only system ideally situated to capture this information.  7.  We recognize that implementation of any program has costs. However,  evidence from the literature indicates that the benefits of an SRS can  far outweigh the costs, a position that was also endorsed by experts  from the three case study industries. We agree that dedicating  resources is essential to successfully implement an SRS program, and  this is reflected in the first lesson derived from the case studies\u2014 \u201dAssessment, dedicated resources, and management focus are needed  to understand and improve safety culture.\u201d However, it is outside the  scope of this report to add a matter for congressional consideration to  assess the relative priority of implementing a safety reporting system  as compared to other biosafety improvements. See also comment #2  above, in response to HHS\u2019s earlier remark about evaluating whether,  and not how, to develop a national SRS for biological labs.  8.  We agree this is an important consideration. In the section \u201cLevel of  Event: The Severity of Events Captured Generally Determines Whether  an SRS Is Mandatory or Voluntary,\u201d we note that mandatory reporting  is generally preferred when program goals are focused on enforcement  of regulations. Serious events\u2014such as accidents resulting in injuries  or deaths\u2014are typically the level of event collected in mandatory  SRSs, whereas voluntary reporting is generally preferred when  learning is the goal. The purpose of a national SRS for all labs would  likely be for learning rather than compliance because the SAP  program, through the TLR system, already manages the regulatory  function for the most dangerous pathogens. Accordingly, it is logical  that a national SRS for all biological labs would be a voluntary,  nonregulatory system.  9.  Evidence from the literature and our case studies does not support this  argument. While we appreciate the NIH\u2019s concerns about the clarity of  reporting requirements, we found that mandatory and voluntary  systems are often employed concurrently\u2014sometimes independently  and sometimes in complementary roles\u2014because programs face the  dual requirements of regulating and promoting safety improvement. In  order to ensure appropriate levels of reporting, however, we also note  the importance of setting clear goals and reporting thresholds for each  system and communicating reporting requirements to the lab  community. In addition, evaluation is an important tool for identifying  and addressing such problems. Consequently, we recommended  evaluation for both the TLR system and the national SRS for biological  labs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Rebecca Shea, Assistant Director;  Amy Bowser; Barbara Chapman; Jean McSween; Laurel Rabin; and  Elizabeth Wood made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bibliography of Articles Used to Develop SRS Lessons from the Literature", "paragraphs": ["Aagaard, L., B.
