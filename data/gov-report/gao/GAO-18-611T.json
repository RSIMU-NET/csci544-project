It addresses (1) what is known about SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children over the summer, and (3) challenges in providing summer meals to children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address these challenges.", "For its May 2018 report, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA's SFSP data for fiscal years 2007 through 2016; and surveyed state agencies responsible for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia. GAO also visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites, selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and rural locations, and analyzed meal site data from these 3 states. In addition, GAO interviewed USDA, state, and national organization officials, as well as SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide, the total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal year 2007 through 2016, according to GAO's May 2018 report. GAO noted that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) directed states to use the number of meals served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children participating in the SFSP. However, GAO found that participation estimates had been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year. In 2017, USDA took steps to improve the consistency of participation estimates, noting they are critical for informing program implementation and strategic planning. However, GAO determined that the method USDA directed states to use would continue to provide unreliable estimates of participation, hindering USDA's ability to use them for these purposes.", "Other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children over the summer to some extent, according to states GAO surveyed and SFSP providers and others GAO interviewed for its May 2018 report. For example, GAO found that in July 2016, about 26 million meals were served through a separate federal program that allowed school meal providers to serve summer meals, according to USDA data. Some children also received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though GAO's state survey and interviews with SFSP meal providers and national organizations indicated the reach of such efforts was limited.", "In GAO's May 2018 report, states and SFSP meal providers reported challenges with issues related to meal sites, participation, and program administration, though USDA, state, and local officials had taken some steps to address these issues. Seventeen states in GAO's survey and several providers in the states GAO visited reported a challenge with ensuring meal sites were in safe locations. To address this issue, USDA granted some states and providers flexibility from the requirement that children consume meals on-site. However, GAO found that USDA had not broadly communicated the circumstances it considered when granting this flexibility or reported to Congress on the use of flexibilities with respect to the on-site requirement in areas where safety was a concern, per requirements. As a result, neither USDA nor Congress knew whether these flexibilities were helping provide meals to children and meeting program goals. Further, officials from national and regional organizations GAO interviewed, as well as providers GAO visited, reported challenges related to the administrative burden associated with participating in multiple child nutrition programs. Although USDA had established program and policy simplifications to help lessen related burdens, the persistence of challenges in this area suggested that information had not reached all relevant state agencies, potentially limiting children's access to meals by discouraging provider participation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its May 2018 report, GAO made four recommendations, including that USDA improve estimates of children's participation in SFSP, communicate the circumstances it considers when granting flexibilities to ensure safe meal delivery, evaluate and annually report to Congress on its use of waivers and demonstration projects when granting these flexibilities, and disseminate information about existing flexibilities available to streamline administrative requirements for providers participating in multiple child nutrition programs. USDA generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). A federal  nutrition program created in 1968, SFSP is designed to provide food  service to children in low-income areas during periods when area schools  are closed for vacation. In fiscal year 2017, USDA spent $485 million to  provide 152 million meals to children through the SFSP.", "USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees the SFSP, which is  administered by the states and operated by a variety of public and private  nonprofit organizations and government entities that sponsor meals for  children at supervised sites such as schools, camps, parks, churches,  and libraries. FNS is responsible for issuing regulations, instructions, and  guidance; overseeing program administration; and reimbursing states for  meals served that meet program requirements. State agencies are  responsible for approving and monitoring sponsors who, in turn, are  responsible for monitoring and managing their meal sites.", "SFSP meals must meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for  federal reimbursement; for example, the meal must be served and  consumed on-site at an approved meal site. States may approve  different types of meal sites, including open sites, closed enrolled sites,  and camps. For example, open sites operate in an area where at least  half of the children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals  (referred to as \u201carea eligible\u201d), according to data from entities such as  schools or the U.S. Census Bureau. Meals must also meet federal  requirements for menu components, meal times, and nutrition.", "Some flexibilities are available to FNS in implementing the SFSP  program, under its waiver and demonstration authorities. For example,  the Secretary of Agriculture has statutory authority to waive, upon request  of a state or eligible service provider, certain child nutrition program  requirements, including some for the SFSP. To grant a waiver request,  the Secretary must determine that the waiver would facilitate the state or  service provider\u2019s ability to carry out the purpose of the program, and that  the waiver will not increase the overall cost of the program to the federal  government, among other things. In the event a waiver request is  submitted, the Secretary is required to act promptly and state in writing  whether the waiver request is granted or denied, and why. The Secretary  is also required to periodically review the performance of waiver  recipients, and submit an annual report to Congress summarizing the use  of waivers and their effectiveness, among other details.", "In addition to this waiver authority, the Secretary is also authorized to  carry out demonstration projects to develop and test methods of providing  access to summer meals for low-income children in urban and rural  areas, to reduce or eliminate the food insecurity and hunger of low- income children and improve their nutritional status. The Secretary is  required to provide for an independent evaluation of the demonstration  projects carried out under this authority, and submit an annual report to  Congress on the status of each project and the results of the  evaluations.", "My testimony today summarizes the findings from our May 2018 report on  summer meals. This statement addresses (1) what is known about  SFSP participation, (2) other programs that help feed low-income children  over the summer, and (3) challenges in providing summer meals to  children and the extent to which USDA provides assistance to address  these challenges. To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant  federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed USDA\u2019s SFSP data for  fiscal years 2007 through 2016; and surveyed state agencies responsible  for administering the SFSP in 50 states and the District of Columbia. We  also visited a nongeneralizable group of 3 states and 30 meal sites,  selected based on Census data on child poverty rates and urban and  rural locations, and analyzed meal site data from these 3 states. In  addition, we interviewed USDA, state, and national organization officials,  as well as SFSP providers, including sponsors and site operators. Our  work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. More details on our scope and methodology can be  found in the issued report.", "In brief, we found that although USDA collects information about the  actual number of meals served to children through the SFSP program\u2014 which is one indicator of program participation\u2014USDA\u2019s estimates of the  number of children participating in the SFSP were unreliable. As a result,  USDA\u2019s understanding of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP was limited,  impairing its ability to both inform program implementation and facilitate  strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation.", "Other federal and nonfederal programs helped feed low-income children  over the summer to some extent. These federal programs included the  National School Lunch Program\u2019s Seamless Summer Option, which  provides nutrition assistance benefits solely in the summer, and several  federal programs that operate year-round. Nonfederal programs,  commonly operated by local faith-based organizations and foodbanks,  also helped feed low-income children in the summer, but states and local  organizations reported that these had limited reach.", "Finally, there were gaps in USDA\u2019s efforts to address reported challenges  related to SFSP meal site safety and program administration. Although  USDA had granted some states and sponsors flexibility from the  requirement that children consume meals on-site when safety at the site  was a concern, the agency did not broadly communicate the  circumstances it considers when granting this flexibility, hindering its  usefulness in ensuring safe summer meal delivery to children.  Additionally, while FNS had established program and policy  simplifications to help lessen the administrative burden on sponsors  participating in multiple child nutrition programs, challenges in this area  persisted. Some of these simplifications had not been shared recently  with states, potentially discouraging sponsor participation in child nutrition  programs and limiting children\u2019s access to meals.", "My statement will highlight four recommendations we made in our May  report that USDA should implement to help improve SFSP participation  estimates and address challenges reported by states and sponsors  related to meal site safety and duplicative paperwork. In oral comments,  FNS officials, including the Deputy Administrator for Child Nutrition  Programs, generally agreed with the recommendations in the report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Number of SFSP Meals Served Generally Increased from 2007 through 2016, but Estimates of Children Participating Were Unreliable", "paragraphs": ["The total number of SFSP meals served nationwide during the summer\u2014 one indicator of program participation\u2014increased from 113 million meals  in fiscal year 2007 to 149 million meals in fiscal year 2016, or by 32  percent. Although almost half of the total increase in meals served in the  summer months was due to increases in lunches, when comparing  across each of the meal types, supper and breakfast had the largest  percentage increases over the 10-year period, 50 and 48 percent,  respectively (see table 1). The increase in SFSP meals over this time  period was generally consistent with increases in the number of meals  served in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the largest child  nutrition assistance program, during this period.", "Although states reported the actual number of SFSP meals served to  FNS for reimbursement purposes, they estimated the number of children  participating in SFSP, and these participation estimates have been  calculated inconsistently, impairing FNS\u2019s ability to inform program  implementation and facilitate strategic planning and outreach to areas  with low participation. Specifically, state agencies calculated a statewide  estimate of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP, referred to as average  daily attendance (ADA), using sponsor-reported information on the  number of meals served and days of operation in July of each year.  However, according to our review of states\u2019 survey responses and FNS  documents, states\u2019 methods for calculating ADA have differed from state  to state and from year to year. For example, although FNS directed states  to include the number of meals served in each site\u2019s primary meal  service\u2014which may or may not be lunch\u2014some states calculated ADA  using only meals served at lunch. In addition, five states reported in our  survey that the method they used to calculate ADA in fiscal year 2016  differed from the one they used previously.", "While FNS clarified its instructions in May 2017 to help improve the  consistency of states\u2019 ADA calculations moving forward, ADA, even if  consistently calculated, remained an unreliable estimate of children\u2019s  daily participation in SFSP for at least two reasons. First, ADA did not  account for existing variation in the number of days that each site serves  meals to children. Specifically, because FNS\u2019s instructions indicated that  sites\u2019 ADAs were to be combined to provide a statewide ADA estimate,  differences in the number of days of meal service at each site were  disregarded. As a result, ADA did not reflect the average number of  children served SFSP meals daily throughout the month. Second, ADA  was an unreliable estimate of children\u2019s participation in SFSP because it  did not account for state variation in the month with the greatest number  of SFSP meals served. According to FNS officials, the agency instructed  states to calculate ADA for July because officials identified this as the  month with the largest number of meals served nationwide. However,  according to our analysis of nationwide FNS data, in summer 2016, 26  states served more SFSP meals in June or August than in July.", "Although FNS had taken some steps to identify other data that states  collect on the SFSP, at the time of our May 2018 report, FNS had not yet  used this information to help improve its estimate of children\u2019s  participation in the program. In 2015, FNS published a Request for  Information, asking whether states or sponsors collected any SFSP data  that were not reported to FNS, and received responses from 15 states.  The responses suggested some states collected additional data, such as  site-level data, that may allow for an improved estimate of children\u2019s  SFSP participation, potentially addressing the issues identified in our  analysis. FNS also followed up with several of these states in 2016 and  2017 to explore the feasibility of collecting additional data and improving  estimates of children\u2019s SFSP participation. FNS stated in a May 2017  memo to states that it is critical that the agency\u2019s means of estimating  children\u2019s participation in the SFSP is as accurate as possible because it  helps inform program implementation at the national level and facilitates  strategic planning and outreach to areas with low participation. Yet, at  the time of our report, FNS had not taken further action to improve the  estimate. In our May 2018 report, we concluded that FNS\u2019s limited  understanding of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP impaired its ability to  both inform program implementation and facilitate strategic planning and  outreach to areas with low participation.", "To improve FNS\u2019s estimate of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP, we  recommended that FNS focus on addressing, at a minimum, data  reliability issues caused by variations in the number of operating days of  meal sites and in the months in which states see the greatest number of  meals served. FNS generally agreed with this recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal and Nonfederal Programs Helped Feed Low- Income Children over the Summer to Some Extent", "paragraphs": ["Other federal and nonfederal programs that operate solely in the summer,  as well as those operating year-round, helped feed low-income children in  the summer months. For example, in 2016, FNS data indicated about 26  million meals were served through the NSLP\u2019s Seamless Summer Option,  a separate federal program that streamlines administrative requirements  for school meal providers serving summer meals. Some children also  received summer meals through nonfederal programs operated by  entities such as faith-based organizations and foodbanks, though the  reach of these efforts was limited, according to our state survey and  interviews with providers and national organizations at the time of our  report. For example, of the 27 states that reported in our survey  awareness of the geographic coverage of these nonfederal programs, 11  states indicated that they operated in some portions of the state\u2014the  most common state response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and SFSP Providers Faced Challenges with Meal Sites, Participation, and Program Administration, and FNS Actions Had Addressed Some, but Not All Areas", "paragraphs": ["States and SFSP providers reported challenges with issues related to  meal site availability, children\u2019s participation, and program administration,  though federal, state, and local entities had taken steps to improve these  areas. For example, a lack of available transportation, low population  density, and limited meal sites posed challenges for SFSP  implementation in rural areas, according to states we surveyed, selected  national organizations, and state and local officials in the three states we  visited. In response, state and local entities took steps, such as  transporting meals to children by bus, to address these issues\u2014efforts  that FNS supported through information sharing and grants.", "States and SFSP providers also reported challenges with meal site  safety, and FNS\u2019s efforts to address this area were limited. Seventeen  states reported in our survey that ensuring summer meal sites are in safe  locations was moderately to very challenging. Some states and  sponsors took steps to help address this issue, and FNS also used its  available authorities to grant some states and sponsors flexibility with  respect to the requirement that children consume summer meals on site,  such as when safety at the site is a concern. However, our review of FNS  documentation showed FNS had not clearly communicated to all states  and sponsors the circumstances it considers when deciding whether to  grant this flexibility. These circumstances\u2014described in letters the  agency sent to requesting states\u2014generally included verification that  violent crime activities occurred within both a 6-block radius of the meal  site and 72 hours prior to the meal service. Although FNS officials  explained that they reviewed state and sponsor requests for flexibility due  to safety concerns on a case-by-case basis, they also acknowledged that  the set of circumstances they used to approve state and sponsor  requests for flexibility, which we identified in their letters to states, had  been used repeatedly. Further, states and sponsors reported challenges  obtaining the specific data needed for approval of a site for this type of  flexibility, including inconsistent availability of timely data, which  hampered some providers\u2019 efforts to ensure safe delivery of meals.", "We concluded that unless FNS shared information with all states and  sponsors on the circumstances it considered when deciding whether to  grant flexibility with respect to the requirement that children consume  summer meals on site, states and sponsors would likely continue to be  challenged to use this flexibility, hindering its usefulness in ensuring safe  summer meal delivery to children. We therefore recommended that FNS communicate to all SFSP stakeholders the circumstances it considers in  approving requests for flexibility with respect to the requirement that  children consume SFSP meals on-site in areas that have experienced  crime and violence, taking into account the feasibility of accessing data  needed for approval, to ensure safe delivery of meals to children. FNS  generally agreed with this recommendation.", "We also found that while FNS had issued reports to Congress evaluating  some of its demonstration projects, as required under its statutory  authorities, the agency had not issued any such reports to Congress  specifically on the use of flexibilities with respect to the on-site  requirement in areas where safety was a concern. As previously  discussed, the agency is required to annually submit certain reports to  Congress regarding the use of waivers and evaluations of projects carried  out under its demonstration authority. FNS officials told us that they had  not evaluated or reported on these flexibilities, in part, because they had  limited information on their outcomes.", "We concluded that without understanding the impact of its use of these  flexibilities, neither FNS nor Congress knew whether these flexibilities  were helping provide meals to children\u2014the goal of the program.  Accordingly, we recommended that FNS evaluate and annually report to  Congress, as required by statute, on its use of waivers and demonstration  projects to grant states and sponsors flexibility with respect to the  requirement that children consume SFSP meals on-site in areas  experiencing crime or violence, to improve understanding of the use and  impact of granting these flexibilities on meeting program goals. FNS  generally agreed with this recommendation.", "Although FNS had established program and policy simplifications to help  lessen the administrative burden on sponsors participating in multiple  child nutrition programs, challenges in this area persisted, indicating that  information had not reached all relevant state agencies. According to  officials we spoke with from a national organization involved in summer  meals, management of each child nutrition program and the processes  related to applications, funding, and oversight were fragmented in many  states. For example, in one of the states we visited, a sponsor that  provided school meals during the school year told us they had to fill out  60 additional pages of paperwork to provide summer meals, which they  described as significant burden. FNS officials told us that some of the  duplicative requirements might have been a function of differences in  statute, and although FNS provided guidance to states on simplified  procedures for sponsors participating in more than one child nutrition  program, some states might have chosen not to implement them.", "We concluded that without further efforts from FNS to disseminate  information on current options for streamlining administrative  requirements across multiple child nutrition programs, overlapping and  duplicative administrative requirements may limit children\u2019s access to  meals by discouraging sponsor participation in child nutrition programs.  We recommended that FNS disseminate information about the existing  streamlining options, and FNS generally agreed with this  recommendation.", "Chairman Rokita, Ranking Member Polis, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
