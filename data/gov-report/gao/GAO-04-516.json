Energy had begun processing nearly 35 percent of the cases, but processing had not yet begun on nearly 60 percent of the cases. Further, insufficient strategic planning and systems limitations complicate the assessment of Energy's achievement of goals related to case processing, as well as goals related to program objectives, such as the quality of the assistance provided to claimants in filing for state workers' compensation. While Energy got off to a slow start in processing cases, it is now processing enough cases that there is a backlog of cases waiting for review by a physician panel. Energy has taken some steps intended to reduce this backlog, such as reducing the number of physicians needed for some panels. Nonetheless, a shortage of qualified physicians continues to constrain the agency's capacity to decide cases more quickly. Consequently, claimants will likely continue to experience lengthy delays in receiving the determinations they need to file workers' compensation claims. In the meantime, Energy has not kept claimants sufficiently informed about the delays in the processing of their claims as well as what claimants can expect as they proceed with state workers' compensation claims. GAO estimates that more than half of the cases associated with Energy facilities in 9 states that account for more than three-quarters of all Subtitle D cases filed are likely to have a willing payer of benefits. Another quarter of the cases in these 9 states, while not technically having a willing payer, have workers' compensation coverage provided by an insurer that has stated that it will not contest these claims. However, the remaining 20 percent of the cases in these 9 states lack willing payers and are likely to be contested. This has created concerns about program equity in that many of these cases may be less likely to receive compensation. Because of data limitations, these percentages provide an order of magnitude estimate of the extent to which claimants will have willing payers. These estimates could change as better data become available or as circumstances change, such as new contractors taking over at individual facilities. The estimates are not a prediction of actual benefit outcomes for claimants. Various options are available to improve payment outcomes for the cases that receive a positive physician panel determination, but lack willing payers. While not recommending any particular option, GAO provides a framework that includes a range of issues to help the Congress assess options if it chooses to change the current program. One of these issues in particular--the federal cost implications--should be carefully considered in the context of the current and projected federal fiscal environment. Please note that the recommendations for this report are identical to the recommendations in GAO-04-515 ."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the last several decades, the Department of Energy (Energy) and its  predecessor agencies and contractors have employed thousands of  individuals in secret and dangerous work in the nuclear weapons  production complex. Over the years, employees were exposed to toxic  substances, including radioactive and hazardous materials, and studies  have shown that many of these employees subsequently developed serious  illnesses. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation  Program Act (EEOICPA) established two programs to help secure  compensation for employees who developed occupational illnesses or for  their survivors. Congressional Committees, as well as individual Members  of Congress, claimants, and advocates have raised concerns regarding  Energy\u2019s processing of claims and the availability of benefits once claims  have been decided.", "Enacted as title XXXVI of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which was signed into law on  October 30, 2000, this legislation has two major components. Subtitle B  provides eligible workers who were exposed to radiation or other toxic  substances and who subsequently developed illnesses, such as cancer and  lung disease, with a one-time payment of up to $150,000 and covers future  medical expenses related to the illness. The Department of Labor  administers these benefits, payable from a compensation fund established  by the same legislation. Subtitle D allows Energy to help its contractor  employees file state workers\u2019 compensation claims for illnesses  determined by a panel of physicians to be caused by exposure to toxic  substances while employed at an Energy facility. Individuals may apply for  and receive benefits under both programs since benefits are not offset  against each other.", "You asked that we study the effectiveness of the benefit program under  Subtitle D of EEOICPA in assisting employees of Energy\u2019s contractors in  obtaining compensation for occupational illnesses.

We also reviewed the  provisions of, and interviewed officials with, the workers\u2019 compensation  programs in 9 states, which account for more than three-quarters of  Subtitle D cases filed, and we interviewed the contractors operating the  major facilities in these states. In addition, we conducted site visits to  three Energy facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the state with facilities  accounting for the largest number of Subtitle D claims.

Under the new law, workers or their survivors could apply for  assistance from Energy in pursuing state workers\u2019 compensation benefits,  and if they received a positive determination from Energy, the agency  would direct its contractors to not contest the workers\u2019 compensation  claims or awards. Energy\u2019s rules to implement the new program became  effective in September 2002, and the agency began to process the  applications it had been accepting since July 2001, when the law took  effect.", "Energy\u2019s claims process has several steps. First, claimants file applications  and provide all available medical evidence. Energy then develops the  claims by requesting records of employment, medical treatment, and  exposure to toxic substances from the Energy facilities at which the  workers were employed. If Energy determines that the worker was not  employed by one of its facilities or did not have an illness that could be  caused by exposure to toxic substances, the agency finds the claimant  ineligible. For all others, once development is complete, a panel of three  physicians reviews the case and decides whether exposure to a toxic  substance during employment at an Energy facility was at least as likely as  not to have caused, contributed to, or aggravated the claimed medical  condition. The panel physicians are appointed by the National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) but paid by Energy for this work.  Claimants receiving positive determinations are advised that they may  wish to file claims for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Claimants  found ineligible or receiving negative determinations may appeal to  Energy\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals.", "Each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia has its own workers\u2019  compensation program to provide benefits to workers who are injured on  the job or contract a work-related illness. Benefits include medical  treatment and cash payments that partially replace lost wages.  Collectively, these state programs paid more than $46 billion in cash and  medical benefits in 2001. In general, employers finance workers\u2019  compensation programs. Depending on state law, employers finance these  programs through one of three methods: (1) they pay insurance premiums  to a private insurance carrier, (2) they contribute to a state workers\u2019  compensation fund, or (3) they set funds aside for this purpose as self- insurance. Although state workers\u2019 compensation laws were enacted in  part as an attempt to avoid litigation over workplace accidents, the  workers\u2019 compensation process is still generally adversarial, with  employers and their insurers tending to contest aspects of claims that they  consider not valid.", "State workers\u2019 compensation programs vary as to the level of benefits,  length of payments, and time limits for filing. For example, in 1999, the  maximum weekly benefit for a total disability in New Mexico was less than  $400, while in Iowa it was approximately $950. In addition, in Idaho, the  weekly benefit for total disability would be reduced after 52 weeks, while  in Iowa benefits would continue at the original rate for the duration of the  disability. Further, in Tennessee, a claim must be filed within 1 year of the  beginning of incapacity or death. In contrast, in Kentucky, a claim must be  filed within 3 years of either the last exposure to most substances or the  onset of disease symptoms, but within 20 years of exposure to radiation or  asbestos.", "EEOICPA allows Energy, to the extent permitted by law, to direct its  contractors to not contest the workers\u2019 compensation claims filed by  Subtitle D claimant who received a positive determination from a  physician panel. In addition, the statute prohibits the inclusion of the costs  of contesting such claims as allowable costs under its contracts with the  contractors; however, Energy\u2019s regulations allow the costs incurred as the  result of a workers\u2019 compensation award to be reimbursed in the manner  permitted under the contracts. The Subtitle D program does not affect the  normal operation of state workers\u2019 compensation programs other than  limiting the ability of Energy or its contractors to contest certain claims;  Energy does not have authority to expand or contract the scope of any of  these state programs.

Furthermore, the system was developed before Energy  established its processing goals and did not collect sufficient information  to track Energy\u2019s progress in meeting these goals. While recent changes to  the system have improved Energy\u2019s ability to track certain information,  these changes have resulted in some recent status data being not  completely comparable with older status data. In addition, Energy will be  unable to completely track the timeliness of its processing for  approximately one-third of the cases that were being processed as of  December 2003 because key data are not complete. For example, Energy  established a goal of completing case development within 120 days of case  assignment to a case manager. At least 70 percent of the cases for which  case development was complete were missing dates corresponding to  either the beginning or the end of the case development process\u2014data  that would allow Energy officials to compute the time elapsed during case  development.", "Energy has not been sufficiently strategic in identifying and systematically  collecting certain data that are useful for program management. For  instance, Energy does not track the reasons why particular cases were  found ineligible in a format that can be easily analyzed. Systematic  tracking of the reasons for ineligibility would make it possible to quickly  identify cases affected by policy changes. For example, when a facility in  West Virginia was determined to be only a Department of Energy facility  and not also an atomic weapons employer, it was necessary for Energy to  identify which cases had been ruled ineligible because of employment at  the West Virginia facility. While some ineligibility information may be  stored in case narratives, this information is not available in a format that  would allow the agency to quickly identify cases declared ineligible for  similar reasons. Ascertaining the reason for ineligibility would at best  require review of individual case narratives, and indeed, Energy officials  report that it is sometimes necessary to refer back to application forms to  find the reasons. As a result, if additional changes are made that change  eligibility criteria, Energy may have to expend considerable time and  resources determining which cases are affected by the change in policy.", "In addition, because it did not adequately plan for the various uses of its  data, Energy lacks some of the data needed to analyze how cases will fare  when they enter the state workers\u2019 compensation systems. Specifically, it  is difficult for Energy to predict whether willing payers of workers\u2019  compensation benefits will exist using case management system data  because the information about the specific employer for whom the  claimant worked is not collected in a format that can be systematically  analyzed. In addition, basic demographic data such as the age of  employees is not necessarily accurate due to insufficient edit controls\u2014 for example, error checking that would prevent employees\u2019 dates of birth  from being entered if the date was in the future or recent past.

However, in an effort to  make the panel process more efficient, Energy published new rules on  March 24, 2004, that re-defined a physician panel as one or more  physicians appointed to evaluate these cases and changed the timeframes  for completing their review. Under the new rule, a panel composed of a  single physician will initially review each case, and if a positive  determination is issued, no further review is necessary. Negative  determinations made by a single physician panels will require review by  one or more additional single-physician panels.

While Energy has  made several requests that NIOSH appoint additional physicians to staff  the panels, such as requesting 500 physicians in June 2003, NIOSH officials  have indicated that the pool of physicians with the appropriate credentials  and experience is limited. The criteria NIOSH originally used to evaluate  qualifications for appointing physicians to these panels included: (1) board  certification in a primary discipline; (2) knowledge of occupational  medicine; (3) minimum of 5 years of relevant clinical practice following  residency; and (4) reputation for good medical judgment, impartiality, and  efficiency. NIOSH recently modified these qualifications, primarily to  reduce the amount of required clinical experience so that physicians with  experience in relevant clinical or public health practice or research,  academic, consulting, or private sector work can now qualify to serve on  the panels. NIOSH has revised its recruiting materials to reflect this  change and to point out that Energy is also interested in physicians willing  to serve on panels full-time. However, a NIOSH official said that he was  uncertain about the effect of the change in qualifications on the number of  available physicians. In addition, the official indicated that only a handful  of physicians would likely be interested in serving full-time on the panels.", "Energy officials have also explored additional sources from which NIOSH  might recruit qualified physicians, but they have expressed concerns that  the current statutory cap on the rate of pay for panel physicians may limit  the willingness of physicians from these sources to serve on the panels.  For example, Energy officials have suggested that physicians in the  military services might be used on a part-time basis, but the rate of pay for  their military work exceeds the current cap. Similarly, physicians from the  Public Health Service could serve on temporary full-time details as panel  physicians. To elevate the rate of pay for panel physicians to a level that is  consistent with the rate physicians from these sources normally receive,  Energy officials recently submitted to the Congress a legislative proposal  to eliminate the current cap on the rate of pay and also expand Energy\u2019s  hiring authority.", "Panel physicians have also suggested methods to Energy for improving the  efficiency of the panels. For example, some physicians have said that more  complete profiles of the types and locations of specific toxic substances at  each facility would speed their ability to decide cases.

Therefore, in some instances, these cases may be less likely to  receive compensation than a comparable case for which there is a willing  payer, unless the claimant is able to overcome challenges to the claim. In  addition, contested cases can take longer to be resolved. For example, one  claimant whose claim is being contested by an insurer was told by her  attorney that because of pretrial motions filed by the opposing attorney, it  would be 2 years before her case was heard on its merits. Specifically, the  cases that lack willing payers involve contractors that (1) have a  commercial insurance policy, (2) use a state fund to pay workers\u2019  compensation claims, or (3) do not have a current contract with Energy. In  each of these situations, Energy maintains that its orders to contractors  would have a limited effect. For instance, an Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019  Compensation official said that the state would not automatically approve  a case with a positive physician panel determination, but would evaluate  each workers\u2019 compensation case carefully to ensure that it was valid and  thereby protect its state fund. Furthermore, although the contractor in  Colorado with a commercial policy attempted to enter into agreements  with prior contractors and their insurers to not contest claims, the parties  have not yet agreed and several workers\u2019 compensation claims filed with  the state program are currently being contested.", "These estimates could change as better data become available or as  circumstances change, such as new contractors taking over at individual  facilities. For example, the contractor currently performing environmental  cleanup at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant will not re-compete for  this work when its contract ends on September 30, 2004. Energy is  soliciting proposals for a new contract to continue the cleanup work and  has indicated that the new contractors will not be required to take on the  responsibility for the workers\u2019 compensation claims filed by employees of  former contractors. While Energy has proposed that the current clean up  contractor continue to handle the claims of their employees and those of  prior contractors under another of its contracts with the agency, it is  unclear at this point whether the current contractor will be able to arrange  for continuing coverage of these claims without securing workers\u2019  compensation coverage through commercial insurance. Unless the current  contractor can continue to self-insure its workers\u2019 compensation coverage  for these claims, the Paducah cases shown in table 1 would have to be  moved to the category in which contests are likely. As a result of this  single change in contractors, the proportion of cases for which contests  are likely could increase from 20 to 33 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Factors Make Compensation Not Certain", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to Subtitle B provisions that provide for a uniform federal  benefit that is not affected by the degree of disability, various factors may  affect whether a Subtitle D claimant is paid under the state workers\u2019  compensation program or how much compensation will be paid.

On the  other hand, claimants with positive determinations but not a willing payer  may still qualify for compensation under the state program if they show a  loss and can overcome all challenges to the claim raised by the employer  or the insurer.", "Contractors\u2019 uncertainty about how to compute compensation may also  cause variation in whether or how much a claimant will receive in  compensation. While contractors with self-insurance told us that they plan  to comply with Energy\u2019s directives to not contest cases with positive  determinations, some contractors were unclear about how to actually  determine the amount of compensation that a claimant will receive. For  example, one contractor raised a concern that no guidance exists to  inform contractors about whether they can negotiate the degree of  disability, a factor that could affect the amount of the workers\u2019  compensation benefit. Other contractors will likely experience similar  situations, as Energy has not issued written guidance on how to  consistently compute compensation amounts.", "While not directly affecting compensation amounts, a related issue  involves how contractors will be reimbursed for claims they pay. Energy  uses several different types of contracts to carry out its mission, such as  operations or cleanup, and these different types of contracts affect how  workers\u2019 compensation claims will be paid. For example, a contractor  responsible for managing and operating an Energy facility was told to pay  the workers\u2019 compensation claims from its current operating budget. The  contractor said that this procedure may compromise its ability to conduct  its primary responsibilities. On the other hand, a contractor cleaning up an  Energy facility under a cost reimbursement contract was told by Energy  officials that its workers\u2019 compensation claims would be reimbursed and,  therefore, paying claims would not affect its ability to perform cleanup of  the site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Issues Could Be Considered in Evaluating Options for Improving the Likelihood of Willing Payers", "paragraphs": ["Various options are available to improve payment outcomes for the cases  that receive a positive determination from Energy, but lack willing payers  under the current program.

A key difference among the options is the type of benefit that  would be provided.", "Option 1\u2014State workers\u2019 compensation with federal back up. This  option would retain state workers\u2019 compensation structure as under the  current Subtitle D program but add a federal benefit for cases that receive  a positive physician panel determination but lack a willing payer of state  workers\u2019 compensation benefits. For example, claims involving employees  of current contractors that self-insure for workers\u2019 compensation coverage  would continue to be processed through the state programs. However,  claims without willing payers such as those involving contractors that use  commercial insurers or state funds likely to contest workers\u2019  compensation claims could be paid a federal benefit that approximates the  amount that would have been received under the relevant state program.", "Option 2\u2014Federal workers\u2019 compensation model. This option would  move the administration of the Subtitle D benefit from the state programs  entirely to the federal arena, but would retain the workers\u2019 compensation  concept for providing partial replacement of lost wages as well as medical  benefits. For example, claims with positive physician panel determinations  could be evaluated under the eligibility criteria of the Federal Employees  Compensation Act and, if found eligible, could be paid benefits consistent  with the criteria of that program.", "Option 3\u2014Expanded Subtitle B program that does not use a  workers\u2019 compensation model. Under this option, the current Subtitle B  program would be expanded to include the other illnesses resulting from  radiation and toxic exposures that are currently considered under the  Subtitle D program. The Subtitle D program would be eliminated as a  separate program and, if found eligible, claimants would receive a lump- sum payment and coverage of future medical expenses related to the  workers\u2019 illnesses, assuming they had not already received benefits under  Subtitle B. The Department of Labor would need to expand its regulations  to specify which illnesses would be covered and the criteria for  establishing eligibility for each of these illnesses. In addition, since the  current programs have differing standards for determining whether the  worker\u2019s illness was related to his employment, it would have to be  decided which standard would be used for the new category of illnesses.", "Option 4\u2014New federal program that uses a different type of  benefit structure. This option would address the willing payer issue as  part of developing a new program that involves moving away from the  workers\u2019 compensation and Subtitle B structures and establishing a new  federal benefit administered by a structure that conforms to the type of the  benefit and its eligibility criteria. This option would provide an opportunity  to consider anew the purpose of the Subtitle D provisions. As a starting  point, policymakers could consider different existing models such as the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, designed to provide partial  restitution to individuals whose health was put at risk because of their  exposure even when their illnesses do not result in ongoing disability.

We have constructed  the sequence of issues in this framework in terms of the purpose and type  of benefit as being the focal point for the evaluation, with consideration of  the other issues flowing from that first decision. For example, decisions  about eligibility criteria would need to consider issues relating to within- state and across-state equity for Subtitle D claimants. The framework  would also provide for decisions on issues such as the method of federal  funding\u2014trust fund or increased appropriations\u2014and the appropriate  federal agency to administer the benefit.

For example, the Radiation  Exposure Compensation Act was designed to provide partial restitution to  individuals whose health was put at risk because of their exposure. Similar  to Subtitle B, the act created a federal trust fund, which provides for  payments to individuals who can establish that they have certain diseases  and that they were exposed to radiation at certain locations and at  specified times.

With  respect to across-state equity, the current program and the option to  provide a federal back up to the state workers\u2019 compensation programs  would not achieve equity for Subtitle D claimants in different states.

Specifically, federal costs would increase for  the option to provide a federal back up to the state workers\u2019 compensation  program because it would ensure payment at rates similar to the state  programs for the significant minority of claimants whose claims are likely  to be contested and possibly denied under the state programs. Further, the  federal costs of adopting a federal workers\u2019 compensation option would  be higher than under the first option because all claimants\u2014those who  would have been paid under the state programs as well as those whose  claims would have been contested under the state programs\u2014would be  eligible for a federal benefit similar to the benefit for federal employees.

However, the degree of this effect is difficult to determine because many  of the claimants who have filed under both programs may be denied  Subtitle B benefits. The key distinction would be whether workers who  sustained certain types of illnesses based on their Energy employment  should be compensated under both programs as opposed to recourse  under only one or the other. If they were able to seek compensation from  only one program, the claimant\u2019s ability to elect one or the other based on  individual needs should be considered.", "The effects on federal cost of an expanded Subtitle B option or a new  federal program option are more difficult to assess. In many cases, the  Subtitle B benefit of up to $150,000 could exceed the cost of the lifetime  benefit for some claimants under either of the workers\u2019 compensation  options, resulting in higher federal costs. However, the extent of these  higher costs could be mitigated by the fact that many of the claimants who  would have filed for both benefits in the current system would be eligible  for only one cash benefit regardless of the number or type of illnesses.

We  determined that some cases (less than 2 percent) that had been in the first  extract were missing from the second file. We consulted with Energy  contractors and determined that one case had been accidentally omitted  from the query results and that the remaining cases had been dropped  from CMS because they were duplicate cases or had been determined to  be non-Subtitle D cases.
