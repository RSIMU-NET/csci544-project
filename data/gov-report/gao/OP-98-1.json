This situation, we noted, was due principally to the failure of Bosnia\u2019s political leaders to fulfill their obligations under the Dayton Agreement and to promote political and social reconciliation. This report was a seminal assessment of the Bosnia issue and was instrumental in influencing the administration\u2019s decision to revise its Bosnia strategy. Our assessments of U.S. programs and those of other NATO member countries showed that they are helping former Eastern Bloc countries prepare for possible membership in the NATO. In a separate study that examined the likely cost of NATO enlargement, we concluded that DOD\u2019s estimated cost of about $27-35 billion was speculative and that the actual enlargement costs could be substantially higher or lower. This work led to a request for GAO to testify at an October 1997 hearing as additional congressional concerns were raised about the impact of NATO expansion on DOD\u2019s budget.

Acting on a recommendation we made in our 1995 report on DOD\u2019s Cooperative Threat Reduction program, DOD improved its reporting on program management and assistance. Our evaluation of whether U.S. export control policy toward Hong Kong will adequately protect U.S. national security interests after Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to China revealed Hong Kong will continue to have easier access to sensitive technology that is more tightly controlled for China.

For example, the Navy could save about $140 million annually by turning over the operation of eight multiproduct (oil, ammunition) ships to the Military Sealift Command for crewing with civil service mariners. These savings are due primarily to a much smaller crew size than has been traditional on military crewed auxiliary ships.

However, our analysis showed that DOD has not been successful enough in reducing and streamlining infrastructure. Our analysis of DOD\u2019s 1998 budget and Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) show substantial risks that the current defense program will not be executed as planned. For example, the 1998 FYDP projects billions of dollars in savings due to management initiatives, but DOD does not have details on how all of the savings will be achieved. Further, DOD projects no real growth in the costs of the Defense Health Program during 1998-2003. This appears to be unrealistic, given that operation and maintenance (O&M) funding of DOD\u2019s health program increased 73 percent in real terms during 1985-96. After we informed Congress that DOD\u2019s future health program costs were likely to exceed their estimate, DOD submitted a budget amendment to redress its understated funding request for the program. Another reason we believe the 1998 FYDP poses risks is that the estimates for procurement spending, in relation to DOD\u2019s operation and maintenance projections, run counter to DOD\u2019s own experience over the last 30 years.

Since EPA\u2019s inception more than 25 years ago, the nation has seen and come to expect continued improvements in the quality of its air, water, and other resources. These improvements, moreover, have come with increasingly higher compliance costs. Further increases are expected. Real spending for environmental compliance grew 7.3 percent in 1994\u2014according to the government\u2019s latest available estimates. This growth rate represents the largest single-year increase in a decade. (Prior year increases were about 3 percent.) In 1994 the nation spent $122 billion in current 1996 dollars on environmental protection\u2014or 3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. Thus, EPA\u2019s almost $7 billion budget has a significant impact on the nation\u2019s economy.", "Rising costs, demands for more environmental protection, and efforts to reduce government spending highlight the need for innovative approaches and demonstrated results. In the past, the nation has taken a strict \u201ccommand and control\u201d approach toward environmental protection. Under this approach, EPA has set specific limitations on pollutant discharges and prescribed, in detail, how these limits are to be met. While this strategy may have served its purpose in the past, a consensus among industry, regulators, and even some in the environmental community is growing that this approach will not effectively control future sources of pollution. This prescriptive approach has also strained relationships between EPA and the states. Both the Congress and EPA seem poised to allow states, localities, and business more flexibility to carry out their environmental responsibilities without extensive direction or oversight from EPA.", "Our work has been in the forefront, highlighting our nation\u2019s recurring environmental problems and recommending ways in which the Congress and EPA can effectively address those concerns.

Furthermore, cleaning up these sites\u2014many of which are owned by the federal government\u2014has proved to be far more complicated and costly than anticipated. Recent estimates show that cleaning up these sites could amount to over $300 billion in federal costs and many billions more in private expenditures.", "Under the Superfund law, EPA can compel the private parties responsible for abandoned or inactive hazardous waste sites to clean them up, or it can conduct the cleanup and demand reimbursement of its costs from the responsible parties. Currently, EPA has negotiated with private parties to do over 70 percent of the cleanups. To pay for EPA\u2019s cleanups, the agency draws on a legislatively established trust fund that is primarily financed by a tax on crude oil and certain chemicals and by an environmental tax on corporations. (In December 1995, the authority to collect these taxes expired and taxes are no longer being collected. However, because the trust fund still has an unappropriated balance, it has continued to be used to finance the Superfund program.) Federal agencies generally use their annual appropriations to finance cleanups of the facilities under their jurisdiction.", "In 1990, GAO identified Superfund as one of its high-risk programs because of certain long-standing management problems. First, EPA and other federal agencies have not consistently allocated their cleanup resources to reduce the most significant threats to human health and the environment. Second, although EPA is responsible for pursuing reimbursement when it funds a cleanup, the agency has recovered from responsible parties only a fraction of the moneys that it has spent.

For instance, EPA has begun using a risk-based process to set priorities and allocate some of its cleanup funds. Other federal agencies have made uneven progress in (1) taking the first step toward setting priorities\u2014that is, developing a complete inventory of the waste sites that need cleanup\u2014and (2) implementing systems to rank sites for cleanup according to risk.", "EPA has also made some improvements in its cost recovery program, although it still recovers only a small percentage of its costs when it does the cleanup work. While some costs are not expected to be recovered, EPA\u2019s historically low recovery rate in part results from the agency\u2019s slow pace in revising its policy that limits the recovery of indirect program costs. EPA estimates that the value of these excluded costs has grown to $3.8 billion through fiscal year 1995\u2014up from a value of $1.1 billion 3 years earlier.", "Finally, while EPA has focused attention on strengthening its management of Superfund contracts, past problems still persist: (1) EPA\u2019s regions are still too dependent upon the contractors\u2019 own cost proposals to establish the price of cost-reimbursable work, (2) EPA continues to pay its cleanup contractors a high percentage of total contract costs to cover administrative expenses rather than ensuring that the maximum amount of available moneys is going toward the actual cleanup work, and (3) little progress has been made in improving the timeliness of audits to verify the accuracy of billions of dollars in Superfund contract charges.", "Thus, despite improvements, further actions are needed to safeguard the government\u2019s investment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Open Recommendations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Air Quality", "paragraphs": ["The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required EPA to issue a series of regulations\u2014many with ambitious milestones\u2014to address some of the more serious air pollution problems facing the nation.

However, very few recipients have left the federal disability rolls by returning to work. In February 1996, we reported that SSA has done a poor job implementing and managing the PASS program. We found that, among other things, the impact of PASS on employment is unknown because SSA lacks basic data on PASS participation and outcomes and recommended that SSA gather additional management data on PASS program participation and impact and use these data to evaluate the impact of PASS program participation on employment. SSA has experienced many technical problems establishing such a database, and SSA does not consider the data to be reliable. SSA officials, however, are continuing efforts to develop a data base that would provide needed data for managing the PASS program. In addition, we recommended that the Congress consider legislation to eliminate DI beneficiary eligibility for SSI benefits through the use of PASS. While SSA has proposed such legislation, the Administration has not submitted it. (GAO/HEHS-96-51)", "In April 1996, we reported that weaknesses in the design and implementation of DI and SSI program components have limited SSA\u2019s capacity to identify and assist in expanding beneficiaries\u2019 productive capacities. We noted that eligibility requirements and the application process encourage people to focus on their inabilities, not their abilities; work incentives offered by the programs do not overcome the risk of returning to work for many beneficiaries, and the complexities of work incentives can make them difficult to understand and challenging to implement; and beneficiaries receive little encouragement to use rehabilitation services, which are relatively inaccessible to beneficiaries seeking them. We recommended that SSA take immediate action to place greater priority on return to work, including (1) designing more effective means to more accurately identify and expand beneficiaries\u2019 work capacities and (2) better implementing existing return-to-work mechanisms. Similarly, in July 1996, we reported return-to-work strategies and practices employed by the private sector in the U.S and by social insurance programs in Germany and Sweden may hold the potential for improving federal disability programs by helping people with disabilities return to productive activity in the workplace and at the same time reduce program costs. We recommended that, in line with placing greater emphasis on return to work, SSA should develop a comprehensive return-to-work strategy that integrates, as appropriate, earlier intervention, earlier identification and provision of necessary return-to-work assistance for applicants and beneficiaries, and changes in the structure of cash and medical benefits. In both reports, we also recommended that SSA identify legislation needed to implement the recommended program changes. SSA noted that it is currently placing a high priority on return to work, citing its expansion of the pool of vocational rehabilitation providers and its proposed \u201ctickets to independence\u201d (vouchers for vocational rehabilitation) as a new demonstration to attempt to improve return-to-work outcomes. In addition, SSA has affirmed its interest in determining whether return-to-work practices of other systems could help improve the return-to-work rate in its disability programs. While such steps are in the right direction, they do not constitute the fundamental redirection of goals and practices needed to move the disability programs to much greater emphasis on return to work. Finally, SSA emphasized that efforts to improve the return-to-work rate in its disability programs can be fruitful only if all parties affecting federal disability policy are involved. While we agree that all relevant parties must be involved, we believe that, as the primary manager of the disability programs and the entity with fiduciary responsibility for the trust funds, SSA must take the lead in forging the partnerships and cooperation needed to redesign federal disability programs.

While SSA initiated action to obtain better information on SSI recipients currently in jail, they had not attempted to develop information on SSI recipients who may have been incarcerated and received payments in prior years. We recommended that SSA obtain information on former prisoners from county and local facilities and identify and attempt to recover any erroneous payments. SSA has initiated a pilot project to determine the feasibility and cost benefit of implementing our recommendations.

We estimated that direct on-line access to state computerized income information could have prevented or more quickly detected about $131.3 million in overpayments caused by unreported or underreported income nationwide in one 12-month period. However, in SSA field offices where such direct access to computerized state information has been implemented, its staff did not use it for overpayment detection. They did use it, however, to process claims more efficiently, and SSA\u2019s preliminary results have shown that its use has reduced the administrative costs of the program. We recommended that SSA require claims representatives to use online access to routinely check for unreported sources of income when initial and subsequent assessments of eligibility are done, provided it is cost-effective to do so and that the data available online pertain to the time periods covered by SSI payments. Further, we recommended that SSA develop automatic interfaces with state databases that comply with laws and standards governing computer matching, privacy, and security that can (1) more fully automate the earnings and Unemployment Insurance computer matches and (2) identify additional income sources that do not currently have computer matches. SSA has requested a study of the cost-effectiveness of these recommendations.

In its comments on our report, HHS noted HCFA\u2019s willingness to provide the data it receives from states to SSA on a quarterly rather than annual basis. However, we believe that having HCFA involved in the pass-through of information causes unnecessary expenditures for HCFA and delays for SSA. SSA needs to obtain nursing home admissions data as quickly as possible after the actual admissions to minimize the overpayments it makes. We further recommended that SSA (1) electronically obtain nursing home admissions data directly from states, (2) obtain computer tapes or paper listings of nursing home admissions to identify overpayment situations, while states adapt their systems to provide the information electronically, and (3) determine the reliability of state data for implementing an automated computer interface to automatically adjust the benefits of SSI recipients admitted to nursing homes.

IRS is responsible for ensuring that taxpayers take no more credits than allowed and that the states allocate no more credit than they are authorized to allocate. We recommended that IRS (1) establish clear requirements to ensure independent verification on sources and uses of funds submitted to states by developers that form the basis of decisions about the value of tax credits granted for low-income housing projects; (2) require that states report sufficient information about monitoring inspections or reviews, including the number and types of inspections made so that IRS can determine whether states have complied with their monitoring plans; (3) require that states\u2019 monitoring plans include specific steps that will provide information to permit IRS to more effectively ensure that the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s habitability requirements are met; and (4) explore alternative ways to obtain better information to verify that states\u2019 allocations do not exceed tax credit authorizations and to evaluate taxpayers\u2019 and housing projects\u2019 compliance with the requirements of the Code.

Much of this noncompliance is attributable to sole proprietors who operate as independent contractors, e.g., self-employed individuals who provide services to others. Given the persistently high levels of noncompliance over the years, we have recommended that IRS adopt a more comprehensive and coordinated compliance program. We also recommended that Congress consider compliance-enhancing legislation, for example, extending withholding and information reporting requirements to cover independent contractors. Since January 1995, at least four legislative proposals for clarifying the rules have been submitted. We had testified annually from 1992 to 1996.

Although audits of these large corporations consume about 20 percent of IRS\u2019 examination resources, IRS collects only about $1 of every $5 of recommended tax assessments. We recommended that IRS take a number of steps to help ensure that it meets its mission of collecting the proper amount of tax at the least cost. They are that IRS (1) provide more authority over budget and staffing allocations in the field to the National Office executive who manages this audit program, (2) improve controls to ensure that the auditors receive the information that the corporations submitted to IRS\u2019 appeals function, and (3) analyze recurring tax disputes and propose legislative changes for minimizing such recurrence.

Between 1988 and 1994, IRS had been investing additional time in doing these audits but recommending fewer additional taxes per hour invested. IRS had been collecting about $1 of every $4 in additional taxes recommended during the audit. These results raised issues about the productivity of such audits. Our recommendations strove to improve that productivity. For example, we recommended that IRS (1) develop more specific criteria to guide the selection of tax returns and tax issues on those returns with high audit potential, (2) encourage the management of the field auditors and lawyers to work together on finding cost-effective ways for auditors to get the necessary legal assistance, and (3) provide feedback to auditors on how IRS\u2019 appeals function settled tax disputes with the large corporations so that the auditors could prepare better support for tax issues that could be sustained if appealed.

Such an advance payment of the tax credit presents a potential compliance problem because the credit is paid before IRS can ensure that the wage earners are eligible. Ensuring compliance becomes more problematic if the affected wage earners do not report the advance payment on their tax returns or do not file tax returns. We recommended that IRS (1) send to individuals who do not file tax returns a notice explaining their requirement to file; and (2) explore ways to identify those individuals who claim the credit in advance but do not report it, so as to prevent them from receiving the credit a second time.
