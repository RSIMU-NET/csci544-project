This report examines, among other things, selected VAMCs' (1) reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns are raised and VHA's oversight of these reviews, and (2) VAMCs' reporting of providers to the NPDB and SLBs and VHA's oversight of reporting. GAO visited a non-generalizable selection of five VAMCs selected for the complexity of services offered and variation in location. GAO reviewed VHA policies and files from the five selected VAMCs, and interviewed VHA, VISN, and VAMC officials. GAO also evaluated VHA's practices using federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers\u2014physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services\u2014after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges.", "GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that", "selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and", "none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs.", "GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including for VA to direct VHA to require VAMCs to document reviews of providers' clinical care after concerns are raised, develop timeliness requirements for these reviews, and ensure proper VISN oversight of such reviews as well as timely VAMC reporting of providers to the NPDB and SLBs. VA concurred with GAO's recommendations and described steps it will take to implement them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) operates one of the largest health care systems in the nation, and  nearly 40,000 providers hold privileges at its 170 VA medical centers  (VAMC). As in all health care delivery settings, VAMCs are responsible  for ensuring that their providers deliver safe care to patients. If a concern  about a provider\u2019s clinical care arises at any point, it is the VAMC\u2019s  responsibility to review the provider\u2019s clinical care. Depending on the  nature of the concern and the findings from their review, VAMC  leadership officials may take adverse privileging actions against providers  that either limit the care they are allowed to deliver at the facility or  prevent the providers from delivering care altogether. VAMC officials are  also required to report the providers they take adverse privileging actions  against to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB), which is used by  other VAMCs, non-VA hospitals, and other health care entities to obtain  information on providers with a history of substandard care and  misconduct. VAMC officials are also required to report providers to state licensing boards (SLB) when there are serious concerns about a  provider\u2019s clinical practice. The SLB can then investigate and determine if  the provider\u2019s license to practice medicine should be suspended,  restricted, or revoked.", "Congress and VA have taken recent steps to make the adverse  privileging action process more efficient and more transparent. For  example, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 shortens the appeals process  timeframe when a VAMC proposes taking an adverse privileging action.  While these actions may shorten the time period for reviewing and  rendering a decision on taking an adverse privileging action, questions  remain about the extent to which VAMC leadership officials review  providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns are raised and, when appropriate,  take adverse privileging actions against these providers and report them  to the NPDB or SLBs. For example, there have been recent whistleblower  complaints from VAMC providers to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel  alleging that VAMC leadership officials have not adequately reviewed and  addressed issues regarding providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns have  been raised. According to the whistleblowers, specific providers have  delivered care in a manner that is unsafe and inconsistent with industry  standards of care, such as performing unnecessary procedures on  veterans, without adequate reviews and actions taken by VAMC  leadership.", "Questions have also been raised about the extent to which VHA gives  performance pay\u2014a component of VA provider compensation\u2014to  providers who have had an adverse privileging action taken against them.  Performance pay is an annual lump sum payment given to providers  based on the extent to which the provider achieves specific goals in a  given fiscal year. In July 2013, we reported that providers who were the  subject of adverse actions, including adverse privileging actions, received  performance pay for the same year the actions were taken.", "You asked us to review the processes VHA has in place to review  providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns arise and the extent to which  providers receive performance pay when concerns are confirmed.

In addition, we identified providers whose clinical care required  a review after concerns were raised at a non-generalizable selection of  five VAMCs from October 2013 through the time we completed our site  visits in March 2017. For these selected providers, we reviewed VAMC  documentation of their reviews. We selected the five VAMCs based on  the complexity of services offered and their geographic distribution. We  identified providers at each VAMC by reviewing documentation of each  VAMC\u2019s credentialing committee meetings from fiscal year 2014 through  fiscal year 2016. During our visits, we interviewed VAMC officials, including chiefs of staff, clinical supervisors known as service chiefs, and  other officials involved in these reviews. We asked the officials to clarify  information about the documentation we received and confirm the  completeness of the list of providers we identified. Based on the  documentation and interviews, we determined the type of reviews the  selected VAMCs conducted and the extent to which the VAMCs took  adverse privileging actions against any of the identified providers. We  assessed the extent to which the selected VAMCs adhered to VHA policy  requirements for clinical care reviews and we compared these VHA  policies and the selected VAMCs\u2019 reviews to federal internal control  standards related to monitoring and documentation. To review VHA\u2019s  oversight of VAMCs\u2019 clinical care reviews and adverse privileging actions,  we reviewed VHA policy for oversight responsibilities and requirements.  We also interviewed relevant VHA officials, as well as officials in VA\u2019s  Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) responsible for each of the  five selected VAMCs, about their oversight activities. We also compared  VHA\u2019s policy and the selected VISNs\u2019 oversight activities with federal  internal control standards related to monitoring.", "To examine VAMCs\u2019 reporting of providers to the NPDB and SLBs, we  reviewed VHA\u2019s related policies and evaluated the extent to which the  selected VAMCs adhered to these policies.

Our review of NPDB reporting is limited to NPDB adverse action reports,  which are reports of the adverse privileging actions VAMCs took against  providers and any providers who resigned or retired while under  investigation for a clinical care concern. Our review does not include VHA  reporting of providers for paid medical malpractice settlements or  judgements (tort claims). We reviewed VAMC documentation related to  its reporting of specific providers and interviewed VAMC officials,  including both clinical and administrative officials involved in these  reporting processes. To examine VHA\u2019s oversight of VAMC reporting, we  reviewed VHA policies for overseeing NPDB and SLB reporting and  interviewed relevant VHA officials as well as officials in the VISNs  responsible for each of the five selected VAMCs about VISN oversight  activities.

VHA requires VAMCs to conduct and  document ongoing monitoring of each provider\u2019s performance at least  twice a year through an ongoing professional practice evaluation.  During this evaluation, a provider\u2019s performance is evaluated against  benchmarks established by VAMC leadership that define acceptable  performance, such as documenting patient visits appropriately and  achieving specific patient outcomes.", "Peer review triggers. VHA has a separate process, called peer  review, that VAMCs may use to review adverse events. While  information collected as part of peer review is protected for quality  improvement purposes and may not be used to take action against a  provider, VAMCs can identify concerns about a provider\u2019s clinical care  based on a trend of certain peer review outcomes over a specified  period of time, referred to as triggers.

VHA officials told us that they expected VAMCs to document  these types of reviews so that the information could be used to  support adverse privileging actions, if necessary. Without clearly  stated documentation requirements in VHA policy, VAMC officials  inconsistently document their results, preventing VAMC directors and  VISNs from properly evaluating the effectiveness of its retrospective  and comprehensive reviews, which are used to, among other things,  ensure patient safety.

Allowing more time to elapse before a clinical  care review is initiated weakens the intended purpose behind clinical care  reviews and further increases risk to patient safety. Federal internal  control standards for monitoring state that management should evaluate  issues and remediate identified deficiencies in a timely manner. A  clinical care concern could represent a potential deficiency in providing  medical care, and as a result, VHA increases its risk further without  establishing a policy that sets timeframes for conducting clinical care  reviews.", "VHA oversight is inadequate.

Under VHA policy, VISNs  are responsible for overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes  at their respective VAMCs. While reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after  concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and privileging, we  found that the VISNs with responsibility for overseeing the selected  VAMCs through routine audits do not include these reviews in their  audits. While the standardized tool VHA requires the VISNs to use for  these audits instructs the VISNs to identify and review providers who  were on an FPPE for cause, none of the VISN officials we spoke with  described any routine oversight of FPPEs or any other reviews of  identified clinical care concerns. This may be in part because some  VISN officials are not using VHA\u2019s standardized audit tool as required.  Officials from one VISN said they had developed their own audit tool and  officials from another VISN said that they were not conducting the audits  due to multiple instances of turnover in a key position at the VISN.  Further, VHA\u2019s standardized audit tool does not direct the VISN to  oversee any other types of reviews of clinical care concerns, such as  retrospective or comprehensive reviews. The tool also does not require  VISN officials to look at documentation of the FPPEs for cause; instead, it  calls for reviewing credentialing committee meeting minutes. Without  reviewing documentation, VISN officials would be unable to identify the  incomplete documentation that we identified in our review. Both VHA and  VISN officials described instances of assisting VAMC officials with  reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns had been raised, but  VHA and VISN officials told us that their involvement in these reviews is  typically consultative and not routine. (For example, the VISN may assist  by identifying providers outside of the VAMC to conduct the review.) As a  result, VHA and the VISNs are not conducting routine oversight to ensure  that VAMC reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns are raised  are conducted appropriately, including adequately ensuring that the  reviews are completed and documented in a timely manner, in  accordance with VHA policy.", "The lack of routine VHA oversight, through the VISNs, of VAMC reviews  of providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns are raised is inconsistent with  federal internal control standards for monitoring, which state that  management should establish and operate monitoring activities.

The provider demonstrated improvement after the  suspension.", "SLB reporting not always timely. While two of the selected VAMCs had  each reported a provider, we found that in these cases the SLB reporting  process took significantly longer than the 100 day timeframe suggested in  VHA policy. Specifically, it took over 500 days for each of the two  completed reports to pass initial and comprehensive review at the VAMC,  receive concurrence from the VISN, and be submitted to the SLB. For  example, one of the two providers self-reported to the SLB the concerning  episode of care at the VAMC. However, before the VAMC submitted its  SLB report 328 days later, the SLB had completed its investigation of the  provider\u2019s self-report and put in place an agreement that placed  restrictions and requirements on the provider\u2019s medical license.  Subsequently, the provider successfully met the requirements of the  agreement and had all restrictions on the license removed. Officials at  two VAMCs told us the SLB reporting is more tedious or cumbersome  than the NPDB reporting process, making it difficult to complete in a  timely manner. One VAMC official commented that while completing the  process in less than a year seems reasonable, the typical timeframe for  submitting a SLB report is at least 2 years.", "At the five selected VAMCs, we found that providers were not reported to  the NPDB and relevant SLBs as required because officials were generally  not familiar with or misinterpreted related VHA policies. VHA officials  commented that adverse privileging actions and clinical care concerns  rising to the level of reporting are infrequent, with officials at two VISNs  estimating that only a few occur across the facilities within their network  each year. Staff at three VAMCs commented that there has been turnover  in positions that have been delegated tasks related to reporting and one  VAMC official told us that turnover in these positions is a barrier to timely  reporting. For example, at one facility, we found that officials failed to report six providers to  the NPDB because the officials were unaware that they had been  delegated responsibility for NPDB reporting.", "Officials at two of the selected VAMCs told us that VHA cannot report  contract providers to the NPDB. This assertion is inconsistent with  VHA policy.", "Officials at two of the selected VAMCs were waiting to start the SLB  reporting process for providers until after all appeals had been  exhausted. This approach is inconsistent with VHA policy, which  states that the process should start within 7 days of when the  reporting standard is met. For example, for one provider who was  reported, VAMC officials unnecessarily waited 7 months for the  completion of the appeals process before they resumed the reporting  process, which ultimately took 547 days.", "Officials at one VAMC did not report a provider to the NPDB or SLB  following an adverse privileging action because the SLB had found  out about the issue independently. This is inconsistent with VHA  policy for NPDB and SLB reporting, and the SLBs in other states  where the provider held a license were not alerted of concerns about  the provider\u2019s clinical practice.", "VHA oversight is inadequate. We also found that VHA and the VISNs  do not adequately oversee NPDB and SLB reporting and they cannot  ensure that VAMCs are reporting providers when required to do so by  VHA policy. While the VISNs are responsible for overseeing the  credentialing and privileging at their respective VAMCs under VHA policy,  VHA policy does not require the VISNs to oversee whether VAMCs are  reporting providers to the NPDB or SLB when warranted. As a result,  VISN officials were unaware of situations in which VAMC directors failed  to report providers to the NPDB, as evidenced by our review. In the case  of reporting processes for SLBs, VISN officials told us that they review the  evidence files to ensure, among other things, that the files are in  compliance with privacy laws. However, officials told us that the VISNs do  not oversee the reporting process to ensure that VAMC directors are  reporting all providers to the SLB who should be reported. Additionally,  VHA officials told us that they are not aware of the number of cases that  have been initiated for SLB reporting.", "Further, by failing to report providers as required, VHA facilitates  providers who provide substandard care obtaining privileges at another  VAMC or a hospital outside of VA\u2019s health care system without an  indication on their record that an adverse privileging action was taken  against them or that they resigned or retired while under investigation. For  example, we found that  two of the four contract providers whose privileges were revoked and  were not reported to the NPDB or SLBs by one VAMC continue to be  able to provide care to veterans outside of that VAMC. Specifically,  one provider whose services were terminated related to patient abuse  subsequently held privileges at another VAMC, while the other  provider belongs to a network of providers that provides care for  veterans in the community.", "Seven of the 12 providers who were not reported to the NPDB or  SLBs after their privileges were revoked\u2014through adverse privileging  actions or the termination of services on a contract\u2014or who resigned  or retired while under investigation have current Medicare enrollment  records, indicating that they are likely practicing outside of VA and  may still be receiving federal dollars by billing for services provided to  Medicare beneficiaries.", "We also identified one case where a VAMC director did not report a  provider to the NPDB or SLB after an agreement was reached that the  provider would resign, though the VAMC credentialing committee  recommended the provider\u2019s privileges be revoked. We found that the  provider\u2019s privileges were also revoked from a non-VA hospital in the  same city for the same reason 2 years later. The director\u2019s decision  not to report the provider as required left patients in that community  vulnerable to adverse outcomes because problems with the provider\u2019s  performance were not disclosed. There was no documentation of the  reasons why the VAMC director did not report the provider to the  NPDB or SLBs.", "This lack of routine oversight from VHA through the VISNs of VAMCs\u2019  reporting of providers to the NPDB and SLBs is inconsistent with federal  internal control standards for monitoring. The standards state that  management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor  the internal control system and appropriately remediate deficiencies on a  timely basis. Without routine monitoring of the reporting process, VHA  lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to  the NPDB and SLBs are reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "At Selected VAMCs, Providers with Adverse Privileging Actions Were Ineligible for Performance Pay the Year the Actions Were Taken", "paragraphs": ["None of the five providers who had an adverse privileging action taken  against them in the period we reviewed received performance pay for the  fiscal year the action was taken because they were ineligible, per VA  policy. This is because VA policy requires providers to be employed  through the end of the fiscal year to be eligible for performance pay, and  none of the five providers we reviewed were still employed by the VAMCs  at the end of the fiscal year in which the actions were taken.", "All five of the adverse privileging actions resulted from concerns about the  providers\u2019 clinical care in previous fiscal years. Among the five providers,  two providers received performance pay in the fiscal year before their  privileges were revoked, and three providers did not. For example, one  provider\u2019s privileges were revoked in 2015 due to concerns raised in 2014  regarding the provider\u2019s failure to complete necessary documentation of  patient care in a timely manner. This provider did not receive credit for the  performance pay goal directly related to timely completion of  documentation, and ultimately the provider received half of the maximum  amount of performance pay for fiscal year 2014. In the case of another  provider who did not receive any performance pay for the fiscal year  before the adverse privileging action was taken, VAMC officials noted that  the provider had been removed from practice for a portion of the fiscal  year while they were reviewing the clinical care concern and thus was  unable to meet performance pay goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VHA is responsible for ensuring that providers at its VAMCs deliver safe  care to veterans and that concerns that may arise about providers\u2019 clinical  care are reviewed and addressed at VHA\u2019s 170 VAMCs. However, our  work shows that at our five selected VAMCs, reviews of concerns about  providers\u2019 clinical care were not always documented or conducted in a  timely manner and VAMCs had not reported the majority of providers they  should have reported to the NPDB or SLBs. This is concerning for several  reasons. First, without documentation of the reviews of these concerns  about providers\u2019 clinical care, VAMC leadership officials may not have the  information they need to make decisions about whether a provider\u2019s  privileges at the VAMC are appropriate. Second, if VAMCs do not  document that they have reviewed provider\u2019s clinical care after concerns  have been raised, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that the VAMCs are  adequately addressing such concerns or that VAMCs are limiting or  revoking providers\u2019 privileges when necessary. Third, if these reviews are  not conducted in a timely manner and providers continue to deliver  potentially substandard care, VHA may be increasing the risk that  veterans will receive unsafe care at VAMCs. Finally, VAMCs\u2019 failure to  report providers to the NPDB and SLBs, as required under VHA policy,  makes it possible for providers to obtain privileges at other VAMCs or  non-VA health care entities without disclosing the problems with their past  performance. In effect, this can help shield the providers from  professional accountability outside of VA\u2019s health care system.", "Further, VHA\u2019s inadequate oversight of these processes calls into  question the extent to which VAMCs are held accountable for ensuring  that veterans receive safe, high quality care. As our review shows, the  VISNs responsible for overseeing the five selected VAMCs do not  routinely oversee VAMC reviews of providers\u2019 clinical care after concerns  are raised to ensure that these reviews are completed in accordance with  VHA policies; nor do the VISNs oversee the VAMCs to ensure that all  providers that should be reported are reported to the NPDB and SLBs.
