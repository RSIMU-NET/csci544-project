One-third of all USAID obligations were provided through public international organizations (PIOs), which under USAID guidance are composed principally of countries or other organizations designated by USAID; 94 percent of PIO obligations were provided to the World Bank for democracy assistance projects in Afghanistan. The remaining two-thirds of USAID obligations were provided through contracts, grants (excluding PIOs), and cooperative agreements. Of the 10 State bureaus providing democracy assistance, 3 were unable to provide reliable funding data for fiscal years 2012\u20132016.

However, USAID provided both complete and timely documentation of the award-type decision for 5 of the 41 awards GAO sampled. For the remaining 36 awards, the documentation was either incomplete, not timely or timeliness was indeterminate, or both (see table). While USAID has taken steps to improve documentation for award-type decisions by updating its guidance and templates, it has not assessed whether these updates have resulted in complete and timely documentation.

One source of  USAID\u2019s authority to limit competition for contracts is the Competition in  Contracting Act of 1984, as implemented in the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), which outlines policies and procedures for acquisition  by all federal agencies, including policies and procedures pertaining to  exemptions from competition. In addition, for contracts awarded under  USAID programs, the FAR, among other regulations and legislation,  contains specific provisions on exemptions from competition. For grants  and cooperative agreements, USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System  Chapter 303 outlines circumstances under which competition can be  limited.", "In accordance with applicable policies, procedures, and guidance, USAID  can use some exemptions from competition only for contracts and others  only for grants and cooperative agreements. For example, USAID can  limit competition for contracts for the sake of public interest or when  circumstances are such that competition would compromise U.S. national  security; however, according to USAID officials, they rarely have cause to  use these grounds for limiting competition. USAID guidance outlines  some unique exemptions to competition for grants and cooperative  agreements. For example, USAID can exempt follow-on awards, which  are the same or substantively similar to recently completed awards, if the  awardee will be the same, or can exempt awards from competition in  certain instances when USAID has received an unsolicited application.", "For the awards in our sample, USAID limited competition for only 3 of the  13 contracts, based on USAID data. However, for one of these contracts,  USAID officials indicated that they erroneously cited FAR 13.106-1(b),  which permits sole source awards for acquisitions not exceeding the  simplified acquisition threshold if only one source is reasonably available,  when they should have cited FAR 13.501(a)(2)(i), which permits sole  source acquisitions of commercial items (including brand-name items) for  acquisitions greater than $150,000. For the exemptions from competition  that USAID used for these awards, see table 15.", "USAID exempted from full competition all five of the grants and 15 of the  23 cooperative agreements in our sample. Table 16 outlines exemptions  from competition that USAID may use for grants and cooperative  agreements in our sample."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Program Objectives of Selected USAID Democracy Assistance Awards by Contract Type", "paragraphs": ["For the contracts in our sample, we found that program objectives varied  by type of contract.

Nearly all of the cost- plus-fixed-fee contracts sought to achieve improvements in the public  sector of the country of performance through activities such as supporting  developments in public policy or strengthening national institutions.
