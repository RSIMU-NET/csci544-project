In addition, limited quantities of two developmental vehicles--the Mobile Gun System and the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance vehicle prototypes--have also been ordered for testing. Stryker program costs have increased about 22 percent from the November 2000 estimate of $7.1 billion to the December 2003 estimate of $8.7 billion. Total program costs include acquisition costs--procurement, research, development, and test and evaluation--as well as military construction costs related to Strykers. The Army does not yet have reliable estimates of the Stryker's operating costs because of limited peacetime use to develop data. As of June 2004, testing of the eight production Strykers was mostly complete, with the vehicles meeting Army operational requirements with limitations. However, development and testing schedules of the two developmental Strykers have been delayed, resulting in an over 1-year delay in meeting the vehicles' production milestones and fielding dates. While the Army has demonstrated the required transportability of Strykers by C-130 aircraft in training exercises, in an operational environment, the Stryker's average weight of 38,000 pounds--along with other factors such as added equipment weight and less than ideal flight conditions--significantly limits the C-130's flight range and reduces the size force that could be deployed. These factors also limit the ability of Strykers to conduct combat operations immediately upon arrival as required.

As in all major Department of Defense  acquisition programs, military construction costs are included in the  program\u2019s total costs. According to the Army, the military construction  cost estimate increased because the December 2003 estimate reflects (1)  the identification of all five sites scheduled to receive Stryker brigades and  (2) the total cost of upgrading or building maintenance and training  facilities at these installations to accommodate a Stryker brigade.

Also, the cost of  RDT&E increased about $138 million, from $508 million to $645.6 million.  Most of the RDT&E cost increase is attributable to revised estimates for  the cost of test and evaluation, development, and system engineering for  the developmental vehicles. The average acquisition cost per vehicle  increased by about $0.79 million, from $3.34 million to $4.13 million.

With most Stryker vehicles weighing close to  38,000 pounds on board, the distance\u2014or range\u2014that a C-130 aircraft  could fly is significantly reduced when taking-off in high air temperatures  or from airfields located in higher elevations. In standard, or nearly ideal,  flight conditions\u2014such as day-time, low head-wind, moderate air  temperature, and low elevation\u2014an armored C-130H with a cargo payload  of 38,000 pounds can generally expect to fly 860 miles from takeoff to  landing. Furthermore, according to a Military Traffic Management  Command\u2019s Transportation Engineering Agency study of C-130 aircraft  transportability of Army vehicles, a C-130\u2019s range is significantly reduced  with only minimal additional weight, and ideal conditions rarely exist in  combat scenarios. The C-130 aircraft\u2019s range may be further reduced if  operational conditions such as high-speed takeoffs and threat-based route  deviations exist because more fuel would be consumed under these  conditions. Even in ideal flight conditions, adding just 2,000 pounds  onboard the aircraft for associated cargo such as mission equipment,  personnel, or ammunition reduces the C-130 aircraft\u2019s takeoff-to-landing  range to 500 miles.

With removable armor added to Strykers, the vehicles will not fit inside a  C-130. To provide interim protection against rocket-propelled grenades,  the Stryker vehicles of the brigade that deployed to Iraq in October 2003,  were fitted with Slat armor weighing about 5,000 pounds for each vehicle  (see fig. 6). By 2005, the Army expects to complete the development of  add-on reactive armor\u2014weighing about 9,000 pounds per vehicle\u2014for  protection against rocket-propelled grenades. With either type of armor  installed, a Stryker vehicle will not fit inside a C-130 aircraft cargo bay.  Regardless, with the added weight of the armor even in ideal flight  conditions, the aircraft would be too heavy to take off.", "Furthermore, according to the Army Test and Evaluation Command\u2019s  Stryker System Evaluation, in less than favorable flight conditions, the Air  Force considers routine transport of the 38,000-pound cargo weight of a  Stryker vehicle on C-130 aircraft risky, and such flight may not be  permitted under the Air Force\u2019s flight operations risk management  requirements if other transport means are available. In two theaters where  U.S. forces are currently operating\u2014the Middle East and Afghanistan, high  temperatures and elevation can reduce C-130 aircraft range if carrying a  38,000-pound Stryker vehicle. Table 7 shows the reduced C-130 aircraft  transport range due to daytime average summer temperatures of more  than 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Iraq and high temperatures and elevations  in Afghanistan. From two locations in Afghanistan (Bagram at 4,895 feet  elevation and Kabul at 5,871 feet elevation) during daytime in the summer,  a C-130 with a Stryker vehicle on board would not be able to take off at all.  In winter from these same locations, its flight range would be reduced to  610 miles departing from Bagram and to 310 miles departing from Kabul.  These same weight concerns would also apply to the Army\u2019s Future  Combat Systems vehicles, which according to the Army\u2019s operational  requirements should be no larger than 38,000 pounds and be transportable  by a C-130.", "Additionally, the Mobile Gun System, expected to weigh over 41,000  pounds, is probably too heavy to transport a significant distance via C-130  aircraft.

For example, if a decision were made to use a Stryker\u2019s add-on  armor for a tactical mission, at about 9,000 pounds for each vehicle\u2019s  armor, it would take at least one additional C-130 aircraft sortie to  transport the armor for about four vehicles. Or, because of potential limits  of the availability of C-130 lift assets, the size of a Stryker force and  number of Stryker vehicles that could be tactically deployed would have to  be reduced.", "At the National Training Center in April 2003, we observed, upon landing,  an infantry company unload the vehicles from the C-130 aircraft,  reconfigure them for combat missions, and move onward to a staging area.  All Stryker variants except one reconfigured into combat capable modes  within their designated time standard. Once reconfigured, units of the  Stryker brigade also demonstrated the ability to conduct immediate  combat operations. However, this was a short-range movement with only  seven aircraft and did not require fitting armor on the vehicles. In an  operational mission, depending on the size of the Stryker force deployed,  using separate C-130 aircraft for transporting vehicles and associated  people and equipment could significantly increase force deployment time  because of the increased numbers of aircraft sorties needed. Upon arrival,  it would also increase the time needed to reconfigure and begin operations  because the vehicles, equipment, and personnel on different aircraft might  arrive at different times or at different airfield locations. In addition, if a  decision were made to use add-on armor for a mission, the armor would  need to be installed after arrival, adding an average of about 10 hours per  vehicle in reconfiguration time to install the armor.", "The capability of transporting Stryker vehicles on C-130 aircraft, despite  its challenges and limitations, is a major objective of the Army\u2019s  transformation to a lighter more responsive force. As such, the Army\u2019s  weight and C-130 transport requirements for the vehicles, as well as  information the Army provided to Congress, created expectations that  Stryker vehicles could be routinely transported within an operational  theater by C-130 aircraft. For example, in several congressional hearings  since 2001, senior Army leadership testified that Stryker vehicles would be  capable of transport by C-130 aircraft. In addition, annual budget  justifications, which the Army submits to Congress for Stryker vehicle  acquisition, highlight the C-130 transport capability of Stryker-vehicle- equipped Brigade Combat Teams.", "During our review, Army officials acknowledged the significant challenges  and limitations of meeting expectations for transporting Stryker vehicles\u2014 and beyond 2010, the Future Combat Systems\u2014on C-130 aircraft in terms  of limited flight range, the size force that could be deployed, and the  challenges of arriving ready for combat. The officials, however, believe  that the capability to transport Stryker vehicles or the Future Combat  Systems\u2019 vehicles on C-130 aircraft, even over short distances, offers the  theater combatant commanders an additional option among other modes  of intratheater transportation\u2014such as C-17 aircraft, sealift, or driving  over land\u2014for transporting Stryker brigades and vehicles in tactical  missions. In addition, the officials believe that the ability to transport  elements of a Stryker brigade as small as a platoon with four Stryker  vehicles\u2014 as a part of an operational mission of forces moving by other  means, greatly enhances the combatant commander\u2019s war-fighting  capabilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In less than 4 years from the November 2000 Stryker vehicle contract  award, the Army is well under way in fielding the eight production vehicle  configurations, and Stryker vehicles are already in use in military  operations in Iraq. However, program costs have increased, largely  because of the cost of military construction related to Stryker vehicle  needs, and delays in developing and testing the two remaining variants will  delay their fielding and use.", "Furthermore, although the Army has successfully demonstrated that  Stryker vehicles can be transported on C-130 aircraft during training  events, routine use of the C-130 for airlifting Stryker vehicles, for other  than short-range missions with limited numbers of vehicles, would be  difficult in theaters where U.S. forces are currently operating. Therefore,  the intended capability of Stryker brigades to be transportable by C-130  aircraft would be markedly reduced. The Army\u2019s operational requirements  and information the Army provided to Congress created expectations that  a Stryker vehicle weight of 38,000 pounds\u2014and a similar weight for Future  Combat System vehicles\u2014would allow routine C-130 transport in tactical  operations. Consequently, congressional decision makers do not have an  accurate sense or realistic expectations of the operational capabilities of  Stryker vehicles and Future Combat Systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the  Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, take the  following two actions:  1.
