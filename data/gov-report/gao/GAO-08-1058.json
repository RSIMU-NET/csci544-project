One such tool is Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (Treasury) to prohibit U.S. financial institutions from maintaining certain accounts for foreign banks if they involve foreign jurisdictions or institutions found to be of primary money laundering concern. To make this finding, Treasury examines several factors and generally issues a proposed rule announcing its intent to apply Section 311 restrictions. GAO was asked to examine (1) the process used to implement Section 311 restrictions, (2) the process Treasury follows to finalize or withdraw a proposed rule, and (3) how Treasury assesses the impact of Section 311. GAO reviewed financial and investigative U.S. government documents and met with government officials and representatives of affected banks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury's informal process to implement Section 311 was consistent with requirements in U.S. law. From 2002 to 2005, Treasury identified 11 cases--3 jurisdictions and 8 institutions--as being of primary money laundering concern and issued proposed rules for 10 of these cases. As required, Treasury consulted with the Departments of Justice and State prior to issuing the proposed rules. However, Justice and State officials said that it was difficult for them to effectively assess the evidence on some Section 311 cases because Treasury provided them limited time. In 2006, Treasury changed its process by forming an interagency working group to discuss potential threats to the U.S. financial system. But it is unclear if the new process addressed the agencies' concerns since Treasury has issued no Section 311 findings since 2005. Treasury determines whether to finalize or withdraw a proposed Section 311 rule by reviewing written comments and sometimes meeting with interested parties. The duration of a proposed rule is significant because U.S. financial institutions act immediately in response to its announcement. However, Treasury has taken years to complete this process in some cases. In April 2008, Treasury withdrew two of three notices--all open for between 3 and 5 years--after GAO discussed the cases with Treasury officials. Contributing to this lag was the absence of required timeframes for completing the action and of written guidance specifying a Treasury office to finalize the actions. Treasury views Section 311 as effective because it isolates target institutions from the U.S. financial system and encourages some foreign governments to strengthen their anti-money laundering authorities. However, some foreign government officials said that Section 311's implementation precluded their own enforcement or regulatory actions against targeted institutions as U.S. action was unilateral or provided too little information for them to act. Justice officials said that if Section 311's application is viewed as unsubstantiated, some countries may be less likely to cooperate with the U.S. government on other law enforcement matters or sanctions. Treasury officials recognized the concerns, but did not believe they diminished Section 311's effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["National Money Laundering Strategy for 2007 (U.S. Government, Washington, D.C.: 2007).", "Pub.

The strategy focuses on three major goals: (1) to more  effectively cut off access to the international financial system by money  launderers and terrorist financiers; (2) to enhance the federal  government\u2019s ability to target major money laundering organizations and  systems; and (3) strengthen and refine the anti-money laundering  regulatory regime for all financial institutions to improve the effectiveness  of compliance and enforcement efforts.

The first opportunity to use Section  311 arose out of the FATF\u2019s Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories  (NCCT) process, according to Treasury officials. Once a country was  placed on the NCCT list, FATF member states, including the United States,  had an obligation to advise financial institutions in their country to give  enhanced scrutiny to financial transactions with financial institutions on  the FATF NCCT list. If after a year, a country had not taken the  appropriate measures to be removed from the NCCT list, then FATF would  request that its member countries place additional countermeasures  against the country, according to Treasury officials. Treasury officials told  us that prior to the passage of Section 311, the United States had no real  countermeasures to impose on countries when FATF called for them.  After Section 311 was passed, Treasury decided to use the provision in  response to the FATF\u2019s call for additional country countermeasures. In  early 2000, FATF called for countermeasures against Ukraine and Nauru  and, in 2003, called for countermeasures against Burma. Subsequently,  Treasury responded by invoking Section 311 against all three countries,  according to Treasury officials.", "For financial institutions it targeted, Treasury used a different approach  from that used for jurisdictions. It developed a list of possible targets for  the purpose of using the new Section 311 authority, according to U.S.  government officials. In 2002 and 2003, Treasury officials said, the Office  of Enforcement, which preceded TFFC, assigned each of its five to six  staff to review a region of the world in order to review intelligence reports  and identify potential targets in each region. Ultimately, the office  produced a list of over 20 banks of money laundering concern that were  potential targets for Section 311 action. Treasury officials told us that their  offices developed the list of targeted financial institutions internally. While  Treasury officials said that they did not consult other agency officials with  expertise in money laundering and international affairs in developing the  initial list of targets, Treasury developed the list from various sources,  based on material developed by other agencies.", "Treasury officials identified several sources as the impetus for its findings  of primary money-laundering concern for various financial institutions.", "The finding against one bank occurred because there was an ongoing FBI  investigation of the bank, according to Treasury officials. They said that  this case was the first opportunity Treasury had to use Section 311 in  conjunction with law enforcement.", "The findings against two other banks emerged from a concern that a  foreign government was not reforming its anti-money laundering laws,  according to Treasury officials. They said that the U.S. government had  been concerned for some time with lack of anti-money laundering controls  in the country, but had not pursued the issue until it became apparent that  anti-money laundering controls were not going to be addressed. At that  point, Treasury met with State to develop a strategy for dealing with the  country\u2019s anti-money laundering control issues. Following the Section 311  finding, the foreign government passed legislation to improve its national  anti-money laundering controls.", "The findings against two other targeted banks emerged from several  national security working groups and were part of a higher National  Security Council strategy for these particular countries, according to  Treasury officials.", "After developing the target list, Treasury conducted research to support a  finding for each targeted institution on the list.

From 2002 through 2005,  in accordance with USA PATRIOT Act Section 311, Treasury generally  considered the seven factors outlined in Section 311 when determining  whether a jurisdiction is of primary money laundering concern, including  the quality of bank supervision and anti-money laundering laws in the  jurisdiction. For example, for the jurisdiction of Burma, Treasury found  that Burma lacked a basic set of anti-money laundering laws and that the  Burmese Central Bank had no anti-money laundering regulations for  financial institutions. For proposed rules determining whether an  institution was of primary money laundering concern, Treasury considered  the three factors outlined in Section 311 for financial institutions. For  example, Treasury determined that the Commercial Bank of Syria was  being used to facilitate or promote money laundering because numerous  transactions were indicative of money laundering passed through that  bank. Treasury also determined that any legitimate business activity at the  bank was significantly outweighed by the apparent use of the bank to  promote money laundering.", "When determining which special measures to apply under Section 311,  Treasury considered the four factors required by the law. For example,  Treasury considered whether similar action was being taken by other  nations or organizations, the burden of special measures for U.S. financial  institution compliance, the impact of special measures on the international  financial system, and the effect of special measures on U.S. national  security and foreign policy when it announced Section 311 special  measures for Banco Delta Asia.

Before a proposed rule was issued for public  comment, Treasury provided it to Justice and State for consultation, as  required by the act. Though the consultations fulfilled requirements  under Section 311, Justice and State officials said that consultations often  occurred under short time frames, affording them insufficient opportunity  to provide meaningful input to the Section 311 process. Treasury  established no operational guidance with set time frames for this  consultation requirement. For example, one Justice official stated that  Justice generally received an e-mail from Treasury asking Justice if it  wanted to comment on a proposed rule and setting very tight time  frames\u2014in one case as little as 1 to 2 days\u2014with no explanation as to why  time frames were so tight. Other Justice officials said that the short time  frame required that most of the feedback from Justice to Treasury was  oral, but that in one case neither Justice nor Treasury had access to a  Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility to discuss classified  information during the time period provided. As a result, all conversations  between the two agencies needed to be general and could not be  classified. This was problematic because one Justice official said that most  of Justice\u2019s comments regarded evidence that was highly classified. Also,  short time frames made consultation difficult because they did not allow  the relevant Justice official who had reviewed the classified evidence time  to collect comments or concerns from other officials in Justice.", "Treasury officials disagreed with concerns expressed about their  consultation roles. They stated their belief that Treasury coordinates  extensively. Treasury worked with other agencies on various cases. For  example, in one case, Treasury worked for months with the intelligence  agencies in developing the case and with State, including the Secretary of  State, on the designation, according to the officials. Treasury officials said  that they also consulted with State\u2019s Undersecretary for Economic and  Business Affairs as required. In addition, Treasury officials said that they  delayed one case because of law enforcement interests in the targeted  institution and that law enforcement equities are a primary concern for  Treasury. Moreover, Treasury said that it has accommodated other  agencies\u2019 concerns and always ensured that it did not endanger the  operational interests of law enforcement and the intelligence community.

Targeted  assessments of financial institutions that may be of primary money  laundering concern are now prepared instead of complete Section 311  packages. This is because preparing a complete package took  considerable time, according to this official, and then had to be assessed  to determine if there was sufficient evidence to justify a finding and  proposed rule. The process now begins when a request for preparing an  assessment comes from either (1) within FinCEN, based on a daily  FinCEN review of intelligence and public materials looking for threats to  the U.S. financial system or (2) other parts of Treasury or other agencies  with suggestions for a targeted assessment. In deciding whether or not to  prepare a targeted assessment, FinCEN first considers whether an  institution has access to the U.S. financial system. If not, FinCEN takes no  action to assess it. Once an assessment is prepared, it is presented either  to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence or to the  Director of FinCEN, or both, for a policy decision on whether further  action should be taken. None of the targeted assessments has resulted in  Section 311 actions, but Treasury said it has selected other options to  address these threats.", "The second change in the implementation process was the formation of an  interagency working group to review suspect banks. This group developed  over time but formally began meeting in January 2008. According to the  Chief of Justice\u2019s Asset Forfeiture & Money Laundering Section (AFMLS),  he developed an informal working relationship with Treasury, primarily  through meetings with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of TFFC, on a  monthly or bimonthly basis. This evolved into a working group to review  suspect banks for possible anti-money laundering efforts, including  Section 311 actions. This process was formalized in the first 6 months of  2008 and the working group has met about 6 times. The Deputy Assistant  Secretary for TFFC at Treasury noted that this group gives the Section 311  process a broader perspective on suspect banks. The Chief of Justice\u2019s  AFMLS section also said that this working group is a significant  improvement over Treasury\u2019s previous process for identifying banks for  possible Section 311 action, which had not been clear to Justice officials.  The working group also allows Justice to learn about possible Section 311  actions early, thus alerting Justice to actions that could impact ongoing  covert operations. The Justice official noted that one of its goals for the  working group is to maintain anti-money laundering expertise and a law  enforcement perspective, since TFFC is not a law enforcement agency.  The Justice official emphasized that the group has good potential but that  it will take another 6 months to see how well it works.", "Membership in the suspect banks\u2019 working group consists of a wide  variety of organizations. The Chief of Justice\u2019s AFMLS co-chairs the group  with Treasury\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for TFFC.

Officials said that  in some cases, they also met with affected financial institutions at the  institutions\u2019 request. Treasury then determines whether to finalize or  withdraw a proposed rule.

Federal government management control standards  require that agencies have policies and procedures for implementing  management directives and that agencies clearly define key areas of  responsibility throughout their organization. However, Treasury does not  have policies and procedures that provide operational guidance as to  when proposed rules should be finalized or other procedures that  Treasury staff should follow when implementing Section 311 actions. In  addition, we observed that there are not clear lines of responsibility as to  which office within Treasury should finalize these proposed rules.", "Treasury officials said that they follow the law and rule-making  procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act when  implementing proposed rules. However, as mentioned earlier, the law  provides no time frames to which officials are expected to adhere between  the issuance of a notice of proposed rule-making and a final rule. Instead,  Treasury officials told us that the events that occur in a case and the  priorities of the office implementing the rule affect the amount of time that  elapses between when a rule is proposed and when it is finalized. For  example, one FinCEN official said that his work on finalizing a proposed  rule was delayed when another Section 311 case became a higher priority.  The proposed rule in this case was eventually finalized after more than 3  years.", "Several additional factors accounted for the interval of time between  issuing findings and proposed rules and finalizing or withdrawing them.  Staff at FinCEN said that often the decision to postpone a case is made  simply because there are not enough resources to concentrate on all of the  cases at hand. For example, one official said that he was working on  resolving the proposed rule-making for one bank when another case  began. Once the second case became a priority, work on the first was put  on hold so that all staff could work on the other case, since only a few  staff within FinCEN work on Section 311 cases, according to the official.", "In addition, Treasury officials said, they extended a comment period for  two banks, while in another case, they postponed final action on an  institution for several months pending completion of a law enforcement  investigation. Also contributing to the interval between a proposed rule  and a final or withdrawn rule is that Treasury monitors financial  institutions on an ad hoc basis after a proposed rule is issued. For  example, in one case FinCEN required several months in 2007 to confirm  whether banks under Section 311 restrictions were still in business and an  additional 9 months to withdraw the proposed rule after receiving the  information.", "Treasury officials\u2019 uncertainty about clear lines of responsibility added to  delays in finalizing proposed rules. Both FinCEN and TFFC officials told  us Treasury has prepared no written guidance outlining the  responsibilities of each bureau for administering Section 311. In addition,  it appears that the bureaus have not determined their respective  responsibilities in finalizing proposed rules. For example, in February  2008, three proposed rules were open, with two having been open for  more than 4 years beyond the 30-day comment period. Senior TFFC  officials were not aware that these cases were still open until we brought  this fact to their attention. In contrast to TFFC, FinCEN officials were  aware that these cases were open, as their status was listed on FinCEN\u2019s  website. In addition, a lack of clear lines of responsibility led to confusion  over the responsibility for closing these cases. FinCEN officials did not  believe that they were responsible for closing them. They stated that TFI is  responsible for deciding when to decide to finalize or withdraw a  proposed rule, although FinCEN staff may sometimes take the initiative to  suggest that a rule be finalized or postponed. TFFC officials, on the other  hand, said that FinCEN was responsible for finalizing proposed rules.  TFFC officials followed up on the proposed rules that were outstanding  after we discussed the rules with them. Although Treasury stated that it  had started action to withdraw two of the proposed rules prior to our  discussion with TFFC, Treasury documents showed that FinCEN  previously had started to draft a withdrawal notice for one case in 2005  but never completed it, and had started again in October 2007 to draft  withdrawal notices for this and a second case, before issuing them 6  months later.", "In response to our observation of unclear lines of authority, senior  FinCEN and TFFC officials said that, pursuant to law and a related  Treasury order, FinCEN is the administrator of the BSA, of which USA  PATRIOT Act amendments are a part. Therefore, FinCEN is technically  responsible for administering Section 311. The Treasury officials added  that FinCEN coordinates closely with TFFC on all aspects of Section 311  rule-making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Rules Had an Immediate Impact on Targeted Countries and Financial Institutions", "paragraphs": ["Despite taking years to finalize in some cases, proposed rules under  Section 311 had an immediate impact on targeted institutions and  jurisdictions. Treasury, State, and Justice officials told us that once a  proposed rule is issued, almost all U.S. financial institutions immediately  implement it voluntarily, stopping financial transactions with designated  financial institutions or jurisdictions. Federal Reserve and Treasury\u2019s  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency officials also said that U.S.  banks often treat proposed Section 311 rules as final and generally cut off  all financial interactions with the targeted institution. Federal Reserve  officials noted that this response to a proposed rule is unusual and, within  the context of BSA requirements, appears to be unique to proposed rules  under Section 311. Officials explained that U.S. banks may be taking this  action because the proposed rule is associated with a finding of primary  money laundering concern and, in many instances, Treasury issued a  finding together with a notice of proposed rule-making. Because it makes  good business sense to protect banks from risks to their reputation and  possible government penalties, banks may discontinue business with other  banks labeled a primary money laundering concern to reduce their  reputational risk. Banks may be concerned that continuing business with a  bank labeled as of \u201cprimary money laundering concern\u201d would negatively  impact their reputation. Moreover, U.S. financial institutions must take  publicly available information into account when implementing their anti- money laundering programs and assessing risks. In addition, banks are  generally given a short time frame to come into compliance with rules  under Section 311 once they are finalized, so they may cut off all financial  interaction with a targeted entity when the proposed rule is issued to  ensure that they have minimized their risk of non-compliance.", "Foreign government officials and representatives from targeted financial  institutions in countries we visited also agreed that proposed rules have an  immediate impact on these institutions and jurisdictions. Foreign  government officials told us that, following the issuance of proposed rules,  U.S. correspondent accounts of targeted banks were immediately closed.  Bank representatives also told us that the proposed rules had a significant  impact on their business. Bank managers from one targeted institution  stated that the banks\u2019 deposits had decreased by one third of their original  amount 3 days after the proposed rule was issued. In another case, a bank  lost approximately 80 percent of its business as a result of a proposed rule,  according to a bank representative. Attorneys for targeted financial  institutions with whom we spoke emphasized that the amount of time  between the proposed and final rule is important to targeted institutions  since a long delay can weaken a bank financially. One legal representative  noted that long delays between the proposed and final rule can put a bank  in a financial position where it cannot afford to take legal action in U.S.  court opposing special measures if a rule is finalized against it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Treasury Views Section 311 as Effective, despite Concerns Expressed by Others about the Process", "paragraphs": ["Treasury views Section 311 restrictions as effective, despite concerns  expressed by others about the process.

Treasury views Section 311 actions as effective in achieving both  goals because U.S. financial institutions respond immediately to proposed  rules, and several foreign governments have strengthened their laws and  regulations in response to proposed rules. However, Treasury does not  view the long-term impact of proposed and final rules, including negative  foreign perceptions of their implementation, as outweighing the  observable achievements of Section 311."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Agencies and Foreign Governments View Section 311 as Effective", "paragraphs": ["U.S. and foreign government officials with whom we spoke said that they  consider Section 311 to be an effective anti-money laundering tool and to  have had a significant impact on target financial institutions and countries.  According to Treasury officials, Section 311 restrictions are intended to  achieve (1) the anti-money laundering goal of isolating target financial  institutions from the U.S. financial system and (2) a broader national  security goal of encouraging foreign governments to strengthen their anti- money laundering laws and regulations.", "Several U.S. government officials said that Section 311 was effective in  achieving the first goal of isolating targeted financial institutions or  jurisdictions from the U.S. financial system. For example, one State official  said that the imposition of Section 311 was very effective for the majority  of countries targeted because financial systems in other countries were so  closely tied to the U.S. financial system. Generally, the imposition of a  Section 311 action, beginning with the issuance of a proposed rule, caused  U.S. banks to voluntarily cut off transactions with the targeted financial  institutions even when proposed rules were not finalized. In addition, the  action has a chilling effect on foreign investment through the bank or in  the country because the banking industry pays close attention to the  actions of U.S. financial institutions, according to the official.", "Several U.S. and foreign government officials said that Section 311 was  effective in achieving the second goal because it influenced some foreign  governments to strengthen their anti-money laundering laws and  regulations. Officials specifically cited the Latvia, Macau, and Ukraine  cases as examples of this. For example, one Treasury official noted that,  after the Section 311 action occurred, the government of Latvia worked  closely with the U.S. Embassy and State to address problems related to  financial crime which had caused Treasury to issue the Section 311  findings. While foreign government officials in these countries did not  dispute the statement, some said either that their governments had already  started to strengthen their laws and regulations when the Section 311  action occurred, or that they had responded as much or more to other  actions, such as the FATF call for countermeasures, than to the U.S.  restrictions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Section 311 Exist Both in the United States and Abroad", "paragraphs": ["Despite the achievements observed from initial monitoring of Section 311  actions, we identified several concerns about the impact of Section 311\u2019s  implementation. U.S. embassy officials with whom we spoke and  representatives of one targeted institution indicated that the impact of the  proposed rule continued on the institution and the country even after the  rule had been withdrawn. A number of U.S. banks have avoided holding  correspondent bank accounts with any banks in the country since the  Section 311 restriction was issued, according to embassy officials. They  noted that the issuance of Section 311 creates a large stigma against  banking with both the targeted banks under the proposed rule and other  banks in the country where the proposed rule was targeted. Embassy  officials said that several U.S. businessmen in the country have been told  by U.S. bankers that they decided to withdraw from doing business in the  country because of the Section 311 action. Foreign banking officials stated  that the proposed rule continued to impact the country even though it was  not targeted at the country specifically, and the United States had  acknowledged the government\u2019s efforts in the anti-money laundering  arena. One representative of a foreign institution pointed out that the  consequences of Section 311 action against his country continue and may  not have been intended. For example, American banks continue to be  hesitant to do business with his country\u2019s banks and many have cut off  business altogether. The official said that he believes this is because  American banks do not believe that guidelines are clear as to what anti- money laundering standards they should be following. In order to  minimize the risk of noncompliance with their regulators, many banks  have stopped business with his country\u2019s banks altogether, regardless of  whether they believe that a bank is following U.S. anti-money laundering  standards.", "Foreign regulatory and law enforcement agencies in some countries we  visited said that how Section 311 actions were implemented did not  provide them sufficient opportunity or information from U.S. government  sources to prosecute crimes or regulate the targeted banks. For example,  foreign government officials in one country that we visited noted that  there were many steps that the government\u2019s monetary authority could  have undertaken to put pressure on the targeted institution to improve its  anti-money laundering controls. These actions might have solved the  problem to the extent that the U.S. government would not have had to take  action, according to the officials. The officials said that the monetary  authority has the ability to obtain information from financial institutions,  attach conditions to institutional operation, work with the Financial  Intelligence Unit to investigate financial crimes, and, in more drastic  situations, appoint an advisor or director to take over a private bank.  Treasury officials said that it discussed Section 311 actions with foreign  government representatives when appropriate and provided ample notice  that a Section 311 action was forthcoming in some cases. In some  instances, however, such communications would be inappropriate,  according to Treasury officials. Treasury officials noted that it is obligated  under the USA PATRIOT Act to consider \u201cthe extent to which that  jurisdiction is characterized by high levels of official or institutional  corruption\u201d when making a finding that a jurisdiction is of primary money  laundering concern.", "Justice officials said that in cases where application of Section 311 is  perceived as unsubstantiated, it harms the United States. Countries may be  less likely to cooperate with the U.S. government on other sanctions or  law enforcement matters if they feel that the United States is acting in an  unreasonable or unsubstantiated manner regarding Section 311 or that the  United States cannot articulate the standards used to reach such a  decision. In addition, when countries distrust actions the United States has  taken under Section 311, their trust in U.S. actions in other areas is  undermined. A Justice official noted that there are times when Justice  needs to request the assistance of others based on classified information  and sometimes it cannot immediately reveal this information or its source.  In these cases, Justice needs foreign governments to trust the United  States and act on its requests. If trust in the U.S. government has been  eroded due to actions that appear to be unsubstantiated, then foreign  governments may be less likely to cooperate with Justice investigations.", "In addition, some U.S. government officials, foreign government officials,  and representatives of banks in countries we visited, characterized the  imposition of Section 311 special measures as a \u201cpolitical tool\u201d and as  sanctions. They saw Section 311 actions to be more like unilateral U.S.  sanctions used for political purposes than law enforcement mechanisms  used for anti-money laundering purposes. Some similarities between  Section 311 actions and sanctions\u2014such as their being unilateral,  designation of targeted persons or institutions, announcement of these  designations in the Federal Register, prohibition of certain financial  transactions, and denial of access to the U.S. financial system for  designated parties\u2014may contribute to this perception. Also, an official of  Treasury\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said that the only  other process in his view that was similar to the Section 311 process is  Treasury\u2019s OFAC sanctions process. Under such sanctions, according to  the official, banks also automatically stop doing business with an  institution once it is cited.", "Treasury officials acknowledge that this perception exists but maintain  that Section 311 is an anti-money laundering mechanism, not a sanction. In  testimony in April 2008, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence stated:  Treasury adopted a new strategy of using targeted, conduct-based  financial measures aimed at particular bad actors. I intentionally refer  to these targeted actions as \u201cfinancial measures\u201d rather than  \u201csanctions\u201d because the word \u201csanctions\u201d often evokes such a negative  reaction. These targeted financial measures are proving to be quite  effective, flying in the face of a widely-held historical view that  dismisses sanctions as ineffective, harmful to innocents, or both. In the  case of broad, country-wide sanctions that are often perceived as  political statements, it can be difficult to persuade other governments  and private businesses to join us in taking action.", "Treasury reiterated its view that Section 311 actions are not sanctions  despite the perception that they are by some U.S. officials and foreign  governments. Senior Treasury officials regularly work to educate the  public and foreign governments that these actions are not sanctions,  according to Treasury officials. Treasury\u2019s OFAC administers the U.S.  sanctions programs, which operate under very different authorities.", "Finally, some U.S. government officials and foreign government officials  we met with in countries where financial institutions had been targeted  felt that there were several financial institutions of greater money  laundering concern that had not been targeted and suggested that  Treasury targeted financial institutions that were politically expedient  rather than financial institutions that were of the greatest concern. For  example, officials we spoke with about two countries we visited where  financial institutions were identified for Section 311 actions told us that  other banks in those countries had anti-money laundering controls that  were as bad as, or worse than the banks that were targeted. They noted  that it was not clear why Treasury chose the banks it chose as targets for  Section 311 action. Treasury officials explained that it was important for  Treasury to have flexibility in implementing Section 311 and that Treasury  could have targeted other banks in one country, for example, that were  larger than those it targeted. However, Treasury did not want to  undermine the country\u2019s financial system but that, by selecting the smaller  banks, it would still send the message to government authorities that they  needed to reform the country\u2019s anti-money laundering systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["U.S. government officials consider Section 311 to be an effective tool in  restricting access to the U.S. financial markets for financial institutions or  jurisdictions that are of primary money laundering concern and in  encouraging foreign governments to strengthen their anti-money  laundering laws and regulations. While using Section 311 has helped  achieve success towards these goals in specific instances, shortcomings in  Treasury\u2019s implementation of the law may be preventing the law from  achieving a greater potential. Without written operational guidelines to  clarify when to complete the Section 311 actions or clear lines of authority  for which office is responsible for completing the action, Treasury has  taken years to complete the Section 311 process for certain cases. Because  a proposed rule applying Section 311 in practice has had the same effect as  a final rule, Treasury may lack incentive to finalize or withdraw such rules.  More expeditious completion of Section 311 cases could be an important  counterbalance to concerns about the Section 311 process by affected  jurisdictions, financial institutions, and other parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve implementation of the Section 311 process, we  recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury establish implementing  guidance for Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act.

We reviewed Section 311 of the  USA PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Procedure Act in order to  identify mandated requirements in law that Treasury must follow when it  issues and finalizes a proposed rule. We focused this performance audit on  locations where the U.S. government has targeted financial institutions or  jurisdictions for Section 311 actions.

We also met with foreign government officials in Riga Latvia; Kyiv,  Ukraine; and Macau and Hong Kong, China; as well as with representatives  of financial institutions in these countries that had been targeted for  Section 311 actions.
