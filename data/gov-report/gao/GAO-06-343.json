Since its inception, the Commission has conducted hearings and issued reports highlighting critical, controversial civil rights issues, including racial segregation, impediments to voting rights, and affirmative action. To carry out its fact-finding and reporting mission, the Commission is required to submit at least one report annually to the President and Congress on federal civil rights enforcement efforts, among other requirements. Because the Commission has no enforcement power, the key means for achieving its mission lies in its credibility as an independent and impartial fact-finding and reporting organization. To complement this national fact-finding and reporting effort, separate state advisory committees were also authorized in 1957 to advise the Commission and serve as its \"eyes and ears\" on state and local civil rights issues. State advisory committees are composed of volunteers appointed by the Commission in every state who conduct public hearings on state and local civil rights issues and issue reports to the Commission on their findings. The Commission's national office reports are researched and written by national office staff and approved by the Commissioners, and the state advisory committee reports are researched and drafted by the Commission's regional office staff under the direction of the state advisory committees. We were asked to assess the Commission's quality assurance policies for its national and state advisory committee reports and other products and the role of the state advisory committees in fulfilling the Commission's fact-finding and reporting mission. More specifically, our objectives were to assess (1) the adequacy of the Commission's policies for ensuring the quality of its products and (2) the role of the state advisory committees in contributing to the Commission's work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Commission has some policies that provide adequate quality assurance for its products; however, it lacks policies for ensuring the objectivity of its national office reports, briefings, and hearings and providing accountability for decisions made on its national office products. Among its key policies, the Commission requires its national office products to be reviewed for legal sufficiency and provides affected agencies an opportunity to comment on the accuracy of information in its draft reports. In addition, under new Commission policies, Commissioners have an increased role in the development of its products, as we previously recommended. However, the Commission lacks several key policies that could help ensure objectivity in its national office products. The state advisory committees have played a key role in the Commission's work by identifying and reporting on local civil rights issues, but most committees do not have current charters giving them authorization to operate, and the Commission has not fully integrated the committees into the accomplishment of its mission. Traditionally, the committees have gathered data on state and local civil rights issues by holding hearings, forums, and briefings and communicated their findings to the Commission and the public through reports. Since 1980, the state advisory committees have accounted for 200 of the 254 reports published by the Commission. Currently, however, 38 of the 51 state advisory committees cannot conduct any work because they do not have approved charters. In late 2005, the Commission began revising the criteria for state advisory committee membership in order to, among other things, move away from racially and ethnically based representation toward great diversity in expertise and ideas. It also decided that the committees' applications for new charters would not be accepted until they had been redrafted to include only members who meet the new criteria. Several other actions by the Commission have limited the activities of the state advisory committees. First, since the 1990s, because of budgetary constraints, the Commission has significantly reduced the number of regional office staff, who provide extensive support to the state committees in conducting their activities and producing reports. In addition, the Commission has reduced funding for the state advisory committees, including money needed to hold public meetings. Furthermore, draft reports prepared by the state advisory committees are often not reviewed or published by the Commission in a timely manner. For example, most of the state advisory committees we visited told us the national office had not reviewed and accepted their reports in a timely manner, and less than a quarter of the state advisory committee chairs who responded to our survey reported that they were satisfied with the national office's timeliness in processing their reports. The Commission has also not incorporated the work of the state advisory committees into its strategic planning and decision-making processes, including articulating how the national office will use the state advisory committees' findings on state and local civil rights issues to inform the Commission's national goals and strategies. For example, the Commission did not obtain input from the state advisory committees in developing its new draft strategic plan, although the committees play an important role in accomplishing the agency's goals. Finally, although many of these are long-standing issues, the Commission has not provided for independent oversight of its policies and practices for the state advisory committees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (the Commission) was established by  the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to serve as an independent, bipartisan, fact- finding agency whose mission is to investigate and report on the status of  civil rights in the United States.

The Commissioners had agreed upon this range of perspectives when they  voted to approve the report\u2019s outline in April 2005.

The Academies\u2019 extensive external review process includes preparing  a slate of names of possible reviewers, having the names approved at two  levels of the organization, and establishing a review coordinator. The  Academies then recruit independent experts with a range of views and  perspectives to comment on the draft report, and their comments are  provided anonymously. In addition, to ensure that the reviewers\u2019  comments are appropriately incorporated, the Academies require the  review coordinator to document that the report adequately addressed the  reviewers\u2019 comments.

Three of the four speakers at the Commission  briefing opposed reauthorization of a key provision of the act. One  Commissioner we interviewed told us he thought the briefing panel was  biased and unbalanced. According to the Staff Director, the way speakers  are identified and the basis for their selection vary with each briefing,  depending on the topic, but the Commission does not have a written  requirement for ensuring varied perspectives in briefing panels. Some  invited speakers have declined to participate in Commission briefings  because they were unavailable on the proposed briefing dates or because  they believed their professional roles precluded them from taking a stance  on the issues to be discussed. However, the Staff Director also told us that  the Commission often has difficulty obtaining speakers who represent  different perspectives on controversial topics. For example, in one  instance an invited speaker declined in part because he had no confidence  in the Commission\u2019s receptivity to the evidence and other points of view.", "In addition, although the Commission\u2019s new policies require the Staff  Director and Commissioners to approve national office products at several  stages, these policies do not include criteria designed to ensure that the  products are objective.

According to the Staff Director, in  addition to the Commission\u2019s general policy guidance, his reviews of draft  reports are largely guided by his judgment on whether the reports are  likely to be approved by a majority of the Commissioners.

For example, in an early stage of the development of this report,  the Staff Director did not consult with all of the Commissioners or obtain  their agreement before he changed the focus of the questions used to  collect essential data from federal agencies for the report. These  questions\u2014called interrogatories\u2014significantly altered the report\u2019s  direction after the Commission\u2019s staff had completed much of their  research. However, the Commissioners were not made aware of this  change until a Commissioner pointed out discrepancies between the  original focus as approved by the Commission in 2003 and the  interrogatories that went out in 2005. At a public meeting of the  Commission, three Commissioners objected to the fact that the  interrogatories had gone forward without the expressed authority of the  Commissioners and that these changes were made autonomously by the  Staff Director and the Chair. At the meeting, the Chair agreed that the  interrogatories should not have been sent without the other  Commissioners\u2019 approval of the changes.", "In another example of decisions being made without the knowledge of all  of the Commissioners, the Chair made changes to a draft briefing report  on campus anti-Semitism based on his legal interpretation of an issue and  private conversations with officials from the Department of Education. At  the Commission\u2019s February 2006 meeting, the Vice Chair said that she did  not understand the rationale for the changes and objected to the methods  used to obtain information on the issue. Other Commissioners questioned  the Chair\u2019s legal interpretation and the accuracy of the changes he made.  Although they had planned to vote on the report at this meeting, the  Commissioners postponed the vote because of disagreements about these  changes and their implications for the report\u2019s recommendations.", "Similarly, the Chair and several Commissioners sent a letter to the  Secretary of the Department of Education (Education) disagreeing with a  civil rights organization\u2019s report that had criticized the department and  commending Education for its commitment to civil rights. However, the  Commissioner, who, at that time, was the sole Democrat, noted in a  separate dissenting letter that he was not informed about the majority\u2019s  letter until after it was drafted and that he did not understand the other  Commissioners\u2019 impetus for writing the letter.", "In several recent instances, Commissioners have also complained about  not receiving key documents for review or receiving them too late to help  them in their deliberations. For example, at the Commission\u2019s monthly  public meeting in January 2006, several Commissioners complained that  they had not received transcripts of Commission meetings since October  2005.

However, because the  Commissioners had not received copies of the transcript used to prepare  this report, they postponed a vote to approve the report for publication. In  addition, the Commissioners postponed a vote accepting a state advisory  committee report for publication because they had not received it in time  to review it. Similarly, in July 2005, the Commissioners were sent a final  draft of the Adarand report for review on the same day that they voted on  its publication, despite the fact that it contained comments from an  affected federal agency and an external reviewer that required fresh  review.

In addition, in accordance  with the Commission\u2019s new policies, the Commissioners\u2019 individual  reviews of the draft report were not discussed in a public meeting. Two  Commissioners said that they were unaware of the changes made to the  report until after the decision had been made to remove the sections of the  report from the draft. In a public meeting afterward, the Staff Director  stated that he had removed the sections because it had become clear to  him that with these sections, the report would not receive enough votes to  be approved for publication. One Republican Commissioner told us that  although he agreed with the analysis in the Adarand report, he had  abstained from voting on the final report because he objected to the report  process and because he did not want a biased report to be issued by the  Commission.", "Another means of documenting the quality of products is the use of  checklists.

The checklists include a section to be completed by the Office of the Staff  Director that documents the office\u2019s assessment of the balance, writing,  and report conclusions of state advisory committee reports before  transmitting these reports to the Commissioners. However, the  Commission does not appear to use the checklists for state advisory  committee reports, since they were not always completed or were missing.

Specifically, we recommended that the  Commission seek the services of an existing Inspector General to help  keep the Commission and Congress informed of problems and to conduct  and supervise necessary audits and investigations of the Commission\u2019s  operations. In 2005, the Commission acted to implement our 2003  recommendation to increase Commissioners\u2019 involvement in the  development of its national office products and also began to implement  our recommendations on other matters, such as financial management.  According to the Staff Director, he contacted officials from some Offices  of Inspectors General, including GSA, but they declined to provide their  services, noting that most of the Commission\u2019s problems would take too  much of their staff time. The Staff Director also told us that the  Commission had contracted with an accounting firm for advice on how to  correct problems identified in their recent financial audit.

More specifically, Commission  policy explicitly requires state advisory committees to incorporate  balanced, varied, and opposing perspectives in their hearings and reports,  in contrast to national office products, which do not have such a  requirement. According to the Commission\u2019s administrative policy manual,  state advisory committees \u201cmust seek to hear a variety of points of view  and opinions\u201d in conducting their work. This policy also notes that  \u201cbalance does not mean that the conclusions of a State Advisory  Committee agree with or include all positions, only that the research and  opinions listened to represent a variety of different and opposing views on  the topic at hand.\u201d To reinforce this focus, the checklist for transmitting  state advisory committee proposals to the national office for approval asks  the Staff Director\u2019s office to determine whether the sources to be used  represent a variety of opinions on the issues. Similarly, the checklist for  transmitting state advisory committee reports to the national office  requires the Office of the Staff Director to determine whether varied and  opposing views were identified and discussed in the report. The national  office does not have such quality assurance checklists for assessing its  own products. In addition, state advisory committee members are required  to review draft committee reports for their clarity, substance, objectivity,  and conclusions, unlike Commissioners, who do not have criteria for  reviewing Commission products. The regional directors are also  responsible for ensuring that state advisory committee reports meet  appropriate methodological, organizational, and balance standards. State  advisory committee products are also subject to the four reviews required  for all Commission products: the editorial review, legal sufficiency review,  defame and degrade review, and affected agency review.

Furthermore, over the past 5 years, the activities of the state  advisory committees have been significantly limited, in part because the  Commission, working under budget restraints, has reduced the resources  available to conduct their work and also because it has delayed reviewing  and accepting their reports for publication. In addition, the Commission  has not sought the views of state advisory committee members in its  strategic planning process or on key decisions that affect the committees.

The state advisory committees have identified and examined issues  through a variety of activities and provided information to the Commission  and the public in written reports. Since 1980, the state advisory committee  issued 200 of the 254 reports published by the Commission. Other  activities conducted by the state advisory committees include open  forums, public meetings, and formal hearings that have provided avenues  for the public to communicate their civil rights experiences and for the  committees to define current local civil rights issues that may not yet be  on the national agenda.", "Some of the committees\u2019 reports have prompted action by the  Commission. For example, in 1973, the California State Advisory  Committee held hearings on the concerns of the Asian American and  Pacific Islander communities. These hearings resulted in two state  advisory committee reports: Asian American and Pacific Peoples: A Case  of Mistaken Identity (February 1975) and A Dream Unfulfilled: Korean  and Philipino Health Professionals in California (May 1975). These  reports were the first studies conducted by the Commission on these  issues, according to agency officials. The Commission issued national  office reports on these issues in 1986, 1988, and 1992. More recently, after  the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, the Commission asked the state  advisory committees to gather information on the status of Muslim, Arab  American, and others perceived to be from these communities in their  states. Twenty state committees held information-gathering events\u2014such  as town hall meetings\u2014at which the public was invited to speak about  experiences that may have threatened the civil rights of members of the  Muslim community. As a result, nine state advisory committees\u2019 reports  were issued by the Commission on the civil rights of Muslims and other  communities in their states, and the Commission issued a statement that  summarized the results of these activities and reports.", "State advisory committee reports also have had an impact on their states\u2019  operations, including state legislation. Members of several committees told  us about legislation that had passed or state offices that had been affected  through their efforts. For example, officials with one of the Commission\u2019s  regional offices told us that in 2003, one of its states formed a multi-agency  state task force to work on an issue reported by the Nevada State Advisory  Committee on the educational opportunities of Native American Indian  students in the state\u2019s public schools. As a result of the task force\u2019s efforts,  the state enacted legislation designed to improve educational outcomes of  Native American Indian students. State advisory committee members also  noted that just conducting activities, without issuing a report, can have an  effect. For example, members of one committee told us that they visited a  local prison after receiving allegations of sexual abuse of female detainees  being held on account of their illegal entry into the United States. Local  newspapers were present during the committee\u2019s visits, bringing the issue,  which was not well known, to the public\u2019s attention.", "In addition, state advisory committee members reported that they  participated in activities that gave them a voice in their states\u2019 civil rights  operations. For example, they reported working with the state civil rights  offices to inform them of local issues and assist in writing proposed  legislation, giving testimony to state legislatures, and training state and  local officials on current civil rights issues. In responding to our survey,  one chairman reported that on the basis of work conducted by the state  advisory committee, he testified before his state\u2019s Joint House and Senate  Committee on several minority issues, including racial harassment in  schools and discrimination in hiring. Another advisory committee chair  wrote that following a report the committee issued on hiring practices and  appointments to state commissions and boards, the governor committed  to improving state practices and asked the committee for assistance in  identifying minorities to serve on state boards and commissions.", "State advisory committee members also reported being well connected to  their local communities because of their professions. Those we  interviewed included a state legislator, several university professors and  lawyers, a director of a county Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission office, the administrator of the regional office of a federal  agency, and a church minister\u2014roles that allowed them to influence civil  rights issues in their communities.

Only 13 state advisory committees currently  have approved charters as of February 2006, and their charters are due to  expire late in 2006. (See table 1.)", "The primary reason for the current delays in renewing the state advisory  committees\u2019 charters is that the Commission recently initiated significant  changes in the criteria for membership in the state advisory committees. In  addition, the Commission chose to cancel pending applications for  renewal until members could be chosen to serve on the rechartered  committees that reflect the new membership criteria, further delaying the  process of establishing active new charters for the committees. The new  membership criteria were first proposed as a regulatory change in  November 2005. As of February 2006, one portion of the criteria had been  incorporated in a new regulation for the Commission; the remaining  criteria had not been finalized.", "The proposed new membership criteria are substantially different from the  previous criteria and could result in major changes in state advisory  committee membership. First, the Commission\u2019s new policy requiring  nondiscrimination in the selection of committee members was published  in February 2006 as a new regulation. It supersedes the Commission\u2019s  previous regulation requiring the membership of each state advisory  committee to reflect and be representative of the state\u2019s population. It also  replaced a 1990 administrative policy that required minority group  membership to be no less than 40 percent or more than 65 percent of the  state advisory committee. Secondly, the proposed new criteria would  require the Commission to consider selecting members with more  academic technical skills, such as knowledge of law and statistical  analysis, instead of having general skills and a diversity of experience and  knowledge from business, labor, and other perspectives. Finally, the  proposed new criteria would require each advisory committee to include  \u201cmembers of both political parties.\u201d If adopted, this will replace the  previous regulation requiring the committees to reflect the political  affiliation proportional to the demographics. In addition, the criteria do  not refer to members who are politically independent, although  independents currently make up about one-quarter of the committees\u2019  membership. See table 2 for a comparison of the previous and proposed  new criteria.", "The proposed new criteria require both political parties to be represented,  and FACA requires that federal advisory membership be fairly balanced in  terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be  performed. However, it is not yet clear how the Commission intends to  achieve this balance. According to the Staff Director, having one person of  a minority party on an 11-member state advisory committee would meet a  new criterion for each committee to have members of both political  parties.", "According to the Commission\u2019s Chair, the new membership criteria were  developed in order to, among other things, move away from racially and  ethnically based representation toward greater diversity in expertise and  ideas. For example, according to the Staff Director, the proposed new  membership criteria are intended to increase the diversity of skills among  committee members. One reason for this is that because of the shortage of  staff in the regional offices, the Commission is considering having state  advisory committee members contribute to the writing of reports  themselves, a course of action that, in the view of the Staff Director, would  require committee members to have the expertise needed for such an  undertaking. In addition, according to the Chair, limiting members\u2019 terms  to 10 years or five 2-year terms will promote the selection of more new  members with new ideas.", "The Commission received several objections to its decision to suspend the  charter approval process until the membership criteria had been finalized.  In July 2005, the chairs of 32 state advisory committees sent a letter to the  Commission Chair requesting that pending charter applications be  approved and stating that there was no justification for not approving  charters pending policy formulation. During a Commission meeting in  August 2005, at which this issue was raised, one Commissioner made a  similar proposal, adding that this would also allow the Commissioners  more time to consider whether to change the membership criteria.

Until recently, when  we questioned the Commission about the current delays in approving the  committees\u2019 charters, we found that state advisory committees in several  states have routinely continued their work and meetings. For example,  representatives of two advisory committees told us that they generally  operate normally, except for the actual publishing of reports, when they  do not have an approved charter.

In 1991, the Commission opened 3 additional regional  offices, bringing the total up to 6 offices, but the number of staff in each  office continued to decline. During the most recent 5-year period, as the  agency\u2019s budget remained flat, these declines continued, with staff  decreasing from 19 staff in 2000 to 9 in 2006. Currently, each of the   6 regional offices has only 1 or 2 professional staff\u2014a total of 9 as of  January 2006\u2014and each regional office supports several state advisory  committees, ranging from 6 to 14 committees for each office.

The agency\u2019s  annual appropriation has remained at about $9 million since 1995,  resulting in several cost reduction measures throughout the agency.

In 1986, in response to concerns about delays in the issuance of  state advisory committee reports, among other things, Congress held  hearings on the subject.

As of January 2006, the state advisory committees  had not been involved in developing the agency\u2019s draft strategic plan,  although they are key stakeholders in accomplishing the Commission\u2019s  goals. The first draft of the strategic plan that was submitted for  stakeholder review in October 2005 scarcely mentioned the role of the  state advisory committees, despite their statutory role or their many  contributions to the Commission\u2019s work over time. The congressional staff  who reviewed the draft plan asked the Commission to include more  information on the role of the state advisory committees in the plan,  among other comments. Although the Commission obtained the  perspectives of two regional directors who participated in a working  group on the strategic plan, the Commission did not solicit the views of  state advisory committee members. According to the Staff Director, the  Commission is now working to include goals that incorporate the role of  the state advisory committees in its strategic plan, including obtaining the  views of the state advisory committees on the Commission\u2019s goals and  their role in accomplishing these goals. In February 2006, the Staff  Director solicited the input of the state advisory committees in identifying  possible topics for the Commission\u2019s 2008 statutory report.", "The Commission has also not generally obtained the views of the state  advisory committees when making organizational changes that directly  affect the committees. For example, when the Staff Director proposed in  April 2005 to close two regional offices in fiscal year 2006 as part of a  larger plan to reduce agency expenses, the Commissioners approved the  proposed closures without obtaining any input from the state advisory  committees on how closures would affect their ability to conduct their  work.

After receiving comments on the Commission\u2019s failure to  consult with the state advisory committees from several members of  Congress, outside civil rights organizations, and others, the Staff Director  held a meeting by conference call with all of the regional directors to  discuss the proposed membership criteria and proposed office closures.  However, in January 2006, the Staff Director reported that he had sought  the perspectives of state advisory committee members in the 13 states  with active charters on whether to ask Congress to extend the terms of the  charters and the chairs to 4 years instead of the current 2 years. The  Commission received comments on the proposed request from about half  of the active committees.

For example, when the Staff  Director and Commissioners agreed to close two of the regional offices,  they did not inform the regional directors, who are the liaisons to the state  advisory committees, until 3 days later, according a regional director.  Instead, two regional directors learned about the decision from sources  outside the Commission, including the local newspaper. In addition, only  22 percent of state committee chairs who responded to our survey  reported that they were satisfied with the quality of their communication  with the national office.

More  specifically, members told us that they thought the Commission could  make more effective and efficient use of the advisory committees if they  knew what issues the Commission saw as priorities and how they could  contribute to the Commission\u2019s vision and goals. For example, several  state advisory committee members said they thought joint reports  prepared by more than one committee would be more efficient and allow  the Commission to obtain more comprehensive views on a particular  issue. In our survey, respondents identified several civil rights issues they  had in common, such as housing, education, and employment for  immigrants and various elements of the justice system.", "The Commission has not provided for independent oversight of its policies  and practices for state advisory committees, despite the long-standing  nature of many of the issues we identified regarding the Commission\u2019s  lack of consultation and communication with the state advisory  committees, delays in renewing charter applications, and lack of  timeliness and other issues in approving state advisory committee reports.

It is therefore important for the  Commission\u2019s credibility that its Commissioners and Staff Director base  their work on sound criteria and that the Commission\u2019s reports and other  products include varying perspectives so as to be recognized as fair and  impartial. The Commission\u2019s briefings and hearings also run the risk of  appearing biased, rather than objective, in the absence of a policy for  identifying and selecting speakers and witnesses who can bring to bear a  range of perspectives and expertise. Furthermore, by using an external  reviewer for its reports without having a process for considering the use of  such reviewers, the Commission risks introducing one-sided commentary  on its products and is not availing itself of an important avenue for helping  to ensure the objectivity of its analyses.

These  include continued delays in renewing charters as well as declines in  regional staff and other forms of support for the state advisory  committees. The Commission\u2019s budgeting practices make it difficult to  gauge the level of funding provided to the committees in order to use this  information to analyze trends, such as the comparison of funding for  reports for the national office versus the advisory committees and to make  decisions about priorities. Furthermore, the potential impact and  usefulness of state advisory committee reports can be significantly  reduced if they are not reviewed and issued speedily or if the  Commission\u2019s review policies constrain the reports\u2019 direction or findings.  The Commission also cuts the line of communication on important civil  rights issues from the local level to the national level if it does not seek the  perspectives of state advisory committees in planning its work,  determining long-term goals and strategies, or making organizational  decisions that directly affect the committees. However, despite the long- standing nature of many of these issues, the Commission has not obtained  independent oversight by an Inspector General of its policies and practices  for state advisory committees.

The Commissioners stated that the report does not acknowledge the  significant changes that have taken place at the agency and its efforts  at reform. To the contrary, the report acknowledged numerous  changes to the Commission\u2019s reporting and state advisory committee  policies by the current leadership. For example, we noted that, after  the arrival of new leadership, the Commission began to reevaluate its  policies on product development and state advisory committee matters  and, in discussing the Commission\u2019s quality assurance policies for its  products, we reported on the increased involvement of the  Commissioners in product development, describing it as a \u201csignificant  improvement over previous Commission policy.\u201d In addition, we  devoted a considerable portion of two appendixes to the Commission\u2019s  process for developing and approving national and state advisory  committee products, including policy changes. With regard to the state  advisory committees, we similarly analyzed the Commission\u2019s policy  changes to the committees\u2019 membership criteria and publication of  state advisory committee reports.   2.  The Commissioners asserted that it was misleading for us to criticize  the Commission\u2019s reports because they lack objectivity. This view  appears to emanate from a misunderstanding of our audit objectives. It  was not within the scope of our study to analyze the objectivity of the  Commission\u2019s reports. As noted in our report, our purpose was to  analyze the Commission\u2019s policies for ensuring the quality of its  reports and other products. When we discussed specific Commission  reports or briefings, we did so to illustrate issues that arose when the  Commission did not have written policies, not to assess the content of  individual reports. We observed that the Commission lacks several  policies for its product development that could help ensure the  objectivity of its reports and briefings. We focused especially on  policies that other organizations, such as the National Academies, the  Congressional Budget Office, and GAO, consider important to ensuring  the quality of their reports and other products.  3.  Our evaluation focused on assessing the adequacy of the Commission\u2019s  policies and the role of the state advisory committees. Our assessment  was not contingent upon obtaining the views of every Commissioner  about these policies or the committees\u2019 role. Therefore, we disagree  with the Commissioners\u2019 assertion that, because we did not interview  all of the Commissioners, the report is biased in its assumptions and  conclusions.    4.  The Commissioners stated that we did not define the term \u201cobjectivity\u201d  in criticizing the Commission\u2019s work. We added a definition of  objectivity to our report.   5.  We disagree with the Commissioner\u2019s statements regarding our review  of the Commission\u2019s statutory reports. First, the scope of our report  did not include a review of the pending 2006 report on the  reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Second, in discussing the  2005 statutory report on Adarand, we noted that the project was  originally approved in 2003 under the previous leadership. However,  we also noted that the current leadership had a significant hand in  revising the direction of the research questions that were sent to  federal agencies to obtain information for the report. The current  Commission also approved an outline for the Adarand report and had  several opportunities to comment on the draft report. Furthermore,  contrary to the Commissioners\u2019 statement, the current Commission  proposed and approved the October 2005 briefing on the Voting Rights  Act, not the previous leadership. This briefing was the subject of our  discussion on the Commission\u2019s speaker selection policies. In  appendix V of our report, we referred to, but did not otherwise discuss,  the Commission\u2019s pending 2006 statutory report on the Voting Rights  Act.   6.  Our report acknowledges the new policy on the Commissioners\u2019 role in  reviewing state advisory committee reports and publication  requirements that was approved in February 2006. We added a note to  our report acknowledging that the Commission will be reviewing its  project approval procedures for state advisory committee products as  it did previously for national office products.   7.  As noted earlier, we did not review the content of either national office  reports or individual state advisory committee reports to assess their  quality. However, if the Commissioners have major concerns about the  quality of the state advisory committee reports, they should take a  hard look at the committees\u2019 adherence to the Commission\u2019s quality  assurance policies for these reports.   8.  In our report, we did not state that the process for the state advisory  committees\u2019 operations should become the model for the national  office. However, we did examine the Commission\u2019s policies for  ensuring the quality of its products and found that the Commission has  some policies governing the committees\u2019 work that are more  comprehensive than those for national office products.  9.  Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with the content or  quality of the chapters and other material that were removed from the  draft Adarand report, we continue to believe that the manner in which  they were removed is of concern. For example, although the current  Commission voted to approve a report outline in April 2005 that  reflected a range of perspectives, the removal of several sections of the  draft report shifted the balance towards one perspective. In addition,  there was no documentation of the basis for this decision. Afterwards,  two Commissioners said that they were unaware of the changes until  after the decision had been made, and one of them abstained during  the Commission\u2019s final vote because he objected to how these changes  had been made, even though he said that he agreed with the content of  the report.   10. We disagree with the Commissioners\u2019 assertion that its new procedural  policies for briefings will necessarily provide balance and a variety of  perspectives to its briefing panels. The new policy requires the  Commissioners to approve briefing topics and panel of speakers at  least one month in advance of the briefing. However, as we reported,  this new policy does not require that briefing panels be balanced or  include a variety of perspectives.   11. In their comments, the Commissioners stated that we criticized the  inclusion of political parties in the membership criteria for state  advisory committee members, but this is incorrect. In our report, we  described the previous and proposed membership criteria, both of  which included members\u2019 political affiliation. Because the proposed  criteria call for each committee to have members of \u201cboth\u201d political  parties, we also expressed uncertainty about how the Commission  would consider candidates who are politically independent and how it  would ensure balance in the points of view represented, as required  under FACA.  12. According to the Commissioners, our report repeatedly refers to the  state advisory committees as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the Commission.  This description of the state advisory committees\u2019 role is not our term.  Rather it appears in the Commission\u2019s State Advisory Committee  Handbook and in the Commission\u2019s  October 2005 and December 2005  draft strategic plans developed under the current leadership.    13. The Commissioners also stated that our finding that the Commission  did not include the state advisory committee members in its strategic  planning process was a \u201cludicrous and unwarranted attack.\u201d We  disagree with this characterization. Our recommendation is intended  to provide a constructive suggestion for improving the Commission\u2019s  strategic planning process. At the time of our review, Commission  officials told us and the staff of the congressional committees that  provide oversight of the Commission that they did not solicit the input  of the state advisory committee members in developing the draft  strategic plan. In addition, our report recognized that the draft  strategic plan had not been completed.

Editorial review: The purpose of this review is to determine the  adequacy and accuracy of the substantive information in the draft  document, according to the Administrative Manual. This includes  conceptual soundness, adherence to Commission policy, quality of  research, argumentation, and documentation of major points.  However, Commission officials we interviewed generally agreed that  the editorial board review more often focused on issues such as  grammatical correctness, inconsistencies, and clarity, rather than on  substantive issues such as the adequacy of evidence. The Staff Director  appoints the members of the editorial review, usually consisting of  three staff members. According to the Staff Director, editorial  reviewers should be able to provide a fresh perspective, be familiar  with the Commission\u2019s standards and style manual, have strong  editorial and writing skills, and should not work in the same office that  wrote the draft product.  2.

It is performed by the Office of General Counsel concurrently  with the legal sufficiency review. Although agencies typically require  or have legal sufficiency reviews for their products, it is unusual for an  agency to also review its products for their potential to defame or  degrade individual persons.  4.

However, until May 2005, the Commissioners had limited involvement in  the development of its products: Essentially, Commissioners could  approve proposals and design summaries at the beginning and approve  final reports at the end. The Commissioners\u2019 limited role was a source of  considerable concern to some Commissioners, as reported in our 2003  study. This concern led to our recommendation that the Commission  provide for increased involvement of the Commissioners in planning and  implementation.", "In May 2005, the Commission made significant changes to its quality  assurance policies by increasing Commissioners\u2019 involvement in the  development of its national office products. Under these new policies,  Commissioners are required to review and approve Commission products  at five key stages: (1) proposal and concept paper development,   (2) background research and outline development, (3) discovery, (4) draft  report, and (5) final report stages. The Commissioners\u2019 review and  approval at three of these stages are new\u2014background research and  outline development, discovery, and draft report stages\u2014and provide  Commissioners with considerably greater opportunities to comment on  and guide the direction of Commission products than previously.

The  new policies were formally incorporated into the Commission\u2019s  administrative policy manual in January 2006. (See fig. 2.)", "In May, 2005, the Commission adopted additional quality assurance  policies for national office products that provide them with greater control  over the substance of draft products: First, Commissioners can now vote  to approve substantive changes to previously approved projects and may  reassess priorities if budgetary changes occur during the year. Second,  instead of having to vote on an entire draft of a final report, the  Commission may vote on sections, and only portions of the report that  receive a majority vote would become part of the final Commission  document.", "The Commission also agreed to add a policy formally allowing statements  of dissent.
