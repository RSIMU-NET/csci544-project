This condition requires that IRS use alternative methods to identify the amounts to be recorded as federal tax receivables on its financial statements. However, these methods thus far have not provided IRS with the capability to report accurate and supportable amounts for federal tax receivables.

To compensate for this, IRS runs computer programs against its masterfiles\u2014the only detailed record of taxpayer information it maintains\u2014to identify taxpayer accounts for which assessments or other debits exceed receipts received or other credits made to taxpayers\u2019 accounts. After these accounts\u2014unpaid assessments\u2014have been identified, IRS runs computer programs that utilize transaction and other codes within the masterfiles to separately classify these accounts as financial receivables or compliance assessments. Those accounts that are classified as financial receivables are then evaluated on a statistical basis by IRS to estimate what amount IRS ultimately believes it will collect on its receivables. The total amount deemed collectible by IRS, based on a projection of its statistical sample, is reported as federal tax receivables on its custodial Statement of Financial Position. The difference between the amount estimated to be collectible and the total amount identified as financial receivables is reported on the custodial Statement of Financial Position as an allowance for doubtful accounts.", "In our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1995 financial statements, we reported that IRS was unsuccessful in deriving reliable receivables information for use in preparing the financial statements. We reported that errors we identified in the transaction and other coding of assessments within the masterfiles, coupled with mistakes IRS made in performing the statistical procedures, resulted in IRS\u2019 sampling results being unreliable for purposes of projecting both the gross and net receivable amounts for financial reporting.", "For our fiscal year 1996 audit, we again reviewed IRS\u2019 process for extracting and classifying taxpayer assessments into financial receivables and compliance assessments. We also tested samples of assessments classified by IRS as both financial receivables and compliance assessments to determine whether IRS\u2019 classifications were appropriate. To test for proper classification, we attempted to review supporting documents in taxpayer files, such as tax returns, receipt deposits, correspondence between the taxpayer and IRS, and other pertinent information.", "We found that IRS could not locate sufficient supporting documentation (such as tax returns and installment agreements) for us to determine whether IRS had properly classified its inventory of unpaid assessments as either federal tax receivables or compliance assessments. Thus, we were unable to determine whether IRS had appropriately recognized federal tax receivables on the Statement of Financial Position.", "IRS officials stated that the missing documents had either been destroyed based on the agency\u2019s record retention policies or simply could not be located. The lack of a detailed listing, or subsidiary ledger, for receivables, coupled with IRS not readily maintaining supporting documents on outstanding accounts receivable, increases the risk that material amounts may be inappropriately included or excluded from the financial statements. Additionally, IRS\u2019 not maintaining adequate documentation, in many cases, to support the underlying assessments, could affect IRS\u2019 ability to pursue collection from taxpayers on amounts owed, resulting in lost tax revenue, including interest and penalties, to the government.", "In an effort to address some of the concerns noted above, IRS is continuing to review all individual assessments in excess of $10 million identified through its computer programs as financial receivables and compliance assessments to ensure their proper classification. Additionally, IRS is continuing to refine its efforts to more accurately classify its unpaid assessments inventory through various enhancements to the computer programs it uses to classify these assessments. As part of a larger and long-term effort to modernize its systems, IRS is also identifying and refining the business and system requirements necessary to assess the status of its unpaid assessments and manage its receivables.", "IRS\u2019 efforts are consistent with our recommendations from prior years\u2019 audits that IRS take steps to ensure that (1) in the long-term, tax system modernization efforts provide for a mechanism to enable IRS to readily identify and routinely track and report on the status of federal tax receivables and (2) in the short-term, continue to identify ways to improve the accuracy of receivables reporting through further enhancements to its computer programs and detailed reviews of taxpayer accounts.

For fiscal year 1995, we reported that IRS had attempted to extract taxpayer information from its masterfiles to support the amounts it reported as revenues on the fiscal year 1995 Custodial Financial Statements. We reported that, while IRS extracted taxpayer information from its masterfiles, it could not adequately reconcile this information to its general ledger and the Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service\u2019s (FMS) records.", "For fiscal year 1996, IRS again extracted detailed taxpayer information from its masterfiles to derive the reported amounts for revenue collections and refunds by tax types on the Custodial Financial Statements. IRS then performed reconciliations between the information used to derive the financial statements and (1) summary amounts recorded in its general ledger and (2) amounts reported for tax revenues collected and refunds paid by FMS. We found that, for fiscal year 1996, IRS\u2019 overall reconciliation between its masterfile, general ledger, and amounts reported by FMS, in total, were materially the same. Based on this, and on our detailed tests of revenue collection and refund transactions, we were able to determine that the total Net Collections of Federal Revenue as reported on the fiscal year 1996 Statement of Custodial Activity was fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.", "However, we were unable to determine whether revenue collection and refund amounts reported by tax types on the financial statements were properly classified. The primary reasons we were unable to make this determination were because (1) IRS could not always provide documentation to support certain transactions and (2) its record retention policies and practices resulted in the destruction of other key documents.

Also, in April 1997 we reported that IRS continues to have serious weaknesses in the controls used to safeguard IRS computer systems, facilities and taxpayer data. Our review of controls, done to support our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1996 financial statements, found that such controls continued to be ineffective. Many issues we previously identified at five IRS sites remained unresolved at the completion of our review of IRS computer security controls in May 1997. These include serious weaknesses in the areas of (1) physical security, (2) logical security, (3) data communications management, (4) risk analysis, (5) quality assurance, (6) internal audit and security, (7) security awareness, and (8) contingency planning. As a result, we consider computer security as a material weakness because IRS data or programs could be added, altered, or deleted and not detected in a timely manner.", "Further, we identified examples of weaknesses in our current review that allowed for unauthorized access and modification to computer resources, including computer programs and data. The more significant weaknesses include the following:", "Computer support personnel were granted excessive access to read or change sensitive system files or resources. This access gave them the ability to change, alter, or delete taxpayer data and associated programs. Access to such data files, which include the basic operating system software, should be limited to the minimum number of computer support personnel needed for maintenance and review. For example, at one facility, 88 computer support personnel had the ability to implement programs not controlled by the security software.", "Computer support personnel were granted inappropriate access, including the ability to both obtain access to data or programs and alter the automated audit trail that identifies who entered or changed data. The inherent risk in these privileges is that data or programs can be added, modified, or deleted and the related audit trail masked or deleted.", "Computer support personnel access to system resources was not adequately monitored. Monitoring the access activities of employees, especially those who have the ability to alter sensitive programs and data, can help identify any significant problems and deter employees from inappropriate and unauthorized activities. IRS systems record user and system activity in automated audit logs. However, when thousands of transactions are involved, reviews cannot be effective unless reports are available to managers that highlight activity that is unusual or suspicious so that such activity can be investigated. Proper supervision of employee actions, especially those having broad access privileges, requires routine assurance concerning the propriety of their activities. IRS sites had incomplete disaster recovery plans. The absence of a comprehensive, current plan increases the likelihood that IRS would not be able to restore the operations on a timely basis in the event of a local disaster and increases the risk of unavailability of the computerized information systems at IRS.", "At one site, IRS allowed improper access to the commands used to authorize and generate taxpayer refund checks. Having access to commands would allow an individual to process a refund payment without review and approval by a second party. In addition, although there were methods available for reviewing such access, there were no monitoring nor any review processes in place to detect improper refund transactions. This increases the likelihood that a person with such privileges could perform unauthorized refund activities.

As we have reported in prior audits, IRS based its certifications of excise tax distributions to specific trust funds on the assessed amount, or amount owed, as reflected on the tax returns filed by taxpayers. This is because IRS does not require taxpayers to provide the necessary information at the time taxes are collected to certify the distributions on the basis of amounts actually collected. By law, distributions of excise taxes to specific trust funds are to be based on actual collections.", "IRS has studied various options to enable it to make final certifications of amounts distributed based on actual collections and to develop the underlying information needed to support such distributions.

IRS officials based that view on their interpretation of auditing standards. In referring to these standards, IRS stated that internal control weaknesses do not preclude rendering an opinion on the financial statements since the assessment of internal controls is performed to determine the extent of reliance that can be placed on internal controls and hence the nature, timing, and extent of substantive testing required.", "While this statement is conceptually correct, the nature of one of the significant internal control weaknesses discussed in this report\u2014specifically the lack of supporting documentation\u2014prevented us from substantiating significant line items on IRS\u2019 financial statements. In planning the fiscal year 1996 audit, we had to consider the weak internal control environment at IRS and, in fact, designed our audit procedures based on the assumption that we could not rely on internal controls. This resulted in our having to increase the level of testing necessary to support our opinion. However, the lack of sufficient evidence to support (1) the validity of amounts included in its tax accounts receivable and (2) classifications of receipts and refunds by tax class precluded us from being able to opine on the financial statements taken as a whole. As discussed in this report, among the basic documents that IRS could not locate and, therefore, were not available to us were tax returns and other agreements which are typically generated or signed by the taxpayer. As a result, we were unable to verify the amounts reported in the financial statements for taxes receivable and receipts and refunds by tax class, which are material to the financial statements taken as a whole, and to report on IRS\u2019 compliance with laws and regulations. The existence of an audit trail to substantiate transactions is fundamental to good accounting practices, and appropriate documentation is necessary to permit audit assurance absent other means to validate these transactions. Further, while IRS believes it provided enough alternative supporting documentation for the majority of tax accounts receivable cases where it could not obtain supporting documentation, we considered the alternatives provided and found that they were unacceptable. Specifically, we found that the information that was generated from IRS systems could not be corroborated with sources external to IRS.", "While acknowledging that material internal control and system weaknesses related to tax accounts receivable existed, IRS disagreed that these weaknesses would impact its ability to effectively manage and routinely monitor the status of amounts owed by taxpayers or its ability to pursue collection. We disagree. As we reported in prior years, improved internal controls and systems would allow IRS to more effectively manage its tax accounts receivable.
