In addition, the act directs these programs to provide law enforcement officers with information about program recipients for whom there are outstanding warrants to assist in their apprehension. Actions taken to implement the act's fugitive felon provisions have varied substantially by program. In implementing provisions to prohibit benefits to fugitive felons, all but housing assistance programs include, at a minimum, a question about fugitive felon status in their applications. SSI and some state Food Stamp and TANF programs also seek independent verification of fugitive felon status by using computer matching to compare arrest warrant and program recipient files. To date, 110,000 beneficiaries have been identified as fugitive felons and dropped from the SSI, Food Stamp, and TANF rolls, and many have been apprehended. Computerized file matching has been responsible for the identification of most of these fugitive felons. Aggressive implementation of the act's fugitive felon provisions poses a number of challenges for programs. First, centralized and complete national and statewide arrest warrant data for computer matching are not readily available. Second, because direct access to arrest warrants and criminal records is limited to law enforcement personnel, computer matching requires what many state TANF and Food Stamp officials view as a burdensome and complex negotiation process to obtain these records. Third, the absence of information and guidance about how to conduct file matching and overcome its logistical challenges has also hindered aggressive implementation of the law. Finally, there is evidence that individuals with outstanding warrants for felonies, or probation or parole violations, may continue to collect benefits because there may be differences in the interpretation of what constitutes a fugitive felon within the Food Stamp and TANF programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to concerns that individuals wanted in connection with a felony or violating terms of their parole or probation could receive benefits from programs for the needy, the Congress added provisions to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 that prohibit these individuals from receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Food Stamp benefits, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and make fugitive felon status grounds for the termination of tenancy in federal housing assistance programs.

Because Food Stamp and TANF programs are administered at the state or county level, we conducted a telephone survey of state TANF and food stamp officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to learn how they were implementing the provisions and the results of these efforts. We also conducted an e-mail survey of those state programs that do not screen their rolls for fugitive felons by conducting computerized file matches. Because we could find no data on the extent to which fugitive felons participate in federal housing programs, we compared Ohio and Tennessee arrest warrant records as of January 2002 with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data on federally subsidized housing tenants to determine the number nationwide who may have been wanted for arrest from January 2001 through January 2002 in those two states. We chose Ohio and Tennessee because their warrant files were readily available from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and because they had prior experience in matching warrant records with SSI, Food Stamp, and TANF recipient files. We also visited with officials in Delaware\u2019s Department of Health and Social Services, fraud unit, as well as law enforcement officials from that state to discuss Delaware\u2019s initiatives for implementing PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions in TANF and Food Stamp programs.

Through the SSI program, SSA oversees the provision of monthly cash payments to people who are blind, disabled, or age 65 or older and have limited income and resources. HHS oversees the TANF program, which provides cash assistance and other work-related services to needy individuals. USDA oversees the Food Stamp Program, which helps low-income individuals purchase food. HUD provides housing assistance to low-income families, including the elderly and persons with disabilities. PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions apply to eligibility for HUD\u2019s public housing program and to most Section 8 programs. The public housing program provides housing units whose operation, maintenance, and modernization is subsidized with federal funds. Section 8 programs provide needy families with rental assistance through vouchers that can be used in privately owned housing or by occupying government-subsidized housing units.", "While SSA directly administers the SSI program nationwide, the Food Stamp and TANF programs are generally administered at the state or local level, albeit with federal money in the case of the Food Stamp Program, and a combination of federal and state funds in the case of TANF. Depending on the state, the same staff at local offices may determine eligibility and benefit levels for both Food Stamp and TANF programs. HUD relies on local public housing agencies to administer its public housing and Section 8 programs. Public housing agencies manage and operate local public housing units and enforce tenant compliance with the lease. Low-income individuals and families often participate in more than one of the above public programs.", "The federal agencies that oversee these programs work with their OIG to meet their responsibility to ensure program integrity. In addition to helping to identify fraud, waste, and abuse in these programs, the OIGs participate in federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies\u2019 pursuit and apprehension of individuals wanted for criminal offenses, including felonies. State governments can also play a role in ensuring the integrity of federal programs, particularly TANF and Food Stamp because states or counties administer them. The governments do so through fraud units in state human services departments and state inspectors or auditors general. To illustrate the size of these programs and their potential for fraud, waste, and abuse, table 1 compares the total benefits paid, erroneous payments, and caseload size reported by federal agencies in a single year by program.", "Under PRWORA, the focus of the language affecting fugitive felons in each programs\u2019 authorizing language differs somewhat. The use of federal funds by fugitive felons is specifically prohibited in the SSI, TANF, and Food Stamp programs. For the SSI and Food Stamp programs, individuals identified as fugitive felons are ineligible for benefits for any period in which they are considered to be a fugitive felon, or probation or parole violator. For the TANF program, states are prohibited from using any portion of their federal funding to assist any individual considered to be a fugitive felon. For public housing and Section 8 programs, PRWORA states that fugitive felon and probation or parole violation status \u201c\u2026shall be cause for immediate termination of the tenancy\u2026.\u201d", "PRWORA\u2019s provisions also require the SSI, Food Stamp, and housing assistance programs to disclose information about felons to law enforcement.

The officer must furnish the name of the recipient, and other identifying information to establish the unique identity of the recipient, and also attest that the request is made in conjunction with the officer\u2019s official duties.

The agency has left the implementation of this provision up to the individual public housing agencies, leaving it to them to identify fugitive felons. HUD regulations give public housing agencies and other landlords the option to evict those identified as fugitive felons, but do not require them to do so. However, HUD has not determined the extent to which public housing agencies have implemented the fugitive felon provisions in accordance with its regulations.

The results from our own comparison of arrest warrant from just two states and the HUD nationwide tenant database suggest that many fugitives in housing assistance programs go unidentified. Total cost savings to date are hard to ascertain, however, in part, because not all state Food Stamp and TANF programs keep records or make such calculations. SSA\u2019s OIG has reported 5-year cumulative savings of more than $81 million in overpayments and $133 million in projected future savings from the SSI recipients identified as fugitive felons. Since passage of PRWORA, law enforcement officials also have been making thousands of requests for program information to help them apprehend fugitive felons, either for specific case information or for file matches.

Also, the more comprehensive the warrant database drawn from, the higher the yield. SSA\u2019s access to the NCIC database together with its array of agreements with states and municipalities has given the agency a large database of warrants against which to compare its own national recipient file.

They pointed out a number of questions that need to be addressed when deciding whether or not to deny benefits to those with arrest warrants.  For example, should individuals with outstanding warrants be considered fugitive felons if they are not aware of the warrants, or if law enforcement agencies have not acted on the warrants within a certain timeframe?  HHS officials also indicated that, based on the language in the law, it is not clear whether the Congress intended to deny benefits when law enforcement officials lack the resources, jail space, or court time to execute arrest warrants.

For example, one state program official indicated that the existence of a warrant, alone, was not proof that a recipient was fleeing. Consequently, recipients in that state who were fugitive felons were reportedly not removed from the benefit rolls unless they were arrested. An official from another state further questioned whether those who are not aware of warrants for their arrest could be considered fleeing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["There has been some progress in implementing the fugitive felon provisions of PRWORA. Where there has been leadership from program officials, OIGs or state auditors, large numbers of fugitive felons have been removed from the rolls and apprehended, mostly through the use of matching. However, the law has not been implemented aggressively in all programs. Most strikingly, HUD has done little to ensure that fugitive felons do not receive housing assistance. This could be because the law, as it applies to housing assistance programs, states that fugitive felon status is only grounds for termination of tenancy and not that fugitive felons are ineligible for housing assistance. Therefore, according to HUD officials, while public housing agencies and landlords have the authority to evict fugitive felons, they are not required to do so. Furthermore, even though HUD maintains its own national database of tenants, it has made no attempt to match it with information from centralized arrest warrant databases such as the NCIC. Such matching, even when done on a limited basis, would be an effective way to identify potentially large numbers of fugitive felons in federal housing assistance programs that landlords have the authority to evict.", "As demonstrated in SSI and a few state TANF and Food Stamp programs, matching recipient and arrest warrant data can be an effective tool for implementing the fugitive felon provisions. However, expanding the use of matching is not an easy task. In this respect, state program officials indicated that they could benefit from the experience of others. Information about how other programs and states have obtained access to and used centralized arrest warrant data, collaborated with law enforcement agencies, and conducted matching could help state TANF and Food Stamp programs plan and develop their own matching procedures.", "Increased use of computer matching alone will not ensure that the law is fully implemented in state TANF and Food Stamp programs. The law\u2019s overall effectiveness could be seriously undermined if it is not applied consistently, and there appears to be some question about what constitutes a fugitive felon within TANF and Food Stamp programs. Without knowing how state programs are defining fugitive felons, there is no way for HHS or USDA to determine if the law is being applied consistently and, if not, how to ensure that it is.", "Finally, neither HHS nor HUD has issued instructions on the circumstances under which information about benefit recipients is to be released to law enforcement agencies when they request it. As a result, state TANF programs, and HUD public housing agencies and other landlords in this highly decentralized system, may be implementing this provision inconsistently.  As a result, law enforcement agencies may not be receiving the information they request and legally have access to."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["The Congress should consider amending the Housing Act of 1937 to make fugitive felons ineligible for federal housing assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better implement PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions, we recommend that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development test the feasibility and effectiveness of routinely matching its nationwide tenant file with the NCIC arrest warrant database as a means of identifying tenants in housing assistance programs nationwide who are fugitive felons and subject to eviction and issue guidance on the circumstances under which federal housing programs are required to provide information about residents in federally subsidized housing to law enforcement agencies.", "To oversee and better implement these provisions in the TANF program, we recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human Services   encourage states to test the feasibility and effectiveness of routinely matching TANF applicant and recipient records with arrest warrants by providing them with information on the matching activities of other state TANF programs and their results and on accessing available arrest warrant databases such as NCIC;   monitor states\u2019 computerized matching efforts to identify fugitive felons and their results;   determine what criteria state TANF programs are using to remove recipients wanted for felonies or probation or parole violations from the TANF rolls, and if these criteria differ across states, provide TANF programs with clear guidance on the circumstances under which benefits to fugitive felons should be terminated; and issue guidance on the circumstances under which TANF programs are required to provide information about TANF recipients to law enforcement agencies.", "To oversee and ensure better implement these provisions in the Food Stamp program, we recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture   encourage states to test the feasibility and effectiveness of routinely matching Food Stamp applicant and recipient records with arrest warrants by providing them with information on the matching activities of other state Food Stamp programs and their results and on accessing available arrest warrant databases such as NCIC;   monitor states\u2019 computerized matching efforts to identify fugitive felons and their results; and   determine what criteria state Food Stamp programs are using to remove recipients wanted for felonies, or probation or parole violations from the Food Stamp rolls and, if these criteria differ across states, provide Food Stamp programs with clear guidance on the circumstances under which benefits to fugitive felons should be terminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration for Children and Families, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development provided comments on our report.

Officials from the Social Security Administration reviewed the report and had no comments. (See app. VIII.)", "In general, FNS officials agreed with our recommendations, but voiced concern that the report needed to more fully discuss the legal and procedural complexities involved in implementing the fugitive felon provisions.  They said that because what constitutes a fugitive under PRWORA is open to interpretation, eligibility criteria for benefits may vary within and across programs. They indicated their intention to re-evaluate their current definition, which defines fugitives as only those who are aware that warrants have been issued for their arrest. Nevertheless, they noted that there may be room for flexibility in how state agencies respond to the individual circumstances of fugitive felons, just as states have flexibility when enforcing certain other Food Stamp program requirements.", "FNS officials cautioned against viewing the implementation of PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions outside the context of a program\u2019s administrative structure and its quality assurance procedures and standards. They noted, for example, that the Food Stamp program is administered by the states, making it more difficult to ensure uniform implementation of the law than in the SSI program, where control is centralized at the federal level.", "FNS officials noted that, in order to enhance compliance with the law in the Food Stamp program, they recently obtained information from SSA about its fugitive felon procedures and processes and were now working with their OIG to clarify issues related to fugitive felon ineligibility for food stamps.  They have also begun to plan pilot projects in several states of procedures that would allow law enforcement time to apprehend fugitive felons before state food stamp agencies take action on their eligibility. These projects will build due process protections into these procedures.", "ACF acknowledged that the report provided new and useful information on this topic.  However, it expressed concern that the report did not adequately portray the full significance of the challenges associated with implementation of the fugitive felon provisions.  In particular, ACF highlighted the challenges associated with defining a fleeing felon. Furthermore, ACF did not concur with our recommendations for a variety of reasons. It believed that implementing our recommendations would infringe on the authority and flexibility PRWORA gives states to establish their own TANF eligibility rules and procedures and calls for federal action not authorized under PRWORA. We believe that issuing guidance is permissible under PRWORA and can be done in a manner that allows for state flexibility. Guidance simply provides states with a means to make more reasoned judgments about the actions they choose to take.", "ACF further argued that neither the Office of management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) single state compliance audits, nor feedback it has received from state agencies have identified problems with the implementation of the fugitive felon provisions.  The absence of evidence of problems in either case, however, does not mean that problems do not exist, nor that the monitoring and guidance we recommend would not be useful. ACF also appears to have interpreted our recommendations for monitoring and encouraging computer matching more narrowly than intended.  We do not prescribe how ACF should accomplish these tasks.  Our recommendations would not require the creation of new data collection procedures or systems. The mechanisms that ACF and HHS\u2019s Office of Family Assistance have in place for communicating and interacting with state and local agencies could be used to effectively implement these recommendations within the limits PRWORA places on federal authority.", "ACF disagreed with the recommendation for national guidance describing the circumstances, under PRWORA, in which TANF programs should provide information to law enforcement agencies, noting that 44 state TANF agencies had already developed their own guidance. Our point remains that all state agencies should have established guidance. Furthermore, our review of selected states\u2019 guidance showed that it may not always be consistent with PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions. Consequently, we continue to believe that national guidance is justified.", "In its comments, HUD did not concur with our recommendation to test the feasibility and effectiveness of routinely matching its nationwide tenant file with NCIC arrest warrant data. HUD said that PRWORA does not require, nor does it give, the department the authority to conduct computer matching to screen for fugitive felons, and parole or probation violators. We disagree with HUD\u2019s assertion that it lacks the authority to conduct computer matching.  In our view, HUD does not need any specific statutory authority to conduct computer matching, but any matching it does conduct must comply with the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988. We also note that, even though HUD contended that it lacked the authority to computer match, it did agree to examine computer matching as a possible option for implementing the fugitive felon provisions.", "HUD did concur with our recommendation to issue guidance on the circumstances under which federal housing programs are required to provide information about residents to law enforcement agencies. HUD said that its Office of General Counsel was working with its Office of Public Housing and Multifamily Housing to determine the appropriate method (by notice or regulation) to implement PRWORA\u2019s requirement that public housing agencies provide law enforcement with information about tenants who are fugitive felons, or parole or probation violators. HUD also described other actions it was taking to better implement PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions.", "Finally, HUD expressed concern about our estimate of the savings that could result from matching its national tenant file with warrants from Ohio and Tennessee.

In our telephone survey, we collected data on the actions these programs had taken to implement the fugitive felon provisions in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. We also collected information on the extent to which law enforcement agencies have asked for or used beneficiary information from these programs to locate and apprehend fugitive felons and asked states for any estimates they had of the number of fugitive felons identified on the rolls and the amount of overpayments to these recipients.

We visited state officials in Delaware to gather information about their initiatives in the Food Stamp and TANF programs and issues surrounding their efforts to establishing a data matching process.", "To determine the extent to which fugitive felons may be receiving federal housing benefits, we conducted a one-time computer match using HUD\u2019s national data on housing tenants and arrest warrant data from Ohio and Tennessee. We chose these two states because their warrant files were readily available from SSA and because of their prior experience in matching warrant records with SSI, Food Stamps, and TANF recipient files. In addition, both states agreed to participate in our pilot. For computer matching, HUD provided us with national information from its database containing persons in public housing, persons receiving Section 8 tenant based assistance, and persons in the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program for the period January 2001 through January 2002.The Ohio and Tennessee warrant records were all current as of January 2002. SSA screened the warrant records for us through its automated Enumeration Verification System to verify the Social Security number (SSN) and other pertinent data provided by the law enforcement agency on the warrant matched with data from SSA\u2019s records. Using SSA guidelines, we screened the approximate 7.3 million tenant records and deleted records with invalid SSNs, that is numbers that SSA never issued. Also, if we found multiple persons using the same SSN, we removed their records. After the screening process, we computer-matched the SSNs of 7.1 million tenant records nationally with the numbers of 31,493 persons with fugitive felon warrants issued by Ohio and Tennessee. Our SSN comparisons identified 927 individual fugitive felons with one or more arrest warrants issued by Ohio or Tennessee who resided in public housing or Section 8 housing. As a final check, we compared the matched individual\u2019s name and date of birth from the warrant and tenant records and found minor inconsistencies which, in our opinion, would not change the results.", "To estimate cost savings, we analyzed agency data collected for a 1998 HUD report. The report showed data by state on the average annual per unit cost for each housing type. Using these data, we multiplied the number of resident fugitive felons by their applicable average annual per unit cost. If the leases on the housing units in which these 927 individuals lived had been terminated, we estimate that about $4.2 million annually in federal funds could have been made available to others who are eligible for, but could not find, public housing or Section 8 housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: PRWORA\u2019s Amendments to Authorizing Legislation of SSI, TANF, Food Stamp, and Housing Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Denial of benefits to fugitive felons and probation or parole violators Section 1611 of the SocialSection 408 of the Social Security ActSecurity Act", "paragraphs": ["In general. \u2013 A State to which a grant is made under section 403 of the Social Security Act shall not use any part of the grant to provide assistance to any individual who is (i) fleeing to avoid prosecution , or custody or confinement after conviction, under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, for a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or which, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of such State; or (ii) violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.

To implement the law, SSA has designed a single process that can accomplish both objectives. By matching arrest warrant information it receives from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies with its national SSI file, SSA is not only preventing fugitive felons from receiving SSI benefits, but also providing information about those in the SSI file it identifies as fugitive felons to law enforcement agencies so those individuals can be apprehended. SSA\u2019s matching process requires the active involvement of its OIG as well as the involvement and cooperation from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.", "In developing this process, SSA and its regional offices as well as its OIG have had to locate sources of arrest warrant information, assess the adequacy of arrest warrant information from each source, and negotiate agreements with the law enforcement authorities that maintain this information to release it to SSA. SSA began to explore the potential for conducting such computer matching when it approached the U.S. Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with proposals to match its SSI file with their arrest warrant information. The FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database is the nation\u2019s most extensive computerized criminal justice information system. NCIC consists of millions of records in several files, including files on wanted persons. As such, law enforcement agencies at the federal, state, and local levels may voluntarily submit their law enforcement information, including arrest warrants, to the FBI for inclusion in the NCIC database. SSA and its OIG secured memorandum of understanding with the FBI in March 2000 to provide SSA with monthly warrant information on fugitive felons from its NCIC Wanted Person File. Submission of information to the NCIC Wanted Person File is voluntary; however, so the file does not include complete arrest warrant data on fugitive felons, nationwide. According to SSA, as of June 2002, 17 states and the District of Columbia submit warrant data on all felonies and parole and probation violators to the FBI. Another 6 states report felonies but not parole and probation violators. However, because the other 27 states told SSA that the majority of their warrant information is not entered into the NCIC database, SSA has pursued negotiating agreement with these 27 states to obtain their warrant information. As of June 2002, 20 of the 27 states had agreed to provide SSA with their fugitive felon files. In exchange, once SSA has matched information from warrants with its SSI file, it provides the addresses of those in the file it finds with arrest warrants to the law enforcement agencies that have issued those warrants, so they can be apprehended. This matching and exchange process includes a number of SSA offices, such as its Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations, its regional and field offices, and its OIG. To successfully implement this process requires cooperation and commitment from the FBI\u2019s NCIC staff and its Information Technology Center (ITC), as well as law enforcement agencies at the state and local level. Figure 2 illustrates the steps in the process and those involved.", "Usually every month, SSA receives automated arrest warrant information from a variety of sources (step 1 in fig. 2). SSA had found that the information on arrest warrants is not always accurate. Fugitive felons frequently use aliases or provide law enforcement agencies with inaccurate Social Security numbers or dates of birth. In addition, SSA noted that law enforcement agencies tend to rely on fingerprints for identification because the Social Security numbers individuals report are often unreliable. As a result, law enforcement agencies do not always enter a Social Security number on a warrant. With the exception of the FBI, law enforcement agencies have agreed to provide SSA with arrest warrants that exclude misdemeanors, except in cases of probation or parole violations. To ensure that the misdemeanors are screened out, SSA\u2019s OIG checks the warrant files the first time SSA receives them to verify that the misdemeanors have been removed. However, the FBI did not agree to screen out misdemeanors from its NCIC Wanted Person File, so an initial step in SSA\u2019s process is to screen out warrants for misdemeanors in this file.", "Using its automated systems, SSA confirms the identity of the individual named on each warrant by comparing information on each warrant (including the individual\u2019s name, Social Security number, date of birth, and gender) with information on the automated records SSA maintains on individuals. If there is no SSA record for a name on a warrant, or if there is no Social Security number in SSA\u2019s records for the name on the warrant, the warrant is eliminated from the file (step 2). When the Social Security number on a warrant is incorrect, according to SSA\u2019s records, or is missing from the warrant, SSA uses its automated systems to attempt to locate the correct or missing Social Security number. Finally, SSA uses its automated systems to eliminate misdemeanors from the warrants it obtains from FBI\u2019s NCIC database, except in cases where the warrant is for a probation or parole violation (step 3). These steps help to ensure that SSI recipients are not mistakenly identified as fugitive felons.", "Next (step 4), SSA matches the remaining arrests warrant records with its computerized SSI file to identify SSI applicants and recipients named on warrants for felonies, or probation or parole violations. The results of this match are then forwarded to the SSA\u2019s OIG (Office of Investigations) (step 5), which establishes its own investigative case file for each individual named on a warrant (step 6). Then, to provide information to law enforcement authorities for the apprehension of fugitive felons, the OIG forwards information from SSI records about those named on warrants to the FBI\u2019s ITC (step 7). ITC screens out duplicate files and verifies the address and status of each individual named in the NCIC match warrant records to determine whether the warrant is active (step 8) and forwards these to the law enforcement agency that issued the warrant (step 9) so that it can locate and apprehend the individual (step 10). If warrants cannot be found in the NCIC database, ITC forwards them to the applicable law enforcement agency for verification and (step 9) so they can locate and apprehend the individual (step 10).", "After the appropriate law enforcement agency receives the addresses of individuals named on warrants, it has up to 60 days to notify ITC of the actions taken, if any, on the disposition of each individual\u2019s case (step 11). Next, ITC updates the case file on each individual named on the active warrant to reflect the actions taken by law enforcement (step 12). Then, ITC forwards the information on the actions taken, if any, by law enforcement on each case to the OIG (step 13). Once SSA\u2019s OIG has been notified or the 60 days have expired, whichever comes first, OIG reports those cases that require termination or recovery of SSI benefits to the appropriate SSA field office (step 14). The field office than takes whatever administrative actions, including due process safeguards, are required (step 15) and reports this back to SSA\u2019s OIG (step 16). The OIG uses the information provided by the SSA field office on the administrative actions taken to update the individual\u2019s case file (step 17).", "Although the matching process is complex and requires considerable cooperation and assistance from law enforcement authorities, that is, the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, state, county, and local law enforcement authorities as well as SSA\u2019s OIG, SSA believes that it is the most efficient and effective method for implementing both requirements of PRWORA\u2019s fugitive felon provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Number of SSI Recipients in Fiscal Year 2001 Arrested by Offense on Warrant", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Warrants Issued for Fugitive Felons Residing in Federally Funded Housing", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Offense on warrant Abscond while on probationDangerous drugs (possess, sell, smuggle opium, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, etc.) Larceny (shoplifting, postal, U.S. government, banking, etc.) Failure to appear Forgery and fraud (forgery of checks, counterfeiting, confidence game, swindle, mail fraud, etc.) Receiving stolen or damaged property Burglary Other obstructing Judiciary, Congress, Legislature, or a CommissionAssault Stolen vehicles Family offense (cruelty toward child or wife, bigamy, nonpayment of alimony, etc.) Abscond while on paroleRobbery Property crimes Sex offense Weapon offenses Kidnapping Traffic offenses Crimes against a person Juvenile offender Flight - escape Smuggling Other offenses (arson, material witness, morals-decency, obstructing police, public disorder, disorderly conduct, or sexual assault) Unknown offenses Total", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["The following people also made significant contributions to this report: William Hutchinson, Laura Luo, Susan Pachikara, Susan Bernstein, Jonathan Barker, Jay Smale, Vanessa Taylor, and Elsie Picyk."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
