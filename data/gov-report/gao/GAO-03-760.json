At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has initiatives under way to enhance information sharing, including the development of a homeland security blueprint, known as an \"enterprise architecture,\" to integrate sharing between federal, state, and city authorities. GAO surveyed federal, state, and city government officials on their perceptions of the effectiveness of the current information-sharing process. Numerous studies, testimonies, reports, and congressional commissions substantiate our survey results. Overall, no level of government perceived the process as effective, particularly when sharing information with federal agencies. Information on threats, methods, and techniques of terrorists is not routinely shared; and the information that is shared is not perceived as timely, accurate, or relevant. Moreover, federal officials have not yet established comprehensive processes and procedures to promote sharing. Federal respondents cited the inability of state and city officials to secure and protect classified information, the lack of federal security clearances, and a lack of integrated databases as restricting their ability to share information. DHS needs to strengthen efforts to improve the information sharing process so that the nation's ability to detect or prepare for attacks is strengthened."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Information\u2014its timely collection, thorough analysis, and appropriate  dissemination\u2014is critical to unifying the efforts of federal, state, and local  government agencies in preventing terrorist attacks.

To meet these objectives, we gathered information on national  planning efforts and obtained the perceptions of federal, state, and  city governments on how the current information-sharing process  was working.", "Specifically, we met with officials who were knowledgeable about  information sharing from federal, state, and city agencies and officials  from associations representing cities, police organizations, and research  groups. Our scope focused on the information-sharing process between  federal, state, and city governments. We did not include county  governments or the private sector (which owns more than 80 percent of  the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure), although we recognize that both have  important roles in homeland security. We also did not include the federal  government\u2019s critical infrastructure protection efforts, for which GAO  has made numerous recommendations over the last several years.  Additionally, most of our fieldwork was performed before the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) began operations in January 2003. Thus,  some of the federal agencies we worked with were still part of other  cabinet departments at the time of our research. Additionally, the  department\u2019s efforts to establish a homeland security blueprint\u2014referred  to as its \u201centerprise architecture\u201d\u2014are in the early stages of development.  We also reviewed relevant reports, testimonies, and position papers.", "Additionally, to supplement this analysis, we conducted a survey of  officials representing the federal intelligence community and law  enforcement agencies; state homeland security offices; all cities with a  population of 100,000 or more; and a sample of cities with a population  between 50,000 and 100,000, to obtain their perceptions about the current  information-sharing process. We did not independently validate that the  perceptions reported in our survey, such as the types of information that  respondents said they needed, accurately represent the condition of the  information-sharing process. However, our survey results typically  corroborated the condition of the current information-sharing process that  was described in our interviews with knowledgeable officials and in our  review of documents. Eighty percent, or 40 of the 50 state homeland  security advisors, completed the survey. Our overall response rate for the  survey was 50 percent and represents 284 government entities.

The  government must prevent and deter attacks on our homeland as well  as detect impending danger before attacks occur. Although it may be  impossible to detect, prevent, or deter every attack, steps can be taken to  reduce the risk posed by the threats to homeland security. Traditionally,  protecting the homeland against these threats was generally considered a  federal responsibility. To meet this responsibility, the federal government  gathers intelligence, which is often classified as national security  information. This information is protected and safeguarded to prevent  unauthorized access by requiring appropriate security clearances and a  \u201cneed to know.\u201d Generally, the federal government did not share national  level intelligence with states and cities, since they were not viewed as  having a significant role in preventing terrorism. Therefore, the federal  government did not generally grant state and city officials access to  classified information. However, as we reported in June 2002, the view  that states and cities do not have a significant role in homeland security  has changed since September 11, 2001, and the need to coordinate the  efforts of federal, state, and local governments for homeland security is  now well understood."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preventing Terrorism Has Traditionally Been Viewed As a Federal Responsibility", "paragraphs": ["Protecting the United States from terrorism has traditionally been a  responsibility of the federal government and, typically, the views of  states and cities in formulating national policy have not been considered.  In the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Congress found that the federal  government relies on state and local personnel to protect against terrorist  attacks and that homeland security information is needed by state and  local personnel to prevent and prepare for such attacks. Congress also  found that federal, state, and local governments; and intelligence, law  enforcement, and other emergency and response personnel must act in  partnership to maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis  to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. As a result, the act expressed  the sense of Congress that federal, state, and local entities should share  homeland security information to the maximum extent practicable.  Federal, state, and local governments and the private sector were not fully  integrated participants before the September 11, 2001, attacks, but the  need to integrate them became more widely recognized afterward.", "In order to develop national policies and strategies to address terrorism  issues, senior policymakers obtain information from the intelligence  community. The intelligence community uses a cyclic process for  intelligence production. Simplified, the intelligence community  (1) receives information requirements from policymakers, (2) collects  and analyzes the information from its sources, (3) creates intelligence  products from the information, (4) disseminates the products to  consumers of intelligence, and (5) receives feedback about the usefulness  of the information from consumers. This process can lead to additional  information requirements and is ongoing.", "Since the late 1940s, the federal government generally separated law  enforcement and intelligence functions, although both have a role in  combating terrorism. From this separation, law enforcement and  intelligence were created and handled differently, depending on which  community obtained the information and how it was to be used. The  law enforcement community investigates criminal activity and supports  prosecutions by providing information related to events that have  occurred. In contrast, the intelligence community tries to provide  policymakers and military leaders with information so that decisions can  be made to protect and advance national interests. Often, the intelligence  community collects information from sensitive sources or using special  methods and keeps the information classified to protect their sources and  methods and ensure a continual flow in the future.", "Executive Order no. 12958, Classified National Security Information, as  amended, prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and  declassifying national security information, including information related  to defense against transnational terrorism. Executive Order no. 12968,  Access to Classified Information, states that access to classified national  security information is generally limited to persons who have been granted  a security clearance, been briefed as to their responsibilities for protecting  classified national security information, have signed a nondisclosure  agreement acknowledging those responsibilities, and have agreed to abide  by all appropriate security requirements. In addition, these persons must  have a demonstrated \u201cneed to know\u201d the information in connection with  the performance of their official functions. If these criteria are not met,  then the information is not to be shared.", "The federal intelligence community has traditionally not always  considered states or cities to need access to intelligence that could be  used to fight terrorism. As a result, few officials at the state and local  levels have the clearances required for access to intelligence products.", "Furthermore, the collection and use of intelligence information on  individuals for domestic law enforcement purposes is constrained by the  application of constitutional protections, statutory controls, and rules of  evidence. For example, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  had, in effect, been interpreted as requiring some separation that limited  coordination between domestic law enforcement and foreign intelligence  investigations, particularly with regard to the use of information collected  for foreign intelligence purposes in criminal prosecutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "September 11, 2001, Attacks Redefined Terrorism Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Although previous terrorist attacks\u2014such as the 1993 World Trade Center  bombing\u2014proved that the United States was not immune to attacks on  its homeland, the enormity of the loss of life and impact of the terrorist  attacks on September 11, 2001, highlighted the increasing risk of terrorist  attacks on U.S. soil. Consequently, federal, state, and city governments  recognized an urgent need to effectively unify their efforts to enhance  homeland security by employing the unique contribution that each level of  government can make on the basis of its capabilities and knowledge of its  own environment. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, policymakers  questioned the separation between law enforcement and intelligence,  noting that the distinctions may limit access to some information needed  to effectively execute homeland security duties. In October 2001, Congress  passed the USA PATRIOT Act, to improve the sharing of information  between the intelligence and law enforcement communities, such as by  providing federal investigators with more flexibility in sharing information  obtained under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  In October 2002, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: Joint  Investigation inquiry into the attacks found problems in maximizing the  flow of relevant information both within the Intelligence Community as  well as to and from those outside the community. The review found that  the reasons for these information disconnects can be, depending on the  case, cultural, organizational, human, or technological. The committee  recommended that comprehensive solutions, while perhaps difficult and  costly, must be developed and implemented if we are to maximize our  potential for success in the war against terrorism.", "At the same time, recognizing a need to balance the protection of  information with the emerging homeland security requirements of those  that had a newly recognized need-to-know, Congress passed the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 to, among other purposes, specifically facilitate  information sharing. In creating the Department of Homeland Security,  the act gives the Secretary the responsibility to coordinate with other  executive agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector  in order to prevent future attacks. Among other responsibilities, the  Secretary is to coordinate the distribution of information between federal  agencies and state and local governments. Furthermore, the act requires  the new department\u2019s Under Secretary for Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection to disseminate, as appropriate, information  analyzed by the department to other federal, state, and local government  agencies with homeland security roles; to consult with state and local  governments to ensure appropriate exchanges of information (including  law-enforcement-related information) relating to threats of terrorism; and  to coordinate with elements of the intelligence community and with  federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, and the private sector,  as appropriate. Additionally, a subtitle of the Homeland Security Act, titled  the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act, requires the President of  the United States to prescribe and implement governmentwide procedures  for determining the extent of sharing, and for the actual sharing, of  homeland security information between federal agencies and state and  local personnel, and for the sharing of classified (and sensitive but  unclassified) information with state and local personnel. To date, these  procedures have not been promulgated, although the President has  recently assigned this function to the Secretary of Homeland Security.", "Furthermore, several national strategies that have been developed include  information sharing as major initiatives. Both the National Strategy for  Homeland Security and the National Strategy for the Physical Protection  of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets include, as objectives,  improving information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement  agencies at all levels of government. In addition, FBI increased the number  of its Joint Terrorism Task Forces, from 35, as of September 11, 2001, to  66, as of March 2003. Federal, state, and local law enforcement officials  can interact to prevent terrorist attacks and share information in  investigations of terrorist events through the task forces.

In the  meantime, some federal agencies and state and city governments  undertook initiatives on their own to improve sharing.

The act also created the Department of Homeland  Security, which consolidated 22 federal agencies with homeland security  missions into a single department. Within the department, the Office of  State and Local Government Coordination and the Office of Private Sector  Liaison were created to provide state and local governments and  appropriate private-sector representatives with regular information,  research, and technical support to assist local efforts at securing the  homeland. According to the department, these offices will give these  participants one primary federal contact instead of many to meet their  homeland security needs.", "Since September 11, 2001, the administration has developed several  strategies containing actions to improve information sharing and charge  DHS, FBI, and other government components with responsibility to  perform these actions. For example, the National Strategy for Homeland  Security (July 2002), the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of  Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets (Feb. 2003), and the National  Strategy to Secure Cyberspace (Feb. 2003) have, as one of their priorities,  actions to promote information sharing between federal agencies and with  state and city governments, law enforcement and intelligence agencies,  and the private sector.", "The National Strategy for Homeland Security specifies that the federal  government will \u201cbuild a national environment that enables the sharing of  essential homeland security information horizontally across each agency  of the federal government and vertically among federal, state, and local  governments, private industry, and citizens\u201d by integrating all participants  and streamlining the sharing process. The strategy contains initiatives to  declassify documents to facilitate sharing, integrate databases at all levels  of government, and provide for a secure method of sharing information.  Similarly, the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical  Infrastructures and Key Assets has initiatives to facilitate information  sharing by improving processes for domestic threat data collection,  analysis, and dissemination to state and local governments as well as with  private industry. This strategy calls on DHS to lead the effort to (1) define  sharing requirements, (2) establish processes for providing and receiving  information, and (3) develop technical systems to share sensitive  information with public-private stakeholders. The National Strategy to  Secure Cyberspace has initiatives to improve and enhance public-private  information sharing involving cyber attacks by establishing, among other  things, protocols for ensuring that information voluntarily provided by the  private sector is securely stored and maintained.", "The Department of Homeland Security has several initiatives to improve  the sharing of information that could be used to protect the homeland.  In particular, it is developing a homeland security enterprise architecture  that, among other actions, will integrate sharing between federal agencies  and between the federal government, state and city governments, and the  private sector. According to DHS, its enterprise architecture is a business- based framework for cross-agency improvement and will provide DHS  with a new way of describing, analyzing, and integrating the data from the  agencies, thus enabling DHS to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d to better prevent  terrorist attacks and protect people and infrastructure from terrorism.  Architecture working groups were established to collect, organize, and  publish the baseline information-sharing structure for the major  components that were transitioned to DHS. According to DHS officials,  this effort will be completed by June 2003. The working groups will also be  used to integrate the state and city governments, and the private sector. By  September of 2003, the department anticipates it will have a plan that  provides a phased approach to achieving information sharing between the  federal government, states, cities, and the private sector.

Nonetheless, the initiatives seek to fulfill a perceived information  requirement not yet fully addressed by the federal intelligence community,  and include both technological solutions as well as management and  communication solutions. However, these initiatives may be duplicating  DHS and other federal efforts already under way, and, in some cases,  may create information-sharing partnerships that actually limit access  to information to only those agencies that are party to the initiatives.", "Sensing an urgency to improve their abilities to effectively perform  their homeland security duties, other federal agencies, and state and city  participants have implemented several initiatives to promote sharing with  others from different levels of government. However, it is unclear how  these initiatives, while enhancing individual organization sharing, will  contribute to national information-sharing efforts. The Departments of  Defense and Justice have established initiatives using technology to  better gather, analyze, and share information with other homeland security  participants. These initiatives include expanding existing mechanisms  for sharing; participating in information-sharing centers like FBI\u2019s Joint  Terrorism Task Forces; establishing new information-sharing centers; and  working with federal, state, and city agencies to integrate databases. Also,  the new Terrorist Threat Integration Center, which began operations  May 1, 2003, was created to fuse, analyze, and share terrorist-related  information collected domestically and abroad. It is an interagency joint  venture that reports directly to the Director of Central Intelligence in his  capacity as statutory head of the intelligence community. The center will  be comprised of elements of DHS, FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division, the  Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center, the Department  of Defense, and other participating agencies.

Nonetheless, according to the survey  results, many participants expressed a need for still more interaction  with other homeland security participants to coordinate planning, develop  contacts, and share information and best practices.", "In addition to the federal government, several states and cities have  implemented their own initiatives to improve sharing. For example, the  state of California has established a clearinghouse for all terrorist-related  activities and investigations. The clearinghouse collects, analyzes, and  disseminates information to its law enforcement officers, other law  enforcement agencies, and FBI. The City of New York established a  counterterrorism committee comprising FBI, the New York State Office  of Public Security, and the New York City Police Department to share  information and promote joint training exercises. Officials from the  Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged that states\u2019 and cities\u2019 efforts  to create their own centers are resulting in duplication and that some  cities may be reaching out to foreign intelligence sources independently  from the federal government. These officials emphasized that state  and local authorities should work through the Joint Terrorism Task  Forces to receive the information they require. Appendix II contains  examples of other initiatives that various information-sharing participants  have expanded and/or implemented to protect the homeland since  September 11, 2001.", "In written comments to our survey, some respondents indicated that  avoiding duplication and redundancy were some of the reasons they were  not joining or establishing new information-sharing centers. For example,  rather than establishing local or regional databases\u2014as some states and  cities have done\u2014some respondents recommended creating a national  terrorism intelligence and information network and computer database.  However, in order to build a comprehensive national plan that integrates  multiple sharing initiatives (including those that integrate databases), the  federal government must first be aware of these efforts. In a speech to the  National Emergency Managers Association in February 2003, the Secretary  of Homeland Security asked states to inform his department of newly  created initiatives when they learn of them. However, it is not clear if  states and cities have provided DHS with this information and whether  DHS has taken actions on the basis of the information. As a result,  federal efforts to integrate initiatives may overlook some state or city  initiatives that could help to improve information sharing and enhance  homeland security.", "Another way that information-sharing initiatives may limit access to  information for some entities is through partnerships that promote  information sharing between the partners but exclude those not  participating. Some federal agencies may try to meet their information  needs by forming partnerships with other agencies outside the purview of  DHS and its ongoing national strategy efforts. Thus, these organizations  may concentrate on local threat information and unknowingly have vital  information that, when combined with national or regional information,  could indicate an impending attack or help prepare for an attack."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Information- Sharing Process Not Perceived As Effective", "paragraphs": ["In spite of legislation, strategies, and initiatives to improve information  sharing, federal agencies and state and city governments generally do not  consider the current information- and intelligence-sharing process to be  effective.

And, of the three aspects, respondents reported that timeliness was  more of a problem than accuracy or relevancy. This supports a common  complaint we heard from police chiefs\u2014that they wanted timely  information but would often receive information from national news  sources at the same time that the public received it. This lack of timeliness  was often attributed to the federal government\u2019s historic reluctance to  share this type of information with local law enforcement officials. In the  survey, we asked all respondents to indicate the extent to which the  information they received from each other was timely, accurate,  and relevant. Generally no level of government, including the federal  government, was satisfied with the information received from the  federal government, as shown in table 4.", "In particular, table 4 highlights these problems for large cities. Only  23 percent of the large cities reported that the information they received  from the federal government was timely, and only 39 percent reported that  it was accurate. Only 40 percent reported that the information received  was relevant.", "When state agencies were the source of information, federal and city  agencies were also dissatisfied, as shown in table 5.", "Table 5 shows that in general, large and small cities view the information  they receive from their state as more timely, accurate, and relevant than  when compared with the view of federal agencies when they receive  information from the states. Few of the federal agencies that responded  view state information received as timely, accurate, or relevant.", "Similarly, few federal or state agencies that responded to our survey  viewed information received from the cities as timely, accurate, or  relevant, as shown in table 6.", "Table 6 also shows that states view the information they receive  from cities more favorably than the federal agencies that responded to  our survey."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fighting Terrorism Still Seen as Generally a Federal Responsibility", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s fight against terrorism is still generally perceived to be a  federal responsibility, at least in terms of preventing (in contrast to  responding to) a terrorist attack. Even though states and cities develop  important information on potential terrorist threats to the homeland,  the federal government still has not established comprehensive policies  or procedures to effectively integrate state and city governments into  the process of determining requirements; gathering, analyzing, and  disseminating information; and providing feedback. Nor has the federal  government routinely recognized states and cities as customers in the  information-sharing process.", "Our survey results support the view that preventing terrorism is still  perceived generally as a federal responsibility. We asked respondents  to indicate the extent to which the elements of a sharing framework  for receiving information from the federal government\u2014such as clear  guidance and access to needed databases\u2014were in place at the various  governmental levels. The existence of these elements would indicate to  some extent the level that state and city governments were integrated  into the sharing process. Specifically, we found that more elements of a  sharing framework, such as clear guidance for providing and receiving  information, are in place at the federal level than at the state or city  level, indicating that terrorism-related information is managed more at  the federal level. Moreover, the lack of such elements at the state and city  level nearly 2 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks may perpetuate  the perception that the fight against terrorism remains generally a federal  responsibility. State and city governments that completed our survey also  indicated that they do not participate in national policy making regarding  information sharing, which also helps maintain the perception. For  example, 77 percent of the responding states, 92 percent of large cities,  and 93 percent of small cities reported that they did not participate in  this policy-making process. By involving states and cities, this process  would help ensure a more unified and consolidated effort to protect the  homeland, and provide opportunities to improve information sharing at  the state and city levels.", "The view that preventing terrorism is generally a federal responsibility is  also reflected in the perception of the existence of barriers to providing  information upwards or downwards. For example, according to the  December 2002 report of the Gilmore Commission, the prevailing view  continues to be that the federal government likes to receive information  but is reluctant to share information with other homeland security  partners. Furthermore, the commission stated that the federal government  must do a better job of designating \u201ctrusted agents\u201d at the state and local  levels and in the private sector, and move forward with clearing those  trusted agents. In our survey, we listed a number of barriers and asked all  respondents to indicate the extent to which these barriers hindered  sharing with each other. Table 7 identifies the barriers that federal, state,  and city agencies that responded to our survey believe exist in the current  information-sharing process.", "As shown in table 7, federal officials cited several barriers that they  perceive prevent them from sharing information, including concerns  over state and local officials\u2019 ability to secure, maintain, and destroy  classified information; their lack of security clearances; and the absence of  integrated databases. However, these perceived barriers were seen to exist  by only a few respondents and could be overcome. For example, state and  local police routinely handle and protect law-enforcement-sensitive  information to support ongoing criminal investigations, which suggests  that\u2014with proper training and equipment\u2014officials of these governments  could handle other types of sensitive information as well.", "As mentioned earlier, the Homeland Security Act requires the President,  in establishing information-sharing procedures, to address the sharing  of classified and sensitive information with state and local personnel.  Congress suggested in the Homeland Security Act that the procedures  could include the means for granting security clearances to certain  state and local personnel, entering into nondisclosure agreements  (for sensitive but unclassified information), and the increased use of  information-sharing partnerships that include state and local personnel.  For example, Congress found that granting security clearances to certain  state and local personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information  regarding specific terrorist threats between federal, state, and local levels  of government. We found that the federal government has issued  security clearances to state or local officials in limited circumstances  and is increasing the number of such clearances. The Federal Emergency  Management Agency has provided certain state emergency management  personnel with security clearances for emergency response purposes, but  other federal agencies, including FBI, have not recognized the validity of  these security clearances. For FBI, this lack of recognition could prevent it  from providing state emergency management personnel with information.  At the same time, FBI has undertaken some initiatives to provide certain  state officials with clearances and could clearly expand this program at  the state and city levels, if officials believe that doing so will address a  perceived impediment to information sharing. And DHS is also developing  a new homeland security level classification for information to improve  sharing.", "For their part, states and cities reported few barriers in their ability to  provide the federal government with information, while federal agencies  cited a number of barriers to sharing. As shown in table 7, state and city  agencies perceived that the federal government faces few barriers in  sharing information. Appendix V details the barriers that states and cities  perceive to providing federal authorities with information.", "All categories of survey respondents identified the lack of integrated  information systems as the single most common barrier to information  sharing across all levels of government. The Markle Foundation stated in  its report that federal agencies have seen the information and homeland  security problem as one of acquiring new technology. For example, for  fiscal year 2003, FBI budgeted $300 million for new technology, the  Transportation Security Administration has budgeted $1 billion over  several years, and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service  (whose function is now within DHS) has a 5-year plan for $550 million.  However, the foundation reports that almost none of this money is being  spent to solve the problem of how to share this information between  federal agencies and with the states and cities. The foundations\u2019 report  states that when it comes to homeland security and using integrated  information systems, adequate efforts and investments are not yet in sight.  And in recent testimony, we stated that DHS must integrate the many  existing systems and processes within government entities and between  them and the private sector required to support its mission."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the current decentralized information-sharing process in which  actions to improve sharing are not organized, and participants at all  levels of government and the private sector are not well integrated into  the scheme, the nation may be hampered in its ability to detect potential  terrorist attacks and effectively secure the homeland. Additionally, the  lack of coordination of the various information-sharing initiatives  continues to hamper the overall national effort to effectively share  information that could be used to prevent an attack.", "DHS has initiated an enterprise architecture to provide a road map to  address information-sharing issues with all levels of government and  the private sector. It is important that this be done in such a way as to  effectively integrate all levels of government and the private sector into an  information-sharing process. Until then, it is not clear how the department  will coordinate the various information-sharing initiatives to eliminate  possible confusion and duplication of effort. Participants risk duplicating  each other\u2019s efforts and creating partnerships that limit access to  information by other participants, thus increasing the risk that decision  makers do not receive useful information; developing initiatives that are  not mutually reinforcing; and potentially unnecessarily increasing the cost  of providing homeland security.", "The failure to fully integrate state and city governments into  the information-sharing policy-making process deprives the federal  government of the opportunity to (1) obtain a complete picture of  the threat environment and (2) exploit state and city governments\u2019  information expertise for their own areas, with which they are uniquely  familiar.", "Finally, the effectiveness of the information-sharing process to provide  timely, accurate, and relevant information is also in question, creating a  risk that urgent information will not get to the recipient best positioned  to act on it in a timely manner. Until the perceived barriers to federal  information sharing are addressed, the federal government may  unnecessarily, and perhaps inadvertently, be hampering the state and  city governments from carrying out their own homeland security  responsibilities.", "States, cities, and the private sector look to the federal government\u2014in  particular the Department of Homeland Security\u2014for guidance and  support regarding information-sharing issues.

The  department also pointed out that further progress will require a thoughtful,  prudent, and deliberate approach. However, it cautioned that issuing the  first draft of the national homeland security enterprise architecture could  go beyond the September 2003 target because of the time it may take to  obtain appropriate interagency coordination.

The department stated that our draft  report reaches sweeping and extraordinarily negative conclusions about  the adequacy of the governmental sharing of information to  prevent terrorism and that (1) our conclusions are fundamentally incorrect  and unsupportable by reliable evidence; (2) our review was beyond our  purview; and (3) an evaluation of information sharing requires a review of  intelligence sharing which by long standing practice the executive branch  provides to Congress but not us, thus we may not be able to provide useful  information to Congress. We disagree.", "First, we used reliable evidence from a variety of sources, including the  Central Intelligence Agency; the Anser Institute of Homeland Security; the  Joint Inquiry into the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001; reports of  the RAND Institute and the Markle Task Force on National Security in the  Information Age; testimony before congressional committees by federal,  state, and local officials; interviews that we conducted with federal, state,  and local agency officials and associations representing the International  Association of Chiefs of Police, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the  National League of Cities, and the National Sheriffs Association; and our  survey results. Moreover, over 100 cities with populations in excess of  100,000, over 120 cities with populations of under 100,000, and 40 states  responded to our survey, representing a substantial number of  governmental entities providing us with evidence of information-sharing  shortcomings. These organizations are involved in information collection  and analysis, have conducted well respected studies on information- sharing issues, or have significant experience in providing for homeland  security through law enforcement or emergency management at the state  and the local level, and are recognized as authorities in their fields of  endeavor. Our conclusions are based on this body of evidence.  Our  complete scope and methodology is shown in appendix I.", "Second, the Department of Justice stated that \u201cour review of intelligence  activities is an arena that is beyond GAO\u2019s purview\u201d and that providing  GAO with information on intelligence sharing \u201cwould represent a  departure from the long-standing practice of Congress and the executive  branch regarding the oversight of intelligence activities.\u201d The Department  of Justice\u2019s impression that our review was a review of intelligence  activities is incorrect. As our report clearly indicates, the oversight of  intelligence activities was not an objective or focus of our review, which  did not require our access to intelligence information or involve our  evaluation of the conduct of actual intelligence activities. Rather, our  review considered the use of intelligence information in general in the  context of the broader information-sharing roles and responsibilities of  various homeland security stakeholders (including the intelligence  community). However, even if our review could be construed as involving  intelligence activities, we disagree that such a review is outside GAO\u2019s  purview. We have broad statutory authority to evaluate agency programs  and activities and to investigate matters related to the receipt,  disbursement, and use of public money. To carry out our audit  responsibilities, we have a statutory right of access to agency records  applicable to all federal agencies. Although our reviews in the intelligence  area are subject to certain limited restrictions, we regard such reviews as  fundamentally within the scope of our authority.", "Third, as to the department\u2019s assertion that providing GAO with  information on intelligence sharing practices would represent \u201ca departure  from long-standing practice,\u201d we believe our review in this area furthers  congressional oversight but does not require reviewing intelligence  sharing practices. For example, we are not aware that the views of state  and local government officials on information sharing contained in our  report have previously been provided to Congress in a comprehensive  manner, their views are not dependent on whether we do or do not have  access to intelligence sharing practices, and the department did not  indicate that this is the case in asserting that Congress is already receiving  sufficient information from the executive branch. Moreover, we did not  review the extent to which the executive branch provides useful  information to Congress so we cannot comment on the department\u2019s  assertion.  Nonetheless, as our report clearly discusses, numerous state  and local government officials believe that they had not received the  information that they need from federal agencies. It would have also been  useful, had the department shared with us its views on information sharing  for homeland security. We believe Congress should have available such  information in making informed decisions in this area.

The survey was not sent to the private sector,  although we recognize that it has a sizeable role in homeland security by  virtue of owning about 80 percent of the critical infrastructure in  the United States. The survey collected information on the types of  information needed by participants, the extent that this information was  received and provided, the sources and usefulness of the information,  and the barriers that prevent participants from sharing. However, the  survey did not attempt to validate the information needs of any level of  government. To ensure the validity of the questions on the survey, we  pretested it with officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  Defense Intelligence Agency; the homeland security directors for the  states of North Dakota and Florida; the police chiefs from the cities of  Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington, Texas; and the Director of Emergency  Management for the District of Columbia.
