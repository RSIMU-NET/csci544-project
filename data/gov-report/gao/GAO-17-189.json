As of August 2016, FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), had coordinated the release of 14 updated or new guidance documents on antibiotic development, in compliance with Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012. However, half of these guidance documents remain in draft form. The GAIN provisions required FDA to review and, as appropriate, revise guidance documents related to antibiotics, in part to ensure that they reflected scientific developments. FDA used the QIDP designation and its incentives, created under the GAIN provisions, to encourage drug sponsors to develop new antibiotics. Incentives available under the QIDP designation include eligibility for fast track designation\u2014which allows drug sponsors to have increased interaction with FDA and allows FDA to review portions of sponsors' applications as they come in rather than waiting for a complete application. FDA granted 101 out of 109 requests for the QIDP designation from July 2012, when the designation was created, through December 2015. FDA also approved six drugs with the QIDP designation for market in the United States.", "The 10 drug sponsors in GAO's study said that GAIN has facilitated FDA's review of their drug applications, and 8 said they experienced increased communication with FDA due to the agency's implementation of GAIN and general commitment to supporting the development of new antibiotics. However, several were uncertain whether they could rely on FDA's draft guidance or were concerned about the lack of guidance describing the QIDP designation and its requirements. For example, 2 drug sponsors expressed concern about the role of FDA's draft guidance. A third sponsor said it would be helpful if certain draft guidance was finalized. Five additional drug sponsors in GAO's study stated that written guidance from FDA related to the QIDP designation and its incentives, such as the process for obtaining fast track designation for a QIDP-designated application, would help them to better understand the requirements and its associated benefits. FDA released some of its updated guidance documents in draft form on its website, in response to GAIN, which indicated that they were intended for comment purposes only, not for implementation, and would represent the agency's current thinking \u201cwhen finalized.\u201d While these draft guidance documents can include updated information, it is unclear if the new information represents FDA's current thinking on a topic or if the purpose of the draft guidance is limited to generating public comment. Internal control standards for the federal government on information and communication state that sharing quality information with external parties is necessary to achieving an entity's objectives. The lack of clarity on the role of draft guidance for and the lack of written guidance on the QIDP designation create uncertainty for drug sponsors about how much reliance they should place on these draft documents and could diminish the likelihood that drug sponsors apply for the designation because they do not fully understand its requirements and benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA clarify the role of draft guidance for and develop written guidance on the QIDP designation to help drug sponsors better understand the designation and its associated incentives.

However, this role is threatened  by the growing resistance of bacteria to existing antibiotics and the steady  decline in the development of new antibiotics since the 1980s. More than  2 million people are sickened every year in the United States with  antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result. The  number of new antibiotics approved for prescription use in the United  States has declined from 29 in the 1980s to 9 in the first decade of the  2000s. The limited number of antibiotics under development is a matter  of concern for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for the  approval of drugs for market in the United States.", "In 2012, Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Safety and  Innovation Act (FDASIA), title VIII of which is commonly referred to as the  Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) provisions. The GAIN  provisions required FDA to take certain steps to encourage drug sponsors  to develop qualified infectious disease products (QIDP), intended for the  treatment of serious or life-threatening infections. However, it is too soon  to determine if the GAIN provisions have actually stimulated the  development of new antibiotics. FDA has taken steps to implement these  provisions and drug sponsors have applied for and received the QIDP  designation for drugs already in development. The GAIN provisions were  passed 5 years ago, but it generally takes 10 to 15 years to develop a  new drug and obtain approval from FDA. Therefore, GAIN has not been  in place long enough yet to have been a factor in motivating any drug  sponsor to develop and submit an application to FDA to market a new  antibiotic.", "You asked us to provide information on FDA\u2019s implementation of the  GAIN provisions.

We also reviewed  FDA guidance documents related to antibiotic drug development and  unmet medical need identified by the agency as being related to GAIN.  We analyzed FDA data on drug sponsors\u2019 requests to FDA to obtain the  QIDP designation and the number of requests FDA granted from July 9,  2012, (when the QIDP designation was created) through December 31,  2015, (the most current available data at the time of our review). We  limited the requests that we examined to those associated with new  antibiotic drug applications and did not include applications for other types  of products. We also reviewed FDA data on the six drugs the agency  approved with the QIDP designation; these data included information  such as the drug\u2019s proprietary name and indication for use. We assessed  the reliability of these data by, for example, conducting data checks and  interviewing knowledgeable FDA officials about the data. We determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting  objectives. We also interviewed FDA officials on their efforts to encourage  the submission of new drug applications by implementing GAIN.", "To examine drug sponsors\u2019 perspectives on FDA\u2019s efforts to encourage  the development of antibiotics to treat serious or life-threatening infections  since GAIN, we contacted certain industry stakeholders for their  assistance in identifying drug sponsors to include in our study.  Information about FDA\u2019s review of drug sponsors\u2019 applications, including  information about whether a drug sponsor is seeking a QIDP designation  and FDA\u2019s subsequent decision, is proprietary. Therefore, we asked two  organizations that represent drug sponsors and two organizations that  conduct research in the area of antibiotic innovation to ask drug sponsors  who had experience with FDA\u2019s QIDP designation or antibiotic drug  development generally to participate in our study. Eight drug sponsors  agreed to participate\u20146 of which we interviewed and 2 of which  answered our questions in writing. Two of these 8 drug sponsors had  drugs approved with the QIDP designation. Because there are a total of 4  sponsors that had drugs approved with the QIDP designation and we  wanted to interview all of them, we contacted the other 2 drug sponsors,  both of which agreed to participate in our study. The 10 drug sponsors in  our study had different characteristics; for example, they included large  and small drug sponsors, those with approved antibiotics, and those with antibiotics in development that have a QIDP designation, according to  publicly available data. These drug sponsors\u2019 perspectives are not  generalizable to all drug sponsors. We supplemented our understanding  of drug sponsors\u2019 perspectives by analyzing FDA data on review times for  approved antibiotics with the QIDP designation from July 9, 2012, through  December 31, 2015. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed  relevant documentation, conducted data checks, and interviewed  knowledgeable FDA officials about the data. We determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.  We also reviewed FDA guidance related to other expedited programs that  FDA implements, including programs for which antibiotics qualify, to  understand what information the agency provides about the features and  benefits of these programs. Lastly, we compared the relevant federal  internal control standards related to information sharing and  communication with FDA\u2019s guidance and other communications with drug  sponsors about the QIDP designation.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2015 to January  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Experts have raised  concerns about the lack of new antibiotics being developed to replace  antibiotics that have become ineffective because of resistance. This lack  of development has been attributed to various challenges. For example,  the development of new drugs, including antibiotics, is often a costly and  lengthy process. To obtain FDA\u2019s approval to market a new drug, a drug  sponsor must conduct extensive research in order to demonstrate that the  drug is both safe and effective. Although high costs and failure rates  make drug development risky for drug sponsors, creating a safe and  effective new drug can be financially rewarding for the drug sponsor and  beneficial to the public. However, antibiotics are often less profitable than  other drugs because they are generally designed to work quickly and are  typically administered for only a brief time.", "FDA oversees the drug development process and the approval of new  drugs for marketing in the United States. FDA generally reviews drug  sponsors\u2019 plans for conducting clinical trials and assesses drug sponsors\u2019  applications for the approval of new antibiotics. FDA also releases  guidance for industry as a way to communicate its current thinking on a  particular topic with the purpose of assisting drug sponsors in the  development of drugs. For example, FDA has released several guidance  documents to assist drug sponsors with the development of antibiotics,  including information on designing clinical trials and measures to  demonstrate a drug\u2019s effectiveness.", "The GAIN provisions required FDA to take certain steps to encourage  drug sponsors to develop antibiotics, particularly those that treat serious  or life-threatening infections.

FDA was also required to  finalize a guidance document on the development of antibacterial drugs  for serious or life-threatening infections, particularly in areas of unmet  medical need. The GAIN provisions also established the QIDP  designation and made incentives available to sponsors of QIDPs\u2014fast  track designation, priority review designation, and 5 years of additional  market exclusivity.", "Fast track designation may expedite FDA\u2019s review of an application by  allowing drug sponsors to have increased communication with FDA  and by allowing FDA to review portions of the application as they  come in rather than waiting for a complete application. Although drug  sponsors that receive QIDP designation are also entitled to receive  fast track designation, drug sponsors must still request this  designation and typically do so prior to submitting their application to  FDA for review.", "Priority review has been automatically granted to applications with the  QIDP designation. It reduces FDA\u2019s goal time for the review of an  application from 10 months to 6 months.", "Market exclusivity is a statutory provision for exclusive marketing  rights for certain periods upon approval of a drug application, if certain  statutory requirements are met. Market exclusivity periods last  different lengths of time and have different scopes. For example,  drugs designated for treatment of rare diseases or conditions may be  eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, which lasts for 7 years for the  specified conditions. New chemical entity exclusivity provides 5 years  of market exclusivity if a drug includes a new active moiety that has  not been previously approved by FDA. QIDP-related market  exclusivity adds an additional 5 years of exclusivity to certain  qualifying drugs. For example, a drug receiving orphan drug  exclusivity receives 7 years of exclusivity. If that drug\u2019s application  also received a QIDP designation, then the drug may receive an  additional 5 years of exclusivity, for a total of 12 years of market  exclusivity.

FDA officials also reviewed  the list of available guidance documents and released guidance on new  topics, where needed. Established after the passage of the GAIN  provisions, the Task Force is a multidisciplinary group that comprises  scientists and clinicians who participate in FDA\u2019s oversight of the drug  development process. Members of this Task Force work with experts,  such as those from academia, industry, and professional societies, and  with patient advocacy groups, to promote the development of new  antibiotics.", "As of August 2016, FDA and the Task Force had coordinated the release  of 14 updated or new guidance documents related to the development of  antibiotics, although half of these documents remain in draft form. Table 2 lists guidance documents for antibiotics that FDA released in  accordance with the GAIN provisions. Half of these 14 documents were  finalized versions of prior draft guidance documents, such as FDA\u2019s 2015  guidance on uncomplicated gonorrhea. FDA released the remaining  guidance documents in draft form\u2014specifically, the guidance either  updated a prior draft guidance or was a brand new draft guidance for a  new topic. For example, FDA\u2019s most recent draft guidance on bacterial  vaginosis, released in July 2016, is an update to prior draft guidance from  July 1998, while FDA\u2019s draft guidance on pulmonary tuberculosis,  released in November 2013, is the first guidance on this topic FDA has  released. FDA made these draft guidance documents publicly available  on its website, in keeping with the agency\u2019s good guidance practices.  According to FDA, these draft guidance documents are made available to  encourage public comment. Further, the draft guidance documents on  developing antibiotics we examined indicated on the title page and on  subsequent pages that they were intended for comment purposes only,  not for implementation, and would represent the agency\u2019s current thinking  \u201cwhen finalized.\u201d Thus, because the draft documents on the FDA  website for public comment have not been finalized, drug sponsors are  left without written guidance indicating FDA\u2019s current thinking on a given  issue until the agency finalizes the guidance. As of January 2017, FDA  had not responded to questions we provided in June 2016 about why  some guidance documents remain in draft form or whether drug sponsors  should rely on draft guidance documents while developing their drugs.  FDA informed us that its responses were in agency clearance. FDA also  had previously received a similar request from Congress and told us it  would provide responses to us and to Congress simultaneously when the  responses are finalized. FDA did not indicate when those responses  would be finalized and provided to us.", "According to FDA officials, they selected the antibiotic-related guidance to  review, and potentially revise, for various reasons, such as the  emergence of new scientific information. Officials said that they also  coordinate with external stakeholders on identifying and addressing  challenges to antibiotic development, such as consulting with them about  any changes they make to guidance documents. For example, FDA  participated in meetings with the Foundation for the National Institutes of  Health and worked with the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative when it  revised two of its guidance documents on developing drugs to treat acute  bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and on drug  development for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial  pneumonia (HABP/VABP).", "In 2013, FDA finalized its revision of a 2010 draft guidance document  on developing drugs to treat ABSSSI based, in part, on work on  clinical endpoints conducted by the Foundation for the National  Institutes of Health. Differences between the finalized 2013  document and the draft 2010 document included changes in the  minimum number of clinical trials FDA recommended that a drug  sponsor conduct and the clinical endpoints FDA recommended that a  sponsor use to assess the effectiveness of a drug. The 2010 guidance  document recommended that drug sponsors conduct at least two  adequate and well-controlled trials. When FDA released the finalized  guidance in 2013, the agency noted that drug sponsors could also  provide evidence from a single adequate and well-controlled clinical  trial supported by independent evidence, such as data from another  trial for a treatment of a different type of infection. Also, the  recommended primary clinical endpoint was redefined as a reduction  in lesion size of at least 20 percent compared to the lesion size of  those patients that did not receive treatment at 48 to 72 hours.", "FDA made similar changes to its draft 2010 guidance on HABP/VABP  based, in part, on work resulting from its coordination with both the  Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the Clinical Trials  Transformation Initiative. Industry stakeholders expressed concerns  about this 2010 guidance document that included the agency\u2019s use of  all-cause mortality (i.e., death from any cause) as the only clinical  endpoint recommended to measure the effectiveness of a drug.  Stakeholders also raised concerns about the restrictive inclusion  criteria that were used to determine which patients could be enrolled  in clinical trials. In 2014, FDA released a revised draft HABP/VABP  guidance document that included changes aimed at addressing these  concerns. Specifically, FDA\u2019s recommendations included endpoints  besides all-cause mortality and modified the criteria for clinical trial  enrollment. Making the criteria for enrollment less restrictive could  make it easier to enroll more patients into clinical trials. Enrolling  patients into clinical trials is a particular challenge noted by most of  the drug sponsors included in our study.", "The GAIN provisions included another requirement for FDA to release a  draft guidance document on unmet medical need by the end of June  2013, and a final version of this guidance by the end of 2014. In July  2013, FDA released its draft guidance\u2014Guidance for Industry  Antibacterial Therapies for Patients with Unmet Medical Need for the  Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases. According to FDA, the agency  did not meet the statutory deadline for publishing finalized guidance  because of concerns that release of such guidance could create  confusion within the industry while Congress considers draft legislation for  a potential limited population antibacterial drug approval pathway. In  October 2016, FDA told us that the agency intended to release the final  guidance later that year, once the legislative disposition of this limited  population approval pathway was clear.

While FDA granted 11 requests from sponsors for fast  track designation, sponsors could have requested fast track designation  in 14 additional instances, but they did not do so. According to FDA  officials, this is likely the case for one of three reasons: (1) a drug sponsor  has chosen not to request fast track designation, (2) a drug sponsor has  not yet requested fast track designation but may intend to; or (3) the drug  sponsor received fast track designation prior to the creation of the QIDP  designation in 2012, and this is not reflected in the counts.", "As of October 2016, FDA had approved applications for six drugs that  received the QIDP designation for marketing in the United States, though  these drugs were in the later stages of their development program when  the designation was created in July 2012.

HHS noted that they are not binding and  that drug sponsors can use an alternative approach, if the approach  satisfies the requirements of applicable statutes. We appreciate FDA\u2019s  consideration of this recommendation, and firmly believe this clarification  is warranted. GAIN called for FDA to issue draft guidance documents and  to review and revise them, as appropriate, to reflect scientific  developments. FDA\u2019s practice of releasing guidance that remains in draft  form for years has created uncertainty for drug sponsors in this area. This  approach leaves sponsors to plan their antibiotic drug development  programs and determine how to meet statutory requirements without the  benefit of written guidance representing FDA\u2019s most current thinking.  Therefore, we believe our recommendation that FDA clarify how drug  sponsors should use these draft documents is appropriate and well- supported.", "HHS agreed with our second recommendation that FDA develop and  issue written guidance on the QIDP designation.
