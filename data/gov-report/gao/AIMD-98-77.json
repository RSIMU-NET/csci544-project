These problems also prevent IRS from producing financial statements on a monthly or quarterly basis as a management tool, which is standard practice in private industry and some federal entities.", "The U.S. Government Standard General Ledger (SGL) establishes the general ledger account structure for federal agencies as well as the rules for agencies to follow in recording financial events. Implementation of the SGL is called for by the Core Financial System Requirements of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP), and is required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems. Implementation of financial management systems that comply with the SGL at the transaction level is also required by FFMIA. However, because of the problems discussed above, IRS\u2019 general ledger does not comply with these requirements.", "As we previously reported, IRS\u2019 general ledger was not designed to support financial statement preparation. To compensate for this deficiency, IRS utilizes specialized computer programs to extract information from its master files\u2014its only detailed database of taxpayer information\u2014to derive amounts to be reported in the financial statements. However, the amounts produced by this approach needed material audit adjustments to the Statement of Custodial Assets and Liabilities to produce reliable financial statements.

To compensate for the lack of a subsidiary ledger, IRS runs computer programs against its master files to identify and classify the universe of unpaid assessments. However, this approach required numerous audit adjustments to produce reliable balances. The lack of a detailed subsidiary ledger impairs IRS\u2019 ability to effectively manage the unpaid assessments.", "For example, IRS\u2019 current systems precluded it from ensuring that all parties liable for certain assessments get credit for payments made on those assessments. Specifically, payments made on unpaid payroll tax withholdings for a troubled company, which can be collectible from multiple individuals, are not always credited to each responsible party to reflect the reduction in their tax liability. In 53 of 83 cases we reviewed involving multiple individuals and companies, we found that payments were not accurately recorded to reflect the reduction in the tax liability of each responsible party. In one case we reviewed, three individuals had multimillion dollar tax liability balances, as well as liens placed against their property, even though the tax had been fully paid by the company.", "While we were able to determine that the amounts reported in the fiscal year 1997 financial statements pertaining to taxes receivable, a component of unpaid assessments, were reliable, this was only after significant adjustments totaling tens of billions of dollars were made. The extensive reliance IRS must place on ad hoc procedures significantly increases the risk of material misstatement of unpaid assessments and/or other reports issued by IRS in the future. A proper subsidiary ledger for unpaid assessments, as recommended by the JFMIP Core Financial Systems Requirements, is necessary to provide management with complete, up-to-date information about the unpaid assessments due from each taxpayer, so that managers will be in a position to make informed decisions about collection efforts and collectibility estimates. This requires a subsidiary ledger that makes readily available to management the amount, nature, and age of all unpaid assessments outstanding by tax liability and taxpayer, and that can be readily and routinely reconciled to corresponding general ledger balances for financial reporting purposes. Such a system should also track and make available key information necessary to assess collectibility, such as account status, payment and default history, and installment agreement terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Documentary Support for Unpaid Assessments Is Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["In our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1996 Custodial Financial Statements, we reported that IRS could not locate sufficient supporting documentation to (1) enable us to evaluate the existence and classification of unpaid assessments or (2) support its classification of reported revenue collections and refunds paid. During our fiscal year 1997 audit, IRS was able to locate and provide sufficient supporting documentation for fiscal year 1997 revenue and refund transactions we tested. However, IRS continued to experience significant problems locating and providing supporting documentation for unpaid assessments, primarily due to the age of the items.", "Documentation for transactions we reviewed, such as tax returns or installment agreements, had often been destroyed in accordance with IRS record retention policies or could not be located. In addition, the documentation IRS provided did not always include useful information, such as appraisals, asset searches, and financial statements. For example, estate case files we reviewed generally did not include audited financial statements or an independent appraisal of the estate\u2019s assets, information that would greatly assist in determining the potential collectibility and potential underreporting of these cases. Additionally, the lack of documentation made it difficult to assess the classification and collectibility of unpaid assessments reported in the financial statements as federal tax receivables.", "Through our audit procedures, we were able to verify the existence and proper classification of unpaid assessments and obtain reasonable assurance that reported balances were reliable. However, this required material audit adjustments to correct misstated unpaid assessment balances identified by our testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Exist in Controls Over Refunds", "paragraphs": ["IRS did not have sufficient preventive controls over refunds to assure that inappropriate payments for tax refunds are not disbursed. Such inappropriate payments have taken the form of refunds improperly issued or inflated, which IRS did not identify because of flawed verification procedures, or fraud by IRS employees. For example, we found three instances where refunds were paid for inappropriate amounts. This occurred because IRS does not compare tax returns to the attached W-2s (Wage and Tax Statements) at the time the returns are initially processed, and consequently did not detect a discrepancy with pertinent information on the tax return. As we have reported in prior audits, such inconsistencies generally go undetected until such time as IRS completes its document matching program, which can take as long as 18 months. In addition, during fiscal year 1997, IRS identified alleged employee embezzlement of refunds totaling over $269,000. IRS is also vulnerable to issuance of duplicate refunds made possible by gaps in IRS\u2019 controls. IRS reported this condition as a material weakness in its fiscal year 1997 FIA report.", "The control weaknesses over refunds are magnified by significant levels of invalid Earned Income Credit (EIC) claims. IRS recently reported that during the period January 1995 through April 1995, an estimated $4.4 billion (25 percent) in EIC claims filed were invalid. This estimate does not reflect actual disbursements made for refunds involving EIC claims. However, it provides an indication of the magnitude of IRS\u2019 and the federal government\u2019s exposure to losses resulting from weak controls over refunds. While we were able to substantiate the amounts disbursed as refunds as reported on the fiscal year 1997 Custodial Financial Statements, IRS needs to have effective preventive controls in place to ensure that the federal government does not incur losses due to payment of inappropriate refunds. Once an inappropriate refund has been disbursed, IRS is compelled to expend both the time and expense to attempt to recover it, with dubious prospect of success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue Accounting and Reporting Does Not Meet User Needs", "paragraphs": ["IRS is unable to currently determine the specific amount of revenue it actually collected for the Social Security, Hospital Insurance, Highway, and other relevant trust funds. As we previously reported, the primary reason for this weakness is that the accounting information needed to validate the taxpayer\u2019s liability and record the payment to the proper trust fund is not provided at the time that taxpayers remit payments. Information is provided on the tax return, which can be received as late as 9 months after a payment is submitted. However, the information on the return only pertains to the amount of the tax liability, not the distribution of the amounts previously collected. As a result, IRS cannot report actual revenue collected for Social Security, Hospital Insurance, Highway, and other trust funds on a current basis nor can it accurately report revenue collected for individuals. Because of this weakness, IRS had to report Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and individual income tax collections in the same line item on its Statement of Custodial Activity for fiscal year 1997. However, requirements for the form and content of governmentwide financial statements require separate reporting of Social Security, Hospital Insurance, and individual income taxes collected. Beginning in fiscal year 1998, federal accounting standards will also require this reporting.", "Taxes collected by IRS on behalf of the federal government are deposited in the general revenue fund of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), where they are subsequently distributed to the appropriate trust funds. Amounts representing Social Security and Hospital Insurance taxes are distributed to their respective trust funds based on information certified by the Social Security Administration (SSA). In contrast, for excise taxes, IRS certifies the amounts to be distributed based on taxes assessed, as reflected on the relevant tax forms. However, by law, distributions of excise taxes are to be based on taxes actually collected.", "The manner in which both FICA and excise taxes are distributed creates a condition in which the federal government\u2019s general revenue fund subsidizes the Social Security, Hospital Insurance, Highway, and other trust funds. The subsidy occurs primarily because a significant number of businesses that file tax returns for Social Security, Hospital Insurance, and excise taxes ultimately go bankrupt or otherwise go out of business and never actually pay the assessed amounts. Additionally, with respect to Social Security and Hospital Insurance taxes, a significant number of self-employed individuals also do not pay the assessed amounts. While the subsidy is not necessarily significant with respect to excise taxes, it is significant for Social Security and Hospital Insurance taxes. At September 30, 1997, the estimated amount of unpaid taxes and interest in IRS\u2019 unpaid assessments balance was approximately $44 billion for Social Security and Hospital Insurance, and approximately $1 billion for excise taxes. While these totals do not include amounts no longer in the unpaid assessments balance due to the expiration of the statutory collection period, they nevertheless give an indication of the cumulative amount of the subsidy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controls Over Computer Security Are Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["IRS places extensive reliance on computer systems to process tax returns, maintain taxpayer data, calculate interest and penalties, and generate refunds. Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain adequate internal controls over these systems. We previously reported that IRS had serious weaknesses in the controls used to safeguard its computer systems, facilities, and taxpayer data. Our review of these controls as part of our audit of IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 Custodial Financial Statements found that although many improvements have been made, overall controls continued to be ineffective. IRS\u2019 controls over automated systems continued to exhibit serious weaknesses in (1) physical security, (2) logical security, (3) data communications management, (4) risk analysis, (5) quality assurance, (6) internal audit and security, and (7) contingency planning. Weaknesses in these areas can allow unauthorized individuals access to critical hardware and software where they may intentionally or inadvertently add, alter, or delete sensitive data or programs.", "IRS recognized these weaknesses in its fiscal year 1997 FIA report and has corrected a significant number of the computer security weaknesses identified in our previous reports. Additionally, IRS has centralized responsibility for security and privacy issues and added staff in this area. IRS is implementing plans to mitigate the remaining weaknesses by June 1999. In our fiscal year 1997 audit, we were able to verify the accuracy of the financial statement balances and disclosures originating in whole or in part from automated systems primarily through review and testing of supporting documentation.

To ensure that appropriate security over these receipts is maintained, IRS requires that lock box depositories receiving payments on its behalf use a surveillance camera to monitor staff when they open mail containing cash and checks. However, we found that payments received at the four IRS service centers where we tested controls over manual cash receipts were not subject to comparable controls. We found at these locations that (1) IRS allowed individuals to open mail unobserved, and relied on them to accurately report amounts received, and (2) payments received were not logged or otherwise recorded at the point of receipt to immediately establish accountability and thereby deter and detect diversion.", "In addition, at one service center, we observed payments being received by personnel who should not have been authorized to accept receipts. As a result of these weaknesses, IRS is vulnerable to losses of cash and checks received from taxpayers in payment of taxes due. In fact, between 1995 and 1997, IRS identified instances of actual or alleged employee embezzlement of receipts totaling about $4.6 million.

IRS has studied various options to enable it to make final certifications of amounts to be distributed based on actual collections and to develop the underlying information needed to support such certifications. IRS was in the process of finalizing its proposed solution at the conclusion of our fiscal year 1996 audit; however, through the end of our fiscal year 1997 audit, IRS still had not implemented its proposed solution.

As indicated by the material weaknesses we discussed earlier, IRS\u2019 systems do not substantially comply with these requirements. For example, as noted previously, IRS does not have a general ledger that conforms with the SGL. Additionally, IRS lacks a subsidiary ledger for its unpaid assessments, and lacks an effective audit trail from its general ledger back to transaction source documents. These are all requirements under FFMSR. The other three material weaknesses we discussed above\u2014controls over refunds, revenue accounting and reporting, and computer security\u2014also are conditions indicating that IRS\u2019 systems do not comply with FFMSR. In addition, the material weaknesses we noted above mean that IRS\u2019 systems cannot produce reliable financial statements and related disclosures that conform with applicable federal accounting standards.

This plan is intended to bring IRS\u2019 general ledger into conformance with the SGL and would be a step toward compliance with FFMSR. However, the plan falls short of fully meeting FFMSR requirements. For example, the plan will not provide for (1) full traceability of information through its systems (i.e., lack of an audit trail), (2) a subsidiary ledger to assist in distinguishing federal tax receivables from other unpaid assessments, and (3) reporting of revenue by tax type. As discussed later in this report, the latter example has implications for IRS\u2019 ability to meet certain federal accounting standards required to be implemented in fiscal year 1998. IRS also has a longer-range plan to address the financial management system deficiencies noted in prior audits and in IRS\u2019 own self-assessment.

As noted above, write-offs have little or no future collection potential. In addition, $48 billion of the unpaid assessments balance represents amounts that have not been agreed to by either the taxpayer or a court. Due to the lack of agreement, these compliance assessments are likely to have less potential for future collection than those unpaid assessments that are considered federal taxes receivable.", "The remaining $90 billion of unpaid assessments represent federal taxes receivable. About $62 billion (70 percent) of this balance is estimated to be uncollectible due primarily to the taxpayer\u2019s economic situation, such as individual taxpayers who are unemployed or have other financial problems. However, IRS may continue collection action for 10 years after the assessment or longer under certain conditions. Thus these accounts may still ultimately have some collection potential if the taxpayer\u2019s economic condition improves. About $28 billion, or about 30 percent, of federal taxes receivable is estimated to be collectible. Components of the collectible balance include installment agreements with estates and individuals, as well as relatively newer amounts due from individuals and businesses who have a history of compliance.", "It is also important to note that of the unpaid assessments balance, about $136 billion (over 60 percent) represents interest and penalties, as depicted in figure 2, which are largely uncollectible.", "Interest and Penalties ($136)", "Interest and penalties are such a high percentage of the balance because IRS continues to accrue them through the 10-year statutory collection date, regardless of whether an account meets the criteria for financial statement recognition or has any collection potential. For example, interest and penalties continue to accrue on write-offs, such as FDIC and RTC cases, as well as on exam assessments where the taxpayers have not agreed to the validity of the assessments.

As we reported, IRS received an unqualified opinion on its financial statements. However, as discussed in this report, we identified six material weaknesses in IRS\u2019 internal controls.
