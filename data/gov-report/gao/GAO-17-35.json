USAID and State initially funded Ebola activities using funds already appropriated. In December 2014, Congress appropriated approximately $2.5 billion to USAID and State, in part, for international efforts to prevent, prepare for, and respond to an Ebola outbreak and mandated that the agencies report periodically on their use of the funds. Congress also allowed the agencies to reimburse accounts for obligations incurred for Ebola activities prior to the fiscal year 2015 appropriation.", "The Act also included a provision for GAO to conduct oversight of USAID and State activities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the Ebola outbreak.

In the early stages of the U.S. response in West Africa, USAID obligated $883 million to control the outbreak, and State obligated $34 million for medical evacuations, among other activities. Subsequently, the United States shifted focus to mitigating second-order impacts, such as the deterioration of health services and food insecurity, and strengthening global health security. Accordingly, USAID obligated $251 million to restore health services, among other activities, and $183 million for activities such as strengthening disease surveillance, while State obligated $5 million for biosecurity activities.", "Of 271 reimbursements that USAID made for obligations incurred prior to the enactment of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2015 (the Act), USAID made 21 reimbursements, totaling over $60 million, that were not in accordance with the Act. These 21 reimbursements represent roughly 15 percent of the $401 million that USAID obligated for reimbursements, of the almost $1.5 billion that had been obligated as of July 1, 2016 (see fig.). For these 21 reimbursements, USAID did not reimburse the same appropriation accounts as the accounts from which it originally obligated the funds, and therefore it did not have legal authority to make these reimbursements. In addition, four reimbursements were for obligations that USAID did not document were for Ebola activities. In reviewing the reimbursements, GAO found that USAID does not have written policies or procedures for staff to follow in making and documenting reimbursements.

Although Ebola outbreaks  have occurred sporadically in Africa since 1976, there were more Ebola  cases and deaths during the 2014 outbreak than in all of the previous  outbreaks combined. In August 2014, the WHO Director-General  declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of  International  Concern.

In  addition, USAID and State initiated efforts to address second-order  effects and better prepare international health systems for future  outbreaks. USAID and State initiated Ebola response and preparedness  activities (Ebola activities) using current and prior year appropriations. In  December 2014, Congress enacted the Department of State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2015 (the Act),  which provided approximately $2.5 billion to USAID and State for  necessary expenses to prevent, prepare for, and respond to an Ebola  outbreak. The Act also directed State, in consultation with USAID, to  submit periodic reports to the Senate and House Committees on  Appropriations on the proposed uses of these funds on a country and  project basis.

We also reviewed the agencies\u2019 reports to Congress to  identify agencies\u2019 reported use of the funds. To examine USAID\u2019s  reimbursements, we analyzed USAID data and documentation to  determine the dates and amounts of obligations that the agency incurred  for Ebola activities prior to the enactment of the Act, the appropriation  accounts that funded the obligations, and the amounts of the  reimbursements. In addition, we interviewed USAID and State officials  about the collection and reporting of the funding data and the agencies\u2019  use of funding for Ebola activities.

Health-care resources in these countries were diverted from other  programs to Ebola response efforts, and some patients and health-care  workers avoided health facilities for fear of contracting the disease.  USAID also noted that these countries experienced job loss, disruptions  to trade, reduced agricultural production, decreased household  purchasing power, and increased food insecurity as a consequence of the  outbreak. The closure of international borders in response to the outbreak  hampered economic activity by limiting trade and restricting the  movement of people, goods, and services.

Following the  declarations, USAID and CDC deployed medical experts to West Africa to  augment existing staff in each of the affected countries. In August 2014, a  USAID-led Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployed to  West Africa.

In July 2016, in  response to our inquiry, USAID prepared a memorandum to attest  that the original obligation was approximately $1.3 million and funded  technical assistance for Ebola preparedness to 13 African countries.  In another instance, USAID reimbursed $500,000 for an obligation  incurred for the preparation of laboratories to detect Middle East  Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and other acute respiratory infections  in the Africa region. However, USAID was unable to provide us  documentation showing how the obligation funded activities related to  the Ebola outbreak.", "Because USAID did not have the legal authority to make the  reimbursements that were not in accordance with the reimbursement  provisions in the Act, these 21 reimbursements represent unauthorized  transfers. Further, the Antideficiency Act prohibits an agency from  obligating or expending more than has been appropriated to it.

In addition, because USAID did not have written  policies and procedures for maintaining documentation of the  reimbursements, USAID officials spent several months locating records to  demonstrate to us that USAID had reimbursed 250 obligations in a  manner consistent with the provisions of the Act.

In particular,  USAID did not in all cases reimburse the same appropriation accounts  from which it obligated funds as required by the Act, and in several  instances it made reimbursements for obligations for which it did not  document that it incurred the obligation to prevent, prepare for, and  respond to the Ebola outbreak.
