GAO's review of 45 cases tracked in CATS revealed that SEC complied with its policy for improved data entry, a step that contributes to improving the overall reliability of SEC's collection data. However, GAO identified additional actions that SEC can take to enhance CATS's usefulness for key users, such as attorneys, collection monitors, and case management specialists in the Division of Enforcement. SEC is currently addressing this issue through a multiyear effort to comprehensively upgrade CATS. Agency officials estimate that the upgrade, which will be completed in phases, will be fully complete in 2008. SEC has also addressed some previous recommendations made to strengthen management of its collection program, such as increasing its collection staff and referring eligible delinquent cases to the Department of the Treasury's (Treasury) Financial Management Service (FMS) on a timely basis. However, SEC must take further steps to address other recommendations designed to enhance management's evaluation of program performance. During this review, GAO identified new issues that warrant SEC management attention. For example, although SEC has increased the number of staff devoted to collection efforts, the agency has neither developed a method to ensure that adequate and consistent supervision is provided to them, nor has it formally assessed whether its additional resources are being used effectively. SEC also has not developed a procedure by which to ensure that two key units, both responsible for tracking collection activity, are effectively communicating and coordinating with one another. Since implementing Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (commonly known as the Fair Fund provision), SEC has instructed its staff to aggressively use the provision and estimates designating over $4.8 billion for return to harmed investors as a result of the provision's enactment. However, to date, only a small amount of the funds have been distributed. According to SEC, distribution is often a lengthy process that can be further complicated by external factors such as a pending criminal indictment on the violator. GAO also found that SEC lacked a reliable method by which to identify and collect data on Fair Fund cases. SEC took action to address this issue, but efforts were still in their early stages. SEC has yet to analyze the data it has collected in order to fully determine the provision's effectiveness in returning an increased fund amount to harmed investors. CFTC implemented both recommendations from previous GAO reports related to controls over fingerprinting procedures and timely referral of eligible delinquent cases to Treasury's FMS."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) primary mission is to  protect investors and maintain the integrity of the securities markets.  Similarly, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) protects  market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive  practices related to the sale of certain commodity interests, including  futures and options. As a part of their responsibility to protect investors,  the agencies seek to ensure that individuals who violate federal securities  or futures laws and regulations take responsibility for their misdeeds. For  their enforcement actions to be successful, however, both agencies must  have collection and distribution programs that function effectively.", "In 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) to address  corporate malfeasance and restore investor confidence in the U.S.  securities markets. This legislation established numerous reforms to  increase investor protection, including Section 308(a), the Federal Account  for Investor Restitution provision, commonly known as the Fair Fund  provision. This provision allows SEC to combine civil monetary penalties  (CMP) and disgorgement amounts collected in enforcement cases to  establish a fund for the benefit of victims of securities law violations.  Disgorgement is a remedy designed to deprive defendants of their ill-gotten  gains derived from their illegal activities. Before the law was implemented,  any CMPs collected were remitted directly to the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), and only the amount of the actual disgorgement was  available to establish a fund for the benefit of victims. The new provision  reinforces the need for SEC to have an effective collection and distribution  program for both CMPs and disgorgement so that additional funds  collected as a result of the Fair Fund provision can benefit harmed  investors.", "GAO has issued a number of reports, including follow-up reports, on SEC  and CFTC\u2019s collection efforts and has made numerous recommendations  designed to help the agencies optimize their collection programs. Our  previous studies have shown that each agency continues to make  refinements and improvements in many areas but that some  recommendations designed to further strengthen their collection efforts  remained open. This study, responds to your requests that we reexamine  SEC and CFTC\u2019s actions to address 12 recommendations that remained  open from prior studies, but focuses primarily on SEC\u2019s activities because  SEC handles significantly more cases than CFTC and had the majority of  open recommendations. Specifically, this report (1) discusses SEC\u2019s  progress in addressing recommendations aimed at improving the tracking  of penalty and disgorgement collection data, (2) assesses the steps SEC has  taken to address recommendations on its management of the collection  program and other related issues, (3) evaluates SEC\u2019s implementation of  the Fair Fund provision, and (4) describes the actions CFTC has taken to  address previous recommendations.", "To evaluate SEC and CFTC\u2019s efforts to enhance their tracking of collection  data, we conducted a case file review at SEC to test the accuracy and  completeness of their data and reviewed CFTC\u2019s process for tracking and  managing its data. To obtain additional insight into each agency\u2019s collection  program, we reviewed pertinent documents, including flowcharts,  collection guidelines, position descriptions, court dockets,  computer-generated documents, memorandums of understanding, and  related laws. Further, we interviewed the appropriate management and  staff members at SEC and CFTC on their respective agency\u2019s collection and  data tracking processes. We also obtained and reviewed documents on  delinquent case referrals from Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Services  (FMS). To assess SEC\u2019s efforts regarding performance measures and  oversight of self-regulatory organizations (SRO) and SEC and CFTC\u2019s  fingerprinting initiatives, we interviewed key officials at both agencies  regarding actions they were taking to address the weaknesses identified  and reviewed relevant documents. In regard to the Fair Fund provision in  SOX, we obtained relevant documentation and discussed SEC\u2019s  implementation approach with the appropriate officials. To calculate each  agency\u2019s penalty and disgorgement collection rate, we obtained  information on monies ordered and collected from SEC and CFTC for the  period beginning September 1, 2002, and ending December 31, 2004. We  conducted our work from August 2004 to August 2005 in Washington, D.C.,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To accomplish its mission, the agency established  four strategic goals: (1) to enforce compliance with federal securities laws,  (2) to sustain an effective and flexible regulatory environment, (3) to  encourage and promote informed investment decision making, and (4) to  maximize the use of SEC\u2019s resources.", "CFTC, established in 1974, performs a comparable role in the futures  industry. Its primary mission is to protect market users and the public from  fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to the sale of commodity  futures and options and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound  commodity futures and options markets. CFTC has set three strategic goals  to support its mission: (1) to ensure the economic vitality of the commodity  futures and option markets; (2) to protect market users and the public; and  (3) to ensure market integrity in order to foster open, competitive, and  financially sound markets.", "Both SEC and CFTC are independent agencies that have five-member  presidentially-appointed commissions that are led by chairmen who are  designated by the President. SEC and CFTC\u2019s headquarters are located in  Washington, D.C.; SEC has a combination of 11 regional and district offices;  CFTC has 5 regional offices.", "In keeping with its mission, each agency has a regulatory responsibility to  protect investors by ensuring the integrity of the securities and commodity  futures markets. Once SEC or CFTC staff conducts an investigation and  determines that a person or company has violated the law and should be  charged, the agency authorizes a civil suit against the alleged violator in  federal district court or a proceeding before an administrative law judge.  On finding that a defendant has violated securities or futures laws, the  court or the administrative law judge can issue a judgment ordering  sanctions such as CMPs, disgorgement, and/or restitution. However, the  agencies may decide not to seek disgorgement or restitution because it is  found to be unwarranted\u2014for example, if a violator did not make a profit  from the illegal activity. Table 1 provides more information on some of the  remedies available to a federal district court or an administrative law judge.", "SEC and CFTC both have collection programs and designated staff to track,  collect, and manage CMPs and disgorgement or restitution orders.  Specifically, as shown in figure 1, staff in SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement  (Enforcement) use the Case Activity Tracking System (CATS) to track  investigations, enforcement actions, and matters under inquiry (issues that  have the potential to turn into investigations).", "When a case has been delinquent for at least 10 days, SEC and CFTC staff  can send a demand letter to a violator. The Debt Collection Improvement  Act of 1996 (DCIA) requires all federal agencies, including SEC and CFTC,  to refer non-tax debt more than 180 days delinquent to the Secretary of the  Treasury for purposes of centralized administrative offset. Once such a  referral is received, Treasury\u2019s FMS activates the Treasury Offset Program  (TOP), under which outstanding debts, including amounts due to SEC or  CFTC as a result of judgments or settlement agreements, are collected by  the withholding of federal payments that the government owes the debtor,  such as tax refunds. During its collection efforts, FMS may negotiate  compromise offers with debtors unable to pay the entire amount of a  judgment and may accept less than the full amount if doing so is the only  way to ensure that the violator pays at least some of the debt owed. SEC  and CFTC must approve such offers for violators under their purview and  may reject an offer or ask for further information if the supporting  documentation is not satisfactory.", "In general, when a disgorgement fund is established, SEC attorneys can  propose appointing a receiver to develop and administer a distribution plan  to facilitate the collection of disgorgement and, in the case of Fair Funds,  both CMPs and disgorgement, and the distribution of those funds to  harmed investors. Receivers act independently of SEC and defendants in  conducting their prescribed duties. They have primary responsibility for  establishing the distribution plan, including a description of the actions  that will be taken to identify harmed investors, and for ensuring that the  appropriate taxes are deducted from the monies collected.", "Before Congress passed SOX, SEC could return only funds collected from  disgorgement to persons who had suffered financial harm from securities  violations. However, Section 308 (a) of the act allows SEC to add CMPs to  disgorgement funds. Section 308 (c) of the act also requires SEC to report  on the approaches the agency used, before the Fair Fund provision, to (1)  provide compensation to harmed investors and (2) to improve the  collection rates for CMPs and disgorgement, in order to establish a  benchmark for further action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Made Progress in Improving the Accuracy and Usefulness of Data It Collects, but Continued Attention Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["Our previous reports contained two recommendations that remained open  related to SEC\u2019s tracking of collection data. First, in 2002, we  recommended that SEC develop appropriate procedures to ensure the  accuracy and timeliness of information maintained in the Disgorgement  Payment Tracking System (DPTS), which was the tracking system SEC  used at the time to monitor disgorgement that had been ordered, waived, or  collected. Second, in 2003, we recommended that SEC take the steps  necessary to implement an action plan to replace DPTS with a new and  improved collection tracking system. SEC has made progress in addressing  these two recommendations by discontinuing its use of DPTS, modifying  CATS to capture financial information, and establishing an improved  procedure for entering data into CATS. Nevertheless, our fiscal year 2004  audit of SEC\u2019s financial statements disclosed inadequate internal controls  over its reporting of penalty and disgorgement transactions. SEC plans to  address this finding by strengthening its policies and its internal controls  over existing processes. In addition, we found, and SEC agreed that  opportunities exist to improve CATS\u2019s usefulness.

Our 2002 review of a sample of 57 enforcement cases found that 18 cases,  or approximately 32 percent, contained at least one error in the amount of  disgorgement ordered, waived, or collected, or in the status of the case or  of the individual violators. We found that the sources used as a basis for  entering data into DPTS did not always provide the most accurate  information. For example, we reported that staff in SEC\u2019s Office of the  Secretary, who were responsible for entering data into DPTS, relied heavily  on SEC litigation releases that, according to the staff, did not contain all the  details of a disgorgement order. The staff also said that they did not  independently verify the information in the litigation releases. In January  2003, an independent accountant confirmed that information in DPTS was  not current and complete and reported that the system could not be relied  upon for financial accounting and reporting purposes. As of October 2003,  SEC discontinued its use of DPTS.", "SEC began using CATS to capture the financial information that DTPS had  tracked. This change was part of larger modifications to CATS made in  response to a legislative requirement that SEC prepare audited financial  statements for submission to Congress and the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB). SEC modified CATS by adding fields to capture the  necessary financial data\u2014such as the amount of CMPs and disgorgement  ordered, collected, and distributed\u2014and established a policy of entering  data on the amount of disgorgement and CMPs only if valid supporting  documentation was available. SEC staff said they began collecting  original source documents\u2014copies of signed and stamped final judgments,  administrative orders, and court dockets\u2014from SEC\u2019s headquarters,  regional, and district offices. SEC staff also told us that they entered  financial data only for those cases with an open enforcement action as of  October 1, 2002, the beginning of fiscal year 2003. As of February 2005,  SEC staff said that they had entered data on almost all of the approximately  4,500 enforcement cases, which involved over 12,000 defendants and  respondents that met SEC\u2019s criterion.", "We reviewed a sample of 45 cases tracked in CATS and determined that  SEC had complied with its policy for improving data entry, which is consistent with our previous recommendation. Specifically, we found  supporting source documents for each of the 45 case files we reviewed and  were able to compare information from the source documents with the  data in CATS (as reflected in a March 2005 printout). However, our  comparison identified one $300,000 discrepancy on the amount of  disgorgement ordered and entered in CATS.", "Although SEC has made progress in improving the reliability of CATS  collection data, in May 2005, we reported that SEC had inadequate controls  over its penalty and disgorgement activities, which increased the risk that  such activities would not be completely, accurately, and properly recorded  and reported for management\u2019s use in decision making.

Some staff, whose  positions were recently established to better track and report collection  activities, have expressed concerns about CATS\u2019s limited reporting and  search capabilities. To compensate for these limitations, we found that  collection staff in each of SEC\u2019s headquarters, district, and regional offices  are using their own ad hoc collection database\u2014outside of and separate  from CATS\u2014to track the status of delinquent cases. According to the  collection staff, these databases allow for faster reporting and retrieval of  information than CATS but, because they also require the staff to enter  some data twice, using additional databases could lead to inefficiencies.", "To address the various concerns of key users, including attorneys, case  management specialists, and collection monitors, and to strengthen the  inadequate internal controls identified in the 2004 financial statement  audit, SEC has begun a multiyear effort to upgrade CATS. SEC staff said  that they are trying to transform what is essentially a case tracking system  into a case management system that would be useful to a broader range of  users. For example, as part of the upgrade effort, SEC is seeking to allow  attorneys to generate customized reports on their cases, search for  information in memorandums, and establish a system that would notify  staff and remind them of deadlines in their cases. According to SEC\u2019s Office  of Information and Technology, the upgraded system is also expected to  address the needs of case management specialists and collection monitors  by capturing and reporting data they require, eliminating the need for the  separate databases. In December 2004, SEC released a draft requirements  analysis for the upgraded system that contained steps to address the  concerns of SEC\u2019s user community.

Because this  lapse in oversight could have allowed inappropriate persons to enter the  securities industry, we recommended that SEC establish controls to ensure  that fingerprints sent by SROs to the FBI actually belong to the applicants.  In July 2004, SEC and CFTC formed a task force with representatives from  several of their SROs to enhance controls over existing fingerprinting  guidelines. Using the FBI\u2019s guidance on the best practices for preventing  fingerprinting fraud in civil and criminal cases, the task force developed a  set of improved fingerprinting guidelines, including a suggestion that  applicants present two forms of identification instead of one immediately  before fingerprints are taken or submit an attestation form in addition to  the standard U4 attestation form.

We suggested other  measures that SEC could consider, including tracking the percentage of  disgorgement funds returned to harmed investors, measuring the  timeliness of various collection actions, and tracking the number of  violators ordered to pay disgorgement who go on to commit other  violations. The last measure would help determine whether the agency\u2019s  disgorgement orders were having a deterrent effect.", "During this review, we found that SEC had developed a performance  measure for timeliness and included it in the agency\u2019s 2004 annual  performance plan but had not collected data on this measure or reported  on its results. The agency\u2019s timeliness measure, according to SEC\u2019s 2004  Performance Plan, is the \u201cnumber and percent of defendants/respondents  subject to delinquent disgorgement orders during the fiscal year for which  the Enforcement staff did not formulate a judgment recovery plan within 60  days after the debt became delinquent.\u201d This measure could potentially be  useful in tracking staff efforts to recover delinquent debt and comply with  SEC\u2019s recently established collection guidelines. However, in its 2004\u20132009  Strategic Plan and 2004 Performance and Accountability Report, SEC  continued to use only the collection rate as its sole measure of collection  performance. SEC staff acknowledged\u2014and we have previously  noted\u2014that using only the collection rate had inherent limitations but  added that the agency continued to use it because Congress and other  agencies had come to expect that SEC would report the measure. While  reporting the collection rate may serve other goals, it is not a meaningful  performance measure and, as a result, SEC cannot fully determine the  effectiveness of its collection program.", "During this review, we calculated SEC\u2019s collection rate for all cases (open  and closed), as well as a separate rate for closed cases only. As shown in  table 3, SEC\u2019s penalty collection rate for closed cases between September  2002 and December 2004 ranged from 72 percent to 100 percent and for all  cases from 34 percent to 86 percent.", "While the percentage collected is a limited measure, as noted above, these  rates represent a significant increase from the 40 percent collection rate for  CMPs SEC averaged from January 1997 through August 2002. During 2003,  SEC imposed about $1 billion in penalties, up from about $85 million in  2002. According to SEC staff, from September 2002 through August 2004,  SEC brought enforcement actions against large, well-financed entities such  as mutual funds and major corporations that had been accused of financial  fraud. Because SEC collected most of the penalties imposed in these large  cases, its collection rate was significantly higher than in previous years.  SEC management told us that the agency\u2019s collection rate is heavily  influenced by the nature of the entity that the agency sues and noted that, if  SEC sued companies or issuers that were not well-financed, its collection  rate would likely fall.", "As shown in table 4, for disgorgement levied on closed cases between  September 2002 and August 2004, SEC\u2019s collection rate ranged from 56  percent to 100 percent and from 13 percent to 34 percent for all cases  during the same period.", "These rates also represent a substantial increase over the collection rate of  14 percent for all cases involving a disgorgement order between 1995 and  November 2001. We reported in 2002 that the collection rate for CMPs  tends to be higher than the collection rate for disgorgement because SEC  can take into account a violator\u2019s ability to pay when imposing a penalty  but cannot do so when imposing a disgorgement. We also reported that  many violators ordered to pay a penalty are members of the securities  industry and are motivated to pay their CMPs in order to maintain their  reputation within the industry. However, we reported that many violators  ordered to pay large disgorgement orders are either not members of the  securities industry or have no desire to remain so. As we have discussed in  previous reports, these factors make using the disgorgement collection rate  as the sole performance measure problematic and highlight the need for  SEC to continue its efforts to develop alternative performance measures  for collection activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Is Working to Capture Data on Amounts Distributed and Receivers\u2019 Fees", "paragraphs": ["In previous GAO reports, we determined that SEC did not have a  centralized system for monitoring information on distribution amounts and  receiver fees, making it difficult for the agency to assess the overall  effectiveness of distribution efforts and ensure that harmed investors  received the maximum amount of recovered funds. We recommended that  SEC better manage disgorgement cases by tracking this information on  both an aggregate and individual case basis. In the past, SEC stated that it  did not believe that aggregating this data would help determine how well it  was managing collection cases or that being able to assess the  reasonableness of receiver fees would necessarily provide information on  whether defrauded investors should have or could have received more  funds. SEC had also identified a number of obstacles that hampered its  ability to address our recommendation\u2014for example, the CATS database,  which was designed to track individual case information but not to  aggregate it. Further, we were told that the agency lacked the information  necessary to identify the amounts allocated to defrauded investors and  receivers\u2019 fees, and SEC staff told us that they did not always know how  much receivers were paid. As a result, the agency has had to rely on the  courts to provide this information, but the courts have not consistently  provided it.", "During our work for this report, we learned that, despite its concerns about  these obstacles, SEC had begun to make some progress in addressing this  open recommendation. Specifically, SEC has updated CATS to identify  distribution data and is in the process of drafting a standard form that will  be used to request information from the courts on receivers\u2019 fees. If the  courts respond to SEC\u2019s requests for this information, the agency should be  better able to assess how well overall distribution efforts are working and  whether harmed investors are being reimbursed the maximum amounts  possible for actions taken against them by securities law violators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uneven Supervision Reduces Assurance That Staff Are Following Collection Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["In our 2002 study, we found that SEC\u2019s collection program lacked clear  policies and procedures specifying the actions that staff should take to  pursue collections. We commented that the lack of such guidance affected  both staff and management, since staff were not held accountable to any  clear standards and management could not determine whether staff took  all collection actions promptly, or ensure that opportunities to maximize  collection were not missed. We recommended that SEC develop and  implement collection guidelines and develop controls to ensure that staff  follow them. Consistent with the first part of this recommendation, SEC  has developed and implemented collection guidelines that specify the  various collection actions staff can take, explain when such activities  should be considered, and stipulate how frequently they should be  performed. SEC has also hired additional resources to perform specific  tasks outlined in its collection guidelines. However, uneven supervision has  reduced the assurance that staff are following these guidelines.", "According to SEC management, the primary control in place to ensure that  staff followed these guidelines is a periodic review, conducted by the lead  collection attorney, of the 12 individual collection databases that collection staff use to track delinquent cases. However, this periodic review may not  be timely or effective since it could result in noncompliance with the  guidelines or errors being undetected for an unspecified amount of time.  Further, we found that some of the individuals involved in the collection  process in some of SEC\u2019s regional offices\u2014specifically monitors and case  management specialists\u2014have supervisors who are not directly involved  and may lack detailed knowledge of the collection guidelines. In addition,  the level of supervision varies by location. For example, one of the regional  case management specialists told us that an associate regional director  oversees her work by reviewing a weekly CATS report that she generates.

Specifically, we found that SEC lacks (1) a formal mechanism to monitor  the effectiveness of the collection staff, (2) appropriate guidance and  training for some collection staff, and (3) effective communication and  coordination between two key units responsible for tracking collection  activity. First, SEC does not have a formal mechanism to assess whether  the increased collection resources are being used effectively. SEC  management believes that the new collection resources have increased  overall collection efforts and allowed enforcement attorneys to devote  more time to investigating potential violations by reassigning some  collection-related administrative duties. However, without a formal process  for determining the effectiveness of the increased resources, SEC cannot  validate these benefits. SEC management explained that they have focused  their attention on making changes to the collection process in preparation  for the first external financial audit and thus have not yet been able to focus  on assessing the effectiveness of the collection staff\u2019s activities. As SEC\u2019s  collection process stabilizes, a formal approach to gathering and analyzing  input from Enforcement staff attorneys that have interacted with collection  staff would help determine whether the new staff positions were being  used effectively and whether any improvements could be made.", "Second, our interviews with some of the case management specialists and  collection monitors disclosed that some of the staff felt that they had not  received sufficient guidance or training on new protocols for the collection  procedures. SEC management told us that the agency had periodically  added new protocols to the established procedures for tracking penalty  and disgorgement data to help the agency prepare for its first external  financial audit. In particular, SEC staff said that they had revised some  internal controls and policies and procedures related to data entry and  added additional data entry screens to CATS. Although new protocols  addressing these changes have been communicated to the collection staff  through various methods such as e-mails, monthly meetings, and monthly  notifications, some of the collection staff identified the need for additional  guidance. Moreover, some of them said that they would like to receive  training on issues addressed in policy updates, as well as receive more  formal training in how to interpret legal documentation such as judgments  and how to work with FMS on collection issues. SEC management said that  the agency has planned a workshop for the staff in late 2005 to provide  information on these and related issues and anticipates that it will help  meet some of the needs that staff have identified. Such attention should  help the collection staff perform their duties more effectively.", "Third, since August 2004, Enforcement and the Office of Financial  Management (OFM) staff have shared responsibility for tracking and  maintaining penalty and disgorgement data in CATS, but the units lack  formal procedures to ensure that their staffs communicate and coordinate  activities. To prepare for the external financial statement audit, SEC  transferred responsibility for entering financial data in CATS from  Enforcement to OFM, since penalty and disgorgement activity are recorded  in SEC\u2019s financial statements. Under the terms of the transfer, Enforcement  would still enter most of the case-related data into CATS, such as the  names of defendants and dates of judgments and orders, and OFM would  enter data on the amounts of money ordered, collected, and distributed.  However, this division of responsibilities has not always been effective. For  instance, Enforcement staff need timely and complete information on  amounts that have been collected in order to take appropriate collection  actions, but communication with OFM staff is not always consistent and  timely, making coordination difficult. As an example, when OFM staff enter  financial data into CATS, they do not always notify Enforcement, so that  Enforcement staff must periodically check CATS to find out whether  money has been collected and, in some instances, must contact OFM to  determine the status of a case. Further, OFM is not always timely in  entering data, resulting in delays that could hinder Enforcement staff\u2019s  collection efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SEC Emphasizes Its Commitment to Implementing the Fair Fund Provision but Has Been Slow in Distributing Funds and Assessing Results", "paragraphs": ["SEC demonstrated its commitment to effectively implementing the Fair  Fund provision of SOX by taking several steps.

SEC has issued guidance to its staff on interpreting and applying the  provision\u2014for example, explaining that ordering a disgorgement for as  little as $1 can qualify a case as a Fair Fund case and make CMPs eligible  for distribution. Among other cases, SEC applied this method in SEC v.  Lucent Technologies, in which the company agreed to pay a settlement of  $25 million in CMPs and $1 in disgorgement. In this particular case, SEC  charged the company and 10 individuals with fraudulently and improperly  recognizing approximately $1.148 billion of revenue and $470 million in  pretax income during fiscal year 2000\u2014a violation of generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP).", "The guidance also highlights several other important aspects of the Fair  Fund provision. It discusses the legal and practical aspects of seeking  disgorgement, including estimating the amount the defendant obtained  illegally. It also instructs staff to include language preserving SEC\u2019s ability  to establish a Fair Fund at a later date in cases that are settled early before  it has been decided whether the Fair Fund provision will be invoked.  Finally, SEC requires that language be added to judgments in all Fair Fund  cases prohibiting violators from using amounts collected under a judgment  to offset potential later judgments levied in third-party lawsuits. Because  allowing such offsets could reduce the amount of money investors received  in these lawsuits, the SEC language also stipulates that even if a court  allows offset language in later judgments, the violator is obligated to pay  the difference.

At the time of our review,  although SEC has collected money for 73 of the 75 cases they identified,  approximately $60 million from only three cases have been distributed to  harmed investors, and funds totaling about $25 million from only one other  case were being readied for distribution.", "SEC\u2019s rules regarding Fair Funds and disgorgement funds states that  \u201cunless ordered otherwise, the Division of Enforcement shall submit a  proposed plan no later than 60 days after the respondent has turned over  the disgorgement\u2026.\u201d However, SEC staff observed that appointing a  receiver to establish a plan for distributing funds can sometimes be a  lengthy process that can be further complicated by factors beyond the  agency\u2019s control. For example, in one case, an analysis of an extensive  trading history had to be conducted, in order to determine issues such as  the extent to which funds were diluted and the shareholders were harmed,  and to determine how to deal with tax considerations for the distribution  recipients. In another instance, a company agreed to pay $80 million in  disgorgement, CMPs, and interest, but a pending criminal indictment  prevented SEC from distributing any funds until the criminal case is  resolved. SEC acknowledged that the agency has an obligation to distribute  funds to harmed investors in a timely manner and that SEC collection  attorneys have begun to take on some of the tasks associated with  distribution in an effort to expedite the distribution process.

SEC management also has used data from CATS, Treasury\u2019s  Bureau of Public Debt database, and discussions with attorneys to compile  information on Fair Fund cases, but this method also has limitations  because it does not employ a reliable data entry process using source  documents that account for all the cases.

In addition, SEC staff said that information on all Fair  Fund cases created before these modifications would be retroactively  entered into the system.

However,  these amounts alone may not be appropriate measures of the program\u2019s  success since harmed investors do not necessarily receive all the money. A  more comprehensive indicator could include the amount of CMPs ordered  as a direct result of the Fair Fund provision, the actual amounts distributed,  and the length of time required to distribute the funds.

We concluded that for purposes of this report, the data provided by  SEC were sufficiently reliable.", "To assess the steps SEC has taken to address our earlier recommendations  on its management of the collection program and related issues, we  conducted relevant testing of procedures, including those related to  referrals and approvals of compromise offers, interviewed staff from SEC  and other agencies involved in SEC\u2019s collection activities, and reviewed  pertinent documents. Specifically, to evaluate the effectiveness of SEC\u2019s  procedures for referring delinquent cases to the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Financial Management Service (FMS) both before  and after the collection guidelines were established, we interviewed SEC  staff to discuss the activities they took recently to refer delinquent cases to  FMS. Using our sample of 45 cases, we identified those that met the  criteria for referral and used FMS\u2019s records to verify that the cases had  been referred and determine how quickly SEC submitted the referrals.  Next, to assess SEC\u2019s efforts to address our 2003 recommendation that the  agency work with the securities and futures self-regulatory organizations  (SRO) to address weaknesses in controls over fingerprinting procedures,  we interviewed SEC staff to discuss actions taken since we made our  recommendation and the status of the fingerprinting guidelines. We also  obtained a draft copy of the guidelines and reviewed the additional controls  that had been proposed to prevent inappropriate persons from being  admitted to the securities industry.", "To assess SEC\u2019s progress in tracking SROs\u2019 disciplinary actions and in  implementing a new database to track them\u2014a recommendation from our  2003 report\u2014we reviewed the results of the analyses that SEC\u2019s Office of  Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) conducted of these  actions, as of May 2005, and an internal planning document that OIT had  prepared. We also interviewed OCIE and OIT staff about the efforts each  office had made to address the recommendation. Further, to address a  recommendation related to approval of compromise offers from FMS, we  assessed SEC\u2019s efforts to improve its timeliness by obtaining and analyzing  data from SEC and FMS on all of the 12 compromise offers presented by  FMS between July 15, 2003, and January 6, 2005, to determine whether SEC  had met its internal time frame. We also interviewed SEC and FMS staff to  discuss the effectiveness of SEC\u2019s policies and procedures and to obtain  information on SEC\u2019s efforts to work with FMS to ensure the timely  approval of offers.", "In addition, to determine whether SEC had implemented our 2002  recommendation that it complete an evaluation of options for addressing  its competing priorities and increasing workload by assessing the  feasibility of contracting out certain collection functions or increasing staff  devoted to collections, we reviewed SEC\u2019s study pursuant to a mandate in  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) to obtain the results of the feasibility assessment. We also reviewed and followed up on the status of the  Securities Fraud Deterrence and Investor Restitution Act, introduced in the  108th Congress, which included a number of legislative proposals that SEC  had recommended in its study, such as contracting with private collection  agencies to collect delinquent debt owed to the agency.  Further, we  interviewed SEC staff to discuss recent measures taken by the agency to  increase its collection staff. Moreover, to determine if SEC had established  alternative measures to its collection rates, as recommended in our 2002  report, we reviewed the agency\u2019s 2004-2009 Strategic Plan, 2004  Performance Plan, and 2004 Performance and Accountability Report for  collection indicators and interviewed staff in Enforcement to obtain their  views on using alternative measures. In addition, to determine whether  SEC had promptly implemented its collection guidelines and taken action  to ensure that staff followed them, we reviewed the collection guidelines  and job descriptions for case management specialists. We conducted  structured interviews with nine collection staff members, including two  attorneys, one regional collection monitor, one paralegal, and five case  management specialists, three of whom also perform collection monitors\u2019  duties, to discuss their duties in relations to the collection guidelines and  their views on the level of training they have received. SEC management  selected these individuals based on our criteria that we speak with one- third of the new collection staff. These staff members worked in  headquarters and regional offices in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, and Miami.  Finally, we reviewed collection checklists and screen printouts from the  databases used by collection staff and interviewed SEC officials who  manage the collection program and staff to discuss their role in SEC\u2019s case  tracking and collection process.", "To evaluate SEC\u2019s implementation of the Fair Fund provision, we reviewed  Section 308 (a\u2013c) of the act and performed a legislative search and legal  analyses. To determine how and when SEC applies the provision, we  reviewed information from SEC\u2019s Web site, the agency\u2019s CATS database, a  sample of distribution plans and rulings on cases to which the Fair Fund  provision had been attached, and SEC\u2019s Rules on Fair Fund and  Disgorgement Plans and interviewed relevant SEC staff. Further, to  determine the number of cases and the amount of CMPs and disgorgement  ordered and collected since the SOX was implemented in 2002, we  reviewed two internal documents that summarized Fair Fund cases and  amounts dated June 30, 2004, and April 22, 2005, and interviewed SEC staff  on their use of the data. In addition, to gain a better understanding of the  distribution process, we interviewed SEC staff on the data and controls  they used to ensure that appropriate amounts were being returned to  harmed investors.  Moreover, Section 308(c) of SOX required that SEC  report on (1) enforcement actions that SEC took to obtain CMPs or  disgorgement for the 5-year period prior to the act\u2019s implementation and (2)  methods SEC used to ensure that injured investors were being fairly  compensated. SEC issued this report in January 2003, and we reviewed it to  determine if SEC had met the legislation\u2019s requirement. We also performed  a legal analysis to assess whether receiving Fair Funds affected a harmed  investor\u2019s ability to sue a violator through private litigation.", "To describe the actions CFTC has taken to address previous  recommendations, we interviewed relevant CFTC staff, reviewed collection  documents they provided and relied on CFTC\u2019s Office of Inspector  General\u2019s (OIG) work. Specifically, to determine whether CFTC had  complied with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 by referring  delinquent debt to FMS, we relied primarily on CFTC OIG\u2019s findings  associated with this recommendation. In particular, we reviewed the OIG\u2019s  2004 and 2001 audit reports and supporting work papers for our  assessment of the timeliness of referrals. We also reviewed CFTC\u2019s  documents describing its collection workflow and processes and  interviewed CFTC\u2019s OIG staff and CFTC staff to discuss CFTC\u2019s procedures  on referring debt to FMS. Furthermore, to assess the actions CFTC has  taken to address our recommendation on strengthening fingerprinting  controls, we conducted our work on CFTC and SEC simultaneously. We  obtained a copy of the draft for the new fingerprinting guidelines and  reviewed them for additional controls to preclude inappropriate individuals  from being admitted to the futures industry.", "Finally, to calculate SEC\u2019s collection rates for CMPs and disgorgement and  CFTC\u2019s collection rates for CMPs and restitution, we requested data from  each agency on the amount of these sanctions ordered from September  2002 through August 2004 and collected through December 2004. We chose  September 2002 as the beginning of our time period in order to pick up  where our 2003 report ended. As with our 2003 report, we limited our  review to CMPs, disgorgement, and restitution ordered through August  2004 to allow SEC and CFTC through December 2004 (4 months) to attempt  collections. Also consistent with our 2003 report, we calculated SEC\u2019s and  CFTC\u2019s collection rates for all cases (open and closed cases) and closed  cases only. For purposes of our calculation, we defined open cases as  \u201ccases with a final judgment order that remained open while collection  efforts continued\u201d and closed cases as \u201ccases with a final judgment order  for which collection actions were completed.\u201d We relied on SEC and CFTC  to categorize cases as being open or closed, consistent with the above  definition. We did not independently verify either SEC or CFTC\u2019s  classification of a case as being open or closed. For data provided by both  agencies, we performed basic tests of the data\u2019s integrity, such as checks  for missing records and obvious errors. We concluded that the data  provided by SEC and CFTC, for purposes of this report, were sufficiently  reliable.", "We conducted our work from August 2004 to August 2005 in Washington,  D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC\u2019s Penalty and Restitution Collection Rates", "paragraphs": ["We calculated the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) civil  monetary penalties (CMP) and restitution collection rates to provide  updated information on CFTC\u2019s activities through December 2004. As in  our 2003 report, we calculated CFTC\u2019s collection rate for all cases (open  and closed) and closed cases only. As shown in table 5, from September  2002 through December 2004, CFTC\u2019s CMPs collection rate for all cases  ranged from 38 percent to 100 percent and for closed cases only from 98  percent to 100 percent.", "Like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CFTC also imposed  significantly larger amounts of CMPs from September 2002 through  December 2004 compared with previous years. For example, during 2003  CFTC imposed about $137 million in CMPs, up from $15.6 million in 2002.  According to CFTC officials, there were three reasons for the increase.  First, in 2002, CFTC was reorganized to leverage the Enforcement\u2019s  investigation and litigation resources. This reorganization allowed the  division to file more cases and ultimately it entered into an increased  number of judgments imposing a penalty. Second, by 2003, the  Enforcement division was engaged in an industrywide investigation of the  energy sector concerning attempted manipulation and false reporting  conduct, and settlements in these cases resulted in the imposition of  approximately $250 million in CMPs. Third, following reauthorization in  2001, CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction over investigations of foreign exchange fraud was  clarified; since that time, CFTC has begun to file more actions in this area.  In one case, according to CFTC officials, a court entered separate  judgments against the named defendants, imposing approximately $75  million in CMPs.", "However, unlike SEC\u2019s collection activity, CFTC\u2019s collection rate for CMPs  did not significantly increase over previous years. For example, from  September 2002 through December 2004 CFTC\u2019s CMPs collection rate for  all cases was 46 percent. From January 1997 through August 2002, the  agency\u2019s collection rate was 45 percent.", "As shown in table 6, CFTC\u2019s collection rate for restitution ranged from 4  percent to 8 percent for all cases and was 100 percent for closed cases only."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Karen Tremba, Assistant  Director, Emily Chalmers, Ronald Ito, Grant Mallie, Bettye Massenburg,  Marc Molino, David Pittman, Carl Ramirez, Omyra Ramsingh, and Cheri  Truett made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
