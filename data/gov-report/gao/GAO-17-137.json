The purpose of NASA's Commercial Crew Program is to facilitate the development of a domestic transport capability. In 2014, NASA awarded two firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing and SpaceX with a combined total value up to $6.8 billion for the development of crew transportation systems that meet NASA requirements and initial missions to the ISS. The contractors were originally required to provide NASA all the evidence it needed to certify that their systems met its requirements by 2017.", "A house report accompanying H.R. 2578 included a provision for GAO to review the progress of NASA's human exploration programs. This report examines the Commercial Crew Program including (1) the extent to which the contractors have made progress towards certification, (2) the risks facing the program, and (3) the extent to which the program has visibility into the contractors' efforts. To do this work, GAO analyzed contracts, schedules, and other documentation; and spoke with officials from NASA, the Commercial Crew Program, Boeing, SpaceX, and independent review bodies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Both of the Commercial Crew Program's contractors have made progress developing their crew transportation systems, but both also have aggressive development schedules that are increasingly under pressure. The two contractors\u2014Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies, Corp.

Both Boeing and SpaceX have determined that they will not be able to meet their original 2017 certification dates and both expect certification to be delayed until 2018, as shown in the figure below. The schedule pressures are amplified by NASA's need to provide a viable crew transportation option to the International Space Station (ISS) before its current contract with Russia's space agency runs out in 2019. If NASA needs to purchase additional seats from Russia, the contracting process typically takes 3 years. Without a viable contingency option for ensuring uninterrupted access to the ISS in the event of further Commercial Crew delays, NASA risks not being able to maximize the return on its multibillion dollar investment in the space station.", "Both contractors are also dealing with a variety of risks that could further delay certification, including program concerns about the adequacy of information on certain key systems to support certification. Another top program risk is the ability of NASA and its contractors to meet crew safety requirements.", "The Commercial Crew Program is using mechanisms laid out in its contracts to gain a high level of visibility into the contractors' crew transportation systems. The program is using a different model than every other spacecraft NASA has built for humans. For example, NASA personnel are less involved in the testing, launching, and operation of the crew transportation system. The program has developed productive working relationships with both contractors, but the level of visibility that the program has required thus far has also taken more time than the program or contractors anticipated. Ultimately, the program has the responsibility for ensuring the safety of U.S. astronauts and its contracts give it deference to determine the level of visibility required to do so. Moving forward though, the program office could face difficult choices about how to maintain the level of visibility it feels it needs without adding to the program's schedule pressures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Given the delays in the Commercial Crew Program, GAO recommends that NASA develop and report to Congress on its contingency plans for maintaining a U.S. presence on the ISS beyond 2018.

NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program is intended to end this  dependency by facilitating the commercial development of a crew  transportation system that can provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective  transportation to and from the ISS no later than 2017. NASA\u2019s goal is to  have one or more contractors that can provide crew transportation  services to the ISS, which is planned to be operational until at least 2024.", "NASA\u2019s acquisition strategy on the Commercial Crew Program is similar  to the one it used successfully on the Commercial Cargo program, but  different than every other spacecraft it has built for humans, from Mercury  to Gemini and Apollo to the Space Shuttle. Each contractor designs,  develops, builds, owns, and operates its spaceflight system and  infrastructure. The contractors have access to NASA\u2019s expertise and  resources throughout the development process, but NASA engineers are  not making design decisions and NASA personnel will be less involved in  processing, testing, launching, and operating the crew transportation  system.

For this review, we assessed (1) the extent to which the contractors have  made progress towards certification and the potential effects of any  certification delays on NASA\u2019s access to the ISS; (2) the major  programmatic and safety risks facing the program and the contractors;  and (3) the extent to which the program has visibility into the contractors\u2019  efforts. To assess the contractors\u2019 progress toward certification, we  reviewed program and contract documents, including quarterly progress  updates and monthly schedule summaries, as well as interviewed  program and contractor officials. We also reviewed information from  NASA\u2019s budget, its contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency, and  the ISS program to determine how NASA plans to mitigate the effects of  any certification delays on its access to the ISS. To assess major  programmatic and safety risks, we analyzed the program\u2019s monthly risk  charts and contractor documentation. We also interviewed program and  contractor officials to identify steps being taken to mitigate risks. To  assess the program\u2019s visibility into the contractors\u2019 efforts, we reviewed  program and contract documents, interviewed officials to identify  mechanisms NASA uses to gain visibility into the contractors\u2019 efforts, and  observed how these mechanisms functioned in practice for several key  contract events. For these events, we interviewed program and contractor  officials to learn how NASA uses various mechanisms to gain visibility,  analyzed supporting documents, and compared NASA\u2019s visibility to what  is defined in the contract.

Across the five phases, NASA has engaged several companies  using both agreements and contract vehicles to develop and demonstrate  crew transportation capabilities. As the program has passed through  these phases, NASA has generally narrowed down the number of  participants. The early phases of the program were under Space Act  agreements, which is NASA\u2019s other transaction authority. These types of  agreements are generally not subject to the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) and allow the government and its contractors greater  flexibility in many areas. Under these Space Act agreements, NASA  relied on the commercial companies to propose specifics related to their  crew transportation systems, including their design, the capabilities they  would provide, and the level of private investment. In these phases,  NASA provided technical support and determined if the contractors met  certain technical milestones. In most cases, NASA also provided funding.  For the final two phases of the program, NASA awarded FAR-based  contracts. By using FAR-based contracts, NASA gained the ability to levy  specific requirements on the contractors and procure missions to the ISS,  while continuing to provide technical expertise and funding to the  contractors. Under the contracts, NASA will also evaluate whether  contractors have met its requirements and certify their final systems for  use.

The ISS program levies a  set of 332 requirements that must be met by all visiting spacecraft,  whether they are carrying cargo or crew to the station. There are three  major areas outlined in the ISS requirements document: 1) interface  requirements for both the ISS and the spacecraft; 2) performance  requirements for ground systems supporting the spacecraft; and 3)  design requirements for spacecraft to ensure safe integration with the  ISS. The second set of requirements is levied by the Commercial Crew  Program. These include 280 high-level requirements related to the  design, manufacturing, testing, qualification, production, and operation of  crew transportation systems that deliver NASA astronauts to the ISS.  Contractors are responsible for developing the lower-level system  specifications and system and subsystem designs that implement those  requirements. For example, there is a Commercial Crew Program  requirement for the contractor\u2019s crew transportation system to provide a  continuous autonomous launch abort capability, in which the spacecraft  self-initiates the abort procedure independent from the supporting ground  systems, from lift-off through orbital insertion with a 95 percent probability  of success. The requirement does not specify how elements of the crew  transportation system, such as its sensors, software, propulsion, or  capsule, should be designed to fulfill it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Program Contracts", "paragraphs": ["In September 2014, NASA awarded firm-fixed-price contracts to Boeing  and SpaceX, valued at up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for  the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability phase.

This is in  contrast to a cost-reimbursement contract, in which the government  agrees to pay the contractor\u2019s reasonable costs regardless of whether  work is completed. During this phase, the contractors will complete  development of crew transportation systems that meet NASA  requirements, provide NASA with the evidence it needs to certify that  those systems meet its requirements, and fly initial crewed missions to  the ISS.

Under this  indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity line item, NASA must order at  least two missions from each contractor, which it has done, and can  order up to six missions. Each service mission is its own firm-fixed- price task order. NASA must certify the contractors\u2019 systems before  they can fly these missions.", "Contract Line Item 003 is an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity  line item for any special studies, tests, and analyses that NASA may  request. These tasks do not include any work necessary to  accomplish the requirements under contract line item 001 and 002. As  of September 2016, NASA had issued one order under this contract  line item to Boeing\u2014an approximately $180,000 study of the  spacecraft\u2019s seat incline. The maximum value of this contract line item  is $150 million.", "NASA divided the certification work under contract line item 001 into two  acceptance events: the ISS design certification review and the  certification review. An acceptance event occurs when NASA approves a  contractor\u2019s designs and acknowledges that the contractor\u2019s work is  complete and meets the requirements of the contract. The ISS design  certification review verifies the contractor\u2019s crew transportation system\u2019s  capability to safely approach, dock, mate, and depart from the ISS,  among other requirements. After the contractor has successfully  completed all its flight tests, as well as various other activities, the  certification review determines whether the crew transportation system  meets the Commercial Crew Program\u2019s requirements. The contractors  must complete both acceptance events to receive NASA certification.", "NASA and the contractors also identified discrete performance-based  events, called interim milestones, which occur as the contractors progress  towards the two acceptance events. Each interim milestone has pre- determined entrance and exit criteria that establish the work that must be  completed in order for the contractor to receive payment. The interim  milestones serve several functions, allowing the government to finance  work from development to completion, review the contractors\u2019 progress,  and provide approval to proceed with key demonstrations and tests.  These milestones are also used by the program to inform its annual  budget request. Since the contracts were awarded, the Commercial Crew  Program and the contractors have agreed to split several of the interim  milestones. The contractors have also added new milestones, in part to  capture changes in their development plans.", "NASA has also made changes to the contracts that have increased their  value. While the contracts are fixed-price, their values can increase if  NASA adds to the scope of the work or otherwise changes requirements.  As of October 2016, NASA had increased the value of contract line item  001 for Boeing by $47 million for hardware and software requirement  changes, and contract line item 001 for SpaceX by $91 million for a  hardware requirement change and the addition of cargo during an ISS  test flight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Oversight", "paragraphs": ["NASA has tailored its management approach for the Commercial Crew  Program because the contractors, not the government, are responsible  for the design, development, test, and evaluation of their crew  transportation systems and make their own decisions about when to  build, integrate, and test hardware. For example, NASA policy outlines  key decision point reviews, which allow NASA management to determine  if the program is ready to progress to the next phase. NASA  management relies on annual program reviews, instead of key decision  point reviews, to provide oversight of the Commercial Crew Program.  According to NASA management officials, they chose to do so because  the contractors\u2019 development approaches and schedules did not align  with NASA\u2019s typical key decision points. Other elements of the reviews  are similar though. For example, NASA\u2019s first annual review of the  program included updates on overall program risk, an update on the  program\u2019s cost and schedule risks, and perspectives from the  independent review board, much like a key decision point review. The  firm-fixed price nature of the current contracts also led NASA to alter its  typical management approach. For example, the NASA Associate  Administrator told us that he decided not to require an agency baseline  commitment\u2014cost or schedule baseline\u2014for the Commercial Crew  Program, in part, because the firm-fixed-price contracts with each  contractor essentially serve as the cost baselines for the program.", "NASA also provides regular updates to Congress on the Commercial  Crew Program through a variety of reporting mechanisms.

The current proposed schedule is the fourth  significant schedule change by Boeing since the contract was awarded.  The most recent schedule update includes delays related to a  manufacturing error. In September 2016, a subcontractor damaged a  major component of Boeing\u2019s second spacecraft during machining to trim  mass from the spacecraft. This is expected to delay delivery of the  component by 2-3 months, which is reflected in the current proposed  schedule. The second spacecraft is important because, according to  Boeing\u2019s program schedule, it will be used to support a significant portion  of Boeing\u2019s planned testing as well as its crewed flight test.", "Boeing also reduced the time between some key testing events that will  be used to provide data necessary for Boeing to demonstrate its ability to  meet NASA\u2019s requirements.

Although these events are not formal milestones  in Boeing\u2019s contract with NASA, they are critical learning events, and we  have previously found that reducing the time between key test events  limits time for the contractor to learn and adapt to any changes that may  be required.

SpaceX officials told us that they are working closely with  NASA to eliminate these cracks in order to meet NASA\u2019s stringent targets  for human rating. Specifically, SpaceX has made design changes that,  according to its officials, did not result in any cracking during initial life  testing. Finally, both the program and a NASA advisory group consider  SpaceX\u2019s plan to fuel the launch vehicle after the astronauts are on board  the spacecraft to be a potential safety risk. SpaceX\u2019s perspective is that  this operation may be a lower risk to the crew; NASA and SpaceX\u2019s risk  evaluation is ongoing. NASA and SpaceX may also need to re-examine  SpaceX\u2019s safety controls related to the fueling process if the investigation  of the September 2016 Falcon 9 mishap identifies issues with the fueling  of the vehicle.", "At the time of our review, SpaceX also had other elements in its design  that had not yet been completed and reviewed. SpaceX requested, and  the program approved, proposals to split its critical design review into  three reviews because portions of its design had not been ready at  previous reviews. The critical design review is the time in a project\u2019s life  cycle when the integrity of the product\u2019s design and its ability to meet  mission requirements are assessed, and it is important that a project\u2019s  design is stable enough to warrant continuation with design and  fabrication. A stable design can minimize changes prior to fabrication,  which can help avoid costly re-engineering and rework effort due to  design changes. SpaceX\u2019s final planned design review was held in  August 2016; however, the program reported that a number of  outstanding areas, primarily related to ground systems, still needed to be  reviewed. SpaceX officials told us these areas were reviewed in  November 2016. Further, according to SpaceX, these separate reviews  were in order to perform review of designs that were completed earlier  than anticipated, to allow SpaceX and NASA teams to focus in greater  detail on certain systems, and to accommodate design updates driven in  part by changes to NASA requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program and Its Contractors Could Have Difficulty Meeting Safety Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Commercial Crew Program has identified the ability of it and its  contractors to meet crew safety requirements as one of its top risks.  NASA established the \u201closs of crew\u201d metric as a way to measure the  safety of a crew transportation system. The metric captures the  probability of death or permanent disability to one or more crew members.  Under each contract, the current loss of crew requirement is 1 in 270,  meaning that the contractors\u2019 systems must carry no more than a 1 in 270  probability of incurring loss of crew. Near the end of the Space Shuttle  program, the probability of loss of crew was approximately 1 in 90.  Program officials told us that Commercial Crew is the first NASA program  that the agency will evaluate against a probabilistic loss of crew  requirement. They said that if the contractors cannot meet the agency  loss of crew requirement at 1 in 270, NASA could still certify their systems  by employing operational alternatives. This would entail a potentially  increased level of risk or uncertainty related to the level of risk for the  crew.", "Program officials told us their main focus is to work with the contractors to  ensure that the spacecraft designs are robust from a safety perspective.  The loss of crew metric and the associated models used to measure it are  tools that help achieve that goal. For example, Boeing told us that in early  2016, it needed to identify ways to reduce the mass of its spacecraft. As  Boeing found opportunities to reduce the spacecraft mass, the program  stated that it also had to consider how implementing those design  changes would affect its loss of crew analysis. According to the program,  it is working with both contractors to address the factors that drive loss of  crew risk through design changes or additional testing to gain more  information on the performance and reliability of systems.", "The Commercial Crew Program is tracking three main crew safety risks.  First, the contractors\u2019 computer models may not accurately predict the  loss of crew. These models are a weighted treatment of scenarios,  likelihoods, and consequences throughout the flight, and are continually  being updated by the contractors. According to program officials, they  have been working closely with the contractors to improve their loss of  crew models. For example, the program identified risk factors, such as  bird strikes, that were not included in the contractors\u2019 models and worked  to update them. Both contractors told us they have confidence in their  models to accurately predict the loss of crew risk associated with their  spacecraft. Second, the contractors\u2019 spacecraft may not be able to  tolerate the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment, which is the  most significant driver of the loss of crew metric, according to the  program\u2019s analysis. Both contractors have lowered this risk through  testing, which provides insight into how well their systems perform in  these environments, and by making design changes. If the contractors  have to make future design changes to improve their spacecraft\u2019s  performance in the debris environment, certification could be delayed  significantly. Finally, if the contractors cannot meet the loss of crew  requirement, there are several actions the Commercial Crew Program  could take to help meet it; but, according to the program, these actions  may not be enough to completely close the gap. The program has  reported it is exploring options, such as the use of ISS cameras to  conduct on-orbit inspections of the spacecraft."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Crew Program Has Visibility into Contractor Progress, but Maintaining Its Current Level of Visibility through Certification Could Add to Schedule Pressures", "paragraphs": ["The Commercial Crew Program is using contractually-defined  mechanisms to gain a high level of visibility into the contractors\u2019 crew  transportation systems to achieve its goal of obtaining safe, reliable, and  cost-effective access to and from the ISS.

The early upfront investment in time may  ultimately make the certification process go smoother, but the program  office could face difficult choices as the program progresses about how to  maintain the level of visibility into contractor efforts it feels it needs without  adding to the program\u2019s schedule pressures.

Contracting officials told us that the program included these  mechanisms because it was concerned that the typical fixed-price  inspection clauses may not give the program the level of visibility it felt it  would need in order to certify the contractors\u2019 systems for human  spaceflight. Using a firm-fixed-price contract for a human spaceflight  development program represents a different way of doing business for  NASA, which has typically used cost-reimbursement contracts for these  efforts due to their complexity and the risks involved. Cost-reimbursement  contracts require the government to maintain extensive visibility into a  contractor\u2019s technical progress and financial performance. The visibility  that NASA receives under its firm-fixed-price contracts with Boeing and  SpaceX is similar to that of cost-reimbursement type contracts, with the  exception that NASA does not receive any of the contractors\u2019 business- related cost and performance data such as earned value management.", "In order to gain the needed visibility into the contractors\u2019 efforts, the  Commercial Crew Program used a mix of standard and tailored contract  clauses. The program began by leveraging NASA\u2019s Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement, which contemplates NASA conducting  inspections and other quality assurance requirements through \u201cinsight\u201d  and \u201coversight.\u201d In the supplement,  insight is defined as the monitoring of contractor quality data and  government-identified metrics and contract milestones, and any  review of contractor work procedures and records; and oversight is defined as the government\u2019s right to concur or non-concur  with the contractor\u2019s decisions affecting product conformity, and non- concurrence must be resolved before the contractor can proceed.", "The Commercial Crew contracting officer explained that the program built  upon what is in the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement by  including an additional \u201cinsight clause\u201d in the contracts to set clear  expectations that the program intended to obtain extensive information  about how the contractors were meeting contract requirements. For  example, the Commercial Crew contracting officer told us that one such  expectation is that the contractors will provide the program access to  virtually all data produced under or relevant to the contract, including  subcontractor data.", "The insight clause includes three mechanisms for the program to gain  visibility into what progress the contractors are making and how the  contractors are performing work. The clause also requires each  contractor to develop an insight implementation plan for how it will provide  access and data to NASA and facilitate the program\u2019s visibility into its  crew transportation systems. Table 2 describes the three mechanisms  and provides examples of how NASA has used them to gain visibility into  the contractors\u2019 progress.", "The visibility that the Commercial Crew Program gains through the use of  these contract mechanisms is designed to assist in its oversight and final  certification of the contractors\u2019 crew transportation systems, as shown in  figure 4.", "The Commercial Crew Program and its contractors have made progress  working together to ensure the program obtains the level of visibility that it  feels it needs to achieve certification. All three organizations said that  their relationships and communication have improved over the course of  the contract, even as they have addressed difficult issues. For example,  program officials said that Boeing is doing a much better job of  communicating NASA\u2019s safety requirements to ULA than it did during  previous contract phases, and that ULA has made great strides  embracing a crew safety culture as demonstrated through its efforts to  understand the program\u2019s crewed flight requirements. We also heard a  strong consensus across several independent bodies and the contractors  that the Commercial Crew program manager is providing critical  leadership to the program to help the NASA workforce operate effectively  in the firm-fixed-price contract environment. For example, Aerospace  Safety Advisory Panel officials told us that, while they originally had  concerns about how the firm-fixed-price environment would work for a  human spaceflight development, they are confident in the progress of the  program and its future success because of the program manager\u2019s  leadership and transparency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustaining Program\u2019s Level of Visibility Might Be Difficult as Schedule Pressure Builds", "paragraphs": ["The Commercial Crew Program has developed productive working  relationships with both contractors, but the level of visibility that the  program has required thus far has also taken more time than the program  or contractors anticipated. The program\u2019s standing review board has  stated that the contract is structured to allow NASA unprecedented levels  of visibility, but that it was intended to be used primarily for high-risk  areas. However, the standing review board found, and both contractors  told us, that the program has requested high levels of visibility on most  items and there are signs that the contractors\u2019 patience is waning. Both  contractors expressed concerns that the program requests more  interaction and data than they originally anticipated at the time of the  contract award. For example, Boeing and SpaceX officials told us that the  program often requests additional in-person engagement with their  engineers, such as repeat presentations to multiple boards on the same  technical issue, and has also asked for the same data in multiple formats  or from multiple stakeholders. Program officials told us that they are  constantly working to find a balance between obtaining the visibility they  need to be able to eventually certify the crew transportation systems for  human spaceflight while giving the contractors room to independently  work through issues for their systems.", "As the Commercial Crew Program progresses, the program office could  also face difficult choices about how to maintain the level of visibility into  contractor efforts it feels it needs without adding to the program\u2019s  schedule pressures. Independent review bodies, including the standing  review board, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, and the NASA  Advisory Council-Human Exploration and Operations committee,  expressed concern that the program may not have the capacity to sustain  the level of visibility it has had to date and still meet the current  certification schedule. The early upfront investment in time may ultimately  make the certification process go smoother, but finding the right balance  of visibility, and recognizing that a high level of visibility takes time and  may impact the schedule, will be especially important as the contractors  approach final certification when the government will need to determine if  the systems are safe enough for human spaceflight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Office Workload Is an Emerging Schedule Risk", "paragraphs": ["Program officials told us that one of their greatest upcoming challenges  will be to keep pace with the contractors\u2019 schedules so that the program  does not delay certification.

In phase two, which is ongoing, the program  reviews and approves the contractors\u2019 hazard reports, and develops  strategies to verify and validate that the controls are effective. In phase  three, the contractors will conduct the verification activities and  incrementally close the reports.", "The Commercial Crew Program\u2019s review and approval of the contractors\u2019  hazard reports have taken longer than planned. The program originally  planned to complete phase two in early 2016 but currently does not  expect to complete this phase until June 2017. The Commercial Crew  Program has a goal of reviewing hazard reports within 8 weeks of  receiving them, but a recent report by the NASA Office of Inspector  General found that the reviews are taking longer than anticipated and a  backlog has developed. In response to the Inspector General\u2019s report,  NASA officials noted that, while the timeliness of the hazard review  process is important, what is more important is having thorough, detailed  hazard reports in order to understand safety risks and ensuring the safety  of each system. As of October 2016, the Commercial Crew Program had  approved 117 of the anticipated 195 hazard reports and planned to  approve approximately half of the remaining reports for both contractors  by the end of 2016. Program officials told us that the hazard reports that  are still open are related to items that they would not expect to be closed  because they involve some of the more complicated design work that the  contractors have not yet finalized. Program officials also pointed out other  ways that the contractors have contributed to phase two delays, including  receiving incomplete hazard reports that required several iterations before  the program could begin its formal review.", "The Commercial Crew Program\u2019s verification closure notice process,  which is used to verify that the contractors have met all requirements, is  one of the other key oversight activities and potential workload challenges  for the program. The program is completing that process concurrently  with the phased safety reviews. The verification closure process is  initiated by the contractor when it provides the program with data and  evidence to substantiate that it has met each requirement, and is  completed when the program has reviewed and approved the contractor\u2019s  evidence to verify that each requirement has been met. A verification  closure notice is required for each of the 332 ISS requirements, which are  applicable to anyone who docks with the station, and the 280 Commercial  Crew Program requirements. The Commercial Crew Program must also  approve a subset of verification closure notices before key tests or  milestones can occur. For example, the ISS requirements must be met  before SpaceX and Boeing\u2019s uncrewed flights to the ISS, which are  currently planned for November 2017 and June 2018, respectively. The  program\u2019s ability to smooth its workload is limited because the contractors  generally control their development schedules.

An independent review group initially raised concerns  about how well this model would work for a human spaceflight program.  Parts of the new business model have worked relatively well and NASA  has had the visibility it needs into the technical details and risks of each  system. Gaining this level of visibility has taken more time than the  program or contractors anticipated, but the early upfront investment in  time should ultimately make the certification process go smoother. In  addition, while the Commercial Crew Program should be mindful about  placing undue burdens on its contractors, it ultimately has the  responsibility for ensuring the safety of U.S. astronauts, and its contracts  with Boeing and SpaceX give it deference to determine the level of insight  required to do so.", "When the current phase of the Commercial Crew Program began, there  was widespread acknowledgment that the contractors\u2019 development and  certification schedules were aggressive, and the anticipated schedule  risks have now materialized. Both contractors\u2019 certification dates have  been delayed into 2018, and the program\u2019s analysis indicates that neither  contractor is likely to be ready until 2019. NASA has purchased seats for  U.S. astronauts on the Russian Soyuz vehicle, so that it can maintain an  uninterrupted presence on the ISS. But those seats will run out in spring  2019, at the latest, and it generally takes 3 years for NASA and Russia to  negotiate the purchase of additional seats. If delays on the Commercial  Crew Program persist, having contingency plans, including options to  expedite the purchase of additional Soyuz seats, will become increasingly  important to ensure an uninterrupted U.S. presence on the ISS.

We interviewed program and contractor  officials to discuss the contractors\u2019 recent progress as well as their  upcoming events and any expected delays. To identify total delays to  date, we compared original contract schedules to Boeing\u2019s October 2016  working schedule and SpaceX\u2019s November 2016 working schedule, which  identify their most recent proposed delays to some milestones. To identify  whether the contractors have introduced compression into their  schedules, we judgmentally selected four key events and analyzed the  movement of these key events relative to each other.

We selected the acceptance events, as these occur  when NASA approves a contractor\u2019s designs and acknowledges that the  contractor\u2019s work is complete and meets the requirements of the contract.  We selected the two flight tests for each contractor, as they are intended  to test key system capabilities including the ability to launch, dock with the  ISS, and return safely to Earth. Finally, to assess the potential effects of  any certification delays on NASA\u2019s access to ISS, we reviewed  information from NASA\u2019s budget, which includes the planned ISS launch  manifest, and its contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency for  transportation on the Soyuz vehicle.

We defined key events as those that are  necessary for final certification. We selected three key events to examine  for each contractor. We chose one historical event, so we could assess  how the program had gained visibility over an entire event, and one  upcoming event in both 2016 and 2017, in order to understand how the  program obtains visibility in advance of an event. For each event, we  obtained detailed information on how NASA obtained visibility and  analyzed supporting documentation for these events to corroborate the  information we obtained from NASA officials. In this report, we used these  events as examples when describing how the program uses its three  insight mechanisms and when describing the program\u2019s relationships with  its contractors.
