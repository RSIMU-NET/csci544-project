In New York state, USFS, for example, does not enter such underserved areas as Brooklyn and the Bronx because they are urban communities and the Forest Service restricts its activities to national forests. Second, national sponsors with an ethnic focus are reluctant to serve areas that do not have significant numbers of their constituent ethnic group. Third, certain national sponsors, to save on administrative costs, may prefer to concentrate SCSEP positions in fewer locations, increasing the ratio of program enrollees to administrators. Fourth, certain national sponsors may be reluctant to shift positions from an overserved area where they have had long working relationships with subgrantees. In the case of the states, some have distributed their positions through existing administrative structures, without sufficiently considering the distribution of eligible people.

Repealing the hold harmless provision, although an option, could significantly change the program\u2019s character if it resulted in major shifts of funding allocations from national sponsors to state governments.", "Similarly, within states, the distribution of SCSEP funds leaves some counties overserved and some underserved. National sponsors are required by law to notify state governments and Labor of their plans for SCSEP positions in each state, but only Labor has the authority to effect a different pattern of positions among a state\u2019s counties. Labor could adjust national sponsors\u2019 funding levels to reward those willing to establish positions in underserved counties.", "Another step that might improve the distribution of funds within states would be legislative action to increase the percentage of positions funded by grants to state governments from the current 22 percent imposed by appropriations restrictions. The distribution patterns in the three states solely responsible for SCSEP activities were comparatively equitable. If these appropriations limitations did not exist, the share, over the hold harmless amount, going to the state governments would increase to 55 percent under the 55/45 provision of the authorizing legislation.", "The SCSEP program also has administrative expense problems. In the 1994 program year, we estimate that the national sponsors\u2019 budgeted administrative expenses collectively exceeded by over $20 million the limit set by the OAA.

Under the 1985 draft regulations, expenditures that we believe to be administrative expenses may be charged to other enrollee costs.

Therefore, sometimes, Labor could not readily identify what kinds of expenses were included in that category.", "The 1995 SCSEP regulations, which took effect in July 1995, allow a broad interpretation of other enrollee costs.

Concerning the appropriateness of the draft report title, SCSEP: Significant Changes Needed, the purpose of our review was not to question the need for the program or its results. We were asked to examine SCSEP\u2019s administration; therefore, we have changed the title to Department of Labor: Senior Community Service Employment Program Delivery Could Be Improved Through Legislative and Administrative Actions to reflect that focus. More specifically, we found systemic flaws that may deny eligible people an opportunity to participate in the program and a cost allocation approach that allowed the improper budgeting and expenditure of millions of dollars, permitting national sponsors to exceed the statutory 15-percent limit on administrative costs. 2. SCSEP is a grant program for which applicants apply annually. Labor has the authority to decrease or deny altogether the funding amount sought if it has concerns about an applicant\u2019s future performance. Therefore, Labor had a choice in funding the national sponsor in question. For this national sponsor, Labor had sufficient reason, on the basis of its Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports, to (1) be concerned about future performance and (2) consider a change to that grantee\u2019s funding. 3. The statement, which we have rewritten to avoid the inference mentioned, seeks to explain program funding by identifying contributors and the differences between cash and in-kind contributions. 4. The report has been changed to include Labor\u2019s updated data that reflect the proper proportion of women in the SCSEP program. 5. Although funding amounts are related to the time sponsors have participated in SCSEP, the wide variation in sponsors\u2019 funding has been cited as a problem by several national sponsors as well as several states. Some of the smaller, ethnically targeted national sponsors have tried to serve targeted groups, these sponsors said, but have been thwarted by a reluctance on the part of some large national sponsors to leave areas they served. According to some state officials, the significant disparity between the funding they received and that received by some national sponsors left the states in a relatively powerless position in disputes over equitable distribution. 6. Noncompetitive grant awards that total several hundred million dollars a year are sufficiently sensitive to warrant the Procurement Review Board\u2019s review. Further, constraints on the Board members\u2019 time is not justification for weakening internal control measures. An independent review of grant award decisions, although administratively established and not explicitly required by law, is an important internal control. 7. In objecting to our views on the inadequacy of attempts to achieve equitable distribution of enrollee positions, Labor raised several issues. Concerning the issue of responsibility by states, we have revised the report to ensure that it clearly points out the responsibility that states, as well as national sponsors, have in achieving equitable distribution of enrollee positions. Concerning the issue of administrative efficiency related to the goal of equitable distribution, Labor cited our 1979 report, The Distribution of Senior Community Service Employment Positions (GAO/HRD-80-13, Nov. 8, 1979). Labor quoted that report on the approach taken by sponsors\u2014and particularly national sponsors\u2014to achieve equitable distribution. The report noted that, relative to the administrative limits required of the program, the national sponsors\u2019 efforts to become cost effective did have merit. But the relationship between national sponsors\u2019 and Labor\u2019s efforts to achieve equitable distribution is more fully detailed in a later report, Information on the Senior Community Service Employment Program and the Proposed Transfer to the Department of Health and Human Services (GAO/HRD-84-42, Mar. 12, 1984).", "This 1984 report (p. 22) noted the following: \u201cA Labor official stated that the distribution of enrollee positions within the states may not be equitable since some national sponsors established large clusters of enrollee positions early in the development of SCSEP, and these have been carried forward.\u201d According to the 1984 report, Labor, in February 1979, asked for SCSEP sponsors in each state to (1) discuss and agree upon a rationale for distributing SCSEP funds, (2) identify areas that showed inequitable distribution, (3) establish plans for eliminating inequities without displacing current enrollees, and (4) send these plans to Labor. Labor officials said they did not receive many plans. In 1981, following up on that request, Labor asked national sponsors and state agencies, as a group effort, to report on the progress made toward achieving equitable distribution. Labor said that it received reports from approximately 90 percent of the states.", "As also noted in our 1984 report, Labor officials established a panel of representatives\u2014from Labor, national sponsors, and state agencies\u2014to review the equitable distribution reports and determine which states were making progress. The panel examined the state reports, but, according to our 1984 report, \u201cThe results were never formalized by Labor, and no general feedback was provided to the sponsors.\u201d Labor did suggest to the program sponsors that they use the reports during their next planning sessions. In January 1984, Labor once again requested another equitable distribution report. According to our 1984 report, \u201cwhile such cooperative efforts by national and state sponsors are directed toward equitable distribution, Labor does not know that such distribution has occurred.\u201d", "When we began the review leading to this latest report, we asked Labor officials if they knew the status of equitable distribution in the states compared with its status 5 years earlier. Labor officials did not know for certain which states had progressed in equitable distribution.", "Concerning Labor\u2019s complaint about census data, any comparison of distribution of positions between 1989 and 1994 is, necessarily, skewed. This is because the 1989 distribution of enrollee positions was made on the basis of 1980 census data, and the 1994 distribution was made on the basis of 1990 census data. The introduction of 1990 census data in the 1994 equitable distribution reports may have obscured progress made between 1989 and 1994 in some areas and exaggerated progress in others. 8. The number of enrollee positions available depends on the level of SCSEP funding, not on the hold harmless provision. When funding levels decline, past performance indicates that sponsors\u2014state and national\u2014leave some positions unfilled to ensure that enrollees in other positions may continue in the program. In receiving enrollee positions formerly available to a national sponsor under the hold harmless provision, a state sponsor would have the option of (1) administering these positions itself or (2) subcontracting the administration to others, including the original national sponsor. In addition, the forward funding nature of the program (see footnote 7) would give all parties concerned ample time to adjust to a change in sponsors. Therefore, it is not likely that removing the hold harmless provision would \u201cplace many enrollees \u2018on-the-street\u2019  without alternatives.\u201d 9. Sponsors that emphasize different activities and target different groups may, nevertheless, serve the same people. All sponsors must provide enrollees positions and training that corresponds to their aptitudes and preferences\u2014just as all sponsors, regardless of their ethnic focus, must accept potential enrollees only on the basis of age and income criteria, not on ethnicity or sex. 10. The unwritten agreement mentioned allows national sponsors to avoid situations that might provoke dissension because of differences in salaries or benefits of enrollees participating through different sponsors. This policy could possibly deny enrollees access to the type of training best suited to their needs. Whether such a denial is permanent or not is irrelevant. The policy serves the interests of SCSEP\u2019s national sponsors rather than those of the elderly poor, for whom the program exists. 11. Several national sponsors\u2014the U.S. Forest Service is an example\u2014have geographic constraints on their decisions on areas to serve. Other national sponsors have a preference for serving specific ethnic or minority groups (whose languages and cultures may require specialized knowledge), which guides some of their decisions on areas to serve. States are not likely to face such constraints or preferences. In addition, some states with small populations have said (1) their level of effort in SCSEP has been curtailed by the minimal funding they receive and (2) more funding would allow them to increase their SCSEP efforts. 12. Labor raised two issues: (1) our use of budgeted rather than actual expense data in assessing administrative and other enrollee costs and (2) our interpretation of acceptable administrative costs in the SCSEP program. Regarding the first issue, during our review, we obtained from Labor\u2019s SCSEP staff the data relevant to SCSEP grant awards. When we discussed actual cost data, staff described the separation of Labor\u2019s program and fiscal oversight activities and the limited use of actual cost data in program planning and new grants approval. Actual cost data are not normally available until well after the grant year is completed.", "When we received Labor\u2019s enclosure, indicating its revised view on the use of actual cost data, we asked when these data would be available. Actual data would not be available for 3 months or longer, Labor said. By that time, program year 1995 allocations had already been made.", "We also asked for any additional data the national sponsors had used to justify their budgeted costs for the 1994-95 program year. Labor said it did not have these data but would request them from the national sponsors. Nine of the national sponsors provided data or information intended to explain and support their allocation of costs to the category of other enrollee costs. In instances in which these data indicated that the expenses had directly supported other enrollee cost services, we have revised the totals we had originally developed using budgeted amounts and noted the revisions in the actual costs columns of tables V.2 through V.11. However, little of the cost data adequately distinguished other enrollee costs as being in direct support of the enrollees rather than general administrative operations.", "Ultimately, the relevance of the budgeted versus actual costs issue is questionable because Labor\u2019s SCSEP program officials historically have based their application approval and oversight decisions primarily on budgeted costs, which should be supported by up-to-date and accurate cost data. Most of the data Labor received from the national sponsors did not directly support the budgeted costs they were asked to support.", "Regarding the second issue, Labor\u2019s other response to our findings of misallocations questions our interpretation of acceptable administrative costs. Labor cites the authority of the 1985 SCSEP draft regulations and their incorporation into the grant agreements. As noted earlier in this report, these draft regulations have no legal authority. In 1976, Labor published the only formal regulations in effect for SCSEP before program year 1995. Labor\u2019s proposed amended SCSEP regulations, published in 1985, remained in draft form. Because these regulations never became final, they never gained the force and effect of law. Between 1976 and 1995, the only regulations in effect that pertained to SCSEP were the 1976 regulations.", "Through its comments, Labor has (1) downplayed the existence of the legally promulgated 1976 regulations and (2) interpreted the draft 1985 regulations as having the force and effect of law, when, in fact, they do not. Labor officials have not provided us with an acceptable legal basis for using the 1985 draft regulations instead of the legally promulgated regulations of 1976.", "Finally, these officials also suggested that other Labor programs under other legislative authority may permit a different interpretation of cost allocations. This may be true, but with respect to SCSEP, the regulations and related provisions of the Older Americans Act (OAA) speak for themselves.", "A brief discussion of the context of the other enrollee costs issue may help in understanding it. The national sponsors have repeatedly criticized Labor\u2019s refusal to recalculate the unit cost to administer an enrollee position. Labor officials have informally acknowledged that the administrative costs associated with a placement have increased significantly over time. They also have acknowledged that some expenses that have been allocated to the category of other enrollee costs by national and state sponsors would have been more appropriately included in the administrative cost category. Through the introduction of the 1985 SCSEP draft regulations, Labor, in effect, used the category of other enrollee costs as a way to provide sponsors, most national and some state, with additional funds to cover administrative expenses.", "The purpose of our review was not to determine whether the present level of funding for administrative expenses is adequate but to identify whether administrative expenses have been properly allocated under existing law and regulations. We continue to conclude that in many instances administrative expenses have not been properly allocated.", "Finally, the July 1995 regulations, which became final as we concluded our review, will allow many of the cost allocations of the type that violated the 1976 regulations to continue. We believe that Labor\u2019s interpretation of these new regulations is inconsistent with the OAA\u2019s 15-percent limit on administrative costs. This belief has prompted our recommendation that the Secretary of Labor clearly delineate the expenses allowable as other enrollee costs and adopt the definition of administrative costs set out in the 1976 regulations. 13. Labor\u2019s OIG officials and contract auditors have told us that significant concern has existed about grantee indirect costs for several years. These costs have been the focus of most of Labor\u2019s OIG audit activity for several of the grantee organizations. 14. While the Office of Management and Budget guidance allows reasonable expenditures for \u201cemployee morale activities,\u201d we questioned the use of scarce program funds for such activities. In the report example Labor cited, one of the grantee organizations budgeted about $57,000 for items to promote staff morale and for recognition of staff achievement. We have changed the report to reflect the fact that $25,000 of the budgeted amount was from indirect costs and $31,944 was from direct costs. The grantee organization in question provided actual cost data showing that program year 1994 expenditures from its employee morale account were $21,347.27 rather than the budgeted amount of $21,821. 15. We have changed the report to reflect that reporting of only legitimate unsubsidized placements is the responsibility of states as well as national sponsors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Laurel H.
