For example, we found that during fiscal years 2000 through  2016, inadequate facilities and equipment led to maintenance delays that  contributed in part to thousands of lost operational days\u2014days when  ships were unavailable for operations\u2014across the Navy\u2019s submarine and  aircraft carrier fleets. Further, we found that the shipyards would not be  able to support almost a third of planned depot maintenance periods for  the current fleet of aircraft carriers and submarines over the next two  decades. We recommended that the Navy develop a plan to improve the  shipyards\u2019 infrastructure and incorporate results-oriented practices in its  efforts.

We also interviewed Navy and shipyard officials at  the four naval shipyards and toured three of the four shipyards to identify  any challenges and improvements in shipyard infrastructure. To provide a  mix of perspectives for our site visits, we selected one shipyard that  repairs both aircraft carriers and submarines (Puget Sound), one shipyard  that repairs submarines only (Portsmouth), and the shipyard that was the  pilot for the modeling and simulation effort (Pearl Harbor). We compared  the Navy\u2019s 2020 shipbuilding plan with the 2018 shipbuilding plan used in  developing the SIOP to identify changes to the planned carrier and  submarine force structure and how those changes may affect the number  of depot maintenance availabilities the shipyards will be expected to  support.

Additionally, because of its shallow depth, the  Navy can move Los Angeles\u2013class  submarines into or out of the dock only during  high tides. Even then, the shipyard has to  remove portions of the submarine to decrease  weight and over-flood the dock to create  enough clearance for the boat. Shipyard  officials said dry dock 3 could be modified to  create a new multimission dry dock (M2D2)  that would provide an additional spot to dry  dock an aircraft carrier on the West Coast.  This would provide the redundancy necessary  to allow the Navy to perform significant  seismic upgrades to dry dock 6, which faces  significant seismic risks and is the only dry  dock on the West Coast capable of  accommodating an aircraft carrier. Navy  officials said the final decision regarding the  location of the M2D2 is pending a formal  Environmental Impact Study. insufficient capacity to support the longer Virginia-class submarines  with the Virginia Payload Module (see fig. 4),  lack of redundancy for a West Coast aircraft carrier, and  various other capacity and capability deficiencies that hinder the  maintenance process such as small dry docks that require time- consuming workarounds or an inability to handle nuclear fuel (see  sidebar).", "Though the Navy intends to recover most of the missed maintenance  periods with these projects, according to Navy officials, the plan was  developed using then-current estimates of fleet size and shipbuilding  schedules derived from the fiscal year 2017 force structure projection.

Officials also stated that they plan to stay aware of  further changes to depot maintenance requirements by attending annual  fleet scheduling conferences in the future. These conferences are  intended to reach a Navy-wide consensus on, among other things,  changes to shipbuilding plans and the schedules for various ships to  undergo their dry dock maintenance. Program officials noted that their  presence at the conference allows them to update the SIOP in the event  that there are additional changes to the shipbuilding schedule in the  future. We have previously recommended that the Navy assess the risks  to implementing shipyard infrastructure improvements; changes to the  shipbuilding schedule are one such risk.

These include  the average age of shipyard production shop facilities is 76 years,  exceeding DOD\u2019s expected average service life of 67 years for  facilities;  the average condition rating of shipyard production shop facilities is  66, which is considered poor, falling below the Navy standard of 80;   and  inefficient facility layout at the shipyards that has not been optimized  to support the maintenance, repair, and disposal of nuclear-powered  Navy ships and submarines.", "According to the Navy, the shipyards were originally designed to support  the construction of ships and submarines and not the maintenance  mission for the nuclear fleet that they perform today. Because the  shipyards were designed for a different mission, key facilities such as  maintenance shops may be located at significant distances from where  the majority of work is performed. As a result, it is not uncommon for  workers to walk several miles each day because of the inefficient layout  of the shipyards, according to shipyard officials. For example, building  155 at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, which is actively involved in  submarine maintenance, is about 1/3 mile away from the nearest dry  dock. This distance creates additional travel time for both personnel and  material, resulting in maintenance inefficiencies. We have noted  previously that waterfront locations are often ideally located to support the  shipyards\u2019 maintenance mission, but that the challenges of dilapidated  structures, historical designations, and other issues can make it difficult  for the shipyards to make full use of the locations (see sidebar).", "Building 6 at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard is a  former foundry that has not been used since  the 1980s. The building\u2019s distinctive 3-tier roof  architectural style make it a historic facility  and therefore difficult to restore and  modernize, according to shipyard officials.  Because of its size and close proximity to the  waterfront, shipyard officials would like to use  the facility to support the maintenance  mission, rather than let it sit empty. However,  the building has extensive health and safety  issues and also requires environmental  remediation.", "The Navy\u2019s plan estimates that the implementation of facility optimization  will take at least 20 years and require increased spending for facility  construction and modernization over that time. In addition, this will be a  highly complex effort to redesign four large operational industrial  installations, and the time frame for its completion remains uncertain at  this stage. The modeling and simulation of shipyard production facilities  began in February 2019 and will not be completed until 2020. According  to program office representatives, Pearl Harbor\u2019s \u201ccurrent state\u201d facility  model is scheduled to be completed near the end of fiscal year 2019, and  the optimal facility model is scheduled to be completed in the 2nd quarter  of fiscal year 2020 (see fig. 7). Modeling and simulation at the Norfolk,  Portsmouth, and Puget Sound shipyards are not scheduled to be  completed until the end of fiscal year 2020. However, some shipyard  officials have expressed doubt about this timeline, stating that the  modeling and simulations may take more effort to complete. For example,  officials from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard told us they have done some  degree of industrial modeling and simulation since 2007, but never at this  magnitude and with this many variables. Because the modeling and  simulation effort is so complicated, officials said it may be necessary to  use the model to optimize the most critical parts of the industrial process  first before gradually adding others. Shipyard officials also said that  running the models will require a highly skilled and interdisciplinary team  due to the complexity of the effort.", "If the simulations are completed as planned, the Navy expects to use  them to complete the shipyard Area Development Plans in fiscal year  2021 and a prioritized list of facility development projects by fiscal year  2022. Navy officials said the list would likely inform facility investments for  the following 5 years. Navy officials told us that they are suspending work  on many facilities\u2019 projects in order to avoid funding projects that do not  serve the larger optimization goal, although some critical projects have  been allowed to continue because they provide improvements needed to  meet immediate operational needs, such as dry dock improvements.  However, according to Navy officials, some projects have been deferred  until 2022 when the prioritized list of projects to support shipyard  optimization is expected to be complete.", "In addition, specific actions to address other infrastructure deficiencies at  the shipyards are not addressed in the current plan, adding additional  uncertainty. Navy officials explained that the optimized layout of shipyard  facilities, which is still in early development, will drive the future efforts  that address deficiencies associated with roads, utilities, sidewalks, and  information-technology systems, which are not addressed in the plan.

Specifically, the Navy\u2019s plan states that funding levels for shipyard capital  equipment will need to increase from historical levels to about $150  million annually and be sustained for at least 20 years to bring the  average age of shipyard equipment to within industry standards.  However, it is not clear whether this will fully address shipyard equipment  deficiencies, because the Navy officials stated that they will not be able to  create a more detailed goal until after the facility modeling and simulation  effort is complete.", "The Navy\u2019s plan states that most shipyard capital equipment is beyond its  effective service life, obsolete, unsupported by the original manufacturers,  or at risk of failure. According to the plan, the average age for industrial  equipment in the private sector is 7 to 10 years, while the average age of  equipment at the four shipyards is 24 years. According to the Navy\u2019s plan,  aged equipment can increase the costs of depot maintenance for  submarines and aircraft carriers and place schedules at risk. Modernizing  the capital equipment at naval shipyards is essential to improving their  efficiency, reducing maintenance costs, and supporting fleet readiness,  according to the plan. The capital equipment deficiencies identified by the  Navy\u2019s plan are consistent with our recent work, which found that the  equipment at the shipyards was, on average, past its expected service life  (see table 1).", "However, it is too early to determine whether the Navy\u2019s plan to increase  equipment funding will fully address the shipyards\u2019 equipment  deficiencies. Navy officials told us that they have not yet established a  specific improvement goal for shipyard capital equipment, because  developing this metric will not be possible until after the modeling and  simulation phase to develop optimized facilities is complete. For  example, during the modeling and simulation phase to optimize shipyard  operations, the Navy will likely make decisions that will affect the amount  and cost of capital equipment, such as concentrating some specialized  equipment at certain yards, standardizing equipment items and  purchasing them in bulk at lower cost, or purchasing more efficient items  that may reduce the quantity needed. Officials stated that they developed  a rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the cost to replace aging  equipment. The Navy has, in the past, spent about $50 million to $60  million annually to invest in capital equipment at the shipyards. However,  the Navy estimates that it will require average annual funding of $150  million over the course of 20 years at a total cost of $3 billion in order to  modernize capital equipment to within private industry standards. If this  effort is sustained over the 20 years identified in the plan, the capital  equipment deficiencies at the shipyards will not be fully addressed until  fiscal year 2040. However, this estimate is based off an earlier Navy  study that identified a need for annual average funding of $150 million  over a longer, 30-year period. According to this earlier equipment study,  the 10 additional years of investment would total $1.5 billion. Navy  officials have stated that they will attempt to address the shipyards\u2019  equipment deficiencies over the 20-year time frame by taking advantage  of different equipment purchasing strategies and gaining efficiencies from  the facility optimization effort that will allow the Navy to recapitalize  equipment more effectively than was possible with its previous strategies.  However, the efficacy of these strategies cannot be assessed until the  Navy completes its modeling and simulation phase in fiscal year 2020  and develops more detailed plans for recapitalizing its shipyard  equipment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Navy\u2019s Initial Cost Estimate of $21 Billion to Implement Its Plan Is Preliminary and Does Not Identify All Required Resources", "paragraphs": ["The Navy estimates the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan will  cost about $21 billion to implement; however, the estimate is preliminary  and therefore is not complete or reliable.

For the dry dock  and equipment portions of the estimate, the Navy was able to build on  previous cost estimates that had investigated additional investments in  those areas. For the facilities portion of the estimate, the Navy assumed  total reconstruction of most current facilities based on current processes,  using notional square-footage facility requirements in the absence of a  more detailed engineering assessment. The initial estimated cost to  implement this plan over 20 years includes $4 billion for improvements to  the dry docks, $14 billion for facilities, and $3 billion for capital equipment.", "Navy officials stated that they wanted to provide Navy leadership and  congressional decision makers with a rough order-of-magnitude estimate,  not a budget-ready cost estimate. That is why the estimate was released  in its 2018 report to Congress, instead of after the Navy completes its  shipyard modeling and simulation effort, which they believe will give them  a more accurate picture of the necessary investments. For example, the  Navy acknowledges that several expected costs are not included in its  plan, such as those for utilities, roads, and environmental remediation.  Officials with the Navy agree that including these will likely add hundreds  of millions of dollars to the plan\u2019s cost. However, they decided that it was  not useful to calculate these costs before the facility optimization process  was complete, since the facility layout is going to have an effect on the  placement of roads and utilities, for example. Navy officials stated that the  initial cost estimate was prepared using applicable Navy guidance and  that they plan to develop a more detailed cost estimate after the Navy has  finished creating digital models of the shipyards and they start prioritizing  specific projects, which they estimate will be in fiscal year 2021.", "We found that the Navy\u2019s initial cost estimate minimally met two  characteristics of a reliable cost estimate, partially met one, and did not meet one, as shown in table 2. The GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide identifies four \u201ccharacteristics\u201d of a reliable cost  estimate as well as associated cost estimating best practices as  previously discussed.", "Specifically, we found that the initial cost estimate was not reliable  because it was not developed using the following best practices:", "Program Baseline: The Navy\u2019s plan includes some pieces of a  program baseline, such as a schedule and goals, but does not fully  establish a common definition of the program from which all cost  estimates could be derived. A program baseline for cost and schedule  may be established prior to contract award or funding work and allows  decision makers to track and report on cost and schedule deviations  above certain thresholds from initial estimates throughout the life of  the project, to facilitate oversight. Navy officials stated that the plan\u2019s  first phase is meant to serve as the program baseline, containing all  relevant data to address systemic issues across all four shipyards.  However, only the facilities estimate was developed specifically for the  plan; the dry dock and equipment estimates came from previous Navy  efforts, conducted under different conditions. Without a program  baseline, a cost estimate will not be based on a complete program  description and will lack specific information regarding technical and  program risks.", "Work breakdown structure: The Navy\u2019s plan includes a broad list of  high-level goals, such as timelines for completing major lines of effort,  but the estimate does not include a more detailed work breakdown  structure. Including a work breakdown structure is an important part of  a comprehensive plan. A work breakdown structure deconstructs a  program\u2019s end product into successive levels with smaller specific  elements until the work is subdivided to a level suitable for  management control. This allows program office and shipyard  personnel to accurately track and closely monitor the progress of  efforts to meet the SIOP\u2019s goals. In addition, including this structure  would ensure consistency across the various cost estimating  contributors, the shipyards, and NAVSEA, and would ensure that  there were no omissions from the analysis and that costs are not  double counted. Navy personnel stated that a more detailed work  breakdown structure would not be possible until after the modeling  and simulation of the shipyards is complete, after fiscal year 2020.", "Methodology and key assumptions: The Navy\u2019s plan describes  assumptions, but not the methodology used to develop the initial cost  estimate. For example, the plan states that the size and configuration  of existing facilities make it difficult to increase capacity without a  significant investment, but does not describe how the Navy intends to  address the issue of a larger fleet. Cost estimates are often built  around assumptions\u2014such as the rate of inflation or material costs\u2014 because they are attempting to predict future costs. However, the plan  must include a clearly identified methodology to be considered well- documented according to GAO best practices. Unless methodology  and assumptions are clearly documented, it will be impossible to  reproduce the estimate, and decision makers will lack information on  which costs are concrete and which are best guesses.", "Inflation: The estimate did not account for inflation, which is an  important component of an accurate cost estimate. If an estimate  does not include adjustments for inflation, cost overruns can result.  Inflation costs on a $21 billion program over 20 years could reach 45  percent or more. Applying inflation is an important step in cost  estimating because, in the development of an estimate, cost data  must be expressed in like terms. If a mistake is made or the inflation  amount is not correct, cost overruns can result.", "Navy officials noted that they are currently  evaluating the use of a covered dry dock  model at the shipyards, which could result in  significant maintenance efficiencies. A  covered dry dock is a dry dock with an area  built over it, which allows the shipyard to  develop production space that can minimize  personnel and materiel movement. However,  the Navy is still investigating the cost benefit  of the covered dry dock, which means that  there could be additional costs or  complications not included in the current plan. not include a cost risk or uncertainty analysis. A comprehensive  analysis of risk and uncertainty in the estimate is an important  component of an accurate cost estimate. Navy officials have identified  a number of risks to implementing the plan, such as the costs of  complying with historical preservation requirements, environmental  remediation, and the acquisition or adaptation of alternative  workspace for shipyards to use while facility upgrades are performed.  Officials have stated that these factors could add hundreds of millions  of dollars more to the total cost of the plan. For example, an official  from Norfolk Naval Shipyard said that environmental remediation of  certain sites at Norfolk alone could easily cost millions of dollars to  execute. Furthermore, the plan excluded certain costs that the Navy  will necessarily incur in implementing it, such as those related to  utilities or roads. Because cost estimates predict future program  costs\u2014sometimes for projects that have never been built before\u2014 Navy officials always associate uncertainty with them (see sidebar).  Lacking risk and uncertainty analysis, management cannot determine  a defensible level of contingency reserves that is necessary to cover  increased costs resulting from unexpected design complexity,  incomplete requirements, technology uncertainty, and other  uncertainties. While the Navy did not initially include mitigation  strategies for these risks in the plan, Navy officials have stated that  they are involved in a number of efforts to address them.", "Sensitivity: Our analysis showed that the Navy\u2019s estimate does not  include a sensitivity analysis, which evaluates the effect that individual  elements or assumptions can have on the estimate. Without a  sensitivity analysis, cost estimators and management will not have a  full understanding of the implications that changes in ground rules and  assumptions can have. Officials have stated that they plan to include  a sensitivity analysis in their more detailed cost estimate in 2021.", "Independent Cost Estimate: Our analysis showed that the Navy\u2019s  plan does not include an independent cost estimate. An independent  cost estimate provides an evaluation of the quality, accuracy, and  reasonableness of a program\u2019s cost estimate by a neutral third-party,  with emphasis on specific cost and technical risks. It also helps to  identify risks associated with budget shortfalls or excesses. Navy  officials noted that an independent cost estimate was likely not  feasible at this point, considering that the effort was still in its very  early stages. However, the officials stated that given the size and  projected cost of the plan, they anticipate they will likely seek out an  independent cost estimate in the future.", "Navy officials said they plan to develop a more detailed cost estimate  after the Navy has finished creating digital models of the naval shipyards  and identifying their optimized layouts, which they estimate will be in fiscal  year 2021. However, even in the context of a preliminary estimate, the  best practices associated with the four characteristics are foundational  and should be the building blocks upon which any sound program is  based. The importance of best practices is only magnified by the size of  the program, which means ignoring best practices can have meaningful  effects. For example, as we noted previously, not adjusting for inflation is  likely to underestimate the cost of the program. Navy officials have  expressed openness to the best practices as they prepare the more  detailed cost estimate. However, without incorporating these cost  estimating best practices that inform Navy decision makers and Congress  of the full costs of shipyard optimization, the Navy is at risk of not  identifying the resources it needs to fully implement its optimization plan.  In addition, without fully accounting for all costs, management will have  difficulty successfully planning program resource requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Has Created a Management Structure to Oversee the Shipyard Optimization Effort, but Has Not Yet Identified Clear Roles and Responsibilities for Shipyards", "paragraphs": ["The Navy created a management structure\u2014a program management  office (referred to as PMS 555)\u2014to oversee the estimated 20-year-long  process of optimizing the shipyards in June 2018. Shortly thereafter, in  September 2018, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research,  Development, and Acquisition stated that, though the shipyard  optimization effort did not fit all the characteristics of a formal acquisition  program, its size and importance required the Navy to treat it as one. As a  result, the newly created program office was designated as the  acquisition lead for all efforts related to shipyard optimization. The  program office was also required to report on its progress quarterly to an  executive oversight council consisting of leadership representatives from  a number of Navy organizations.", "This program office includes representatives from Navy organizations that  would necessarily be involved in shipyard construction, including Navy  Installations Command and Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  Navy officials explained that NAVSEA is managing the implementation of  the plan through the program office; Navy Installations Command  provides installation support through management of shipyard land and  facilities; Naval Facilities Engineering Command provides acquisition and  technical expertise for real estate, facilities, and related environmental  studies; and the shipyards implement the plan\u2019s activities (see fig. 8).", "In the year since its creation, the program office told us they have begun  taking steps to prioritize shipyard projects and complete the modeling and  simulation of the existing shipyards. The office has also developed its  internal organizational structure, which includes describing its  relationships to essential stakeholders such as Navy Installations  Command and Naval Facilities Engineering Command.", "However, the program office has not yet formally clarified the extent to  which it will interact with the shipyards or its expectations of support from  the shipyards. For example, officials with the program office have stated  that they plan to locate new staff both in Washington, D.C., and at field  offices at each of the shipyards. However, neither the program office nor  the shipyards yet know where the field offices will fall in the shipyards\u2019  reporting structures\u2014including the chain of command\u2014or precisely what  their roles will be. According to program office representatives, the Navy  is in the process of developing documentation, including a memorandum  of agreement, to formally codify roles and responsibilities for executing  the plan among the program office and its field offices, the shipyards, and  other Navy organizations to accomplish these tasks, but did not provide  an estimated time frame for when these roles and responsibilities would  be determined. Officials said their current plan is for field offices to serve  as extensions of the program office and that they will help the shipyards  to oversee the execution of the plan. Program office representatives  intend for shipyard personnel to help define project requirements, collect  data, provide input on the digital shipyard models, and communicate the  plan among the entire shipyard workforce. However, the development of  the memorandum of agreement has been extended.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should establish an organizational structure, assign  responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.  Shipyard officials told us that the current lack of clarity has created  concerns and confusion about what their roles should be during  implementation. For example, shipyard officials were uncertain in what  fiscal years certain positions would be needed for implementing the plan,  and shipyard officials were not always involved with planning efforts. In  addition, according to NAVSEA officials, the lack of clear roles and  responsibilities has hampered several long-term planning efforts,  including identifying and tracking performance metrics. According to Navy  officials, the program office has since received funding that it intends to  use to hire additional staff, and they intend to embed some of those staff  members at the shipyards to coordinate with shipyard personnel.  However, at present, shipyard personnel have stated that they are  generally left to interpret and enact implementation activities, which could  lead to inefficient or duplicative efforts. Given the time frames of the plan,  even minor delays due to inefficiency could result in projects being  postponed and critical ship maintenance being deferred.

Lack of adequate capacity can also result  in critical parts of the fleet sitting idle awaiting maintenance, incurring  hundreds of millions of dollars in operating and support costs without  providing any operational benefit. We note that the shipyards are  struggling to meet the Navy\u2019s current needs with inadequate facilities,  aging equipment, poorly configured dry docks, and an ineffective  management approach for addressing these issues. The Navy is  attempting to address these concerns with its Shipyard Infrastructure  Optimization Plan. However, the cost estimate for implementing this plan  is preliminary and therefore likely under states the costs of what will be a  decades-long effort. Because the Navy will be required to request funding  from Congress over 20 years in order to implement this plan, the lack of a  reliable cost estimate places the effort at risk. By developing a more  complete cost estimate, the Navy could reduce the risk that it might  request too little funding to achieve its desired outcome. Without high- quality estimates, agencies are at risk of experiencing cost overruns,  missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls.
