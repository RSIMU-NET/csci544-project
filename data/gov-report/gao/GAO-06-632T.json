U.S. efforts to strengthen domestic and global security include, among others, the provision of training and technical assistance in countering terrorist financing abroad. An interagency Terrorist Financing Working Group (TFWG), chaired by the U.S. Department of State (State), coordinates the delivery of this training and technical assistance to \"priority\" countries--those considered most vulnerable to terrorist financing schemes--as well as to other vulnerable countries. In addition, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) leads U.S. efforts to block access to designated terrorists' assets that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction. In response to multiple congressional requesters, GAO examined U.S. efforts to combat terrorist financing abroad, publishing the report in October 2005. In this testimony, GAO discusses the report's findings about challenges related to (1) TFWG's coordination of the counter-terrorism-financing training and technical assistance abroad and (2) Treasury's measurement of results and provision of information needed to assess OFAC's efforts to block terrorist assets."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under State's leadership, TFWG has coordinated the interagency delivery of counter-terrorism-financing training and technical assistance--for example, providing training and placing resident advisors--in more than 20 priority countries as well as other vulnerable countries. However, TFWG's effort has been hampered by the absence of a strategic and integrated plan. GAO found that the effort lacks three elements that are critical to strategic planning for operations within and across agencies: (1) Key stakeholder acceptance of roles and practices; (2) strategic alignment of resources with countries' needs and risks; and (3) a process to measurement the effort's results For example, two key TFWG stakeholders, State and Treasury, disagree about the extent of State's leadership as chair of TFWG. GAO recommended that State and Treasury, with other government agencies, implement an integrated strategic plan that addresses these challenges and sign a Memorandum of Agreement to improve coordination of counter-terrorism-financing training and technical assistance abroad. State and Treasury responded that they are taking several steps to improve the interagency process, but they did not address all of GAO's recommendations. OFAC undertakes a number of efforts related to the blocking of terrorists' assets. For example, OFAC compiles evidence as a basis for designating terrorist groups and individuals. However, GAO found limitations regarding Treasury's measurement of results and provision of information about FAC's efforts. Inadequate measures. At the time of GAO's review, Treasury lacked adequate measures to assess the results of OFAC's efforts. OFAC was in the process of developing new measures, which it recently completed. Although GAO has not reviewed them, these measures may enable officials overseeing OFAC to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of its efforts as well as hold OFAC managers accountable. GAO recommended that, in addition, Treasury develop an OFAC-specific strategic plan that describes, among other things, how its performance measures relate to general program goals and objectives. As of March 30, Treasury had not yet finalized the strategic plan. Insufficient information. Treasury's yearly report to Congress on terrorist assets blocked does not provide sufficient information for Congress to assess OFAC's progress. For instance, the report shows the total dollar value of blocked terrorist assets held under U.S. jurisdictions but does not show changes from amounts of assets blocked in previous years. GAO recommended that Treasury provide information on such changes, along with other key performance metrics, in its annual Terrorist Assets Report. Treasury responded that it would discuss with Congress recrafting the report to address congressional interests."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss GAO\u2019s findings on certain  U.S. government counter-terrorism-financing efforts as well as various  recommendations we have made for improving the management and  oversight of these efforts. We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to  the record that this panel has created on the subject. Madame  Chairwoman, we also recognize and appreciate your consistent attention  to issues related to the financing of terrorism. For example, you  cofounded the bipartisan Congressional Anti-Terrorist Financing Task  Force in 2004 to bolster efforts to shut down terrorist funding networks.  You also coauthored recent legislation to create a certification regime, led  by the Department of the Treasury, that would annually report to Congress  the efforts of other countries to combat terror funding and would impose  sanctions on countries that fail to perform up to standard. Thank you for  your leadership in this area.", "As you have stated on prior occasions, Madame Chairwoman, disrupting  terrorist financing can raise terrorists\u2019 costs and risks of gathering and  moving assets and is necessary to impede their ability to carry out  significant operations. The United Nations (UN) reports that more than  ever before, security threats are interrelated; a threat to one country can  be a threat to all, and no country by its efforts alone can make itself  invulnerable. It is in every country\u2019s interest, accordingly, to cooperate  both internally and with other countries in addressing threat priorities.", "In GAO\u2019s October 2005 report on U.S. efforts to counter terrorist financing  abroad, we noted that the United States plays an active and ongoing role in  building international support for measures to combat terrorist financing.  For example, the U.S. government has participated in efforts to develop  and implement international standards to combat terrorist financing,  sometimes leading these efforts. The United States also conducts various  intelligence and law enforcement activities designed to identify and  disrupt the flow of terrorist financing abroad. These activities include,  among others, gathering intelligence and sharing information with other  countries.", "Further, the United States provides training and technical assistance to  help countries that are vulnerable to terrorist financing establish effective  counter-terrorism-financing regimes. To coordinate the delivery of this  training and assistance to about two dozen \u201cpriority countries\u201d\u2014those  considered most vulnerable\u2014as well as to other vulnerable countries, the  National Security Council (NSC) established the interagency Terrorist  Finance Working Group (TFWG), whose members include, among others,  the Department of State (State), which chairs the group; the Treasury; and  the Department of Justice (Justice).", "In addition, the United States has participated in global efforts to publicly  designate individuals and groups as terrorists and to block access to their  assets. U.S. officials have worked with members of the UN to develop and  support UN Security Council resolutions to freeze the assets of designated  individuals or groups that conduct or facilitate terrorist acts. The United  States successfully participated in bilateral efforts with Saudi Arabia and  jointly designated more than a dozen Saudi-related entities and multiple  individuals as terrorists or terrorist supporters. Officials of the Department  of the Treasury (Treasury) have stated that public designations discourage  further financial support and encourage other governments to more  effectively monitor the activities of the designated individuals or groups.  Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) serves as the lead U.S.  agency for blocking the assets of terrorists designated by the United States  unilaterally or bilaterally or as a result of UN Security Council Resolutions.", "As our October 2005 report showed, much has been accomplished.  However, our report also noted various challenges that could negatively  affect the results of some of these efforts as well as U.S. agencies\u2019\u2014and  Congress\u2019s\u2014accountability for, and oversight of, these efforts. Today, as  requested, I will discuss our report\u2019s findings and recommendations  regarding challenges related to    TFWG\u2019s efforts to coordinate interagency delivery of counter- terrorism-financing training and technical assistance abroad and    Treasury\u2019s use of performance measures and provision of information  necessary to assess OFAC\u2019s efforts to block terrorist assets.", "In discussing these challenges, I will address the need for more strategic  and integrated planning that focuses on achieving results in connection  with U.S. counter-terrorism-financing activities rather than on the  activities themselves. Such planning should include a risk management  element\u2014a systematic process for assessing threats and taking  appropriate steps to deal with them.", "GAO\u2019s mission is to help Congress improve the performance and ensure  the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the  American people. We have been actively involved in improving the federal  government\u2019s performance in the critically important area of homeland  security, including providing numerous products related to counter\u2013 terrorism financing. We have also been privileged to actively support  Congress and the 9/11 Commission by providing details about key  personnel, testifying before Congress and the 9/11 Commission, and  sharing our research, products, and experiences. In addition, GAO is an  active member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit  Institutions (INTOSAI), a professional organization of national supreme  audit institutions that provides its members opportunities to share  knowledge and experiences about the challenges in today\u2019s global  environment, to ensure that government auditing continuously progresses  with new developments. GAO also serves on an INTOSAI task force on  international anti\u2013money laundering that aims to design and promote  policies, strategies, and actions to enable INTOSAI members to strengthen  their anti\u2013money laundering capabilities.", "In preparing our October 2005 report, we examined documentation and  interviewed officials from State, Treasury, Justice, and the Departments of  Homeland Security and Defense as well as from the intelligence  community. We also assessed information from the UN, Financial Action  Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering, World Bank, and International  Monetary Fund (IMF). We conducted field work in Pakistan, Indonesia,  and Paraguay, where we assessed information from government, law  enforcement, nongovernmental organizations, regional organizations, and  donor government officials as well as from U.S. embassy officials. We  performed our work for the report from April 2004 to July 2005. In  addition, for this testimony, we obtained information in March 2006 from  State and Treasury on their actions to implement our recommendations.  All work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The financing of terrorism is the financial support, in any form, of  terrorism or of those who encourage, plan, or engage in it. Terrorist  financing may derive from licit activities, such as fundraising by charities,  or from illicit activities, such as selling counterfeit goods, contraband  cigarettes, and illegal drugs. Disguising the source of terrorist financing,  whether licit or illicit, is important to terrorist financiers: if the source can  be concealed, it remains available for future terrorist financing activities.  Some international experts on money laundering find that there is little  difference in the methods used by criminal organizations or terrorist  groups to conceal their proceeds by moving them through national and  international financial systems.", "FATF, an intergovernmental body, sets internationally recognized  standards for developing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism- financing regimes and assesses countries\u2019 abilities to meet these  standards. To strengthen anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism- financing worldwide, international entities such as the UN, FATF, World  Bank, and IMF, as well as the U.S. government, agree that each country  should implement practices and adopt laws that are consistent with  international standards. The U.S. government has worked with  international donors and organizations\u2014for example, the United Kingdom,  Australia, Japan, the European Union, FATF, UN, the Organization of  American States, the Asian Development Bank, IMF, and the World  Bank\u2014to build counter-terrorism-financing regimes in vulnerable  countries.", "U.S. offices and bureaus\u2014primarily within the Departments of State, the  Treasury, Justice, and Homeland Security\u2014and the federal financial  regulators provide training and technical assistance, chiefly funded by  State and Treasury, to countries deemed vulnerable to terrorist financing.  One of TFWG\u2019s functions is to prioritize the delivery of such assistance to  countries that it deems most vulnerable. To identify priority countries,  TFWG considers intelligence community analysis of countries\u2019  vulnerabilities to terrorist financing, importance to U.S. security, and  capacity to absorb U.S. assistance. NSC guidance for TFWG states that  delivery of assistance to other vulnerable countries\u2014that is, those that  have not been designated as priority\u2014may proceed so long as it is  possible without adversely affecting the delivery of assistance to priority  countries. Other vulnerable countries receive counter-terrorism-financing  training and technical assistance through other U.S. government programs  as well as through TFWG.

The training and assistance are  offered through courses, presentations at international conferences, the  use of overseas regional U.S. law enforcement academies or U.S.-based  schools, and the placement of intermittent or long-term resident advisors.

Consequently, the overall effort lacks  effective leadership, resulting in less than optimal delivery of training and  technical assistance to vulnerable countries.", "State and Treasury disagree regarding State\u2019s role in coordinating the  training and technical assistance. According to State, its Office of the  Coordinator for Counterterrorism is charged with directing, managing, and  coordinating all U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to develop and provide counter- terrorism financing programs, including, but not limited to, those in  priority countries. Treasury, a key stakeholder, asserts that there are  numerous other efforts outside States\u2019 purview and that State\u2019s role is  limited to coordinating, as chair of TFWG, the provision of such assistance  in priority countries. In addition, senior Treasury officials told us that  they strongly disagree with the degree of control State asserts over TFWG  decisions and said that State creates obstacles rather than coordinating  efforts. Officials from Justice, which provides training and technical  assistance and receives funding from State, told us that they respect  State\u2019s role as the TFWG chair and coordinator and said that all counter- terrorism-financing training and technical assistance efforts should be  brought under the TFWG decision-making process. While supportive of  State\u2019s position, Justice\u2019s statement demonstrates that State\u2019s role lacks  clear definition and recognition in practice.", "In addition, State and Treasury officials disagree about procedures and  practices for delivering the training and technical assistance. State cited  NSC guidance and an unclassified State document focusing on TFWG as  providing procedures and practices for delivering training and technical  assistance to all countries. Treasury officials told us that the procedures  and practices defined by NSC were pertinent only to the TFWG priority  countries and that TFWG has no formal mandate or process to provide  technical assistance to non-priority countries. Moreover, Justice officials  indicated that differences in the procedures and practices for delivering  training and technical assistance to priority countries versus those for  other vulnerable countries had created problems.", "State and Treasury officials cited numerous examples of their  disagreements on procedures and practices. For example:    According to Treasury officials, funding provided by Treasury\u2019s Office  of Technical Assistance (OTA) should primarily support intermittent  and long-term resident advisors, who are U.S. contractors. According  to State officials, OTA should instead supplement State\u2019s funding for  counter-terrorism-financing training and technical assistance, which  primarily funds current employees of other U.S. agencies.", "According to OTA officials, their contractors provide assistance in  drafting counter-terrorism-financing and anti-money-laundering laws in  non-priority countries and OTA provides the drafts to Justice and other  U.S. agencies for review and comment. State officials cited NSC  guidance that current Justice employees should be primarily  responsible for working with foreign countries to assist in drafting  counter-terrorism-financing and anti-money-laundering laws and  voiced strong resistance to use of contractors. Justice cited two  examples in which contractors\u2019 work resulted in laws that did not meet  FATF standards. According to OTA officials, the host country itself is  ultimately responsible for final passage of a law that meets  international standards.", "State officials said that OTA\u2019s use of confidentiality agreements  between contractors and the foreign officials they advise had impeded  U.S. interagency coordination in one country and that the continued  practice could present future challenges. However, Treasury officials  said that the incident was an isolated case involving a contract problem  and that procedural steps have been taken to ensure the problem is not  repeated.", "According to TFWG procedures for priority countries, if an assessment  trip is determined to be necessary, State is to lead and determine the  composition of the teams and set the travel dates. However, this  procedure becomes complicated when a vulnerable country is  designated a priority country. For example, in November 2004,  Treasury conducted an OTA financial assessment in a vulnerable  country and subsequently reached agreement with the country\u2019s central  bank minister to install a resident advisor to set up an FIU. However,  after TFWG had changed the country\u2019s status to priority, State officials,  in May 2005, denied clearance for Treasury officials to visit the country  to arrange for the placement of a resident advisor; according to State  TFWG officials, State delayed the officials\u2019 visit until a TFWG  assessment could be completed. At our review\u2019s conclusion in July  2005, Treasury\u2019s work had been delayed by 2.5 months.

State\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism uses  funding from this account to provide counter-terrorism financing  training and technical assistance to TFWG countries.

Our  analysis of Treasury records showed that OTA received budget authority  totaling about $30.3 million for all financial enforcement programs for  fiscal years 2002-2005. However, because OTA funding for counter- terrorism-financing training and technical assistance is embedded with  funding for anti-money-laundering assistance, the exact amount allocated  to countering terrorist financing cannot be determined.

In addition,  according to the State Performance and Accountability Report for fiscal  year 2004, a shortage of anti-money-laundering experts continues to  hamper efforts to meet the needs of nations that request assistance,  including priority countries. According to State officials, U.S. technical  experts are especially overextended because of their frequent need to  divide their time between assessment, training, and investigative missions.

A senior OTA official said that OTA  has actively sought to provide programs in more priority countries but that  State, as chair of TFWG, has not supported OTA\u2019s efforts. Specifically, our  analysis showed that OTA obligated about $1.1 million of its financial  enforcement program funding in priority countries, in part to place  resident advisors, in fiscal years 2002-2005. State officials said that they  welcomed more OTA participation in priority countries as a component of  applicable resources; however, they questioned whether OTA consistently  provides high-quality assistance.

According to the  OFAC officials:    The measures in the 2004 Performance and Accountability Report are  not specific to terrorist financing. Two of the three measures do not  separate data on terrorists from data on other entities such as drug  traffickers, hostile foreign governments, corrupt regimes, and foreign  drug cartels, although OFAC officials acknowledged that they could  have reported the data separately.", "Progress on asset blocking cannot be measured simply by totaling an  amount of blocked assets at the end of the year, because the amounts  may vary over the year as assets are blocked and unblocked.", "As of October 2005, Treasury had not developed measures to track  activities and results related to asset blocking. For example, Treasury\u2019s  underlying research to identify terrorist entities and their support  systems is used by other U.S. agencies for activities such as law  enforcement investigations. However, Treasury lacked measures to  track other agencies\u2019 use of this research.", "Treasury officials also noted that measuring the effectiveness of these  efforts in terms of their deterrent value is problematic, in part because the  direct impact on unlawful activity is unknown and because precise metrics  for illegal and clandestine activities are hard to develop. According to  Treasury officials, measuring these efforts\u2019 effectiveness can also be  difficult because many of them involve multiple U.S. agencies and foreign  governments and are highly sensitive. However, contrary to a U.S.  legislative directive to agencies to ascertain and explain the infeasibility or  impracticableness of a performance goal for a program activity, Treasury\u2019s  annual report does not address the deterrent value of designations or the  difficulties in measuring their effectiveness.", "In October 2005, in commenting on a draft of our draft report, Treasury  officials told us that they were in the process of developing better  quantitative and qualitative measures for assessing the results of OFAC\u2019s  terrorist asset blocking efforts. In addition, Treasury officials said that  they were developing a strategic plan to guide OFAC\u2019s efforts. The  officials stated that they expected OFAC\u2019s new performance measures to  be completed by December 1, 2005, and its new strategic plan to be  completed by January 1, 2006. We recommended in our report that the  Secretary of the Treasury complete the efforts to develop meaningful  performance measures and an OFAC-specific strategic plan to ensure that  policy makers and program managers are able to examine the results of  U.S. efforts to block terrorists\u2019 assets. According to discussions with  OFAC officials in March 2006, OFAC has developed new measures to  assess its role in administering and enforcing economic sanctions against  terrorists; however, we have not assessed the adequacy of these new  measures.

In 2004, OFAC reported that the United  States blocked almost $10 million in assets belonging to seven  international terrorist organizations and related designees. The 2004  report also noted that the United States held more than $1.6 billion in  assets belonging to six designated state sponsors of terrorism. However,  the report does not document or quantify changes from amounts of assets  blocked in previous years. For example, the 2004 report stated that the  United States held $3.9 million in al Qaeda assets, but it did not show that  this represented a 400 percent increase from the value of al Qaeda assets  held by the United State in 2003 or offer an explanation for this increase.", "We noted in our October 2005 report that although the amounts of assets  blocked are not in themselves a complete measure to assess progress over  time, such information, along with other key performance metrics, could  help policy makers and program managers examine the results of OFAC\u2019s  asset blocking efforts. We recommended that the Secretary of the  Treasury provide more complete information in the annual Terrorist  Assets Report on the nature and extent of assets blocked, such as  differences in amounts blocked each year, explanations for such  differences, results of OFAC\u2019s terrorist asset blocking efforts, and  obstacles faced by the U.S. government. In commenting on a draft of our  report, Treasury observed that the Terrorist Assets Report \u201cis not  mandated or designed as an accountability measure.\u201d However, nothing in  the statutory language or the congressional intent underlying the mandate  precludes Treasury from compiling and reporting in this manner. Senior  OFAC officials acknowledged that the Terrorist Assets Report is not useful  for assessing results of asset blocking efforts. In its March 2006 letter to  relevant congressional oversight and appropriation committees, Treasury  responded that although it does not believe that the amounts of assets  blocked is a meaningful measure of its efforts\u2019 effectiveness, it would work  with Congress to discuss recrafting the Terrorist Assets Report to address  congressional interests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies have accomplished much in their efforts to combat terrorist  financing abroad. Despite the difficulties of interagency coordination,  TFWG has delivered counter-terrorism-financing training and technical  assistance to numerous vulnerable countries and has designated and  blocked significant amounts of terrorist assets. However, as GAO\u2019s  October 2005 report described, several challenges impact the effectiveness  of U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts. Without a strategic and integrated plan for  coordinating the funding and delivery of training and technical assistance  by the agencies, the U.S. government cannot maximize the use of its  resources in the fight against terrorist financing. Interagency disputes over  State-led TFWG roles and procedures have hampered TFWG leadership  and wasted staff energy and talent. In addition, decisions based on  anecdotal and informal information, rather than transparent and  systematic assessments, have hindered managers from effectively  addressing problems before they grow and potentially become crises.  Further, the U.S. government\u2019s, including TFWG\u2019s, failure to integrate all  available U.S. and international resources may result in missed  opportunities to leverage resources to meet related needs and risks,  particularly given the scarce expertise available to address counter- terrorism financing. Finally, without a functional performance  measurement system, TFWG lacks the information needed for optimal  coordination and planning.", "Although OFAC undertakes a number of important efforts with regard to  blocking terrorist assets, the lack of meaningful performance measures  and sufficient information regarding these efforts has created uncertainty  about their results and progress. The new performance measures that  OFAC has recently developed may enable Congress and other officials  with oversight responsibilities to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses  of these efforts as well as hold OFAC managers accountable. OFAC\u2019s  strategic plan, when completed, could further facilitate the development of  meaningful performance measures by describing the relation of  performance goals and measures to OFAC\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives.  In addition, including information in Treasury\u2019s annual Terrorist Assets  Reports that shows changes in the amounts of assets blocked from year to  year may help Congress and other officials better understand the  importance of these efforts in the overall U.S. effort to combat terrorist  financing and may assist in the strategic allocation of resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In view of congressional interest in U.S. government efforts to deliver  training and technical assistance abroad to combat terrorist financing and  the difficulty of obtaining a systematic assessment of U.S. resources  dedicated to this endeavor, as stated in our report, Congress should  consider requiring the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury  to submit an annual report to Congress showing the status of interagency  efforts to develop and implement an integrated strategic plan and  Memorandum of Agreement to ensure TFWG\u2019s seamless functioning,  particularly with respect to TFWG roles and procedures.", "Madame Chairwoman, this concludes my prepared statement.

With input from the intelligence and law enforcement communities,  identify and prioritize countries most vulnerable to terrorist financing ,  and needing the most assistance in combating it.  2.   Evaluate priority countries\u2019 counter-terrorism-financing and anti- money-laundering regimes with Financial Systems Assessment Team  (FSAT) on-site visits or Washington tabletop exercises. State-led FSAT  teams of 6 to 8 members include technical experts from State,  Treasury, Justice, and other regulatory and law enforcement agencies.  The FSAT on-site visits take about 1 week and include in-depth  meetings with host government financial regulatory agencies, the  judiciary, law enforcement agencies, the private financial services  sector, and nongovernmental organizations.  3.   Prepare a formal assessment report on each priority country\u2019s  vulnerabilities to terrorist financing and make recommendations for  training and technical assistance to address these weaknesses. The  formal report is shared with the county\u2019s government to gauge its  receptivity and to coordinate U.S. offers of assistance.  4.   Develop a counter-terrorism-financing training implementation plan  based on FSAT recommendations. Counter-terrorism-financing  assistance programs include financial investigative training to \u201cfollow  the money,\u201d financial regulatory training to detect and analyze  suspicious transactions, judicial and prosecutorial training to build  financial crime cases, financial intelligence unit development, and  training in detecting over- and under-invoicing schemes for money  laundering or terrorist financing.  5.   Provide sequenced training and technical assistance to priority  countries in the country, regionally, or in the United States.  6.   Encourage burden sharing with our allies, with international financial  institutions (e.g., IMF, World Bank, regional development banks), and  through international organizations such as the United Nations (UN),  the UN Counterterrorism Committee, Financial Action Task Force on  Money Laundering, or the Group of Eight (G-8) to capitalize on and  maximize international efforts to strengthen counter-terrorism- financing regimes around the world.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
