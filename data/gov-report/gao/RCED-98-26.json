AUI is a not-for-profit corporation that has operated the laboratory since it was created in 1947. In January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards\u2014some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory\u2019s High Flux Beam Reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.", "DOE\u2019s and BNL\u2019s investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE\u2019s or BNL\u2019s knowledge.

The resulting controversy about both BNL\u2019s handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE\u2019s oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997. In response to DOE\u2019s investigation and other factors, you asked us to further examine these issues. As agreed with your offices, we identified the events leading up to discovery of the tritium leak, evaluated why these events occurred, and determined the reasons used by the Secretary of Energy to terminate DOE\u2019s contract with AUI."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["BNL conducts basic and applied research in a multitude of scientific disciplines, including experimental and theoretical physics, medicine, chemistry, biology, and the environment.

As the operating contractor for BNL, AUI is responsible for day-to-day activities at the laboratory. Originally founded by nine universities, AUI has operated as a separate not-for-profit corporation since 1986.", "DOE\u2019s Brookhaven Group and DOE\u2019s Chicago Operations Office managed BNL for the Department. DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Research is the principal headquarters\u2019 organization responsible for BNL-wide programs, infrastructure, and environment, safety and health (ES&H). However, other DOE program offices, including the Office of Nuclear Energy and the Office of Environmental Management, have significant responsibilities for activities at BNL, as does the Office of Environment, Safety and Health, which also monitors and evaluates the laboratory\u2019s activities.", "At the local level, the Suffolk County Health Department is responsible for ensuring that BNL and private industries operating within the county do not contaminate the underground aquifer that provides the only source of drinking water for its 1.3 million residents. As a consequence of local citizens\u2019 sensitivity to possible contamination of the aquifer, the county has developed regulations that require underground tanks that contain potential contaminants to be lined to prevent the tanks from leaking. In 1987, after local hearings on chemical and radioactive releases at the laboratory, officials representing the county health department, DOE, and BNL signed an agreement that the laboratory would meet the county\u2019s requirements and would strive to minimize contamination of the aquifer. The agreement also allowed county health department officials access to BNL to inspect facilities and to identify tanks and other facilities that did not adhere to the county\u2019s requirements.", "The laboratory\u2019s High Flux Beam Reactor is the larger of the laboratory\u2019s two research reactors and is regulated by and must conform to standards that DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establish.Although its main purpose is to produce neutrons for scientific experiments, the reactor\u2019s cooling water becomes contaminated with the radioactive element tritium during operations. Tritium has many uses in medicine and biological research and is commonly used in self-illuminating wrist watches and exit signs. However, tritium is a health concern if ingested or absorbed into the body in large quantities. The reactor\u2019s 68,000-gallon spent-fuel pool has high concentrations of tritium stemming from the reactor\u2019s operations. Built in the early 1960s, the reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool is made of concrete but does not have a secondary containment, such as a stainless steel liner, to protect against possible leaks. Newer reactor fuel pools must have secondary containment systems to protect against such leaks.", "In January 1997, the laboratory\u2019s analysis of water samples taken near the reactor revealed concentrations of tritium that greatly exceeded EPA\u2019s drinking water standards (some samples taken later were 32 times the standard). Laboratory officials attributed the leak to the reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool.

On February 14, 1997, it released a report highly critical of both BNL\u2019s actions and DOE\u2019s oversight performance. A second report was issued in April 1997. In addition, the Attorney General of New York State issued a report on October 16, 1997, which was critical of BNL\u2019s and DOE\u2019s environmental performance.

The key events are as follows:", "Higher than expected levels of tritium were first discovered in a drinking water well about 500 feet from the reactor in 1986. BNL officials at the time reasoned that the tritium came from local sewer lines and did not suspect the reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool as a source. Sewer lines were a known source of tritium. Tritium originated from condensation that forms inside the reactor building and eventually reached the laboratory\u2019s sewer system. No further samples were taken from this well, which was closed because of high levels of other nonradioactive contaminants. In 1987, DOE and BNL officials signed an agreement with Suffolk County which stated that the laboratory would conform to the environmental provisions of the county\u2019s sanitary code and allowed county officials to inspect BNL property for the first time. In 1988, Suffolk County, which was registering BNL\u2019s underground tanks for eventual regulatory compliance, told the laboratory that it wanted the reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool listed as a tank. In 1989, BNL disagreed with the county\u2019s position. To allay the county\u2019s concerns, BNL said that the pool did not leak because it had successfully passed a leak test in 1989. BNL also said that two monitoring wells that were installed in 1989 near the reactor did not indicate any leaking from the reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool. Although BNL officials later told us that the leak test was not accurate and that the two monitoring wells they installed earlier were in the wrong location to detect the tritium contamination, BNL officials relied on these data as the basis for their confidence that the spent-fuel pool did not leak.", "During the late 1980s, the laboratory was coming under increasing environmental scrutiny. A 1988 DOE environmental survey reported weaknesses in BNL\u2019s groundwater monitoring program and noted that local citizens were concerned about groundwater contamination at the laboratory. In 1989, the EPA listed BNL as a Superfund site because of an old landfill problem. New York State had listed BNL as a state Superfund site 3 years earlier. In 1990, a special DOE headquarters inspection concluded that BNL did not have an adequate groundwater monitoring program.", "By 1993, BNL had begun discussing the need for additional monitoring wells near the reactor.", "In 1993, a BNL reactor official discussed with other BNL staff the need for additional monitoring wells near the reactor. This discussion was prompted by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission information bulletin that emphasized the need to monitor potential leaks from old equipment.", "Using BNL\u2019s data as support, a 1993 DOE report noted that the spent-fuel pool was not leaking. The report also noted, however, that there was no reliable means of determining if the spent-fuel pool was leaking.", "In early 1994, a BNL engineer proposed that monitoring wells\u2014at a total cost of $15,000 to $30,000\u2014be drilled near the reactor, citing the reason as \u201cgood management practice.\u201d The proposal was given a low priority by a team of BNL and DOE officials that reviewed environment, safety and health proposals. The well proposal did not rank sufficiently high, compared with other ES&H proposals, to receive funding. BNL officials continued to believe that the spent-fuel pool was not leaking.", "By late 1994, Suffolk County advised the laboratory that, under its regulations, the spent-fuel pool must be upgraded or abandoned. County officials told us that their demand on the laboratory to upgrade the spent-fuel pool was part of a general effort to upgrade all tanks that were still out of compliance with their sanitary code. The officials told us that they did not suspect that the spent-fuel pool was leaking. However, in their November quarterly meeting with Suffolk County, BNL and DOE staff agreed to install monitoring wells. The agreement was made at the staff level with no apparent senior management involvement in, or knowledge of, the agreement.", "In late 1994, plans were begun for installing the monitoring wells. However, because of a subsequent budget cut, the wells were not funded. In early 1996, the wells were again approved for funding and were installed that July. The first samples from the new wells were taken in October and results returned in December. Additional samples were taken that month and were returned in January 1997. The additional samples reflected tritium levels far exceeding EPA\u2019s drinking water standards. Further testing showed that an underground tritium \u201cplume\u201d of about 2,200 feet in length was coming from the reactor\u2019s spent-fuel pool and had been developing for at least 12 years. On the basis of a new leak test, the pool was estimated to have been leaking from 6 to 9 gallons of tritium-contaminated water per day. The four previous leak tests in 1989, 1994, 1995, and 1996 had used less sophisticated measurement techniques that failed to show the leak."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senior Officials at All Levels Are Responsible for the Delays in Discovering the Tritium Leak", "paragraphs": ["Responsibility for the conditions at BNL is shared among BNL, the Chicago Operations Office, the Brookhaven Group, and DOE headquarters managers.

In reaching this conclusion, laboratory officials relied heavily on leak rate tests conducted by in-house personnel during 1989, 1994, 1995, and 1996 which indicated that the spent-fuel pool was not leaking. BNL officials acknowledge, in retrospect, that these tests were not carefully conducted because laboratory staff failed to accurately measure the spent-fuel pool\u2019s evaporation rate. Tests conducted after the tritium leak was discovered more accurately accounted for evaporation rates and concluded that the pool was leaking 6 to 9 gallons per day.", "The officials who conducted the pool leak tests, who were part of the laboratory\u2019s reactor division, told us that they believed the tests were accurate because repeated tests produced the same results. Staff from the laboratory\u2019s safety and environmental protection division told us they did not question the reactor division\u2019s tests because of a high regard for its work.", "However, the laboratory\u2019s own investigation of the tritium leak concluded that the laboratory\u2019s safety and environmental protection division should have placed more emphasis on assessing potential risk and should have questioned the reactor division on the accuracy of the test results.", "BNL officials also relied on well-sampling results to reinforce their position that the spent-fuel pool was not leaking, but these samples did not provide adequate coverage of the area surrounding the reactor where the spent-fuel pool was located. BNL officials relied on two wells that were installed southeast (in the general direction of the underground water flow) of the reactor in 1989. They were part of a group of 51 wells installed throughout the laboratory site in response to a need to improve BNL\u2019s groundwater monitoring program. BNL used the results from the two monitoring wells near the reactor as further evidence that the spent-fuel pool was not leaking because water samples from these wells did not identify the tritium leak. Laboratory officials told us, in retrospect, that they erred in using the results from these wells, which were not in the correct location to detect the tritium leak.

Several factors suggest that the public\u2019s reaction could have been better anticipated. For example, Long Island residents have long been concerned with the quality of their drinking water and the potential harmful effects from laboratory-generated pollution. The county had been extensively monitoring for laboratory pollutants in the groundwater for years, and for tritium since 1979. Furthermore, DOE had been paying nearby residents\u2019 costs to switch from private wells to public water systems, a policy stemming in part from past groundwater chemical contamination coming from the laboratory and from other industrial sources.", "DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety and Health; the Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology; and the Director of the Office of Energy Research all told us of their dissatisfaction with BNL\u2019s and the Brookhaven Group\u2019s inability to develop effective ways to maintain the public\u2019s trust. DOE\u2019s Office of Oversight officials, who have conducted reviews of many different DOE facilities\u2014including three other laboratories\u2014told us that compared to other DOE facilities, BNL was relatively slow in developing mechanisms to gauge changes in the public\u2019s attitude toward the laboratory.

More rigorous attention to this agreement could have led to monitoring wells being installed more promptly. In their November 1994 meeting with Suffolk County officials, DOE and BNL staff agreed to install monitoring wells near the reactor. The agreement was made in response to Suffolk County\u2019s concern about the laboratory\u2019s progress in upgrading its many underground tanks (upgrading underground tanks was an important feature of the county\u2019s 1987 agreement with DOE and BNL). This agreement was summarized in the minutes from the November 1994 meeting. The proposal to install the wells was reported in subsequent BNL project schedules, which were reviewed by BNL and DOE management.", "The informality of the agreement to install monitoring wells made at the November meeting with Suffolk County officials had several important consequences. DOE and laboratory staff told us they did not track the laboratory\u2019s progress toward installing the wells. Also, because the agreements were made at the staff level and were documented only by informal notes, senior laboratory officials and DOE managers told us they were not aware that an agreement had been made. Thus, these managers lacked the information they needed to (1) gauge the relative importance of the staff\u2019s recommendations to install the wells and (2) use this information to adjust funding priorities, such as reallocating funding among laboratory programs.", "Also, DOE has never completely reviewed the laboratory\u2019s progress in complying with the county\u2019s sanitary code, nor does it document its activities associated with county compliance issues.

For example, the monitoring wells could have been funded by BNL\u2019s (1) reactor division, which operates and maintains the reactor; (2) safety and environmental protection division, which manages an ES&H account derived from overhead funds; or (3) plant engineering division, which has an ES&H budget account. Plant engineering actually funded the monitoring wells because the reactor division staff did not believe it was their responsibility to pay for the wells\u2014they wanted the safety and environmental protection division to pay for them.", "DOE\u2019s complex organizational structure prevented effective accountability over the Brookhaven Group.

To improve our understanding of the matters discussed in these reports, we (1) interviewed the authors and staff of each study, (2) obtained and reviewed documents and studies discussed in the reports, and (3) discussed the results of the studies with officials from the numerous organizations involved in the tritium situation. For example, within DOE we interviewed Office of Environment, Safety and Health officials who had evaluated the tritium recovery effort and safety management processes at the laboratory; the Chicago Operations Office manager and staff who were responsible for overseeing activities of DOE\u2019s local Brookhaven office (the Brookhaven Group) during the early 1990s; and officials of DOE\u2019s Brookhaven Group who administered DOE\u2019s contract with AUI and who reviewed the laboratory\u2019s reactor, ES&H, and groundwater monitoring programs. At Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), we interviewed the president, the former and the current laboratory director, and the vice president responsible for ES&H activities. We supplemented the information obtained during these meetings by interviewing the BNL associate director and staff responsible for operating the High Flux Beam Reactor and its spent-fuel pool and for implementing groundwater monitoring and other ES&H programs at the site. We also interviewed officials from other organizations who regulate aspects of the laboratory\u2019s environmental efforts or its compliance with local environmental laws.
