In 2012, VA established the Office of Health Equity to identify and address health care outcome disparities and to develop an action plan to achieve health equity. This office issued an action plan in 2014 that identified activities to make improvements in five focus areas, such as increasing awareness of the significance of disparities and strengthening leadership for addressing them. However, GAO found that the extent of VA's progress in implementing the action plan and advancing health equity is unknown because the action plan lacked performance measures and clear lines of accountability for specific offices. For example, although VA's action plan included a list of \u201csuccess criteria\u201d for each of the five focus areas, these criteria were not measurable, and were not linked to specific activities or to offices responsible for implementation.", "VA funds research efforts that have identified disparities in health care outcomes involving minority veterans, but rely on data that VA officials and researchers noted have weaknesses in completeness and accuracy. One concern is that race and ethnicity information can be labeled incorrectly in VA patients' electronic health records as \u201dself-reported\u201d, a highly reliable method of collection, when data were actually collected based on the less reliable method of VA staff observation. Other reported concerns include missing values on patients' race and conflicting race and ethnicity information. VA researchers told GAO they account for some of these concerns by using data from other sources, such as Medicare, but such work-arounds are time intensive. Further, VA officials reported that data weaknesses limit their ability to identify and address disparities in health care outcomes in their medical centers. Despite recognizing weaknesses related to the quality of race and ethnicity data, VA has not implemented corrective actions to address them. Without doing so, VA medical center officials cannot readily identify and address disparities in health care outcomes by race and ethnicity.", "Note: Concerns about the completeness and accuracy of race and ethnicity information were raised by officials from VA's Office of Health Equity, Veterans Experience Office, and Health Services Research & Development."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations to VA to (1) ensure that any health equity action plan includes performance measures to assess progress, and clear lines of accountability designating responsibility to specific offices, and (2) conduct an assessment to determine how to address weaknesses identified with the completeness and accuracy of race and ethnicity data in the electronic health record, and implement corrective actions as necessary.

For example, in 2011,  VA found outcomes for controlling blood pressure, blood glucose, and  cholesterol levels were significantly worse for Black or African American  veterans than they were for White veterans. Additionally, VA has noted  racial and ethnic disparities in reported patient experiences. For example,  in 2013, VA researchers found higher rates of negative experiences at VA  medical centers reported by Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander,  American Indian/Alaska Native and multiracial veterans compared with  other minority veterans and White veterans, particularly in areas of doctor  and nurse communication, speed of receipt of care, and overall rating of  health care. More recently, in 2019, VA reported evidence of disparities  in health care outcomes within VA medical centers in the form of lower  survival rates for African American veterans with cancer and  cardiovascular-related illnesses compared with other minority veterans  and White veterans.", "A report accompanying the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2018, included a provision for us to  review whether VA provides quality, equitable health care for minority  veterans, among other things.

We reviewed VA-funded research related to identifying and  reducing disparities in health care outcomes. Based on this review, we  interviewed researchers about their efforts to identify disparities in health  care outcomes involving minority veterans and achieving health equity.  We also spoke with VA Central Office officials, including officials from the  Quality Enhancement Research Initiative, the Center for Health Equity,  Research, and Promotion, and the Office of Patient Centered Care and  Cultural Transformation.

We reviewed VA webinar presentations on race and ethnicity data.  To determine how race and ethnicity data are collected and to obtain  perspectives on the completeness and accuracy of such data, we  conducted interviews with five VA researchers, who are also data experts,  selected based on their publications in peer-reviewed journals on  disparities in health care outcomes and knowledge of race and ethnicity  research at VA medical centers. We interviewed officials from two  Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) in order to obtain their  perspectives on using race and ethnicity data to assess health care  disparities in their networks. We selected these officials because of their  prior efforts working with VA researchers to assess race and ethnicity  data among their minority veteran populations. The perspectives of these  officials are not generalizable. We also interviewed officials from two  private health care systems, selected because of their efforts to address  health care disparities. We asked them about the methods they use to  collect race and ethnicity data, and how they have used these data to  assess and address disparities in health care outcomes and patient  experience.

To obtain information on the types and nature of  patient feedback received by patient advocates at VA medical centers, we  interviewed VA officials with the Office of Patient Advocacy and  conducted interviews with four patient advocate coordinators across four  VISNs, and small group interviews with 21 VA medical center patient  advocates located in 12 medical centers within the four VISNs. We  selected these medical centers to provide diversity in geographic regions,  number of enrollees\u2019 by race per VISN, facility complexity, and racial and  ethnic demographics of the veteran population. The perspectives  obtained from staff located within the 12 VA medical centers and four  VISNs cannot be generalized.

Intake clerks may also collect and record race and  ethnicity information when assisting veterans with enrollment, as well as  when checking a veteran in at a clinic for an outpatient appointment, or  registering a veteran for an inpatient hospital admission. However, VA  researchers and officials have identified weaknesses in the completeness  and accuracy of VA\u2019s patient data on race and ethnicity, which has raised  data reliability concerns.

VA follows standards outlined  by the Office of Management Budget, which state that self-reported  information is the preferred method for obtaining an individual\u2019s race  and ethnicity, because it is more accurate than data collected by  observation of a third party. However, a VA data expert with  HSR&D\u2019s Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, and  officials at one of the VISNs in our review told us that they are aware  that intake clerks sometimes enter information based on observation,  which may be inaccurate, because they feel uncomfortable asking  veterans for their race and ethnicity information in case the veterans  find it offensive. Adding further to potential inaccuracies, because  VA\u2019s EHR default setting automatically records all race and ethnicity  information as self-reported, observational data are only accurately  labeled as such if a clerk manually changes the default setting to  \u2018observational\u2019. The VA data expert from HSR&D\u2019s Center for Health  Equity Research and Promotion told us that, based on her research,  almost all of the information collected electronically in the EHR is  automatically assigned as self-reported, the default setting, even  when it is collected by observation of VA staff. This expert also told us  that research efforts at VA medical centers have indicated that the  default setting is rarely changed and that some clerks had never  changed the setting because they do not know how. VA research has  indicated that observational data is more accurate for Blacks or  African Americans and Whites than other racial groups, and that  studies focused on other racial groups may be especially vulnerable  to misclassification bias.

Two VA  researchers told us that ethnicity data\u2014based on veterans\u2019  designation of whether they are Hispanic or non-Hispanic\u2014are often  more complete than race data. They said that one reason for this is  that the order in which the questions are asked may be problematic;  specifically, the ethnicity question is asked first, followed by a second  question to request a race designation. Veterans may self-report that  they are \u201cHispanic\u201d upon enrollment or check-in for an inpatient  admission or outpatient medical visit, and then leave the race field  empty because they believe that they have already provided this  information. Missing data on race impedes VA\u2019s ability to identify  potential disparities in health care outcomes.", "Conflicting race and ethnicity information in a veteran\u2019s medical  records makes it difficult to determine which information is  accurate.

The  official told us that she subsequently contacted both VISN-level and  national data specialists, but was still unable to obtain the data to  assess health care outcomes by veterans\u2019 race and ethnicity at the  regional or local level. other VISN officials we spoke to explained that they had a similar  experience when they explored using race and ethnicity data to  design a dashboard for a VISN-funded project to track efforts to  address disparities in ambulatory care readmissions involving minority  veterans. They also told us they too contacted regional and national  data specialists, but were told that the readmissions data were  missing and inaccurate by race and ethnicity and therefore not  useable for their efforts.", "VA officials told us they are taking steps to provide VA medical centers  with data on health care outcomes at their facilities. These officials told us  that they are currently developing two health equity dashboards that will  use VA\u2019s data on race and ethnicity to provide information on health care  outcomes, which would allow VA staff to identify any disparities in these  outcomes at the VISN and VA medical center levels. The two health  equity dashboards are in different stages of development and, as of  September 2019, VA did not have a timeline for completion and  implementation across VA medical centers for either dashboard.  According to VA officials, the development of these dashboards will not  address the accuracy and completeness of the race and ethnicity data in  the VA\u2019s EHR. In order to maximize the effectiveness of these  dashboards, VA needs to ensure that underlying data weaknesses are  addressed by ensuring that race and ethnicity data in the EHR are  complete and accurate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Collects Patient Experience Feedback from Veterans, including Minority Veterans, through Surveys and VA Medical Center Patient Advocates", "paragraphs": ["VA collects patient experience feedback from veterans, including minority  veterans, through the following surveys:", "The Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP) is VA\u2019s  national, standardized, and publically reported patient experience  survey that comprises up to 83 questions that are used to collect  information about patients\u2019 experiences in various inpatient care  settings. The SHEP covers topics to assess patients\u2019 perceptions of  their experience using the Consumer Assessment of Health Providers  and Systems Survey, which is the health care industry standard.  According to VA officials, the response rate for the SHEP is just under  40 percent, and on average, 95 percent of respondents complete  survey questions about their race and ethnicity. SHEP survey results  are reported publically at the national, VISN, and VA medical center  level.", "VA does not report survey data for specific racial and ethnic groups  because, according to VA officials, the number of minority veterans  responding to the SHEP is too small to report. In 2012, a memo  establishing the OHE recommended that VA send the SHEP survey to  a higher number of veterans from racial and ethnic minority groups so  there are enough responses to report survey results by those minority  groups. However, VA officials told us that they were not aware of this  recommendation and had not addressed it. Currently, VA officials told  us that VA staff can access SHEP data by race and ethnicity in four  broad categories: Hispanic, White, African American or Black, and  other, which includes American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, and  Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander racial groups. VA officials  told us these data can be accessed on VA\u2019s intranet and are updated  on a monthly basis.", "The Survey of Veteran Enrollees\u2019 Health and Use of Health Care  comprises questions about a range of issues, such as enrollee\u2019s  health status, insurance, VA and community health care use, and  attitudes and perceptions of VA services. The survey is generally  conducted on an annual basis, and achieved a 32 percent response  rate in 2018. VA publically reports these survey results by race and  ethnicity at the national level, and also provides survey results by race  and ethnicity for each VISN. For example, one indicator in the 2018  survey results showed that Native Hawaiians were far less satisfied  with their ability to get referrals compared to other minority groups.  According to VA survey documentation, VA requires a minimum  number of survey responses to draw conclusions across the VA  enrollee population; the number of survey responses must be  aggregated at the VISN level to meet this minimum number.", "Veterans Signals is a VA survey intended to collect immediate  targeted feedback on veterans\u2019 experiences with outpatient services  on an ongoing basis. VA officials told us that about one to two million  survey invitations are sent out via email each week to veterans who  recently received outpatient services, and have provided their email  addresses to VA. These short surveys include eight to nine questions  and focus on a particular area related to veterans\u2019 recent experiences  with VA health care services, such as scheduling appointments,  pharmacy wait times, and proficiency of provider communication  about veteran concerns during appointments. VA officials told us that  the surveys have a response rate of about 20 percent, and of the  responses received, 44 percent of respondents provide their race and  ethnicity information.  VA officials told us that VA medical center  staff have access to survey results in real-time and can review results  by race and ethnicity for their individual medical centers.", "In addition to these surveys, VA collects patient experience feedback  from veterans, including minority veterans, through its patient advocates  located at its medical centers. Each of VA\u2019s 172 VA medical centers is  responsible for making at least one patient advocate available to respond  to veterans\u2019 feedback and for ensuring feedback is recorded in its Patient  Advocate Tracking System (PATS)\u2014an electronic system used to  describe and track the resolution of veterans\u2019 feedback across VA  medical centers. Patient advocates enter veterans\u2019 feedback in PATS and  assign one or more issue codes that generally describe the nature of the  feedback. Of the 21 patient advocates we interviewed across 12 VA  medical centers, most said they generally do not include race and  ethnicity information in PATS when filing a veteran\u2019s complaint, but a few  patient advocates said they will include such information if it pertains  directly to the complaint. For example, a patient advocate told us she may  include race and ethnicity information in PATS in the case of a concern  that discrimination occurred.", "We found that some veteran complaints may not be consistently coded  and reported under the correct PATS issue codes in a manner similar to  inconsistencies we have identified in prior work. According to VA  officials from the Office of Patient Advocacy, two PATS codes were  created in 2017 that, in particular, may specifically apply to issues  affecting minority veterans: (1) discrimination concerns, and (2) diversity  concerns. Of the 21 patient advocates we interviewed about these two  specific issue codes, nine were not familiar with or had never used them.  VA officials told us that they expected to see patient advocates use these  codes more often in 2019 as a result of updates to their patient advocate  training curriculum, required for newly hired patient advocates and  available to all others.", "Patient advocates that we interviewed often told us that they review PATS  data to report systemic issues to their VA medical center leadership, and  a few said they report on a weekly or monthly basis.

Although VA is  developing equity dashboards to provide health care outcomes data by  race and ethnicity at the VA medical center level, these efforts will not  improve the completeness and accuracy of the race and ethnicity data in  VA\u2019s EHR.
