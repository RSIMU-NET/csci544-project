Many stakeholders we spoke with, along with panelists on our expert panel, identified a number of weaknesses of the existing spectrum allocation process, including that the current process is slow and leads to underutilization of the spectrum. FCC staff have identified two alternative allocation models: the \"exclusive, flexible rights\" model--which would extend the existing process by providing greater flexibility to spectrum license holders--and the \"open-access\" (or \"commons\") model--which would allow an unlimited number of unlicensed users to share spectrum. While little consensus exists about fully adopting either alternative model, FCC staff, as well as many stakeholders and panelists on our expert panel, recommend a balanced approach that would combine elements of the current process and the two alternative models. FCC's use of auctions to assign spectrum appears to have little to no negative impact on end-user prices, infrastructure deployment, and competition; evidence on how auctions impact the entry and participation of small businesses is less clear. Additionally, FCC's implementation of auctions has mitigated problems associated with comparative hearings and lotteries, which FCC previously used to assign licenses. In particular, auctions are quicker, less costly, and more transparent. Finally, secondary markets provide an additional mechanism for companies to acquire licenses and gain access to spectrum, and FCC has undertaken actions to facilitate secondary-market transactions, such as streamlining the approval process for leases. Industry stakeholders and panelists on our expert panel offered a number of options for improving spectrum management. The most frequently cited options include (1) extending FCC's auction authority, (2) reexamining the use and distribution of spectrum--such as between commercial and governmental use--to enhance the efficient and effective use of this important resource, and (3) ensuring flexibility in commercially licensed spectrum bands. Stakeholders and panelists on our expert panel overwhelmingly supported extending FCC's auction authority; however, there was little consensus on the other identified options for improvement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The radio-frequency spectrum is a natural resource used to provide an  array of wireless communications services that are critical to the U.S.  economy and national security, such as mobile voice and data services,  radio and television broadcasting, radar, and satellite-based services.

As a result, nearly all parties are becoming  increasingly concerned about the availability of spectrum for future needs,  because most of the usable spectrum in the United States has already been  allocated to existing services and users. These concerns are compounded  by evidence that some of the spectrum is currently underutilized.  Therefore, to promote a more efficient use of this resource and meet future  needs, FCC has increasingly adopted more market-oriented approaches to  spectrum management in recent years, including using a competitive  bidding process, or auctions, to assign spectrum licenses to commercial  users. Prior to auctions, FCC used comparative hearings, which were quasi- judicial forums, and lotteries as assignment mechanisms. As of November  30, 2005, FCC has held 59 auctions for over 56,000 licenses to select  between competing applications for the same license, and generated over  $14.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury.", "The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act required GAO to examine  FCC\u2019s commercial spectrum licensing process.

To address these issues, we  reviewed and synthesized relevant economic, legal, and policy-oriented  literature, such as the Spectrum Policy Task Force report, a document  produced by FCC staff. In addition, we hosted, in conjunction with the  National Academies, two balanced and diverse expert panels with 23  experts representing academia, government, and industry. The experts  discussed policy issues related to spectrum allocation and assignment, as  well as options for improving spectrum management in the future. We also  conducted semi-structured interviews with representatives of academia,  government, and industry. Finally, we interviewed officials at FCC and  analyzed data from FCC\u2019s three primary spectrum license databases: the  Universal Licensing System, the Consolidated Database System, and the  International Bureau Filing System.

It is the medium that makes possible wireless  communications and supports a vast array of commercial and  governmental services. Commercial entities use spectrum to provide a  variety of wireless services, including mobile voice and data, paging,  broadcast television and radio, and satellite services. Additionally, some  companies use spectrum for private tasks, such as communicating with  remote vehicles. Federal, state, and local agencies also use spectrum to  fulfill a variety of government missions. For example, state and local police  departments, fire departments, and other emergency services agencies use  spectrum to transmit and receive critical voice and data communications,  and federal agencies use spectrum for varied mission needs such as  national defense, law enforcement, weather services, and aviation  communication.", "Spectrum is managed at the international and national levels. The  International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the  United Nations, coordinates spectrum management decisions among  nations. Spectrum management decisions generally require international  coordination, since radio waves can cross national borders. Once spectrum  management decisions are made at the ITU, regulators within each nation,  to varying degrees, will follow the ITU decisions. In the United States,  responsibility for spectrum management is divided between two agencies:  FCC and NTIA. FCC manages spectrum use for nonfederal users, including  commercial, private, and state and local government users under authority  provided in the Communications Act. NTIA manages spectrum for federal  government users and acts for the President with respect to spectrum  management issues. FCC and NTIA, with direction from the Congress,  jointly determine the amount of spectrum allocated to federal and  nonfederal users, including the amount allocated to shared use. Figure 1  shows the current allocation of spectrum between federal and nonfederal  users.", "Historically, concern about interference or crowding among users has been  a driving force in the management of spectrum. FCC and NTIA work to  minimize interference through two primary spectrum management  functions\u2014the \u201callocation\u201d and the \u201cassignment\u201d of radio spectrum.  Specifically:  Allocation involves segmenting the radio spectrum into bands of  frequencies that are designated for use by particular types of radio  services or classes of users. For example, the frequency bands between  88 and 108 megahertz (MHz) are allocated to FM radio broadcasting in  the United States. In addition to allocation, spectrum managers also  specify service rules, which include the technical and operating  characteristics of equipment.", "Assignment, which occurs after spectrum has been allocated for  particular types of services or classes of users, involves providing a  license or authorization to use a specific portion of spectrum to users,  such as commercial entities or government agencies. FCC assigns  licenses for frequency bands to commercial enterprises, state and local  governments, and other entities, while NTIA makes frequency  assignments to federal agencies.", "In some frequency bands, FCC authorizes unlicensed use of spectrum\u2014 that is, users do not need to obtain a license to use the spectrum. Rather,  an unlimited number of unlicensed users can share frequencies on a non- interference basis. Thus, the assignment process does not apply to the use  of unlicensed devices. However, manufacturers of unlicensed equipment  must receive authorization from FCC before operating or marketing an  unlicensed device.", "When FCC assigns a portion of spectrum to a single entity, the license is  considered exclusive. When two or more entities apply for the same  exclusive license, FCC classifies these as mutually exclusive applications\u2014 that is, the grant of a license to one entity would preclude the grant to one  or more other entities. For mutually exclusive applications, FCC has  primarily used the following three assignment mechanisms.", "Comparative hearings were quasi-judicial forums in which competing  applicants argued why they should be awarded a license, and FCC  awarded licenses based on pre-established comparative criteria. FCC  principally used comparative hearings from 1934 to 1984. Critics  asserted that comparative hearings were time consuming and resource  intensive, lacked transparency, and often led to protracted litigation.", "Lotteries entailed FCC randomly selecting licensees from a pool of  qualified applicants. Congress authorized FCC to use lotteries to assign  mutually exclusive licenses in 1981, partially in response to the  administrative burden associated with comparative hearings. FCC used  lotteries from 1984 to 1993. Critics contended that lottery winners  were not always the best suited to provide services; thus, several years  could pass before the licenses were transferred in the secondary market  to entities capable of deploying a system and effectively using the  spectrum.", "Auctions are a market-based mechanism in which FCC assigns a  license to the entity that submits the highest bid for specific bands of  spectrum. The Congress provided FCC with authority to use auctions to  assign mutually exclusive licenses for certain subscriber-based wireless services in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. In  subsequent years, the Congress has modified and extended FCC\u2019s  auction authority, including exempting some licenses from competitive  bidding, such as licenses for public safety radio services and  noncommercial educational broadcast services. Critics of auctions  have suggested that auctions raise consumer prices for wireless  services, slow the deployment of wireless systems, and are a barrier for  small businesses.", "As of November 30, 2005, FCC has conducted 59 auctions to select between  competing applications for the same license, which have generated over  $14.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury. However, only a very small portion of  total licenses has been auctioned. In particular, FCC has auctioned  approximately 56,100 licenses\u2014about 2 percent of total licenses. (See fig.  2.) The other 98 percent of licenses have been assigned through other  means.", "In recent years, two government-led task forces have examined spectrum  policy in the U.S. FCC established the Spectrum Policy Task Force,  comprised of FCC staff, to assist the Commission in identifying and  evaluating changes in spectrum policy that would increase the public  benefits derived from the use of spectrum. In November 2002, the task  force released a report that contained a number of recommendations,  including promoting more market-based mechanisms to allocate  spectrum. The Commission subsequently implemented several of the task  force\u2019s recommendations, including developing rules for leasing spectrum.  The Federal Government Spectrum Task Force, comprised of the heads of  executive branch departments, agencies, and offices, examined spectrum  policy for government use, including homeland security, public safety,  scientific research, federal transportation infrastructure, and law  enforcement. In June 2004, the Department of Commerce released two  reports based on the task force\u2019s findings, which contained a number of  recommendations for reforms to federal agencies\u2019 use of spectrum. For  example, the Department of Commerce recommended adopting incentives  for more efficient use of spectrum by government agencies. However, as  we noted in 2003, the bifurcated responsibility between FCC and NTIA for  spectrum management can hinder reform. Specifically, neither FCC nor  NTIA has ultimate decision making authority over spectrum management  or the authority to impose fundamental reform. Because of the lack of a  single decision making point for spectrum reform, we recommended that  the Congress consider establishing an independent commission that would  conduct a comprehensive examination of spectrum management.

In addition, for most frequency bands FCC allocates, the agency  issues service rules to define the terms and conditions for spectrum use  within the given bands. These rules typically specify eligibility standards as  well as limitations on the services that relevant entities may offer and the  technologies and power levels they may use. These decisions can constrain  users\u2019 ability to offer services and equipment of their choosing.", "FCC has provided greater operational and technical flexibility within  certain frequency bands. For example, FCC\u2019s rules for Commercial Mobile  Radio Service (CMRS), which include cellular and PCS services, are  considered less restrictive. Under these rules, wireless telephony operators  are free to select technologies, services, and business models of their  choosing. In contrast, spectrum users have relatively little latitude for  making such choices in frequency bands allocated for broadcast television  services.", "Despite these efforts, many industry stakeholders and experts with whom  we spoke cited a number of weaknesses in the command-and-control  process for spectrum allocation. The most frequently cited weakness by  our expert panel was the slowness of the allocation process.  Because of  the regulatory nature of the command-and-control process, arriving at  allocation decisions can be a protracted process. The slow moving  allocation process delays consumers\u2019 access to new technologies. In  addition, some panelists noted that the current allocation process leads to  underutilization of spectrum. For example, a recent study found that during  a four-day period in New York City, only 13 percent of spectrum between 30  MHz and 2.9 GHz was occupied at one time or another. Another weakness  cited by a number of stakeholders was that the command-and-control  process does not systematically allocate spectrum to its highest value uses.

This is a licensed-based approach to spectrum  management that extends the existing allocation process by providing  greater flexibility regarding the use of spectrum and the ability to transfer  licenses or to lease spectrum usage rights. Licensees with exclusive  licenses can exclude others from using the spectrum they have been  assigned, and with flexible rights they enjoy flexibility to provide the  services they wish with their licenses, provided they comply with  applicable FCC rules and policies. To a certain extent, the model treats  spectrum like real estate, and some have suggested moving far in this  direction by turning spectrum licenses into full property rights\u2014an option  that existing legislation currently prohibits. FCC\u2019s broadband PCS rules  closely resemble this model, in that they provide substantial flexibility to  licensees in terms of technology and use of spectrum.", "Proponents cite several advantages with the exclusive, flexible rights  model. First, proponents argue that this model would promote the  economically efficient use of spectrum. For example, advocates typically  point to CMRS to support this argument, as CMRS licenses are exclusive  and governed by relatively flexible rules; in addition, the market for CMRS  services is highly valuable, innovative, and fast-growing. Second,  proponents suggest that the model provides certainty for licensees. The  model provides a reliable means of protecting commercial users from  interference, allowing them to guarantee quality of service on a wide scale.  Third, proponents argue that greater certainty will encourage investment in  technology and infrastructure.", "Opponents cite several problems with the exclusive, flexible rights model.  For example, opponents assert that the model might not promote  technically efficient, or intensive, use of spectrum. According to some  critics, exclusivity might reduce licensees\u2019 incentives to invest in  developing more technically efficient technologies as users have  guaranteed access to spectrum, thereby deterring innovation. In addition,  some opponents assert that the model could encourage \u201choarding\u201d of  spectrum, as licensees could benefit from blocking access to spectrum by  potential competitors.

As with exclusive, flexible rights, users would have greater  latitude in determining how they use spectrum. However, in this case,  markets for end-user equipment, rather than for licenses, would determine  how different frequency bands are used or allocated. Under this model,  commercial spectrum-based service providers would not seek to maximize  their return on spectrum licenses, but rather, on the sale of equipment that,  once purchased, would allow consumers to enjoy wireless services.", "Proponents of the open-access model cite several advantages with this  approach to spectrum allocation. For example, proponents assert that the  open-access model will promote the technically efficient use of spectrum.  In order to avoid interference, users have an incentive to develop smarter  equipment that will use the spectrum intelligently. An example of  technically efficient equipment is agile radio. Agile radios can determine if  a specific frequency is currently in use, emit in that band if it is not, and  switch to another band in microseconds if another user begins to emit in that band. In fact, supporters of the open-access model believe that open  access to spectrum will foster the development of technologies that will  reduce spectrum scarcity, and therefore interference problems, as a new  type of wireless architecture becomes possible. According to proponents,  the open-access model for spectrum allocation also limits the ability for  companies to \u201choard\u201d spectrum\u2014that is, since there would be no exclusive  use of spectrum in this model, companies could no longer block their  competitors from acquiring spectrum by simply acquiring or holding on to  spectrum themselves. In addition, since users would no longer need to buy  spectrum rights, the open-access model reduces barriers to entry into  spectrum-based markets, according to proponents.", "Opponents cite several problems with the open-access model. One cited  problem is that an open-access approach could lead to the overuse of  spectrum. Specifically, opponents believe that the technologies that could  end spectrum scarcity are years away from realization. Without such  technologies, an unlimited number of unlicensed users would result in the  overuse of spectrum and interference. Moreover, opponents argue that the  uncertainty about interference would inhibit investment. Another cited  problem is the potential irreversibility of this model\u2014that is, once  consumers have the equipment, it would be difficult to prevent them from  accessing the spectrum if the spectrum were needed for some other  purpose in the future.

First, secondary markets  can promote more efficient use of spectrum. If existing licensees are not  fully utilizing the spectrum, secondary markets provide a mechanism  whereby these licensees can transfer use of the spectrum to other  companies that would utilize the spectrum, thereby increasing the amount  of available spectrum and reducing the perceived scarcity of spectrum.  Second, secondary markets can facilitate the participation of small  businesses and introduction of new technologies. For example, a company  might have a greater incentive to deploy new technologies that require less  spectrum if the company can profitably transfer the unused portion of the  spectrum to another company through the secondary market. Also, several  stakeholders we spoke to noted that secondary markets provide a  mechanism whereby a small business can acquire spectrum for a  geographic area that best meets the needs of the company."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Industry Stakeholders and Panelists Suggested Several Options to Improve Spectrum Management", "paragraphs": ["Industry stakeholders and panelists on our expert panel offered a number  of options for improving spectrum management.

For  example, 21 of 22 of panelists on our expert panel indicated that the  Congress should extend FCC\u2019s auction authority beyond the September 30,  2007 expiration date. As mentioned earlier, panelists and stakeholders  believe that auctions are more efficient than previous mechanisms used to  assign spectrum licenses; moreover, auctions are viewed as being faster,  less costly, and more transparent than the previous mechanisms.  Additionally, extending FCC\u2019s auction authority could generate significant  revenues for the government. However, panelists and stakeholders also  noted that the government should use spectrum auctions to promote the  efficient use of spectrum, not necessarily to maximize revenues for the  government.", "While panelists on our expert panel overwhelmingly supported extending  FCC\u2019s auction authority, a majority also suggested modifications to  enhance the use of auctions. However, there was little consensus on the  suggested modifications. The suggested modifications fall into the  following three categories:  Better define license rights. Some industry stakeholders and  panelists indicated that FCC should better define the rights  accompanying spectrum licenses, as these rights can significantly affect  the value of a license being auctioned. For example, some industry  stakeholders express concern with FCC assigning overlay and underlay  rights to frequency bands when a company holds a license for the same  frequency bands.", "Enhance secondary markets. Industry stakeholders we contacted and  panelists on our expert panel generally believe that modifying the rules  governing secondary markets could lead to more efficient use of  spectrum. For example, some panelists on our expert panel said that  FCC should increase its involvement in the secondary market. These  panelists thought that increased oversight could help to both ensure  transparency in the secondary market and also promote the use of the  secondary market. Additionally, a few panelists said that adoption of a  \u201ctwo-sided\u201d auction would support the efficient use of spectrum.  With a  two-sided auction, FCC would offer unassigned spectrum and existing  licensees could make available the spectrum usage rights they currently  hold.", "Reexamine existing small business incentives. The opinions of  panelists on our expert panel and industry stakeholders with whom we  spoke varied greatly regarding the need for and success of FCC\u2019s efforts  to promote economic opportunities for small businesses. For example,  some panelists and industry stakeholders do not support incentive  programs for small businesses. These panelists and industry  stakeholders cited several reasons for not supporting these incentives,  including (1) the wireless industry is not a small business industry; (2)  while the policy may have been well intended, the current program is  flawed; or (3) such incentives create inefficiencies in the market. Other  industry stakeholders suggested alternative programs to support small  businesses. These suggestions included (1) having licenses cover  smaller geographic areas, (2) using auctions set aside exclusively for  small and rural businesses, and (3) providing better lease options for  small and rural businesses. Finally, some industry stakeholders with  whom we spoke have benefited from the small business incentive  programs, such as bidding credits, and believe that these incentives  have been an effective means to promote small business participation in  wireless markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reexamine the Use and Distribution of Spectrum", "paragraphs": ["Panelists on our expert panel suggested a reexamination of the use and  distribution of spectrum to ensure the most efficient and effective use of  this important resource.

To  gain a better understanding, a few panelists suggested that the government  systematically track usage, perhaps through a \u201cspectrum census.\u201d This  information would allow the government to determine if some portions of  spectrum were underutilized, and if so, to make appropriate allocation  changes and adjustments.", "A number of panelists on our expert panel also suggested that the  government evaluate the relative allocation of spectrum for government  and commercial use as well as the allocation of spectrum for licensed and  unlicensed purposes. While panelists thought the relative allocation  between these categories should be examined, there was little consensus  among the panelists on the appropriate allocation.  For instance, as shown  in figure 3, 13 panelists indicated that more spectrum should be dedicated  to commercial use, while 7 thought the current distribution was  appropriate. No panelists thought that more spectrum should be dedicated  to government use.  Similarly, as shown in figure 4, nine panelists believed  that more spectrum should be dedicated to licensed uses, six believed  more should be dedicated to unlicensed uses, and five thought the current  balance was appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensure Clearly Defined Rights and Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Similar to a suggested modification of FCC\u2019s use of auctions, some  panelists on our expert panel suggested better defining users\u2019 rights and  increasing flexibility in the allocation of spectrum.

In addition, some panelists stated that greater flexibility in the  type of technology used\u2014and service offered\u2014within frequency bands  would help promote the efficient use of spectrum. In particular, greater  flexibility would allow the licensee to determine the efficient and highly  valued use, rather than relying on FCC-based allocation and service rules.

First,  although we were able to secure the participation of a balanced, highly  qualified group of experts, there are other experts in this field who could  not be included because of the need to limit the size of the panel. Although  many points of view were represented, the panel was not representative of  all potential views. Second, even though we conducted preliminary  research, in cooperation with The National Academies, and heard from  national experts in their fields, two panels cannot represent the current  practice in this vast arena. More thought, discussion, and research must be  done to develop greater agreement on what is really known, what needs to  be done, and how to do it. These two key limitations and qualifications  provide contextual boundaries.
