USDA is engaged in research efforts aimed at better understanding climate change's impacts on agriculture and providing technical assistance to farmers. Through the use of existing conservation and energy programs, USDA aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester (store) carbon so it is not released, or is actively withdrawn, from the atmosphere.", "Helping to make farmers more resilient to climate change is one of USDA's four strategic goals, but the agency is not using its performance planning and reporting process to provide information on how it intends to accomplish this goal or to assess the status of its efforts in this area. According to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, as amended, an agency's performance plan is supposed to explain how the agency will accomplish its performance goals, and its performance reports are supposed to review the extent to which those goals have been met. However, USDA performance plans for recent years have not provided a link between the agency's climate efforts and performance goals, and its recent performance reports have not provided information on whether the agency was meeting its performance measures related to climate change. In addition, USDA performance measures do not capture the breadth of the agency's climate efforts. Agency officials told GAO that developing measures for the strategic goal on climate change was difficult. However, USDA has developed measures for other areas, such as conservation, where similar challenges existed. Without developing performance plans and reports that better reflect USDA's climate change efforts, USDA will have difficulty fully assessing its progress in meeting its climate change strategic goal and providing information on its progress to Congress and the public.", "USDA faces challenges in encouraging farmers to take measures to adapt to climate change and reduce emissions. For example, USDA faces the challenge of turning the large amount of often technical climate research into readily understandable information. To address this challenge USDA is, among other things, developing tools that summarize climate information and communicate research findings to farmers in a more accessible format. USDA also faces a challenge related to the incentive structure that farmers consider when making decisions for their farms. Farmers weigh the financial costs and returns of taking certain actions, but USDA has not provided much information to farmers on the economic costs and returns of taking certain adaptation or emissions reduction actions, such as changing the extent to which they plow their fields. Under federal internal control standards, agencies are to ensure there are adequate means of communicating with external stakeholders when it may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals.

Sources  of these emissions include fuel consumption, fertilizer that can emit  nitrous oxide, and methane emissions from livestock. Farmers can  take certain mitigation actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  sequester carbon. For example, farmers can use energy-efficient  buildings, vehicles, or farm equipment that runs on renewable energy,  rather than fossil fuels. In addition, farmers can implement mitigation  measures, such as no-till farming and precision agriculture. According to  a 2011 ERS report, adoption of precision agriculture can improve the  efficiency of input use and reduce environmental harm from the  overapplication of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, which can  reduce nitrous oxide emissions. Through the digestive process,  livestock emit a considerable amount of methane, a greenhouse gas;  reducing these emissions is another mitigation strategy. According to  USDA officials, work is being done to alter the diet of cattle and to  improve manure management practices in an effort to reduce methane  emissions.", "Farmers also can improve the resiliency of their operations, as shown in  table 2. For example, farmers can change the type of crop they plant to fit  the changing climate or change the timing of their planting in response to  a longer or shorter growing season. They can also shift to drought-, pest-,  or weed-resistant crop varieties to reduce climate change impacts. There  are also actions that address both mitigation and adaptation.

This program conducts research on four  components of climate change: (1) improving air quality; (2) reducing  greenhouse gas emissions and sequestering carbon; (3) enabling  agriculture to adapt to climate change; and (4) enhancing soil health.  According to an internal ARS document, there were 32 ongoing research  projects in 2013 focused on climate mitigation at a cost of $13.7 million,  and 53 research projects focused on climate adaptation at a cost of $24.6  million. NIFA\u2019s work on climate change is done through its Institute of  Bioenergy, Climate, and the Environment and, in fiscal year 2013, NIFA  accounted for about $40 million of USDA\u2019s climate research spending.  According to NIFA officials, most of NIFA\u2019s climate research is funded  through AFRI, the largest competitive grants program that NIFA  administers. One of the five challenge areas that AFRI is working on is to  \u201cmitigate and adapt to climate change.\u201d", "Conservation: USDA also has several established conservation  programs administered by FSA and NRCS, many of which were  established prior to USDA\u2019s more recent focus on climate change. Now  these conservation programs are being presented as not only helping to  conserve land, prevent erosion, or provide wildlife habitat, but also as  having the climate benefit of sequestering carbon and promoting soil  health. For example, FSA, and its predecessor agency, have  administered the Conservation Reserve Program since 1986 and, in fiscal  year 2013, about 27 million acres of land were conserved through this  program. FSA estimates that this effort results in a net reduction of 45  million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually through sequestration of  carbon dioxide and reduced fuel and fertilizer use by farmers. Similarly,  NRCS oversees a number of conservation programs, and an estimated  52.9 million acres were enrolled in these programs in fiscal year 2012.  NRCS\u2019s focus on conservation goes back to the Dust Bowl of the  1930s.Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which provides financial and  technical assistance to farmers who implement conservation practices  and undertake conservation planning.", "The largest of NRCS\u2019s conservation programs is the  Energy: Another area where USDA has ongoing climate change  mitigation efforts involves energy. FSA, NIFA, NRCS, and Rural  Development have programs focusing on different aspects of energy,  including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the production of  biofuels. Among these programs is Rural Development\u2019s REAP program.  According to a March 2012 report on REAP, this program funded 5,733  renewable energy and energy-efficiency improvement projects since  2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent USDA Efforts Have Emphasized the Need to Turn Research Findings Into Technical Assistance for Farmers", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, research program leaders at NIFA developed a new strategic  direction, which called for NIFA to support the creation of \u201cinnovative tools  for communication and education to provide information that people and  communities can use in their daily lives.\u201d Subsequently, USDA\u2019s Climate  Change Science Plan, released in 2010, emphasized the need for the  agency to develop tools to help farmers with both climate adaptation and  mitigation. Also, in 2010, NIFA issued a funding announcement under  AFRI\u2019s climate change challenge area for projects focused on climate  research, education, or extension. The announcement also provided  funding for integrated projects, which combine research along with  education and/or extension activities. Among the projects funded under  this announcement were the four largest grants the agency had ever  awarded according to NIFA officials. NIFA provided $85 million in total  funding over a period of 5 years for these four integrated projects, known  as CAP grants. Each of these grants, now in their fourth year, involves  researchers across several universities. Table 6 provides more  information on these projects.", "The four CAP grant projects are at various stages of turning research into  technical assistance for farmers, based on our review of materials and  conversations with leaders of these projects. Most of the grantees had  conducted outreach to farmers through conducting surveys or holding  webinars, but the grants varied in terms of their use of extension and  development of web-based tools to aid farmers in decision making. For  example, the Sustainable Corn CAP grant has cooperative extension  agents in nine Midwestern states in the Corn Belt who are responsible for  disseminating project information to farmers. This CAP grant recipient  also has partnered with another USDA grantee, Useful to Usable, to  communicate research to farmers; this joint effort has resulted in the  development of two web-based tools for farmers. One of these tools, the  Corn-Growing Degree Day tool, compares current weather conditions  with 30-year averages and helps farmers decide when to plant their  seeds. In contrast, university officials leading the PINEMAP and REACCH  CAP grants say their projects have been more focused on research so  far, but they are planning to produce tools for farmers in the final years of  funding. These university officials said that developing tools for farmers  takes time.", "In 2013, NIFA awarded two CAP grants focused on livestock, with one  focused on dairy cattle, and one focused on beef cattle. These also were  5-year grants, consisting of about $10 million each. These livestock  grants focus on developing information for farmers on adaptation and  mitigation options. For example, the CAP grant project on beef cattle is  examining ways to reduce methane emissions by altering the animals\u2019  diets. NIFA officials told us it was likely that when funding ran out for  these CAP grants and the four awarded in 2011, that future CAP grant  funding would be less.", "A senior ARS official told us that ARS\u2019s research on climate mitigation is  more mature than its climate adaptation efforts. This official said ARS was  more comfortable with making recommendations to farmers about how to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon in soil than with  providing information on how to adapt to climate change. He said that  ARS\u2019s adaptation research had not progressed to the point where a  \u201cdecision tree\u201d tool could be developed to guide farmers on adaptation  options. During our site visits to two ARS laboratories, we observed  growth chambers where ARS scientists were examining the impacts that  future climate conditions could have on crops to help identify crop types  that best withstand these conditions. One area where ARS has made  progress is on soil health techniques, such as using no-till farming.  According to ARS and NRCS officials, ARS research has been used by  NRCS to provide information to farmers on the benefits of healthy soil.", "Like ARS, NRCS has also developed some climate change tools for  farmers in recent years. For example, NRCS has worked with Colorado  State University to develop COMET-FARM, a web-based tool used by  farmers to estimate the carbon footprint of their operations and to  determine likely impacts from certain actions in reducing their greenhouse  gas emissions or increasing sequestration. In 2012, NRCS launched a  campaign called Unlock the Secrets in the Soil to share information with  farmers on the benefits of healthy and productive soil. As part of this  effort, NRCS maintains a website with fact sheets, videos, and other  information on soil health.", "In February 2014, USDA announced the establishment of seven regional  climate hubs and three subsidiary hubs to \u201cdeliver science-based,  practical information to farmers, ranchers\u201d and \u201cto support decision  making related to mitigation of, and adaptation to climate change.\u201d  Figure 2 is an interactive map showing the regional climate hub locations.  (See app. IV for a printable, noninteractive version of fig. 2.) During the  first year of this effort, USDA officials expect the hubs to engage with  stakeholders, establish a website, conduct a climate risk assessment for  the hub\u2019s region, and develop training for USDA staff. Several USDA  agencies will actively contribute to this effort, including ARS, NRCS, Rural  Development, and the Forest Service. USDA officials said they expect  NRCS staff and the cooperative extension service to help distribute  technical assistance from the hubs to farmers and other stakeholders in  the region. The climate hubs will also collaborate with other federal  agencies that have existing climate offices, such as NOAA, which has  regional climate partnerships that include Regional Integrated Sciences  and Assessments teams, Regional Climate Centers, and Regional  Climate Services Directors.

However,  representatives from farm groups said that the cooperative extension  system is \u201cnot what it used to be\u201d because both funding and staffing  levels have fallen in recent years. During our site visit to Iowa, a leading  agricultural state in crop and livestock production, a university official told  us that, until 2009, there had been an agricultural extension agent in each  of the 99 county extension offices, but there now are only about 30 such  individuals, each of whom covers multiple counties. According to USDA  officials leading the climate hubs effort, they have reached out to the  extension system by hosting a meeting with all of the land-grant  universities and sending a letter to states, urging them to take part in the  climate hub effort. USDA is also developing a memorandum of  understanding on this topic with the Association of Public and Land-Grant  Universities. However, there are very few extension specialists that  have a focus on climate change; we spoke to two climate change  extension specialists during our work, and one of these specialists told us  that he knew of only four such specialists in the United States. NRCS  officials said that they viewed the staff\u2019s work in the hubs as an extension  of NRCS\u2019 traditional work on conservation. These officials did, however,  acknowledge that there has been a decline in staffing levels in recent  years, which we reported on in a recent report.", "With the reduced presence of the extension system, some stakeholders  told us that farmers are turning more to the private sector for information  on managing their farms. Certified crop advisers, who provide information to farmers on, among other things, seed selection, irrigation,  and fertilizer decisions, are one such source of information. The Useful to  Usable grant project is focused on delivering information to crop advisers  that can be shared with farmers.

USDA  officials told us that farmers need projections that cover longer periods of  time so they can make longer-range and seasonal decisions, such as  what type of seed to buy for the upcoming planting season or whether to  purchase a certain piece of equipment. One of the ways that USDA and  NOAA are addressing the need for longer-term climate projections is  through participation in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and  Improvement Project (AgMIP) consortium, an international effort  established in 2010 to examine and improve globally integrated climate,  economic, and agricultural production models. A USDA official involved in  this effort told us that the AgMIP effort is at an early stage of  development. Currently, most climate models provide projections over  large geographical regions. For example, the Third National Climate  Assessment provided information on possible future climate conditions  across nine regions in the United States under different greenhouse gas  emissions scenarios. However, NOAA officials said that these were  scenarios and not forecasts because they do not include probabilities of  these occurring. Officials at USDA told us that they recognize farmers  need both localized information to make decisions and more information  on the likelihood that certain climate conditions will occur. The process of  refining larger-scale model results and arriving at a more local geographic  scale is known as downscaling. According to the National Research  Council, downscaling can be challenging, and additional evaluation of the  various downscaling methodologies is needed.", "Currently, farmers can obtain more localized projections on weather and  drought conditions with shorter time frames from various sources.  NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center produces seasonal weather outlooks  that cover 90-day periods for both temperature and precipitation and  provide probabilities on whether conditions will be average, below  average, or above average. NOAA also leads the National Integrated  Drought Information System (NIDIS), which provides information on  current drought conditions and projections for future drought conditions  and communicates these on a regular basis.

According to GPRA, as  amended by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, an agency\u2019s  performance plan is supposed to explain how the agency will accomplish  its performance goals, and its performance reports are supposed to  review the extent to which performance goals have been met, and if the  performance goals are not met, explain why. We found shortcomings in  both of these documents that USDA had been preparing on an annual  basis:", "Performance plans. In USDA\u2019s performance plans for the years 2011,  2012, and 2013, there was only general information about its climate  change efforts, and there was no specific linkage between these efforts  and its performance goals and how these efforts would be used to  accomplish its goals. For example, in the 2013 USDA performance plan,  there is no explicit discussion on how ARS\u2019s or NIFA\u2019s research efforts  relate to climate change. When asked, USDA officials were uncertain as  to why this linkage was not included in the department\u2019s performance  plan. GPRA requires that agencies use their performance plans to  describe how an agency\u2019s performance goals contribute to the goals laid  out in its strategic plan. Without this information in its performance plans,  USDA is not providing a plan to the public on how it intends to  accomplish its goals.", "Performance reports. In its performance reports for the years 2011,  2012, and 2013, USDA did not provide any information on whether it was  meeting its performance goals under its strategic objective to lead efforts  to mitigate and adapt to climate change. USDA provided information on  its other measures for its strategic objectives. USDA officials stated that  since climate efforts were largely excluded from the performance plan,  these efforts were excluded in the performance report. GPRA requires  that agencies use their performance reports to provide information on  whether they have achieved their performance goals. Without this  information, USDA cannot demonstrate whether its efforts have been  successful and whether changes need to be made to its programs to  address any unmet goals.", "Performance measures. USDA does not have performance measures  in its 2014-2018 strategic plan for some of the adaptation practices, such  as no-till farming and the planting of cover crops, which the agency is  encouraging farmers to adopt. USDA officials in both ARS and NIFA told  us that it is difficult for them to track farm management practices.  However, USDA conducts several surveys of farmers, and its Agricultural  Resource Management Survey collects information on farm management  practices, including the use of no-till farming. Agency officials also said  that it has been difficult to develop performance measures for climate  change since it was first included as a strategic goal in the 2010-2015  strategic plan. Nonetheless, USDA has developed performance  measures to track progress for some of its other strategic objectives that  track acreage amounts where certain practices have been implemented  on public or private lands. USDA has a wide-ranging set of climate  efforts under way, but the performance measures that are part of its  strategic plan do not capture the breadth of its efforts.

Our 2009 report on climate change found that turning climate  data into information useful for making climate adaptation decisions was a  challenge facing federal, state, and local decision makers.", "USDA officials acknowledge a need to develop climate projections at  geographic scales and time frames relevant to farmers. To accomplish  this goal, USDA officials said they must rely on other agencies and  researchers, such as NOAA, because USDA does not have the technical  capability to do this work.

Currently, it is difficult for climate modelers  to predict when certain key climate features will occur that can have major  influences on the climate on these time frames, such as El Ni\u00f1o/Southern  Oscillation events.NOAA is seeking to extend its climate forecasts beyond one year.  NOAA  officials also told us that climate models will always involve a degree of  uncertainty and that local cooperative extension staff need to be trained  on how to present information about this uncertainty in the models.", "However, to provide additional help to farmers,  Another challenge USDA faces is the incentive structure that farmers  consider when making decisions. Officials at USDA, researchers, and  farmers we spoke with told us that farmers need incentives to take  climate adaptation or mitigation actions. For example, planting cover  crops has a financial cost for the farmer in the short-term in the form of  seed and planting costs, but the benefits of healthier soil may not be  realized for a few years. Similarly, an acre of land that is maintained in  perennial vegetative cover for conservation purposes is not available to a  farmer for revenue-generating crops, such as corn or soybeans.  USDA\u2019s existing conservation programs provide payments to farmers who  take such conservation actions, but these payments are generally less  than the revenue the farmer would receive from growing and selling crops  on the land. Total acreage placed in the Conservation Reserve Program  has declined between 2007 and 2013 from about 37 million acres to  about 27 million acres, and one USDA official told us this was due in part  to higher market prices for corn. Also, farmers who have marginal  farmland have been able to convert it from grassland\u2014which provides  conservation benefits and sequesters carbon\u2014to revenue-generating  crops and qualify for crop insurance coverage offered by USDA, thus  lowering their financial risk. As some Iowa farmers told us, farmers  generally make decisions based on short-term economic incentives  because the farming industry is focused on producing commodities at the  lowest price. For example, if climate change measurably decreases yields  for farmers in the future, farmers may have an incentive to change their  practices.", "There was also general agreement among university researchers that  climate change can be a polarizing topic in the agriculture community.  According to a USDA-funded survey of almost 4,800 farmers in the Corn  Belt, 66 percent believed that climate change was occurring and, of these  respondents, 41 percent believed that humans were at least partly  responsible.

According to USDA officials, the regional  climate hubs are intended to provide an avenue to deliver region-specific  information to farmers on climate change. In addition, in three of the large  CAP grant projects that USDA funded in 2011, farmers have been  surveyed or interviewed to get more information on their needs and to  better tailor the information provided to them to their needs. An official  with the Useful to Usable CAP grant project told us that the project has  used focus groups to gather information on the types of information that  the farm community needs on climate change. Another USDA project  maintains a website called AgroClimate, with weather forecast links and  other tools, including fact sheets on different farm management practices,  such as planting cover crops. University researchers we spoke with said  that an understanding of the farm community is critical in communicating  with farmers about climate change.", "USDA reports have highlighted the importance of providing information to  farmers on the costs and returns of taking certain actions in response to  climate change.

When we  asked USDA officials about the agency\u2019s efforts to develop this  information, they highlighted a 2013 report that examined the financial  incentives necessary for farmers to adopt certain mitigation practices.  For example, the report provides estimated changes in costs, yield, and  revenue for farmers changing from conventional tillage to reduced tillage  for certain crops including corn and wheat. However, we found that the  report does not provide information on instances where crop yields  increased as a result of changes in practices, and we did not find  evidence of USDA efforts to make information in this 270-page technical  report more accessible to farmers. NRCS officials we spoke with did not  seem aware of the report, and the website for NRCS\u2019s soil health  campaign provides general information on the benefits of healthy soil but  not on the farm-level costs to farmers or the demonstrated impact on crop  yields from having healthier soil. According to federal standards for  internal control, federal agencies are to record and communicate to  management and others who need it and in a form and within a time  frame that enables them to carry out their responsibilities. Also under  these standards, in addition to internal communications, management  should ensure that there are adequate means of communicating with, and  obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have a  significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. NRCS officials said  they did not have information on the costs and returns of taking certain  actions in response to climate change and suggested that farmers might  get it from other farmers. They noted that this information is challenging to  develop because several variables can affect the costs and returns for a  particular farmer. In keeping with Technical Bulletin 1935, USDA has  taken some steps to develop estimates of costs and benefits of taking  actions in response to climate change, but if this information is not  distributed in an accessible format, its usefulness to farmers may be  limited.

We also spoke with a variety  of officials at Iowa State University, including professors and extension  staff. In addition, we met with extension staff in a county office, visited a  corn and pig farm, and spoke with farmers that operated this farm. We  selected Iowa because it is a large agriculture producer; according to the  2012 National Census of Agriculture, Iowa was the largest producer of  corn and soybeans in the United States.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to  September 2014 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
