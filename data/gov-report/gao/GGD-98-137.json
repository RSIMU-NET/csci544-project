In terms of this historic classification, the typical categorical grant permits funds to be used only for specific, narrowly defined purposes and populations and includes administrative and reporting requirements that help to ensure both financial and programmatic accountability. These features, on the one hand, can make it easier for Congress to ascertain how funds have been used, and with what result. On the other hand, a grant system comprising numerous and overlapping specific programs, each with its own target populations and requirements, can create difficulties at the service delivery level. The combined coverage of related specific programs may be poorly matched to local needs, and differing eligibility and reporting requirements complicate program administration for service providers who receive funds from multiple grants.", "The block grant approach can avoid these disadvantages. In principle, block grants award funds to state or local governments, to be used at their discretion to support a range of activities aimed at achieving a broad national purpose. Consistent with their historic aim of devolving federal program responsibilities to, or supporting programs at, the state or local level, the block grants of the past (such as those of the 1980s) had limited administrative and reporting requirements. These features avoid many of the rigidities and burdens associated with multiple categorical grants. However, as our past reports have observed, these features also make it difficult for federal policymakers to ascertain how funds are being used and to verify that programs are achieving their intended purpose.", "In practice, the \u201ccategorical\u201d and \u201cblock\u201d grant labels and their underlying definitions represent the ends of a continuum and overlap considerably in its middle range. Some block grants have from their inception covered only a single major activity, and thus offer flexibility within a narrow range. The addition of constraints over the years has moved others toward the categorical end of the spectrum. Conversely, some initially categorical grants (such as Special Programs for Aging\u2014Supportive Services and Senior Centers) have broadened and increased local flexibility over time and now look much like block grants.

To identify flexible programs, we reviewed studies by GAO, the Congressional Research Service, and others on the block grants of the 1980s and program descriptions in the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance and privately published grant catalogues. After creating a list of programs that appeared to offer flexibility, we eliminated programs that were narrow in scope, subject to detailed regulation, or relatively small in federal dollar terms (less than $100 million). Programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) that were too new to have produced performance reports or evaluation data were also eliminated from consideration.

For example, if a program\u2019s purpose is to leverage resources, its output would be measured in terms of dollars or other resources\u2014units that are ordinarily considered inputs and that may indeed be inputs for a related program or activity. To avoid linguistic confusion, we base our terminology on what is being measured at the operating or service delivery program level.

State or local choice with respect to these activities, however, was subject to a variety of constraints. Some of the constraints we found placed on choice of activities included allowing only one major activity or group of related activities (e.g., Job Training Partnership Act programs); allowing only specified activities for which approaches of proven effectiveness were available, with exceptions permitted only when supported by data and analysis (e.g., State and Community Highway Safety); requiring one particular activity (e.g., specific activities to reduce access to tobacco products by persons under the age of 18 under the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Grant, or laws requiring sex offenders to be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if the victim requests it under the Byrne Formula grants) while allowing choice among other allowable activities; and requiring that each allowable activity be undertaken somewhere in the state (e.g., Community Services Block Grant).", "Discretion over funds allocation for many programs was constrained by caps (limits on the percentage of funds that could be spent on a given activity) or set-asides (required minimum percentages to be used for a specific activity).

Where grant-funded activities were managed at the local level, as in the two education programs we studied, title VI Innovative Education and Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities, the state\u2019s role was similarly limited.", "Operation as a funding stream complicates the task of getting uniform, program-specific information. We found that when grant funds were part of a stream, it was possible to identify which activities federal funds supported and the amount allocated to each. But once added to the overall budget for a state or local activity, federal dollars lost their identity, and their results could not be separated out\u2014particularly when the federal share was small.

Because of this, the agencies that administered grants in this group were able (with proper authorization) to collect nationally uniform information about performance from grantees. For example, the national objectives of the Job Training Partnership Act are to provide job training that leads to increases in employment and earnings of youths and adults facing serious barriers to participation in the work force. To evaluate the results of the program in achieving these objectives, the terms of the grant require recipient organizations to provide counts of activities provided, demographic characteristics of individuals served, employment outcomes, and program costs.", "Our second grant design type covers performance-related, funding stream grants (second row), which involve national performance objectives yet operate through state or local programs. Most programs of this type in our study covered a state or local function or delivery system (such as preventive health) involving various activities. National performance objectives typically concerned system improvement or capacity-building, ensuring access to services, service quality, and targeting of activities to priority populations. Several grants in this group require state or local grantees to set their own performance objectives of various kinds.

Federal reporting requirements were minimal, and performance information did not necessarily flow to the federal funding agency.", "The grants that combine federal performance objectives with operation through state or local programs present puzzling performance measurement and accountability issues, particularly for service outcome objectives. Activities supported with federal funds and the information collected about performance generally differed from state to state. (This difficulty affected fiscal-objective operating programs as well.) While state or local program outcomes in total were measurable for some programs, the component attributable to federal funding could not be separated out. Thus, measuring performance at the level of the federal program through grantee reporting was not feasible.

(They were designed to mitigate the risk that existing state or local oversight and management arrangements might be insufficient to ensure strong performance.) For example, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which has a national objective of increasing service quality, directs states or localities to set service delivery or quality standards and monitor whether their own standards are being met. States and localities are then accountable to the federal agency for implementing these provisions.", "The Department of Education has been experimenting with a different approach.

A few of the programs we studied had performance goals unlike those of other agency-funded activities and could appropriately be treated in this manner. However, a number of others contributed toward client outcome goals or indicators that receive support through other agency-funded activities as well. In shared-goal situations, aggregation or consolidation seems preferable to treating the individual grant program as the unit of analysis. Aggregation and disaggregation decisions are likely to be particularly complicated for grants that contribute toward a wide variety of end-outcome goals.", "As we have seen, some flexible programs\u2019 designs inherently limit the prospect of collecting programwide performance data through program operations.

To assist in this process, we have developed a framework that depicts the grant design policy choices discussed in this report and factors that might be considered at each point in the form of a decision tree (see fig. 2). Each choice has implications regarding the degree of flexibility provided to states or local entities, the type of performance information that can be collected through program operations, and the level at which this information is used for accountability purposes.", "The critical choice points in each decision path can be framed as questions, such as:", "Are national objectives primarily fiscal or performance-oriented?

This question is particularly relevant to new service outcome objectives, such as decreasing drug use among students. State and local programs designed with different objectives in mind may have difficulty incorporating this new objective. Or conditions that enable achievement of that outcome (such as solid knowledge of how to produce it) may not be met.", "What implementing provisions are needed to support attainment of these objectives? Implementing provisions might include constraints on activities and funds distribution or operational objectives, standards, and criteria for performance. These can be set for the program as a whole or delegated to the level of government responsible for program management.", "For state or local programs, the next question would be whether the program would operate as a funding stream or support distinct projects.

As we have seen, diverse activities and funding stream operation may make the collection of uniform data difficult. The answers to these questions provide the basis for setting grantee reporting requirements. Is additional information needed for program oversight? If so, the logical next step is to provide for such information to be gathered and reported through program evaluation studies or other relevant, cost-effective means.", "We use the title VI Innovative Education Program Strategies grant program to illustrate how figure 2 flows. The objectives of the grant, to support local education reform and innovation, are primarily fiscal, putting us on the upper decision path on our diagram. Funds may be used to support local projects (such as magnet schools), but the title VI program\u2019s purpose does not require that project-level performance objectives be set, so we continue to the step of designing provisions to match fiscal objectives.", "Title VI has such provisions, stating that grant funds may not be used to supplant funds from nonfederal sources and that the state must maintain prior levels of fiscal effort. To obtain information required for accountability, the program requires local districts to describe their intended use of the funds and how this will contribute to the grant\u2019s objectives of supporting education reform. States, drawing on district records, must report biennially on general uses of funds, types of services furnished, and students served. As these data are of limited utility for program oversight, Congress mandated national evaluation reports on this program in 1986 and 1994. The 1994 report provided information about federal share, the size of state and local grants, how funds were used, the minimal performance accountability requirements imposed by states, and the difficulty of evaluating a program that provides supplemental resources for other activities.", "The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities grant provides a further illustration. Funds support local activities that serve national performance objectives to prevent violence in and around schools and the illegal use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. The presence of these objectives puts us on the lower, performance-oriented path of the flow chart. Funded activities are not implemented through a national operating program but, rather, through state and local programs, reflecting at least the hope that national objectives could be achieved through these programs. However, some national program provisions do apply. Local programs must be comprehensive and convey the message that the illegal use of alcohol and other drugs is wrong and harmful. These national requirements notwithstanding, the local education agencies are responsible for setting performance goals, deciding how to pursue them, and reporting to the state in terms of those goals.", "Moving along the state and local path on our diagram, we come to the question of whether drug and violence prevention programs function as distinct projects or as funding streams. The recent evaluation study suggests the latter. Examining what appeared to be comprehensive school-based drug prevention programs, this study found so much variation within districts in what was being done that local activities hardly met our definition of a \u201cprogram.\u201d As to the feasibility question on the diagram, collecting performance data\u2014beyond student counts\u2014for drug prevention programs has proven difficult. Reporting requirements make reference to local program outcomes, but states are simply asked to provide whatever relevant data they can. Reflecting these limitations, provision has been made to gather data from other sources, including state-level data from national surveys of youth drug use, for program oversight. Although the Department of Education is required to report on the national program every 3 years, the lack of uniform information on program activities and effectiveness may limit the report\u2019s usefulness.
