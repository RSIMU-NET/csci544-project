For fiscal year 2005, estimated improper payments exceeded $38 billion but did not include some of the highest risk programs, such as Medicaid with outlays exceeding $181 billion for fiscal year 2005. Overall, state-administered programs and other nonfederal entities receive over $400 billion annually in federal funds. Thus, federal agencies and states share responsibility for the prudent use of these funds. GAO was asked to determine actions taken at the state level to help federal agencies estimate improper payments for state-administered federal programs and assistance needed from the federal level to support the respective federal agencies' implementation of IPIA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To date, states have been subject to limited requirements to assist federal agencies in estimating improper payments. For the 25 major state-administered federal programs surveyed, only 2 programs--the Food Stamp and Unemployment Insurance programs--have federal requirements for all states to estimate improper payments. A limited number of federal agencies are conducting pilots to estimate improper payments in other programs, but state participation is voluntary. Where no federal requirement or pilot is in place, 5 programs involving 11 states had estimated improper payments during fiscal years 2003 or 2004. States have a fundamental responsibility to ensure the proper administration of federal awards by using sound management practices and maintaining internal controls. To do this, states reported using a variety of techniques to prevent and detect improper payments. All states, except for one, responded that they use computer-related techniques, such as fraud and abuse detection programs or data matching, to prevent or detect improper payments. Other techniques selected states used included performing statewide assessments and recovery auditing methods. States also reported receiving federal incentives and penalties to assist with reducing improper payments, although most of these actions related to the Food Stamp Program, which gives incentives and penalties to states having error rates below and above the program's national error rate. Of the 240 state program officials surveyed, 100 identified tools that would be needed to estimate improper payments and help federal agencies meet various IPIA requirements, including guidance on estimating improper payments and performing risk assessments. OMB has begun planning for increased state involvement in measuring and reporting improper payments via the Erroneous and Improper Payments Workgroup and IPIA guidance. However, much work remains at the federal level to identify and estimate improper payments for state-administered federal programs, including determining the nature and extent of states' involvement to assist federal agencies with IPIA reporting requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year federal agencies expend more than $2 trillion through thousands  of programs and activities to address the needs of the American people. Of  this amount, over $400 billion in federal funds are distributed to states and  other nonfederal entities. These funds, typically issued through grants, are  used to implement over 1,000 individual programs from 26 federal grant- making agencies. As the steward of taxpayer dollars, the federal  government is accountable for how its agencies and grantees spend this  money, including the safeguarding of federal funds from improper  payments. Grantees are also responsible for ensuring that funds are used  for the purposes for which the funds were provided.", "Our work over the past several years has demonstrated that improper  payments are a significant and widespread problem in the federal  government, with agencies reporting improper payments over $38 billion in  their fiscal year 2005 performance and accountability reports (PAR).

In our review of  agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2005 PARs, we noted that some agencies still have not  instituted systematic methods of reviewing all programs and activities,  have not identified all programs susceptible to significant improper  payments, or have not annually estimated improper payments for their  high-risk programs. For example, seven state-administered federal  programs with outlays totaling about $228 billion still have not been  annually estimated for improper payments, even though the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) required them to report such information  about 4 years ago in their fiscal year 2003 budget submissions.", "The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) prompted all  executive branch agencies to systematically address improper payment  activity annually. While states do not have a direct role in meeting IPIA  requirements, they do play an important role in federal fund stewardship.  In particular, states are responsible for the proper administration of federal  awards through using sound management practices and maintaining  internal control. Payments, as defined under IPIA, include payments made  by a governmental or other organization administering a federal program or  activity. An improper payment is defined by IPIA as any payment that  should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, a  duplicate payment, and payment for services not rendered or rendered to  ineligible beneficiaries. OMB\u2019s implementing guidance for IPIA requires  that estimates of improper payments, and if applicable, a corrective action  report, be included in all federal executive branch agencies\u2019 PARs  beginning with fiscal year 2004.", "Because of the Subcommittee\u2019s continued interest in addressing the  governmentwide improper payments issue, you asked us to determine   (1) what actions are being taken by states to assist federal agencies in  estimating improper payments; (2) what techniques related to detecting,  preventing, or reducing improper payments have states employed to ensure  the proper administration of federal awards; and (3) what assistance can be  provided by OMB that state program administrators would find helpful in  supporting the respective federal agencies with the implementation of  IPIA.", "To identify states\u2019 actions and assistance needed, we conducted a survey of  all 50 states and the District of Columbia regarding actions to estimate  improper payments for state-administered federal programs for fiscal years  2003 and 2004. Statewide surveys were completed by state officials with  knowledge of statewide administration of operations. We received 50 of the  51 statewide surveys for a response rate of 98 percent. In addition,  program-specific surveys were completed by state program administrators  or directors for the major programs in each state. We received 227 of 240  program-specific surveys for a response rate of 95 percent. The high  response rates for the variety of state-administered programs provided a  wide range of survey responses regarding actions to address improper  payments.", "For the purposes of this review, we defined major programs as those state- administered programs that expended the largest amounts of federal funds  in decreasing order, which in aggregate covered at least 60 percent of the  total federal portion of state-administered expenditures in each state.  Together, the states identified 25 programs as major (see table 3 in app. I).  The 5 most common major programs were Medicaid (all 51 states),  Highway Planning and Construction (44 states), Food Stamp (36 states),  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (28 states), and Unemployment  Insurance (26 states). As shown in table 4 in appendix I, the number of  major programs varied from 1 to 12 programs per state, and in total, added  up to the 240 program-specific surveys we sent. We also visited selected  states that had ongoing initiatives already in place to estimate improper  payments for certain programs, conducted interviews with OMB and other  federal officials as well as state officials regarding state efforts to estimate  improper payments, and reviewed federal agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2005 PARs  and prior GAO and office of inspector general (OIG) reports.

The law  requires executive branch agency heads to annually review all programs  and activities that they administer, identify those that may be susceptible to  significant improper payments, and estimate and report annually on the  amount of improper payments in those programs and activities. IPIA also  requires the agencies to report annually to the Congress on the actions they  are taking to reduce erroneous payments for programs for which estimated  improper payments exceed $10 million.", "IPIA further requires OMB to prescribe guidance for federal agencies to use  in implementing the act. OMB issued this guidance in Memorandum M-03- 13 in May 2003. It requires use of a systematic method to annually review  and identify those programs and activities that are susceptible to  significant improper payments. OMB guidance defines significant improper  payments as annual improper payments in any particular program  exceeding both 2.5 percent of program payments and $10 million. The OMB  guidance then requires agencies to estimate the annual amount of improper  payments using statistically valid techniques for each susceptible program  or activity. For those agency programs, including state-administered  programs, determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments  and with estimated annual improper payments greater than $10 million,  IPIA and related OMB guidance require each agency to report the results of  its improper payment efforts. OMB guidance requires the reporting to be in  the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the agency\u2019s PAR for  each fiscal year ending on or after September 30, 2004. IPIA requires the  following information to be reported to the Congress:  a discussion of the causes of the improper payments identified, actions  taken to correct those causes, and results of the actions taken to  address those causes;  a statement of whether the agency has the information systems and  other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments to minimal  cost-effective levels;  if the agency does not have such systems and infrastructure, a  description of the resources the agency has requested in its most recent  budget submission to the Congress to obtain the necessary information  and infrastructure; and  a description of the steps the agency has taken and plans to take to  ensure that agency mangers are held accountable for reducing improper  payments.", "OMB\u2019s guidance in M-03-13 requires that three additional things be included  in the PAR:   a discussion of the amount of actual erroneous payments that the  agency expects to recover and how it will go about recovering them;  a description of any statutory or regulatory barriers that may limit the  agency\u2019s corrective actions in reducing improper payments; and  provided the agency has estimated a baseline improper payment rate for  the program, a target for the program\u2019s future improper payment rate  that is lower than the agency\u2019s most recent estimated error rate.", "In August 2004, OMB established Eliminating Improper Payments as a new  program-specific initiative in the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA).  The separate improper payments PMA program initiative began in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2005. Previously, agency efforts related to improper  payments were tracked along with other financial management activities as  part of the Improving Financial Performance initiative. The objective of  establishing a separate initiative for improper payments was to ensure that  agency managers are held accountable for meeting the goals of IPIA and  are therefore dedicating the necessary attention and resources to meeting  IPIA requirements. This program initiative establishes an accountability  framework for ensuring that federal agencies initiate all necessary financial  management improvements for addressing this significant and widespread  problem.

In total, 47 states reported estimating improper payments  for one or more major programs, which represented 97 program surveys  for fiscal year 2003, fiscal year 2004, or both. More than half of the reported  estimates were for the Food Stamp and UI programs. Food Stamp and UI  program outlays expended by the states totaled about $61 billion for fiscal  year 2004. This constitutes about 15 percent of the total federal funds that  are estimated to be annually distributed to states and other nonfederal  entities for redistribution to eligible parties. Both of these programs are  benefit programs, have a history of measuring improper payments through  established systems, and can calculate a national error rate.", "The purpose of the Food Stamp Program is to help low-income  individuals and families obtain a more nutritious diet by supplementing  their incomes with benefits to purchase food. As reported in USDA\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 PAR, the causes of improper payments in the Food  Stamp Program include client errors, such as incomplete or inaccurate  reporting of income, assets, or both by participants at the time of  certification or by not reporting subsequent changes. Causes can also be  provider based, such as errors in determining eligibility or benefit  amounts or delays in action or inaction on client reported changes. The  Food Stamp quality control system measures payment accuracy and  monitors how accurately states determine food stamp eligibility and  calculate benefits. USDA reports a rate and dollar amount of estimated  improper payments for the Food Stamp Program in its annual PAR  based on the quality control system. In its fiscal year 2005 PAR, USDA  reported a national improper payment error rate of 5.88 percent, or   $1.4 billion, for the Food Stamp Program. A national error rate is  calculated and incentives and penalties are applied to the states that  have rates lower or higher than the national rate. Recent initiatives  reported in USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 PAR include the agency\u2019s fiscal year  2004 nationwide implementation of an electronic benefit transfer (EBT)  system for the delivery of food stamp benefits. The EBT card, which  replaced paper coupons, creates an electronic record for each  transaction that makes fraud easier to detect. Other USDA efforts  include Partner Web, which is an intranet for state food stamp agencies,  and the National Payment Accuracy Workgroup, which consists of  representatives from USDA headquarters and regional offices who meet  to discuss best practice methods and strategies. (See app. III for more  details on the Food Stamp Program.)", "The UI Program provides temporary cash benefits to workers who lose  their jobs through no fault of their own. Labor reported in its fiscal year  2005 PAR that the principal cause of improper payments was claimants  who continue to claim benefits despite having returned to work.  Pursuant to Part 602 of Title 20, Code of Federal Regulations, Labor  implemented the Benefit Accuracy Measurement system to measure  state payment accuracy in the UI Program. Labor also reports a rate  and dollar amount of estimated improper payments for the UI Program  in its annual PAR. In its fiscal year 2005 PAR, Labor reported an annual  error rate of 10.13 percent, or $3.2 billion, for the UI Program. Labor\u2019s  initiatives to reduce improper payments in the UI Program include  implementing new cross-matching technologies like the National  Directory of New Hires database and funding states\u2019 data-sharing efforts  with federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, and  other state agencies, such as the state departments of motor vehicles.  Further, Labor is instilling additional performance measures for states  to detect and recover overpayments of benefits and continuing analyses  of the causes, costs, and benefits of improper payment prevention or  establishing recovery operations.

These pilots  serve as models for the federal agencies on obtaining improper payment  information and establishing a methodology for other states to estimate  improper payments for those programs. Neither of the two pilots was  sufficiently comprehensive to allow the responsible federal agency to  project an error rate with statistical precision to all of the states.", "DOT provides funding to the state departments of transportation to  administer the nation\u2019s federal Highway Planning and Construction  Program. During our review, DOT had a pilot in place to estimate  improper payments for two construction projects in Tennessee. The  sampled transactions reviewed to identify improper payments for these  two projects were selected from a population of almost $35 million,  which represented a small portion of DOT\u2019s fiscal year 2005 outlays  totaling $31 billion for the Highway Planning and Construction  Program. For one of these projects, DOT reported that the estimated  improper payments amount was statistically insignificant. For the other  project, DOT reported an improper payment estimate of $111,671. The  methodology and testing procedures that resulted from DOT\u2019s pilot  project will be used to extend the methodology nationwide. In its fiscal  year 2005 PAR, DOT reported a zero-dollar improper payment estimate  for this program. However, the DOT OIG also reported that detecting  improper payments for several grant programs, including the Highway  Planning and Construction Program, was a top management challenge  for the agency. In particular, the OIG reported that the DOT pilot project  was too limited and that OIG investigators continue to identify instances  of improper payments. The OIG cited two improper payment examples  totaling over $1.3 million, which was reimbursed to DOT as a result of  OIG investigations. In response, DOT is reorganizing and redesigning its  procedures to better improve oversight of research agreements. This  includes creating a new division within DOT\u2019s Office of Acquisition  Management devoted to the award and administration of cooperative  agreements.

Medicaid improper payments are caused by medical review, eligibility  review, or data-processing review errors. In fiscal year 2002, HHS  began a pilot to estimate improper payments for its Medicaid program.  The number of states voluntarily participating in the pilot has increased  each year, and in the second year of the pilot, fiscal year 2003, 12 states  participated. In the third year, fiscal year 2004, 24 states participated in  the pilot.

According to  agency officials, HHS is in the process of implementing a methodology  for estimating payment error rates for Medicaid in all states. HHS stated  that it expects to be fully compliant with the IPIA requirements for the  Medicaid program by fiscal year 2008. Other initiatives HHS is  undertaking for the Medicaid program are the hiring of additional staff  to do prospective reviews of state Medicaid operations and the  Medicare/Medicaid data match program designed to identify improper  payments and areas in need of improved payment accuracy.

For HHS\u2019s State Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program (SCHIP), 15 states participated in a payment accuracy  measurement pilot in fiscal year 2004. The states performed a combination  of medical, eligibility, or data-processing reviews of claims and applicable  payments for the period October 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003. Using a  standard methodology, those states computed a payment accuracy error  rate for their programs. Based on these results, HHS has adopted a national  strategy using federal contractors to obtain a national error rate for SCHIP  with expected implementation in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2007, HHS  expects to begin measuring SCHIP error rates nationwide for its fee-for- service component. HHS expects to report SCHIP error rates for its fee-for- service, managed care, and eligibility components in its fiscal year 2008  PAR.", "For HHS\u2019s Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Program, 11 states  participated in an improper payment pilot in fiscal year 2004 to assess  states\u2019 efforts to prevent and reduce improper payments.

Strong systems of internal  control provide reasonable assurance that programs are operating as  intended and are achieving expected outcomes. A key step in the process  of gaining this assurance is conducting a risk assessment, an activity that  entails a comprehensive review and analysis of program operations to  determine where risks exist and what those risks are, and then measuring  of the potential or actual impact of those risks on program operations. In  performing a risk assessment, management should consider all significant  interactions between the entity and other parties, as well as all internal  factors at both the organizationwide and program levels.", "IPIA requires agencies to review all of their programs to identify those that  may be susceptible to significant improper payments.

Computer-related techniques play a significant role not only in  identifying improper payments, but also in providing data on why these  payments were made and, in turn, highlighting areas that need  strengthened prevention controls. The adoption of technology allows  states to have effective detection techniques to quickly identify and recover  improper payments. Data sharing, data mining, smart technology, data  warehousing, and other techniques are powerful internal control tools that  provide more useful and timely access to information. The use of these  techniques can achieve potentially significant savings by identifying client- related reporting errors and misinformation during the eligibility  determination process\u2014before payments are made\u2014or by detecting  improper payments that have been made.

Incentives and penalties can be helpful to create management reform and  to ensure adherence to performance standards. The IPIA implementing  guidance requires that each federal agency report on steps it has taken to  ensure that agency managers are held accountable for reducing and  recovering improper payments. When a culture of accountability over  improper payments is instilled in an organization, everyone in the  organization, including the managers and day-to-day program operators,  have an incentive to reduce fraud and errors. Transparency, through public  communication of performance results, also acts as an incentive for  agencies to be vigilant in their efforts to address the wasteful spending that  results from lapses in controls that lead to improper payments.", "In the survey, we asked the state program administrators to identify any  incentives they have received from the federal government to encourage  them to reduce improper payments. We also asked them to identify any  penalties they have received from the federal government for not doing so.  Thirty-two states reported incentives such as enhanced funding and  reduced reporting requirements for 5 of the 25 major programs. Most  incentives were related to the Food Stamp Program, largely because of a  statutory requirement that USDA assess penalties and provide financial  incentives to the states. As we previously reported on the Food Stamp  Program, the administration of the quality control process and its system  of performance bonuses and sanctions is a large motivator of program  behavior and has assisted in increasing payment accuracy. Examples of  other incentives identified by the state programs included reduced  reporting requirements for benefit recipients and additional funding  received for a fraud and abuse detection system.", "Penalties such as decreased funding, increased reporting, and client  sanctions were reported by 17 states for four different programs. As with  incentives, most of the penalties identified related to the Food Stamp  Program. States can get approval from USDA to reinvest portions of their  penalties toward corrective actions to reduce the error rate as opposed to  USDA recovering the penalty from the state; thus the distinction between  incentives and penalties is somewhat blurred. Our survey results showed  that some states believed that being able to reinvest a portion of their food  stamp penalty toward corrective action plans to improve payment accuracy  was actually an incentive, while other states considered it a penalty. For  another program, one state noted in its survey response that it was  penalized by the federal government for not applying applicable reductions  to TANF beneficiaries for noncompliance with child support enforcement  regulations. In lieu of paying a penalty of over $1 million, the state  submitted a corrective action plan to address the problems.", "Certain states perceive limitations in their ability to adequately address  improper payments. For example, 37 states reported in their survey  responses that federal legislative and program design barriers hinder their  ability to detect, prevent, and reduce improper payments for one or more  programs. Legislative barriers relate to an agency\u2019s ability to take actions to  reduce improper payments. Program design barriers relate to the  complexity and variety of programs.", "From our review of survey responses, several state program officials,  representing multiple programs, reported that they encountered legislative  barriers related to due process. Specifically, states are not permitted to  stop or adjust payments until the due process hearing or appeals processes  are complete, even though they know the payment is improper. For  example, one state reported that it has a state superior court ruling that  requires paying UI benefits conditionally under certain circumstances, and  that the recovery of the paid benefits can only take place once the courts  have determined the payments were incorrect. Another state program  response said that lack of authority to mandate the submission of Social  Security numbers for those applying for benefits was a barrier that limited  the ability to identify and prevent improper payments. Additionally, 23 state  programs identified statutory restrictions over the use of certain data as a  barrier to improved accuracy. For example, three state programs noted that  because of security policies, they were restricted from accessing and using  information from the Internal Revenue Service.", "Program design barriers have also contributed to states\u2019 inability to reduce  improper payments. Generally, states receive broad statutory and  regulatory program guidelines from the responsible federal agency. States  then issue state-specific guidelines to manage day-to-day operations, which  may vary among the states. A few survey respondents indicated that  inconsistent requirements between programs hindered their ability to  reduce improper payments. For example, four state programs noted that  efforts to manage improper payments are hindered because of the different  eligibility requirements among the federal programs that they administer.  The survey responses of the state programs also indicated that they  encountered resource barriers, such as lack of funding for additional  personnel or information technology.

While OMB has taken steps to begin addressing the  complexities related to reporting improper payment information for  federally funded, state-administered programs, additional enhancements  could be made that address how federal agencies define state-administered  programs and the methodology to be employed for generating a national  estimate. Specifically, we found that the proposed changes do not clearly  define the term state-administered programs. Without a clear definition,  OMB is at risk of receiving inconsistent improper payment reports because  agencies could define programs differently.

With budgetary pressures rising  across the federal government, agencies are under constant and increasing  pressure to do more with less. Preventing improper payments and  identifying and recouping those that occur become an even higher priority  in this environment. States have a fundamental responsibility to ensure the  proper administration of federal awards by using sound management  practices and maintaining internal controls to ensure distribution of federal  funding to subrecipients or beneficiaries in accordance with federal and  state laws and regulations. Given their involvement in determining  eligibility and distributing benefits, states are in a position to assist federal  agencies in reporting on IPIA requirements. In fact, the success of several  existing programs and pilots in estimating improper payment rates  indicates that such efforts could logically be expanded.

At the federal level, DOT improper payment initiatives for the  future include citing the inherent higher risk of improper payments  because of concentrated and accelerated spending related to Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita. Fiscal year 2006 Highway Planning and Construction  Program testing will be focused on these hurricane regions. In its fiscal  year 2006 PAR, DOT will provide interim information on the amounts and  causes of improper payments and control procedures that can be used to  prevent or detect improper payments in national emergency situations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Payment Accuracy and Payment Error Rate Measurement Project", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improper Payment Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Because of the variations in the states\u2019 Medicaid programs, CMS provided  states the option of either testing for the FFS or managed care components,  including testing eligibility for the two components. The rates for the 12  states that participated in the PAM pilot for Year 2 (fiscal year 2003) ranged  from 0.3 percent to 18.6 percent for the FFS component and 0 percent to  2.5 percent for the managed care component. The rates for the 24 states  that participated in the Year 3 PAM pilot (fiscal year 2004) ranged from 0.80  percent to 54.3 percent for the FFS component and 0 percent to 7.45  percent for the managed care component. Rates for the Year 1 PERM pilot  (fiscal year 2005) had not been published at the conclusion of our  fieldwork.", "Although all states used a standard methodology to produce the rates, CMS  noted that these rates should not be compared among states. Specifically,  states applied different administrative standards that resulted in a lack of a  common approach to the reviews among states. For medical reviews,  states have different policies against which the reviews are conducted. For  eligibility reviews, states had two review options under the PAM Year 3  pilot for verifying program eligibility. Other differences include the level of  provider cooperation in submitting information and whether states  conducted reviews in-house or contracted with vendors to perform the  reviews.", "CMS identified Texas as having a leadership role in estimating improper  payments for its Medicaid program. Texas was estimating improper  payments prior to implementing the CMS pilots. Under state statute,  effective 1997, Texas was required to biennially estimate improper  payments for its Medicaid program. In September 2003, the state of Texas  passed another statute, among other things, to fund 200 additional  positions to investigate Medicaid fraud. Texas has also initiated a Medicaid  Integrity Pilot (MIP) project to assist in preventing improper payments. The  MIP project incorporates the use of biometric technology, such as  fingerprint imaging and smart cards, as eligibility verification tools. For  example, Texas issues smart cards to Medicaid clients participating in the  pilot and smart card and biometric readers to medical providers. When a  client obtains services, he or she inserts the card into the smart card reader  and positions his or her finger on the biometric reader, which compares the  print to the fingerprint image contained on the card. The use of this type of  technology promotes positive identification, incorporates automated  eligibility determination, and assists in an electronic billing process.", "Furthermore, Texas has performed a feasibility study to consolidate  multiple program benefits onto a single card called an Integrated Benefits  Card (IBC). This study has identified four primary benefit programs for  consolidation\u2014Medicaid; TANF; Food Stamps; and Women, Infants, and  Children. Texas believes that the IBC may facilitate the needs of the  Medicaid program by preventing fraud, making payments to medical  providers more quickly, and offering a means for providers to quickly and  accurately verify the eligibility of a client.", "In addition to the above initiatives, CMS has taken additional steps  programwide to estimate improper payments at the national level. See  table 9 for a detailed description of actions taken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Federal Improper Payment Initiatives Under Way", "paragraphs": ["In October 2005, CMS published an interim final rule, with plans to publish  a final rule that would include responses to comments received. According  to the interim final rule, states would be stratified based on the states\u2019  annual FFS Medicaid expenditures from the previous year, and a random  sample of up to 18 states would be reviewed. States would only be selected  once every 3 years. The interim final rule also outlines the strategy for  conducting medical and data-processing reviews on claims made for FFS  only. CMS will address estimating improper payments for Medicaid\u2019s  managed care and eligibility components at a later time. In November 2005,  CMS sent a memo to the states selected for review during fiscal year 2006.", "Subsequent to the publication of the October 2005 interim final rule, CMS  stated that it anticipates the number of states selected each year will be 17  to ensure that each state and the District of Columbia would only be  selected once every 3 years. This approach would exclude any U.S.  territories or possessions that receive Medicaid funds. In a discussion with  CMS\u2019s consultant firm, it communicated to us that the sampling approach  to be employed was statistically valid since every state was selected by  strata, for each of the 3 years, in year 1 of this process, and thus, each state  had an equal chance of being selected for years 1 through 3. Because CMS\u2019s  sampling methodology, including sampling plans, had not been fully  documented by the conclusion of our fieldwork, we were unable to  independently assess the statistical validity of CMS\u2019s approach to obtain a  national improper payment estimate for its Medicaid program.", "In its fiscal year 2005 PAR, HHS also identified efforts to detect and reduce  improper payments through activities other than the pilot project. For  example, HHS\u2019s Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Office has two  projects under way that will assist in reporting improper payments. The  office plans to hire 100 staff to conduct prospective reviews of state  Medicaid operations and the Medicare/Medicaid data match program to  identify areas where efficiencies could be made to enhance payment  accuracy. Additionally, HHS expects to improve its data match capabilities  to detect improper payments for Medicaid, as well as other programs,  through the use of its Public Assistance Reporting Information System  (PARIS). PARIS is a voluntary project that enables the 33 participating  states\u2019 public assistance data to be matched against several databases to  help maintain program integrity and to detect and deter improper  payments.
