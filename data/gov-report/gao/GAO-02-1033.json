Ninety-five percent of our overseas trade tonnage moves by water, and the cargo moving through the U.S. marine transportation system contributes hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The marine transportation system includes coastal ports and shipping channels; 25,000 miles of navigable inland and coastal channels and waterways like the Mississippi, St. Lawrence, and Columbia Snake rivers; and ports on the Great Lakes and elsewhere. According to a congressionally mandated report (1999 marine transportation system  report) that assessed the capabilities and challenges of the system, critical issues include modernizing aging locks and dams on inland waterways, dredging waterways to new depths to accommodate larger ships, and upgrading navigation systems for maximum safety and efficiency.

We asked each agency to identify the source of funding for expenditures and the accounts that were credited with the collections based on categories we identified for this purpose.We separated their expenditures into the following categories: administrative services; physical services, such as inspections and certifications; construction and maintenance; or miscellaneous services. In addition, we obtained information on customs duties collected on goods transported by each transportation system. Although we had each agency validate the data provided, we did not independently verify agency expenditures and collections.

Over 95 percent of the U.S. overseas trade tonnage is shipped by sea. The marine transportation system, a system of navigable waterways that connects oceans to rivers, lakes, and canals, serves waterborne commerce through more than 300 public and private ports. These ports serve as freight connectors between the waterborne system and the nation\u2019s other transportation systems. In addition to the ports and navigable waterways, the marine transportation system also encompasses vessels, marine terminals, intermodal connections, shipyards, locks, dams, and information systems.", "The marine transportation system plays an essential role in the nation\u2019s economy and defense. For example, it moves import and export cargo worth hundreds of billions of dollars, generating jobs, both directly and indirectly, for Americans and our trading partners. The system\u2019s inland waterways also support the movement of grain, petroleum products, coal, paper products, and industrial chemicals. In addition to its economic role, the marine transportation system plays an important role in national defense by facilitating the movement of military equipment and supplying troops deployed overseas. The nation\u2019s marine transportation system also serves as an alternative transportation mode to roads and provides recreational value through boating, fishing, and cruises.", "Federal, state, and local governments and private sector organizations all participate in financing the marine transportation system. In general, expenditures for the development and operation of the waterside portion of the system (e.g., dredging channels, installing navigational aids, monitoring vessel traffic, or operating locks and dams) have been largely a public function, with participation at the federal, state, and local government levels. Ports\u2014usually state, county, or local entities\u2014and private commercial interests spend billions of dollars in the landside portion of the system by updating and modernizing their facilities. The source of the expenditures for intermodal connections (rail, pipeline, or highway) can vary. For example, rail and pipeline development are generally funded by the private sector; funding for public roadways, on the other hand, comes from the public sector.", "One source of federal funding common to all three major transportation systems\u2014marine, aviation, and highway\u2014is collections from assessments on users of the system. These collections can include user fees and excise taxes. Collections are deposited into the U.S. Treasury\u2019s general fund and can be used for the general support of federal activities or may be earmarked by law for specific purposes and credited to a trust fund. Also, some collections are credited directly to agency accounts for services provided by that agency such as inspections or certifications. Trust funds that support the marine transportation system include the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Trust funds that support the aviation and highway transportation systems include the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and the Highway Trust Fund. (See app. II for detailed information concerning these trust funds.) The portion of collections from users of these systems that are deposited into the U.S. Treasury\u2019s general fund are not earmarked for a specified purpose and are used for the general support of federal activities.", "In addition to assessing fees and taxes to specifically support the transportation systems, the federal government also assesses customs duties on goods imported into the United States.

This issue was discussed in depth in the 1999 MTS Report that assessed the capabilities and challenges of the nation\u2019s marine transportation system. The report cited a growing gap between transportation demands and shifting user requirements on one side and available transportation infrastructure on the other side. According to the report, the projected doubling of maritime trade by the year 2020 and the need for the system to be responsive to users means that the infrastructure would face challenges on several levels. The projected increase in maritime trade will likely result in an increase in the overall demand for the kinds of infrastructure improvements in which the federal government has typically participated. For example, there are calls to modernize aging structures such as key locks and dams in river transportation systems. Changes in the shipping industry also have increased the pressure to make capacity improvements, such as deeper navigation channels to accommodate larger ships.", "Since the issuance of the 1999 MTS Report, new and far reaching security issues have emerged as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Many of the security improvements now planned or under way at our nation\u2019s ports will require costly outlays for infrastructure, technology, and personnel. Even before September 11, the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports estimated that the cost of upgrading security infrastructure at U.S. ports ranged from $10 million to $50 million per port. These estimates could increase dramatically due to new post- September 11 security requirements. For example, when the Congress recently made $92.3 million in federal funding available for port security as part of a supplemental appropriations bill, the Transportation Security Administration received grant applications totaling almost $700 million.", "In today\u2019s environment, with growing system demands and border security concerns, some stakeholders have suggested a larger federal role in funding the marine transportation system. Two examples illustrate the mounting pressure for increased federal funding in this area. First, for the last several years, the U.S. public port authorities have advocated increased federal funding for dredging. Currently, funding for such maintenance\u2014which has totaled more than $700 million annually since fiscal year 2000\u2014is derived from a fee on passengers and imported and domestic cargo loaded and unloaded in U.S. ports. Ports and shippers would like to see funding for maintenance dredging come from the general fund instead, and there was legislation introduced in 1999 to do so.Second, besides the growing pressures on areas of traditional federal investment, ports are seeking substantial federal assistance to enhance security in the aftermath of the events of September 11. In other work we have conducted on port security, port and private-sector officials have said that they believe combating terrorism is the federal government\u2019s responsibility, and that if additional security is needed, the federal government should provide or pay for it.", "Deciding on an appropriate federal role to address these concerns requires, in part, a better understanding of the magnitude and nature of federal revenues generated by and expenditures for the maritime transportation system and how these revenues and expenditures compare to other transportation modes.

Substantial new investments in the maritime infrastructure by federal, state, and local governments and by the private sector may be required because of an aging infrastructure, changes in the shipping industry, and increased concerns about security. Pressure on the federal government to bear a significant portion of these new investment costs is evident. These growing and varied demands for increased federal investments in the marine transportation system heighten the need for a clear understanding about the federal government\u2019s purpose and role in providing funding for the system and for a sound investment approach to guide federal participation. In examining federal investment approaches across many national activities, we have found that issues such as these are best addressed through a systematic framework. As shown in figure 2, this framework has the following four components that potentially could be applied to all transportation systems:   Set national goals for the system. These goals, which would establish what federal participation in the system is designed to accomplish, should be specific and measurable.", "Define clearly what the federal role should be relative to other stakeholders. This step is important to help ensure that federal participation supplements and enhances participation by others, rather than simply replacing their participation.", "Determine which funding tools and other approaches, such as alternatives to investment in new infrastructure, will maximize the impact of any federal investment. This step can help expand the capacity to leverage funding resources and promote shared responsibilities.", "Ensure that a process is in place for evaluating performance periodically so that defined goals, roles, and approaches can be reexamined and modified, as necessary."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing National Goals to Guide Federal Participation", "paragraphs": ["The first component of a framework for evaluating federal investments is establishing a set of clearly defined national goals that can serve as a basis for guiding federal participation. Such goals can help chart a clear direction, establish priorities among competing issues, specify the desired results, and lay the foundation for such other decisions as determining how assistance will be provided.", "At the federal level, measuring results for federal programs has been a longstanding objective of the Congress. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 has become the primary legislative framework through which agencies are required to set strategic and annual goals that are based on national goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which goals are met and on what actions are needed to achieve or modify goals that have not been met. These goals need to be measurable in order to identify and provide accountability for the amount of public benefits to be attained. Stating goals in measurable terms makes it easier to assess the success or failure of government support and ultimately, to hold system stakeholders accountable for the outcomes. Establishing clear goals and performance measures for the marine transportation system is critical to ensuring both a successful and a fiscally responsible effort.", "Meaningful goal-setting for the marine transportation system requires an in-depth understanding of the relationship of the system to other transportation modes. Transportation experts highlight the need to view the system in the context of the entire transportation system in addressing congestion, mobility, and other challenges and ultimately investment decisions. For example, congestion challenges often occur where modes connect or should connect, such as ports where freight is transferred from one mode to another. The connections require coordination of more than one mode of transportation and cooperation among multiple transportation providers and planners. While decision makers recognize the importance of intermodal planning, the goals for the system need to reflect this broader perspective. A systemwide approach to transportation planning and funding, as opposed to focus on a single mode or type of travel, could improve focus on outcomes related to customer or community needs.", "Meaningful goal-setting also requires a comprehensive understanding of the scope and extent of issues and priorities facing the marine transportation system. However, there are clear signs that certain key issues and priorities are not yet understood well enough to establish meaningful goals for the system. For example, a comprehensive analysis of the issues and problems facing the maritime transportation system has not yet been accomplished. In setting goals for investment decisions, leading organizations usually perform comprehensive needs assessments to obtain a clear understanding of the extent and scope of their issues, problems, and needs and ultimately to identify resources needed. These assessments should be results-oriented in that they determine what is needed to obtain specific outcomes rather than what is needed to maintain or expand existing capital stock. Developing such information is important for ensuring that goals are framed in an adequate context. The call by many ports for federal assistance in dredging channels or harbors to 50 feet is an example. Dredging to 50 feet allows a port to accommodate the largest of the container ships currently being constructed and placed in service. However, developing the capacity to serve such ships is no guarantee that companies with such ships will actually choose to use the port. Every port\u2019s desire to be competitive by having a 50-foot channel could thus lead to a situation in which the nation as a whole has an overcapacity for accommodating larger ships. The result, at least for the excess capacity, would signal an inefficient use of federal resources that might have been put to better use in other ways. Proper economic analysis for the justification of such a project, however, may minimize the likelihood of such excess capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defining the Federal Role Relative to Other Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["The second component of the framework involves defining the federal role relative to other stakeholders. The federal government is only one of many stakeholders in the marine transportation system. While these various stakeholders may all be able to share a general vision of the system, they are likely to diverge in the priorities and emphasis they place on specific goals. For example, the federal government, with its national point of view, is in a much different position than a local port intensely involved in head-to-head competition with other ports for the business of shipping companies or other businesses. For a port, its own infrastructure is paramount, while the federal government\u2019s perspective is focused on the national and broader public interest.", "Past patterns of participation are a tacit acknowledgement of these differences in roles. Traditionally, federal participation has been directed mainly at projects related to \u201cwaterside\u201d issues, such as keeping navigation channels open by dredging or icebreaking; improving systems of locks and dams; maintaining navigational aids such as lighthouses or radio systems; and monitoring the movement of ships in and out of the nation\u2019s coastal waters. Federal participation has generally not extended to \u201clandside\u201d projects related to a port\u2019s capabilities, such as building terminals or piers and purchasing cranes or other equipment to unload cargoes.", "Since there are so many stakeholders involved with the marine transportation system, achieving national goals for the system hinge on the ability of the federal government to forge effective partnerships with nonfederal entities. Decision makers have to balance national goals with the unique needs and interests of all nonfederal stakeholders in order to leverage the resources and capabilities that reside within state and local governments and the private sector.", "Future partnering among key maritime stakeholders may take on a different form as transportation planners begin focusing across transportation modes in making investment decisions instead of making investment decisions for each mode separately. Transportation experts with whom we talked said that current transportation planning institutions, such as state transportation departments and metropolitan planning organizations, may not have sufficient expertise or authority to effectively identify and implement improvements across modes. They suggested that transportation planning by all entities should focus more closely on regional issues and highlighted the importance of cooperation and coordination among modal agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, between public and private transportation providers, and between transportation planning organizations and other government and community agencies to address transportation issues.", "The Alameda Corridor Program in the Los Angeles area provides an example of how effective partnering allowed the capabilities of the various stakeholders to be more fully utilized. Called the Alameda Corridor because of the street it parallels, the program created a 20-mile, $2.4 billion railroad express line connecting the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the transcontinental rail network east of downtown Los Angeles. The express line eliminates approximately 200 street-level railroad crossings, relieving congestion and improving freight mobility for cargo. This project made substantial use of local stakeholders\u2019 ability to raise funds. While the federal government participated in the cost, its share was about 20 percent of the total. In addition, about 80 percent of the federal assistance is in the form of a loan rather than a grant.", "Making careful decisions about these roles is important in order to match capabilities and resources with appropriate goals. This is important for federal assistance because other stakeholders may want to emphasize other priorities and use federal funds in ways that may not match federal goals. This can happen in two main ways.", "Other stakeholders may seek to transfer a previously local function to the federal arena. For example, in the area of port security, there is a significant funding need at the local level for overtime pay for police and security guards. Given the degree of need, if more federal funding were made available, local interests might push to apply federal funding in this way, thereby transferring a previously local function to the federal arena. In moving toward federal coverage of basic public services, the Congress and federal officials would be substantially expanding the federal role.", "Other stakeholders may also seek to use federal funds to reduce their traditional levels of commitment. Federal decision makers need to guard against this tendency\u2014where federal support reduces or supplants private, state, or local funding. One aim of providing federal assistance has been to promote or supplement expenditures that would not otherwise occur\u2014or at a level deemed necessary\u2014without federal funding. Otherwise, federal funding is largely substituting for funding that would otherwise have been provided by private or other public investors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Funding Tools and Other Approaches That Maximize the Return on the Federal Investment", "paragraphs": ["The third component of a framework for evaluating federal investments involves a careful choice of the approaches and funding tools that would best leverage federal funds in meeting identified goals. A well-designed funding approach can help encourage investment by other stakeholders and maximize the application of limited federal dollars. In addition, the federal government has other tools available besides those that relate specifically to making funding available such as demand management, technology improvements, and different operational approaches.", "An important step in selecting the appropriate approach is to effectively harness the financial capabilities of local, state, and private stakeholders. The Alameda Corridor Program is an apt example. In this program, state and local stakeholders had both a financial incentive to relieve congestion and the commitment and ability to bring financial resources to bear. Some other ports may not have the same level of financial incentives or capabilities to undertake projects largely on their own. For example, in studying the extent to which Florida ports were able to implement a set of security requirements imposed by the state, we found that some ports were able to draw on more financial resources than others, based on such factors as size, economic climate, and funding base. While such information would be valuable in crafting federal assistance, it currently is largely unavailable. Relatively little is known about the extent of state, local, and private sector funding resources across the country.", "The federal government has a variety of funding tools potentially available for use, ranging from outright grants to loan guarantees, as shown in table 7. Through cost sharing and other arrangements, the federal government can use these approaches to help ensure that federal funds supplement\u2014 and not supplant\u2014funds from other stakeholders. For example, an effective use of funding tools, with appropriate nonfederal matches and incentives, can be valuable in implementing a national strategy to support federal port investments, without putting the government in the position of choosing winners or losers.", "Federal approaches can take other forms besides those that relate specifically to making funding available. These tools allow increased output without making major capital investments. Examples include the following:   Demand management. Demand management is designed to reduce travel at the most congested times and on the most congested routes. One demand management strategy involves requiring users to pay more to use congested parts of the system during such periods, with the idea that the charge will provide an incentive for some users to shift their use to a less congested time or to less congested routes or transportation modes. On inland waterways, for example, congestion pricing for locks\u2014that is, charging a toll during congested periods to reflect the additional cost of delay that a vessel imposes on other vessels\u2014might be a way to space out demand on the system. Economists generally believe that such surcharges or tolls enhance economic efficiency by making operators take into account the external costs they impose on others in deciding when, where, and how to travel.", "Technology improvements. Instead of making extensive modifications to infrastructure such as locks and dams, it may be possible to apply federal investments to technology that makes the existing system more efficient. For example, technological improvements may be able to help barges on the inland waterways navigate locks in inclement weather, thereby reducing delays on the inland waterway system.", "Different operational approaches. Enhancing capacity of existing infrastructure through increased maintenance and rehabilitation is an important supplement to, and sometimes a substitute for, building new infrastructure. Similarly, different operating arrangements may also be able to produce efficiencies.

Such evaluations are also useful for better ensuring accountability and providing incentives for achieving results.", "Leading organizations that we have studied have stressed the importance of developing performance measures and linking investment decisions and their expected outcomes to overall strategic goals and objectives.Hypothetically, for example, one goal for the marine transportation system might be to increase throughput (that is, the volume of cargo) that can be transported through a particular lock and dam system on the nation\u2019s inland waterways. A performance measure to gauge the results of an investment for this goal might be the increased capacity (such as number of barges per hour) that results from this investment and the economic benefits associated with that increase.

Compared to these two other transportation modes, the federal approach for marine transportation funding relies more extensively on general revenues and less extensively on users of the system. These differences notwithstanding, there is growing awareness of, and agreement about, the need to view various transportation modes from an integrated standpoint, particularly for the purposes of developing and implementing a federal investment strategy and alternative funding approaches. Also, an intermodal perspective appears especially important as the nation reacts to the increased security needs for transportation networks and as it plans for better, more efficient transportation for the future.

In addition to the assessment revenue collected that is specific to the transportation systems, we also received data from the U.S. Customs Service on the amount of duty collected on commodities imported by the transportation modes. The U.S. Customs Service provided estimates, developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, on the percent of collections that were attributable to water, sea, and land transportation modes. We applied these percentages to the total customs duties collected for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 provided by the U.S. Customs Service to compute the amount of total customs duties collected by the marine, aviation, and highway transportation systems each year.", "We performed limited reasonableness tests on the data (comparing the data to the actual trust fund outlays contained in the budget of the U.S. government for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003) and found that the data were reliable enough for our uses in this report.
