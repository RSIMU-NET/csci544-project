Operation  Desert Storm demonstrated that the U.S. military and other allied forces  have limited capability against theater ballistic missiles.  In fact, U.S.  defensive capability is limited to weapons that defend against missiles  nearing the end of their flight, such as the Patriot.  Consequently,  developing weapon systems to defeat these threats is DOD\u2019s top priority in  its overall ballistic missile defense program.", "DOD has been working with laser technology for a long time.

Initial  operational capability of three ABLs is scheduled for 2007; full operational  capability of seven ABLs is scheduled for 2009.  This schedule reflects a  1-year slip in the original PDRR schedule.  According to the program office,  the revision to the schedule is due to a $25-million reduction Congress  made in the fiscal year 1999 appropriation for the ABL and to an expanded  test program.  The Air Force estimates the life-cycle cost of the ABL to be  about $11 billion, including $1.6 billion for the PDRR phase, $1.1 billion for  the EMD phase, $3.6 billion for the production phase, and $4.6 billion for  20 years of operations and support.", "ABL Program Progress We reported on the ABL program in October 1997.  At that time, the  immediate area of concern that we and others reported was whether the  program had adequately assessed the adverse effects of atmospheric  turbulence on the ABL's operational effectiveness.  We reported that the  Air Force did not have all of the data needed to fully understand the effect  that atmospheric turbulence would have on the operation of the ABL and  that the Air Force had not determined whether non-optical turbulence  measurements could be correlated to optical turbulence measurements.   We reported that the Air Force had not shown that it could accurately  predict the levels of turbulence the ABL will actually encounter; neither  had it shown that the ABL's technical requirement regarding turbulence  was appropriate.  Consequently, we concluded that it was not yet known  whether the ABL would be able to operate effectively in its operational  environment.  In addition, we reported that the Air Force planned to only  take additional non-optical turbulence measurements to predict the  severity of the optical turbulence the ABL would encounter without first  determining whether the two measurement types could be correlated.", "The Air Force has now completed collecting non-optical atmospheric  turbulence data from the Korean and Middle East theaters.  In commenting  on a draft of this report, DOD stated that, while the Air Force's analyses of  these data argue that the design specification established for atmospheric  turbulence is generally accurate, the DOD has yet to reach a final position  on this issue. DOD stated further that it is still examining the design  specification for atmospheric turbulence.  According to DOD, the Air Force  plans to collect and characterize additional data to further validate its  design assumptions.  DOD also stated that uncertainties remain concerning  the ability to use non-optical turbulence measurements under all  conditions to predict operational performance for the ABL.  It said that it  was considering what additional measurements and analysis are needed to  resolve these uncertainties.", "The Air Force has also been able to establish that the correlation between  non-optical and optical data is adequate for the purposes of estimating ABL  performance using non-optical data at this stage of the program.  However,  according to DOD officials, there are instances where optical and non- optical data disagree and the causes of these differences are not  understood.  Consequently, the Air Force is continuing to collect and  analyze data to further validate its turbulence design assumptions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["While the ABL program has made progress in addressing technical  challenges relating to atmospheric turbulence, other challenges remain.   Developing a laser module that is of the size and weight that can be carried  by the ABL aircraft (referred to as a flight-weighted laser module), and  integrating the laser, beam control system, and related equipment into an  aircraft, are two examples of these challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Flight-Weighted Laser Module Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The technical challenge inherent in the ABL program is exemplified by  problems experienced in developing the high-energy laser.  The Air Force  must build the laser to be able to contend with size and weight restrictions,  motion and vibrations, and other factors unique to an aircraft environment,  yet be powerful enough to sustain a killing force over a range of hundreds  of kilometers.  It is also to be constructed in a configuration that links  modules together to produce a single high-energy beam.  The laser being  developed for the PDRR phase will have six modules.  The laser for the  EMD phase will have 14 modules.  When we issued our report on the ABL  in 1997, the program had constructed and tested a developmental laser  module.  Although that developmental module exceeded its energy output  requirements, it was too heavy and large to meet integration requirements.   It would have to be reduced in width by about one-third and reduced in  weight by over one-half.  To accomplish this, many components of the  module would have to be reconfigured and built of advanced materials,  such as composites.", "As previously discussed, the PDRR phase of the ABL program includes two  milestone decision points--referred to as ATP-1 and ATP-2.  To pass ATP-1,  the Air Force had to \"demonstrate a single laser module at full power with  all critical components flight-weighted and show performance (power,  beam quality, chemical efficiency, thermal management) is scaleable/ traceable to the EMD design through analysis.\"  During testing of the flight-weighted laser module in connection with the scheduled June 1998  ATP-1 decision point, the module failed to meet its power output  requirement.  Because of this failure, the program provisionally passed  ATP-1.", "The program fully passed ATP-1 when, 3 months later, the laser module  exceeded its power output requirement by 10 percent.  However, the power  output was achieved using a flight-weighted laser module that was not  representative of the laser modules that will be used in an operational ABL  weapon system.  Specifically, the flight-weighted laser module used for  testing in connection with ATP-1 used a stable resonator.  ABL design  specifications require that an unstable resonator be used.  According to  program officials, an unstable resonator is needed because it would  produce a laser beam that would allow the ABL's beam control system to  focus more of the beam's power on the target than would be possible with a  beam produced by a stable resonator.  In commenting on a draft of this  report, DOD stated that a stable, versus unstable, resonator was used for  the initial flight-weighted laser module tests because the test facility had a  stable resonator in place, and to replace the stable resonator with an  unstable resonator would have been too costly and would have adversely  affected the program schedule.", "In addition to demonstrating the laser module at full power, ATP-1 also  required the program to demonstrate that the beam quality of the laser  beam generated by the module would meet ABL design requirements.  In  meeting this requirement, the Air Force did not measure the quality of an  actual laser beam generated by the module.  Instead, it estimated the beam  quality using computer models and measurements of the chemical flows  within the laser.  In future tests of the laser module, the Air Force plans to  measure the beam quality of an actual beam generated by the laser module.", "In attempting to demonstrate the laser module at full power, the Air Force  identified several design problems.  For example, the catch tank and catch  tank outlet, which collect and recirculate a chemical used by the laser,  were too small.  This limited the flow rate of the chemical, reducing the  laser's power.  Another problem identified was that too much water vapor  entered the laser cavity, which reduced the amount of power generated.  In  addition, gas pressure within the laser cavity was too high, thus slowing the  velocity of gases through the cavity, which also reduced the amount of  power generated.", "Some modifications were made to achieve higher power levels during  testing.  These and other modifications are currently being finalized and  incorporated into the flight-weighted laser module.", "The ABL program manager stated that integrating a weapon-level laser,  beam control system, and the other related components into an aircraft is  the largest challenge facing the program.  Some individual components of  the ABL have been tested under laboratory conditions and the program  office has conducted modeling and computer simulations.  However, the  individual components have not been integrated and tested as a complete  weapon system.  As we stated in our October 1997 report, until this system  integration and testing is accomplished, it is not possible to predict with  any degree of certainty the probability that the ABL program will evolve  into a viable missile defense system.", "A major aspect of this system integration testing will be the hot fire flight  tests when the laser is turned on and the beam is controlled by the beam  control system.  According to planning documents, hot fire flight testing  begins only 4 months prior to the 2003 theater ballistic missile shoot-down  tests.  Because of the complexity of the system integration task, some  experts both inside and outside of DOD have noted that the planned flight  testing schedule for the program is too dependent on successful tests and  does not allow enough time and resources to deal with potential test  failures and to prove the ABL concept.", "In a May 1998 Early Operational Assessment, the Air Force Operational  Test and Evaluation Center characterized the flight test schedule as  \"compressed and success-oriented.\"  In addition, the Air Force Scientific  Advisory Board, in its February 1998 report, \"Airborne Laser Scenarios and  Concept of Operations,\" stated that while the ABL program evolution as  currently planned is rational in its sequencing of tests, the schedule  appears to have an unrealistically brief flight testing phase.  The Board  characterized the flight test program as \"immature\" and said that it needs to  be structured to build high confidence in the operability of the laser  system.  It further stated that past experience with high-power laser  systems and large beam directors suggests that new and difficult problems  will surface in that phase, and that many flights and targets will be needed  to sort them out.  The Board suggested that the laser should be fired a  reasonably large number of times (in the hundreds) with the ABL in flight  before committing to a lethality demonstration and that this would serve to  gain experience; establish that it is safe, reliable, and routine; and measure  the critical parameters that will give a commander the confidence to use  the system without hesitation.  Consequently, the Board advised the Air  Force to develop contingency plans to prepare for the possibility that the  current success-oriented schedule is not achieved, to include ordering  additional long lead targets if required, the identification of potential  avenues of failure during the flight tests, and preparation of work-arounds  or corrective steps prepared in advance.", "Congress has also raised concerns related to this issue.  The conference  report on the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 1999 noted that the conferees are concerned that the Air Force  plans to enter EMD without adequate time to operate, test, and evaluate the  PDRR configuration.  As a result, the conferees directed the Secretary of  Defense to establish an independent review team to assist with the  Secretary\u2019s evaluation of the technical risk in the ABL program and his  determination of whether (1) additional testing and risk reduction is  necessary prior to integration of the ABL subsystems into a commercial  747-400F aircraft and (2) the fully integrated PDRR aircraft should be  operated for a period of time and thoroughly tested prior to finalizing an  objective design.

A major test for the program will be the flight tests  during which the laser is turned on and its beam is controlled by the beam  control system.

In its report, DOD noted the IAT\u2019s agreement with Air Force  plans to restructure the ABL program to expand testing and risk reduction  activities before starting modifications to the PDRR aircraft (the first  aircraft).  DOD concurred with the IAT\u2019s recommendation for more testing  of the PDRR aircraft before Milestone II, which governs entry into  engineering and manufacturing development.  DOD stated that it will  review the Air Force\u2019s proposed restructured program and set a new  Acquisition Program Baseline in the spring of 1999.  During the  restructuring and rebaselining effort, DOD stated that, among other things,  it will revise the exit criteria for Milestone II to require more testing against  threat-representative targets.", "DOD stated that it expects that adding flight tests to the program before the  start of EMD will increase near-term costs and might delay ABL\u2019s  achievement of an initial operational capability.

Therefore, we deleted from our final report the recommendation for an  assessment of the ABL flight test program.", "Based on DOD\u2019s comments on our draft report that DOD would not  necessarily incur unnecessary costs by proceeding with the purchase of a  second ABL aircraft, we revised our recommendation to reflect the need  for DOD to reconsider its planned purchase in light of the IAT\u2019s findings  and our report.", "We recognize that delaying the procurement of the aircraft for the EMD  portion of the program until after the ABL demonstrates it can shoot down  target missiles might require a change in the scheduled initial operational  capability.  However, such a slip would ensure that the procurement of the  EMD aircraft would then be based on the additional knowledge gained in  the shoot down demonstrations that the ABL design is feasible.  Our  recommended approach is consistent with DOD\u2019s March 1999 report to  Congress on the ABL program wherein it accepted a potential delay in the  ABL\u2019s initial operational capability in favor of obtaining additional data  through increased flight tests.  Our approach is also appropriate in view of  the discussion in DOD\u2019s March 1999 report on the impact of turbulence on  the ABL design specification.  DOD stated that optical turbulence in excess  of the design specification along the slant path between the ABL and its  target can reduce ABL\u2019s maximum lethal range and increase required dwell  times, even at lesser ranges.  It said that some analyses of atmospheric  turbulence data collected in theaters of interest to date suggest that  turbulence levels well above assumed ABL design levels might occur more  often than expected at the time the design levels were set.  According to  DOD, there are currently no clear methods for predicting the actual  turbulence level along a slant path to a particular threat location at a given  point in time.  Thus, according to DOD, beyond trial and error, it is not clear  how a correct decision can be made on whether a particular target can be  successfully engaged when launched near ABL\u2019s maximum lethal range.

Consequently, he  directed the BMDO and the Air Force to restructure and expand the scope  of the readiness demonstrator acquisition strategy to include the complete  development and deployment of an SBL system.  The restructuring was  also to include review and assessment of other missile defense concepts  such as ground-based lasers and space-based relay mirrors.  In addition, the  Under Secretary directed them to look for opportunities to develop  technologies that would increase the affordability of the SBL by  collaborating with other agencies such as the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, which is currently developing deployable optics for  its next generation space telescope.  In implementing this direction, BMDO  and the Air Force restructured the acquisition strategy and extended the  concept definition study contracts at a cost of $5 million each.
