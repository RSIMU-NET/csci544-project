Performance planning and measurement have slowly, yet increasingly, become a part of agencies' cultures. For planning and performance measurement to be effective, federal managers need to use performance information to identify performance problems and look for solutions, develop approaches that improve results, and make other important management decisions. According to GAO's periodic surveys, federal managers reported having more performance measures in 2003 than in 1997. However, the data also showed that managers' reported use of performance information for program management activities has remained essentially unchanged from 1997 levels.

The five federal agencies that GAO examined for this report provide examples of how agencies can use performance information for key management decisions and practices that can enhance or facilitate such use. While agencies face different management conditions and challenges and operate under different authorities, the general uses and practices highlighted in this report could be adapted by other agencies. Helpful next steps would be for agency experiences in using performance information to be more widely shared; and, for agencies to be encouraged to adapt the practices to their unique situations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is in a period of profound transition and faces an  array of challenges and opportunities to enhance performance, ensure  accountability, and position the nation for the future.

In the face of these pressures, it is vital to maximize the  performance of federal agencies in achieving their long-term goals.  The  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) planning and  reporting requirements can provide the essential information needed to  assess federal agencies\u2019 performance, hold agencies accountable for  achieving results, and help the baseline review of federal programs,  operating functions, and activities needed to respond to the nation\u2019s long- term structural fiscal imbalance.  GPRA requires executive agencies to  develop strategic plans, prepare annual performance plans, measure  progress toward the achievement of the goals in the annual performance  plans, and report annually on their progress in program performance  reports.", "For planning and performance measurement to be effective, federal  managers need to use performance information to identify performance  problems and look for solutions, develop approaches that improve results,  and make other important management decisions.

We also  interviewed individuals within five federal agencies and reviewed  documentation to illustrate in greater detail how program managers have  used performance information to make decisions and specific agency  practices that facilitated those uses. We selected the five agencies\u2014the  Departments of Commerce, Labor, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs,  and the Small Business Administration\u2014on the basis of a number of  factors, including a relatively high agency score on our 2000 GPRA survey  regarding the extent to which agency managers reported using  performance information, and relatively good agency marks in the  September 2004 Executive Branch Management Scorecard (President\u2019s  Management Agenda).  We also considered information obtained from  interviews with experts, and diversity in terms of program type and size. It  should be noted that we did not attempt to identify all agencies and  programs that could have illustrated these uses and practices.  In addition,  we reviewed existing relevant information regarding the quality of  performance information where available but did not systematically assess  the quality of the performance information used in the examples we cite.   Finally, for most of the examples, we describe how performance  information was used to make decisions, but we did not attempt to verify  that the use ultimately resulted in improved outcomes.

The Act was intended to improve federal program effectiveness,  accountability, and service delivery.  GPRA requires federal agencies to  develop strategic plans with long-term, outcome-oriented goals and  objectives, annual goals linked to the long-term goals, and annual reports  on the results achieved.  Agencies are required to measure progress toward  the achievement of the goals in annual performance plans and report  annually on their progress in program performance reports.", "As we reported in our 10-year retrospective report on the effectiveness of  GPRA, the Act\u2019s requirements have laid a solid foundation of results- oriented agency planning, measurement, and reporting that has begun to  address the purposes of GPRA.

In our survey, we  asked managers about their use of performance information for specific  purposes, such as \u201csetting program priorities\u201d, \u201callocating resources\u201d, or  \u201cadopting new program approaches.\u201d  As shown in figure 3, the majority of  managers who expressed an opinion reported using performance  information for these uses to a great or very great extent in 2003.  While the  reported use of performance information for these uses to a great or very  great extent fluctuated somewhat between 1997 and 2003, the extent of use  in 2003 was not significantly different from 1997 levels for any category of  use except \u201cadopting new program approaches or changing work  processes\u201d, where use actually decreased.", "From our 2000 survey, we also know that use of performance information  has varied widely among agencies.

One of EBSA\u2019s functions is to provide information and  assistance for individuals covered by private retirement and health and  welfare plans, plan sponsors, and members of the employee benefits  community.  EBSA has contracted with an outside organization since 2003  to collect data through a specialized survey on customer satisfaction with  EBSA services.   Data indicated that customers whose cases were referred  to the enforcement side of EBSA were reporting lower satisfaction rates.   An analysis of data for specific survey questions identified the need for  improved communication.  Investigating an inquiry or complaint could  sometimes take up to 2 years, and a customer might not receive any  information during that time.  As a result of the performance data, EBSA  changed a standard operating procedure in January 2005 so that customers  would be kept informed about the status of their open inquiries or  complaints. Under the new procedure, when an inquiry is referred to the  enforcement staff for investigation, the OPA benefits advisor informs the  inquirer about the referral and sets realistic expectations for future contact  by an investigator.  Investigative staff are to make initial contact with the  customer no later than 30 days following receipt of the referral and  maintain contact with the inquirer on a quarterly basis until the matter is  resolved.  Managers plan to continue to monitor customer satisfaction to  see whether the changes lead to improved performance.", "Through the Performance Enhancement Project (PEP), the Office of  Workforce Investment in DOL has used performance information to  identify the technical assistance needs of state and local employment and  training programs and has then provided targeted assistance to try to  improve performance.  The PEP project, which began in October 2002, has  provided technical assistance and training for targeted state and local  workforce organizations that receive funds under the Workforce  Investment Act (WIA).  Poorly performing states, as shown by the  performance measures (supplemented by analysis from regional DOL  staff), have received technical assistance designed to improve their  performance through PEP.  DOL\u2019s Office of Workforce Investment sent a  questionnaire to all the regional offices and held a conference with them at  the close of the first PEP project to assess the effectiveness of the  technical assistance that had been given.

According  to an official, in the first quarter of 2004, the network was at risk of not  meeting the entire set of 10 cardiovascular performance measures if one of  its facilities did not improve its low score on the heart failure performance  measure by the end of the year. The heart failure performance measure is  a cumulative performance measure that assesses whether discharged heart  failure patients receive six types of instructions, including instructions for  monitoring weight after discharge and taking medications.  The  instructions are critical because patients\u2019 noncompliance with physicians\u2019  instructions is often a cause for rehospitalization. An agency official stated  that the entire network implemented a new set of mandatory data fields in  patients\u2019 electronic medical records.  The data fields include the six types  of instructions and have to be filled out when a facility discharges a heart  failure patient. According to this official, the result of the implementation  of the new mandatory fields in the patients\u2019 electronic records was that the  facility that was not meeting the heart failure performance measure target  in the first quarter improved its score to the \u201cfully satisfactory\u201d category in  the fourth quarter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Information Can Be Used to Develop Agency Strategy, Plan and Budget, Identify Priorities and Allocate Resources", "paragraphs": ["Agencies can use performance information to make decisions that affect  future strategies, planning and budgeting, identifying priorities, and  allocating resources.

In addition, linking cost with performance  information infuses performance concerns into planning and budgetary  deliberations, prompting agencies to reassess their performance goals and  strategies and to more clearly understand the cost of performance.   Performance information also allows program managers to compare their  programs\u2019 results with goals and thus determine where to target program  resources to improve performance.

The memo directs managers to focus  their programs and proposals to support these priorities.   In addition,  NHTSA used performance information on alcohol-related injuries and  fatalities to target grant funding and specific program strategies to states  with the highest impaired driver rates.

At the end of fiscal year 2004, 78 percent of employees were  included in the agency\u2019s performance-based pay system, which allocates  increases on the basis of individual and organizational performance.  At  the individual level, employees can receive two types of increases.   Employees earn the first increase for meeting individual goals and the  second increase for achieving outstanding individual performance.  At the  organizational level, employees are eligible for the organizational success  increase (OSI).  This is an agencywide pay increase based on the  performance of the agency as a whole on the 31 key performance measures  in the agency\u2019s strategic plan, called the Flight Plan.  The OSI funding pool  consists of the amount of the general increase for General Schedule (GS)  employees in other federal agencies plus an additional 1 percent (which  reflects a portion of the funds previously spent on within-grade increases).  Receiving the full OSI depends on whether actual performance meets the  goals.  In calendar year 2004, FAA employees received an OSI increase of  2.13 percent.

This forms hierarchies of goals and  objectives and performance information that are appropriate to the  managerial responsibilities and controls at each level of the organization.   This alignment increases the usefulness of the performance information  collected to decision makers at each level, and reinforces the connection  between strategic goals and the day-to-day activities of managers and staff.   We have also reported that a greater focus on results can be created by  cascading organizational goals and objectives down to the individual  performance level.  Earlier in this report, we described how agencies can  use performance information to recognize and reward performance and  encourage the achievement of results.  Alignment facilitates the linking of  individual performance to organizational performance.", "FAA promotes alignment by requiring that all organizations use the same  alignment framework and approach in preparing their annual business  plans.   Goals cascade throughout each of FAA\u2019s 16 organizations to each  individual employee.  The agency goals detailed in FAA\u2019s strategic plan (or  Flight Plan) drive new strategic initiatives and the ongoing, day-to-day  operations of FAA, referred to as their core business functions.  Key  elements required in the business plans for each of FAA\u2019s four lines of  business and 12 offices are developed using a systematic alignment  approach that guides the organizations through the step-by-step process of  defining and developing performance elements that support the Flight Plan  goals.  Organizations align themselves with the Flight Plan through this  process, and targets cascade down through the organization into employee  performance plans.  These plans identify specific work expectations and  outcomes, and are required for every FAA employee.  This alignment  facilitates FAA recognizing and rewarding performance by using  performance information to affect pay decisions, as described earlier in  this report.", "VHA\u2019s performance measures are aligned through different levels of the  organization.   The same performance measures are used to assess VHA\u2019s  performance from the VHA-wide level down through the network levels to  the individual facilities.  For example, the performance measure of the  percentage of patients receiving breast cancer screening is used at all three  levels.  As mentioned earlier in this report, the performance score of a  facility can have an effect upon the entire network to which it belongs.  As  an illustration of how performance is \u201crolled up,\u201d officials stated that in  order to get a fully satisfactory rating at the network level, 80 percent of the  hospitals in that network must have met their goals.  Officials stated that if  any facility is at the failing level for a performance measure, the entire  network will also be rated as failing the measure.  In addition, alignment  contributes to VHA\u2019s ability to use performance information to provide  incentives for network directors, through the performance-based review  process described earlier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving the Usefulness of Performance Information to Better Meet Management\u2019s Decision-Making Needs", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that performance information will be both useful and used in  decision making throughout the organization, agencies need to consider  users\u2019 differing policy and management information needs.  Practices that  improve the usefulness of performance information can help to meet those  needs.  We reported previously that to be useful, performance information  must meet users\u2019 needs for completeness, accuracy, consistency,  timeliness, validity, and ease of use. Other attributes that affect the  usefulness of information include, but are not limited to, relevance,  credibility, and accessibility.  We have reported previously on a number of  practices that improve the usefulness of performance information to  different users.  Measures should be selected specifically on the basis of  their ability to inform the decisions made at each organizational level, and  should be appropriate to the responsibilities and control at each level.  In  that regard, involving managers in the development of performance goals  and measures is critical to increasing the relevance and therefore the  usefulness of performance information to their day-to-day activities.   Agency officials in our case illustrations identified a number of practices  that increased the usefulness of performance information, including its  relevance, ease of use, timeliness, and accessibility.", "As discussed earlier, EBSA contracted with an outside organization to  collect more useful customer satisfaction information.  By increasing the  scope and depth of customer satisfaction data, the information has been  made more relevant, and therefore, more useful to management\u2019s day-to- day activities.   Prior to this contract, EBSA used another contractor that  provided a general high-level index of customer satisfaction that provided  comparability to other organizations.  However, in order to provide this  comparability, the survey questions had to be standardized in a manner that  was not as relevant for EBSA as for other organizations.  In addition, the  first customer satisfaction survey did not provide a means for EBSA to  disaggregate data to identify specific aspects of its performance.   Recognizing that the information did not fully meet their needs, EBSA staff  identified a new contractor to create and conduct a specialized customer  satisfaction survey of clients that will provide comparability from year to  year even if it does not provide comparability among other organizations.   Survey questions are now tailored to EBSA\u2019s needs.  Specific questions can  be added and data disaggregated and analyzed as needed to focus in on  potential problem areas.  For example, data can be broken down by  categories such as regional office, benefit advisor, and type of inquiry.", "The Enforcement Office of the Department of Labor\u2019s EBSA Office  implemented a new Enforcement Management System (EMS) that officials  say improved the usefulness of performance information, making it more  timely, accessible, and easy to use.  The system, implemented in 1999,  manages information related to investigations into the potential violation of  benefits laws.  These investigations are conducted by 385 investigators  located at EBSA field offices across the country.  Prior to the development  of the EMS, officials said that the Enforcement Office had a simple  database system located at headquarters and that field offices used a  separate case management system.   The EMS was custommade for the  Enforcement Office.  It tracks information about every investigation  nationwide throughout its lifecycle, providing both field and headquarters  staff access to real-time information.  According to officials, not only does  the system make information more timely and accessible, it has increased  the ease of use and relevance of performance information by incorporating  user-friendly windows technology and allowing users to define their own  information needs with customized queries and reports.  In addition, over  30 standardized statistical and case reports are available.  Standardized  statistical reports allow managers to view, by selected geographic area,  summaries of such information as  the different investigation types (e.g.,  fiduciary and criminal), the cases referred for litigation, and closed cases  along with the associated results.  Headquarters provides additional  analysis of the information regarding overall progress toward policy goals,  allowing adjustments to be made in the field offices.", "SBA has involved its program managers in the development of the agency\u2019s  performance measurement system, allowing offices to determine their own  goals and measures.   This practice increases the usefulness of  performance information to the activities of offices and programs, and SBA  officials credit it with creating buy-in and ownership of the performance  measurement system.  Measures and targets must meet certain  requirements as overseen by the chief operating officer.  For example,  measures should support the strategic goals; measures should be valid,  measurable, and verifiable; and the set of measures as a whole should  contain both qualitative and quantitative measures.  At the beginning of  each year when the measures and targets are being selected, assistance is  provided for any program upon request to help with selecting appropriate  measures.", "SBA has also initiated a practice aimed at documenting and improving the  overall usefulness of performance information and increasing its use.   Programs are required to identify the intended use of each measure in  decisions related to policy and to provide an assessment of how fit the  information is for this use.  The importance of this practice is that it  promotes the selection of performance measures that better meet  managements\u2019 needs, providing information that is relevant, and  sufficiently complete, accurate, consistent, and timely for management\u2019s  decision-making needs.  To facilitate and document the practice, SBA\u2019s  Office of Analysis, Planning and Accountability developed an assessment  tool for its indicators in the form of the Data Validation Table,\u201d shown in  figure 6.  These tables are updated annually for every indicator published in  the SBA Performance and Accountability Report.  In addition to  documenting the intended use, the office must provide an assessment of  the information\u2019s completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness.   Validation Tables also document the associated office and program; what  outcomes are being assessed; how each outcome is aligned with agency  goals; the system in which the data are kept; and any limitations to the use  of the information in the intended manner and associated remedies, among  other items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Agency Capacity", "paragraphs": ["The practice of building analytical capacity to use performance  information\u2014both in terms of staff trained to do analysis and availability of  research and evaluation resources\u2014is critical to using performance  information in a meaningful fashion.   Our 2003 GPRA survey found that  there was a positive relationship between agencies providing training and  development on setting program performance goals and the use of  performance information when setting or revising performance goals.  We  have previously reported on the need for agencies to expend resources on  effective training and professional development to equip federal employees  to work effectively.  Specifically, managers and staff need competencies  and skills to plan strategically, develop robust measures of performance,  and analyze what the performance data mean.  Performance management  literature also states that training is a key factor in improving employees\u2019  capabilities and enabling employee involvement in achieving performance  improvements.  We found examples where our case illustration agencies  built capacity through providing staff with training in the performance  management system and by providing access to technical assistance, such  as having designated evaluation support staff or performance measurement  experts available.", "The VHA network that includes health care facilities located in California,  Nevada, Hawaii, and the Philippines builds agency capacity by providing  annual training on performance measures for facility managers.  The  training is coordinated by a performance measurement committee  composed of clinical leadership and quality management staff from each of  the facilities.  The committee\u2019s mission includes providing education on the  performance measures beyond the annual training, as well as sharing and  implementing strategies to facilitate meeting the performance  measurement targets.  At the annual training conference, all of the  performance measures are discussed, including existing measures as well  as any new measures.  The training lasts for a day or two, and facility  managers can participate in person, on the telephone, or by  videoconference.  In addition, the performance measurement committee is  also a resource throughout the year for questions on the performance  measures.", "NHTSA has established capacity to use performance information through  its research and evaluation office.  According to one official, NHTSA has  had internal analytic capacity through a research office for more than 25  years.  The evaluation office provides the capacity to conduct research and  evaluations on the effectiveness of NHTSA\u2019s Traffic Injury Control Office  programs and initiatives, which address issues such as safety related to  alcohol- and drug-impaired driving, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles,  school buses, emergency medical services, older drivers, and driver fatigue  and inattention.  We previously reported that NHTSA\u2019s evaluation office  provides the capacity for a three-phase evaluation process.  First, studies  identify the nature of the problem and possible solutions.  Second, cost- benefit analyses identify the expected consequences or alternative  approaches.  Third, follow-up studies assess the consequences of policy or  regulatory changes, since effects of some changes may not be apparent  until 5 or more years after the introduction of changes.  According to a  NHTSA official, it is important to have this capacity because the Traffic  Injury Control Office does not have any regulatory authority, and needs the  analysis and evaluations to demonstrate that the proposed programs are  effective in order to persuade states to implement them.  In addition, we  have previously reported that evaluations can improve agency use of  performance information by providing performance information that may  otherwise be unavailable; by validating the accuracy of performance data;  by explaining the reasons for observed performance; or, finally, by  identifying ways to improve performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communicating Performance Information Frequently and Effectively", "paragraphs": ["Improving the communication of performance information among staff and  stakeholders can facilitate the use of performance information by agency  managers.

We previously reported that frequent, regular communication  is key for managers to inform staff and other stakeholders of their  commitment to achieve the agency\u2019s goals and to keep these goals in mind  as they pursue their day-to-day activities.  Frequently reporting  performance information also allows managers to review the information  in time to take action to make improvements.  Program managers can also  communicate performance information upward through the management  hierarchy, and across operating units.  We found a number of vehicles  through which agencies communicated performance information  effectively. For example, agencies maintained frequent, routine  communication among managers and staff through visual tools such as  poster displays, performance scorecards, and intranet sites. Some agencies  provided performance updates through regular e-mail or the distribution of  monthly performance review meeting minutes.  In addition, officials said  publicizing performance information can inspire ownership of a unit\u2019s  performance, as well as competition between units.  For example,  scorecards or other visual presentations of performance information  enable staff to compare and analyze performance, resulting in a  competitive interest in improving performance.

Quad charts arose out of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) efforts to  improve budgeting and planning systems, and have also been used at the  NWS.  They are one-page summaries that provide pertinent information for  decision-making purposes.  One particular type of quad chart is prepared to  inform agency executives about program performance.  These quad charts  are prepared by each major program and presented during NOAA\u2019s  quarterly executive panels.  These panels are composed of the Deputy  Under Secretary of NOAA and the deputies of the line offices. A one-page  chart is divided into four quadrants containing the following four areas:  Performance Parameters (metrics and threshold values for selected  performance indicators); Schedule of Activities (including schedule  status); Key Issues and Risks; and Funding (budgetary issues).  For each of  these topics, status is also color-coded in green, yellow, or red.   An  example of this type of quad chart is shown in figure 7.  Similar types of  quad charts are prepared by managers requesting program adjustments  (such as changes in funding) and for selected NWS and NOAA programs.

The five federal agencies that we examined for this report provide  examples of how agencies can use performance information for key  management decisions and practices that can facilitate such use.  The  specific ways in which the case agencies used performance information or  implemented the practices may not be appropriate for wholesale adoption  throughout the federal government because agencies face different  management conditions and challenges, and operate under different  authorities.  Nevertheless, the general uses and practices highlighted in this  report are universal and could be adapted by each agency.

Among the  factors that we considered in guiding our selection processs were that the  agencies received relatively high scores on the 2000 GAO Government  Performance and Results Act survey results regarding the extent to which  managers reported using performance information, relatively good marks  on the September 2004 Executive Branch Management Scorecard  (President\u2019s Management Agenda), and/or recommendations from  interviews with experts.

We selected  specific examples to highlight each use and practice and to illustrate  particular aspects of how that use or practice was implemented within  specific agency program contexts and across various program types.  We  did not attempt to identify all agencies and programs that could have  illustrated these uses and practices.  In addition, while we did review  existing relevant information regarding performance data quality where  available, we did not systematically assess the quality of the performance  information used in the examples we cite.  Finally, for most of the  examples, we describe how performance information was used to make  decisions, but we did not attempt to verify that the use ultimately resulted  in improved outcomes.", "From our review of the literature and interviews with experts and staff  from the five agencies, we developed a conceptual framework identifying  four categories of uses of performance information and five categories of  practices that contribute to using performance information.  The  framework and categories of uses and practices are consistent with the  themes identified in our March 2003 report on results-oriented cultures and  effective performance management, and are consistent with additional  GAO reports on GPRA and results-oriented government.  The four use  categories in our framework that we identified through our independent  analysis are similar to the four types of uses identified in How Federal  Programs Use Outcome Information: Opportunities for Federal  Managers, by Harry Hatry, Elaine Morley, Shelli Rossman, and Joseph  Wholey, published by the IBM Endowment for The Business of Government  in May 2003.
