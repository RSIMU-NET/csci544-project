The Congress recently demonstrated its interest in insuring more children by committing more than $20 billion over a 5-year period to fund state expansions of children\u2019s health insurance\u2014either through the Medicaid program or through insurance programs developed by states. However, as we have reported in the past, many uninsured children who are eligible for Medicaid are not enrolled.", "Concerned about this failure to enroll children in Medicaid, you asked us to examine the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of children who qualify for Medicaid, and identify groups in which uninsured children are concentrated and to whom outreach efforts might be targeted; determine the reasons these children are not enrolled in Medicaid; and identify strategies that states and communities are using to increase enrollment.", "To examine the characteristics of families of Medicaid-eligible uninsured children, we analyzed data from the Bureau of the Census\u2019 March 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS). To develop a demographic profile of uninsured Medicaid-eligible children, we linked information on children\u2019s health insurance status with their families\u2019 characteristics and compared them with children similar in age and family income who are enrolled in Medicaid or who have employment-based insurance. In this analysis, we only considered children who met the federal age and income standards for mandated eligibility. We did not include children who could be eligible because of individual state expansions or children over age 12 who could be eligible if their family income was low enough to receive cash assistance in their state.", "To determine the reasons eligible children are not enrolled in Medicaid and identify strategies that could assist in getting such children enrolled, we interviewed state officials, beneficiary advocates, and provider representatives in Arkansas and Massachusetts; state officials in Georgia; and other experts. We also reviewed the outreach materials used by these states and by Wisconsin. Arkansas, Georgia, and Massachusetts were selected from among several states that were identified by experts as having innovative outreach programs. Additionally, Wisconsin was identified as being further along in its approach to welfare reform and Medicaid outreach and eligibility determination. State outreach programs are designed to reach all Medicaid eligibles, and the programs we reviewed target all eligible children, both mandated and optional. For more information on our scope and methodology, see appendix I. Our work was conducted between July 1997 and February 1998, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Studies have shown that insured children are more likely than uninsured children to get preventive and primary health care. Insured children are also more likely to have a relationship with a primary care physician and to receive required preventive services, such as well-child checkups. In contrast, lack of insurance can inhibit parents from trying to get health care for their children and can lead providers to offer less intensive services when families seek care. Several studies have found that low-income and uninsured children are more likely to be hospitalized for conditions that could have been managed with appropriate outpatient care.", "Most insured U.S. children under age 18 have health coverage through their parents\u2019 employment\u201462 percent in 1996. Most other children with insurance have publicly funded coverage, usually the Medicaid program. Medicaid\u2014a jointly funded federal-state entitlement program that provides health coverage for both children and adults\u2014is administered through 56 separate programs, including the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. territories. Historically, children and their parents were automatically covered if they received benefits under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Children and adults may also be eligible for Medicaid if they are disabled and have low incomes or, at state discretion, if their medical expenses are extremely high relative to family income.", "Before 1989, coverage expansions for pregnant women and children based on family income and age were optional for states, although many states had expanded coverage. Starting in July 1989, states were required to cover pregnant women and infants (defined as children under 1 year of age) with family incomes at or below 75 percent of the federal poverty level. Two subsequent federal laws further expanded mandated eligibility for children. By July 1991, states were required to cover (1) infants and children up to 6 years old with family income at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level and (2) children 6 years old and older born after September 30, 1983, with family income at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. Since 1989, states have also had the option of covering infants with family income between 133 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level. States may expand Medicaid eligibility for children by phasing in coverage of children up to 19 years old more quickly than required, by increasing eligibility income levels, or both. The demographic analysis in this report, however, focuses on the group of children for whom coverage is mandated.", "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L 104-193), also known as the Welfare Reform Act, substantially altered AFDC and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) but made relatively few changes to the Medicaid program itself. The law replaced AFDC with a block grant that allowed states to set different income and resource (asset) eligibility standards for the new program\u2014Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\u2014than for Medicaid. To ensure continued health coverage for low-income families, the law generally set Medicaid\u2019s eligibility standards at AFDC levels in effect July 16, 1996, thereby ensuring that families who were eligible for Medicaid before welfare reform continued to qualify, regardless of their eligibility for states\u2019 cash assistance programs. The law tightened the criteria for children to qualify for disability assistance through SSI, thus tightening eligibility for Medicaid. In addition, the law restricted aliens\u2019 access to benefit programs, including SSI, and Medicaid benefits that were conditional on receipt of SSI. State and local governments were given some flexibility in designing policies that governed aliens\u2019 eligibility for TANF, Medicaid, and social services. In a recently released report, we studied the Welfare Reform Act and its impact on Medicaid and found that in the states we visited, most chose to continue to provide Medicaid coverage to previously covered groups.", "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) restored SSI eligibility and the derivative Medicaid benefits to all aliens receiving SSI at the time welfare reform was enacted and to all aliens legally residing in the United States on the date of enactment who become disabled in the future. At the same time, states continued to have flexibility in implementing certain benefits policies for aliens. Current law allows states the option of providing Medicaid coverage to aliens who were legal permanent residents in the country before August 23, 1996. States also have the option of covering legal residents who arrived after August 22, 1996, once they have resided in the United States for 5 years. Illegal aliens are eligible only for emergency services under Medicaid. (See table 1.)", "The Balanced Budget Act also made two changes that directly affect children\u2019s coverage in the Medicaid program. It gives states the option of providing 12 months of continuous eligibility to children without a redetermination of eligibility, thereby avoiding the problem of children frequently moving on and off Medicaid as their parents\u2019 circumstances change. The act also allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to children on the basis of \u201cpresumptive eligibility\u201d until a formal determination is made. Under this provision, certain qualified providers can make an initial determination of eligibility, based on income, that an individual is eligible. The individual is then required to apply formally for the program by the last day of the month following the month in which the determination of presumptive eligibility was made.", "Finally, the Balanced Budget Act created the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a grant program for uninsured children, through which $20.3 billion in new federal funds will be made available to states over the next 5 years. CHIP has a number of implications for Medicaid. If a state chooses to offer coverage through a separate program, the state must coordinate activities with the Medicaid program to ensure that Medicaid-eligible children are enrolled in Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \u201coutreach effect\u201d of CHIP will result in an additional $2.4 billion in Medicaid spending over the same 5 years due to increased enrollment of 460,000 Medicaid-eligible children each year. States may also use the grant funds to expand coverage under their state Medicaid programs to reach additional low-income children, increasing the number of children potentially eligible for Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid-Eligible Children Who Are Uninsured Have Characteristics That Can Be Used to Target Outreach Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Uninsured Medicaid-eligible children differ somewhat from those currently enrolled in Medicaid, and these differences can be used by states to focus their outreach and enrollment efforts. Overall, about 23 percent\u2014or 3.4 million\u2014of the 15 million children who were eligible for Medicaid were uninsured in 1996. Slightly over half of the Medicaid-eligible children are insured solely by Medicaid, while about 7 percent have both Medicaid and private coverage. The remainder have coverage through other public programs, such as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) or the Indian Health Service. (See fig. 1.) Medicaid-eligible children who are uninsured have characteristics closer to Medicaid-eligible children who are privately insured than to those with Medicaid. They are disproportionately children of the working poor, Hispanic, and U.S.-born children of foreign-born parents or foreign-born, and they are more likely to live in the West and the South."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Uninsured Medicaid-Eligible Children Have Similarities With Privately Insured Children", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid-eligible children are more likely to be uninsured if their parents work, if their parents are self-employed or employed by a small firm, or if they have a two-parent family. Children whose parents worked at all during the year\u2014whether full-time, part-time, or for part of the year\u2014are about twice as likely to be uninsured as those whose parents were unemployed. However, these children are more likely to be covered by employment-based insurance. The explanation for this apparent paradox is that children with employed parents are less likely to be covered by Medicaid, and employment-based coverage does not fully compensate for low rates of Medicaid participation. (See table 2.)", "Small firms are less likely than larger firms to offer health insurance; therefore, it is not surprising that children whose parents are self-employed or employed by small firms are less likely to be insured. This could suggest selective targeting of smaller firms in Medicaid outreach efforts, especially if it is known that they do not offer insurance.", "Half of all uninsured Medicaid-eligible children are in two-parent families, compared with only about 28 percent of those insured by Medicaid. The uninsured rate for Medicaid-eligible children is also higher in two-parent families than in single-parent families\u201430 percent compared with 18 percent. This again underscores that successful outreach efforts need to reach beyond the single unemployed mothers generally associated with both cash assistance programs and Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hispanics, U.S.-Born Children of Foreign-Born Parents, and Immigrant Children Are More Likely to Be Uninsured", "paragraphs": ["Among racial and ethnic groups, the proportion of uninsured Medicaid-eligible children, as well as the proportion enrolled in Medicaid, varies by racial and ethnic group.

In addition to the 11 percent who were immigrants, another one-quarter had at least one foreign-born parent. (See fig. 2.) The large number of children in immigrant families and the high proportion that are uninsured suggest that immigrant communities may be promising targets for outreach. (See table 4.)

As a consequence, 54 percent of children who are Medicaid-eligible but uninsured are less than 6 years old. Nevertheless, outreach through schools could reach some of these younger children, since 42 percent have a school-age sibling aged 6 to 17.

Some experts have argued that immigrant families have been less willing to apply for subsidized benefits because of their fear of the government or language and cultural barriers.

(See fig. 3.)", "Several reasons may explain the differences in proportions of uninsured Medicaid-eligible children in different regions. Some areas have higher proportions of workers with employment-based insurance because of the size of local firms, type of business, or degree of unionization.

Some families, especially those who have never enrolled in public benefit programs, may not even be aware that they are eligible. In addition, some parents may associate Medicaid with welfare and dependency, and therefore have an aversion to enrolling their children in the program. Cultural and language differences may limit awareness or understanding, and immigration status may also affect a family\u2019s willingness to apply. Finally, the eligibility process can be difficult for working families because of the limits on where and when enrollment can take place, the lengthy application, and the documentation required.

Two types of families tend to be unaware of their eligibility: working families who assume that Medicaid eligibility is tied to welfare eligibility and families who were previously on welfare and believe that, because of welfare reform, they are no longer eligible for Medicaid. These families are unlikely to understand that children with higher levels of family income may be eligible for Medicaid.

In addition, if families have successfully sought and received care for their children from clinics or emergency rooms in the past without enrolling in a health care program such as Medicaid, they are likely to continue to seek care from these providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cultural Differences, Language Barriers, and Immigration Policies May Keep Some Families From Enrolling in Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["State officials, advocates, and other experts told us that some families are hesitant to enroll in Medicaid because of cultural differences, language barriers, and their understanding of U.S. immigration policies. Experts and a state official said that cultural differences may keep immigrant families from enrolling in Medicaid. Language was often mentioned as a barrier. Individuals who cannot read the Medicaid application and informational materials and cannot easily converse with eligibility workers by telephone or in person are at a distinct disadvantage. One expert told us that the degree of acculturation has a major impact on whether an immigrant will use public assistance of any kind. While time spent in the country is the main predictor of acculturation, some individuals may not participate in mainstream society and use its institutions even after living in the country for many years.", "According to some state officials, advocates, and experts, immigrant families may also hesitate to enroll in Medicaid because they are concerned that it will negatively affect their immigration status. Immigrants who are legal residents may be afraid that if they receive benefits that they will be labeled a \u201cpublic charge\u201d and will have difficulties with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) when applying for naturalization, visa renewal, or reentry into the United States. Although advocates question whether aliens receiving benefits may be considered public charges, in some instances actions have been taken against such individuals seeking visa renewals. Several advocates also told us about cases where individuals were prevented from reentering the United States unless they agreed to reimburse Medicaid for services paid for by the program on their behalf\u2014particularly in border states such as California. Publicity about such cases in the immigrant community can deter immigrants from applying for Medicaid benefits for themselves or their children\u2014even in cases where the children were born in the United States and are American citizens.", "In families where one or more adults are in the country illegally, the reluctance to seek Medicaid benefits for a child may be even greater. When applying for Medicaid for children, families in some states are asked about the immigration status of other members of the household. Again, advocates told us this is a deterrent to enrollment for such families and reported that many immigrant families, both legal and illegal, seek medical assistance through county clinics and public hospitals because these institutions are viewed as more sympathetic and less likely to ask questions about immigration status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Perceived Negative Image Attached to Medicaid May Deter Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["State officials and other experts told us that because of its long-standing ties with welfare and other benefit programs, many families associate Medicaid with a family that cannot provide for itself.

However, to ensure that all recipients of Medicaid benefits meet income and other requirements, states have found it necessary to develop application processes that use lengthy application forms and require extensive documentation.", "State officials, beneficiary advocates, and other experts told us that lengthy enrollment forms and the associated documentation requirements create a barrier for families. Long forms are often used when a family is applying for a combination of programs, including Medicaid. Numerous questions relating to income, assets, citizenship, and family composition are used to determine eligibility and to ensure that only those who are entitled to benefits are enrolled in Medicaid. In addition to length, enrollment forms often require extensive documentation. Families are asked to provide paystubs, bank account statements, birth certificates, and other documents that verify the information they provide on the forms. Gathering such documents can be burdensome. For example, obtaining a birth certificate can involve going to a different office and then returning to the eligibility office. Obtaining certain documents can also require a family to pay a fee.", "A valid and reliable eligibility determination process is important to state officials to ensure program integrity. In addition, states can be assessed a financial penalty by the federal government if their error rates are too high. In an effort to balance these needs, most states have developed shorter forms for children who are applying exclusively for Medicaid, primarily by dropping the asset requirements. Some advocates, however, are still concerned with the length and complexity of application forms and the number of questions they contain. One advocate suggested that if applicants cannot understand the form, they are not going to fill it out. Another advocate pointed out that some questions may be well-intended, but they nonetheless lengthen the application. For example, as a way of identifying if the family may be eligible for other benefit programs, some states\u2019 applications ask questions related to disability. In addition, advocates pointed out that the documentation requirements are so stringent in some states that many applicants are denied enrollment because they cannot produce the documentation required. In an earlier report, we found that such requirements were shown to account for nearly half of all denials.", "In addition to limits that were developed as part of a legitimate effort to maximize the accuracy of eligibility determinations and monitor the eligibility process, other barriers exist. These include location of enrollment sites and enrollment hours; fluctuations in eligibility status, including the impact of welfare reform; and families\u2019 lack of transportation and communication problems.", "Many of the state officials and other experts with whom we spoke said that the enrollment process used for welfare was difficult for working families because enrollment locations are limited and open only during typical work hours. This makes it difficult for working parents in families whose children may be eligible for Medicaid to apply. Such parents may not have the flexibility in their job to take time off to enroll through face-to-face interviews, according to one state official and one expert. States are required to provide for the receipt and initial processing of applications for pregnant women, infants, and children at sites not used for AFDC applications\u2014such as federally qualified health centers and hospitals that serve a larger share of uninsured and publicly insured persons\u2014but these efforts may have been limited.", "Experts also noted that the eligibility system does not accommodate the fluctuating eligibility status of many families. Low-income working families may have changes in their income if they work seasonally or change or lose jobs. A family eligible one month may not be eligible the next month because of an increase in family income, but children in that family may still be covered under other categories of eligibility. According to experts, some states\u2019 eligibility processes do not automatically make redeterminations to see if children who lose their eligibility might be eligible in another category. If the family does not reapply, the child loses coverage.", "Advocates have also been concerned that welfare reform may make enrollment less likely. Families may be confused about their Medicaid eligibility because, prior to welfare reform, Medicaid and cash assistance had, historically, been so closely linked. For example, if TANF enrollment workers focus on job search strategies and not on benefits, families who come in may not be enrolled for Medicaid. In addition, some families may believe Medicaid is time limited as is TANF.", "According to experts, advocates, and one provider, limits on the ability to communicate and availability of transportation can be a barrier for applicants. In addition to difficulties for non-English-speaking families, illiteracy may also limit a parent\u2019s ability to enroll without substantial assistance. Experts also pointed out that lack of transportation to enrollment sites can be a barrier, primarily in rural areas, but also in some urban settings.

Some states have even renamed the Medicaid program as a way to change its image. To improve the enrollment process, some states have adopted strategies to assist immigrant families or have simplified and streamlined the eligibility process by shortening forms and accepting applications at many new sites, as well as mail-in applications.

For example, Massachusetts has placed outreach workers in health centers, hospitals, and other traditional locations; distributed literature in schools; sent material to the YMCA and other community groups; and worked with a supermarket chain to place in grocery bags notices of the program. The governor has held several press conferences around the state to publicize the program, and the state is working with workers in WIC clinics, who are already trained to do income-based eligibility assessments. The state has also used its enrollment data to target communities that have low levels of Medicaid enrollment and worked with local officials to address the problem. The state\u2019s private contractor for managed care enrollment has also assisted with outreach through its presentations in the community. One advocacy group worked with the state to develop a campaign to target high-school athletes, who are required to have health insurance. This campaign involved sending posters and fold-out fliers\u2014developed and produced with the donated time of professionals\u2014to athletic directors in high schools throughout the state and establishing a pool of student athletes to go out and talk to their peers. In another initiative, the state medical society is training its members\u2019 staffs to assist in educating families about program eligibility and benefits. Finally, Massachusetts is making $600,000 available to help community groups conduct outreach and educate families of uninsured Medicaid-eligible children, with the money distributed as grants in amounts between $10,000 and $20,000.", "In Arkansas, as part of a large media campaign that included television and radio announcements, the state placed color inserts in Sunday newspapers during September 1997.

The outreach workers are often available during evening and weekend hours as a convenience to working families. Workers also make presentations regularly to community groups, medical providers, and employers. A flier was developed that is targeted to employers to inform them about benefit programs for which their employees may be eligible. Georgia is also trying to enroll former welfare recipients by emphasizing Medicaid enrollment as an important part of a successful transition to work. The state\u2019s outreach program has also established partnerships with numerous community groups\u2014including local coordinating councils, local teen pregnancy task forces, and school boards\u2014and has used these local partnerships to develop outreach tailored to needs and characteristics of the communities. The state\u2019s private contractor for enrollment in managed care has also assisted with the outreach program through its contacts with the community.", "In view of its recent welfare reform initiatives, Wisconsin is making a concerted effort to ensure that Medicaid-eligible individuals enroll in Medicaid regardless of their eligibility for the state welfare program.

The Medicaid program cannot refuse enrollment to any eligible individual based on the fact that he or she has insurance, although Medicaid is the payer of last resort. However, some states that have expanded eligibility through waivers of normal program rules have been allowed to limit eligibility if a family already has insurance. For example, in Arkansas, which received a waiver for its expansion, a child is not eligible for ARKids 1st unless he or she has been uninsured for a period of 12 months or the child lost insurance coverage during that period through no fault of the family.

As part of its ARKids 1st program, Arkansas is providing 12 months of continuous eligibility to children regardless of changes in family income, under waiver authority granted by HCFA. Until recently, states had to receive a waiver to pursue such a policy. The Balanced Budget Act, however, allows states to adopt 12 months of continuous eligibility.", "To date, welfare reform has not significantly affected the application process for Medicaid. In a recent report, we found that nine states we contacted have chosen to make few structural changes in their Medicaid programs in the first full year of implementing welfare reform. For example, while the Welfare Reform Act delinked eligibility for cash assistance and Medicaid, the states that we contacted had generally decided not to separate Medicaid and cash assistance program administration.

Only Arkansas has taken direct action to discourage employers from dropping health insurance coverage by enforcing a 12-month waiting period.", "We found less outreach targeted to Hispanics and immigrants, and experts whom we interviewed said this was generally true, even in states with large immigrant or Hispanic populations. Immigrants, particularly families in which the parents are not naturalized U.S. citizens, are likely to be a more difficult group to reach, both because of the complexities of the law, which makes some but not all immigrant children eligible for Medicaid, and because of the immigrants\u2019 general wariness of government.
